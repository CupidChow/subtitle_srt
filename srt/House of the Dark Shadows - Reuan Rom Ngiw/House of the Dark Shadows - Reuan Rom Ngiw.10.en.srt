"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 10)

19
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:01,289
My Lord only spends time with Ms. Malai,

20
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:03,835
don't you think I will be lonely?

21
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,156
I am aware that

22
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:07,906
what I ask of you

23
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:09,101
is not a small request,

24
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:10,843
And I'm not belittling you,

25
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:11,867
but...

26
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:13,476
But what, my lord?

27
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:14,694
You damn Bu-nga!

28
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:18,070
Having your own wife

29
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:19,203
sleeping with another man,

30
00:02:19,227 --> 00:02:20,227
shameful!

31
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,101
Malai!

32
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:22,265
Never hang out with

33
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:23,375
that kind of person again!

34
00:02:23,922 --> 00:02:24,922
Watch out, ma'am!

35
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:32,804
Could it be that

36
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,867
you are in a hurry to tend

37
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:35,750
to your lover?

38
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:37,148
- How dare you?
- No, Fueang.

39
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:47,769
You dare slap me, you damn Malai?

40
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:48,660
Indeed!

41
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:50,152
I'm willing to waste my energy

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,144
to slap your face

43
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:52,410
and teach you that

44
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:53,882
if you live in a house,

45
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:56,855
cease barking like a
stray dog on the street.

46
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,472
I will tell the viscount

47
00:02:58,488 --> 00:02:59,629
that you slapped me!

48
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:01,316
I will ensure that you
will pay. Just watch!

49
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:02,590
Do as you wish.

50
00:03:03,231 --> 00:03:04,402
The Viscount will learn

51
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:05,918
what kind of person you are

52
00:03:06,332 --> 00:03:08,043
that made me resort to such action.

53
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:09,355
Fueang.

54
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:10,910
- Yes, ma'am?
- Fetch me a cloth.

55
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:12,848
Yes, ma'am.

56
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:17,551
Here you go, ma'am.

57
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,879
Oh.

58
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:32,175
Wiping dirt from her hands.

59
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:35,011
Fueang, you...

60
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:37,893
Let us leave, Fueang.

61
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:42,734
The audacity!

62
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,367
Come back here!

63
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,960
Cowards, look...

64
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,328
Chaem!

65
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:49,664
How could you allow

66
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:50,742
this to happen to me?

67
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,351
Why did you just stand there silently?

68
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:55,859
I apologize, Ms. Ramphoei,

69
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:56,976
well...

70
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:58,216
I was afraid.

71
00:03:58,734 --> 00:03:59,796
If she finds out that

72
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,531
I let the snake loose in her room,

73
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,750
it will all be over.

74
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,710
Coward!

75
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:07,750
It's not like she can

76
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:08,819
just smell your hands.

77
00:04:08,844 --> 00:04:10,352
Why should you be afraid?

78
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,515
The more you act this way,

79
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:14,171
the more suspicious she'll become.

80
00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:15,844
Fool!

81
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:17,304
My apologies, ma'am.

82
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:18,781
From now on,

83
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,944
I won't be afraid anymore.

84
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:23,218
Please forgive me.

85
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:24,710
Good!

86
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,992
From now on,

87
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,406
try to protect me

88
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:29,523
like how Fueang protects Malai!

89
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:30,390
Got it?

90
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:31,846
Yes, I understand.

91
00:04:31,852 --> 00:04:32,852
Go!

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Where to?

93
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:35,281
To see the viscount!

94
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:37,530
I will not be slapped in vain!

95
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:39,563
- Depart!
- Yes, ma'am.

96
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:45,806
What is it, Ramphoei?

97
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:46,806
Why did you come here?

98
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:51,361
My lord...

99
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:54,416
It's Malai, my lord.

100
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:56,431
I don't know what's wrong with her.

101
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:57,111
Oww...

102
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:59,408
She suddenly attacked me.

103
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:02,806
Behold, my cheeks are all red.

104
00:05:03,924 --> 00:05:04,924
Ouch...

105
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:08,361
Malai attacked you?

106
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:10,549
Since being with Malai,

107
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:13,197
she has not dared to harm even a fly.

108
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:14,799
But, my lord,

109
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,080
Ms. Ramphoei speaks the truth.

110
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:17,736
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

111
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:18,800
Even if Malai did it,

112
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:19,777
there must be a reason.

113
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:22,017
Just don't disturb Malai again,

114
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:23,722
that would be enough.

115
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,845
My lord, are you not concerned about me?

116
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,970
Will you not approach her on my behalf?

117
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:32,947
If so,

118
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:34,940
you probably wouldn't be angry either

119
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:36,760
if Ms. Malai

120
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,557
has

121
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,838
an affair.

122
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:43,940
What? What affair?

123
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:46,682
I do not understand what you are saying.

124
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:48,736
If you are here to speak nonsense,

125
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:49,541
leave.

126
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,713
I have work to attend to.

127
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:53,557
Viscount!

128
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:55,338
You are glorify your primary wife

129
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:56,636
too fervently, my lord!

130
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:58,760
Ms. Malai is having an affair with Dech.

131
00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:00,518
Will you not take any action, my lord?

132
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:01,182
Hey.

133
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:02,557
Oww, my lord!

134
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,705
Cease it, Ramphoei!

135
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:06,198
When did Dech become Malai's lover?

136
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:07,768
You are not making any sense.

137
00:06:07,823 --> 00:06:09,623
I'm not spouting nonsense.

138
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:10,838
The proof is how Dech

139
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,096
got bitten by a snake.

140
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:13,713
The servants say

141
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:16,908
he was bitten in Ms. Malai's bedroom.

142
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:19,268
The evidence is so obvious.

143
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:22,104
I now comprehend

144
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,065
why Malai attacked Ramphoei.

145
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:27,377
You said that to her, right?

146
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:29,174
What of it, my lord?

147
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:30,611
It is the truth!

148
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,479
Cease spreading lies.

149
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,846
Dech went in to change

150
00:06:33,862 --> 00:06:34,916
the lightbulbs for me.

151
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:36,791
He did nothing of the sort to Malai.

152
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:39,096
If you persist in coming up

153
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,752
with unfounded accusations against her,

154
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,033
next time, I will not only chase you

155
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:42,995
out of the room,

156
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,580
but out of the house!

157
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:45,236
Leave!

158
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:54,295
What are you staring at?

159
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:54,990
Just leave!

160
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,358
Oh, yes, my lord.

161
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:02,482
Let us leave, ma'am.

162
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:07,021
The viscount will be upset!

163
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,248
What is wrong with this household?

164
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:13,467
Stay calm, ma'am. Let's return.

165
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:14,154
Chaem.

166
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:14,850
Huh?

167
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:16,306
Remember my words,

168
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:18,568
Malai shall not be living joyously.

169
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:20,670
As long as I still draw breath,

170
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:22,670
one of us must perish,

171
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:24,053
be it me or her.

172
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:26,959
But it has to be her

173
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:28,397
that dies.

174
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:37,292
Please wait for me.

175
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,815
I must devise a plan to keep those two

176
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,907
away from Ramphoei's scrutiny.

177
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:52,206
Ramphoei is excessively meddlesome.

178
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:12,139
Has he been in such a state

179
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:13,147
since last night?

180
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:14,303
Yes, Ms. Malai.

181
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:16,678
Last night, the viscount stayed

182
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:18,358
to observe his condition until morning,

183
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:19,389
and then left.

184
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:23,124
Ms. Malai.

185
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:24,678
Allow me to do it.

186
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:26,670
It's alright.

187
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:28,162
Please attend to your duties

188
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:28,928
if you have any.

189
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,256
I'll tend to Dech myself.

190
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:31,694
- But...
- Go on.

191
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,600
As you wish, ma'am.

192
00:08:35,757 --> 00:08:37,522
But I'll come back

193
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:39,397
in case people with loose tongues

194
00:08:39,422 --> 00:08:41,222
saw you and gossip about you again.

195
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:43,497
Let them be.

196
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:45,886
They can think whatever they want.

197
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:48,779
Yes, ma'am.

198
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:05,957
It shouldn't have been you.

199
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:10,440
The one deserving to be bitten is me.

200
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:33,413
Ms. Malai.

201
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:36,240
I fell in love with you since then,

202
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:38,045
even though I knew

203
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:39,936
I would never see you again.

204
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:41,576
Ms. Malai of my heart.

205
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:47,967
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

206
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:53,061
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

207
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,050
Ms. Malai.

208
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:07,877
You are awake.

209
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,550
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,260
Do any parts of your body still hurt?

211
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:14,854
Do you want water?

212
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:15,924
I will fetch it for you.

213
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:20,385
It's alright, ma'am.

214
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,112
Just having Ms. Malai taking care of me

215
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:27,299
has already blessed me greatly.

216
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,190
What blessing?

217
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,221
You shouldn't have gotten bitten

218
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:33,705
by the snake instead of me.

219
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:35,979
Why did you do that, Dech?

220
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:37,799
You should have just let me

221
00:10:37,823 --> 00:10:38,752
get bitten and die.

222
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,729
Please do not say such thing, Ms. Malai.

223
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,896
Ms. Malai, do you still

224
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:49,178
remember the day we first met?

225
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:57,521
I remember.

226
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:04,802
That day was the saddest day of my life.

227
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:09,554
I can never forget it.

228
00:11:11,984 --> 00:11:13,859
We are bound by blood, elder brother.

229
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,242
Why do you cast me aside

230
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:18,039
as if I were a mere swine or cur?

231
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,813
You are not my sole sibling.

232
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,835
Should you seek refuge with me,

233
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:24,382
won't others follow suit?

234
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:25,735
You are a human.

235
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,727
It'd be a disgrace if you can't survive.

236
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:29,781
Brother...

237
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,125
Lady!

238
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:12,008
Lady!

239
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,594
Lady!

240
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,204
Lady!

241
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,524
Lady!

242
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,281
What are you doing, lady?

243
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:20,555
Huh?

244
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:22,133
Lady.

245
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:24,688
- I wish to die!
- Lady!

246
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:26,531
I wish to die! Let go!

247
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:28,125
Lady...

248
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:29,827
Let go!

249
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:30,445
Lady.

250
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,581
I wish to die!

251
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:32,492
Please calm down.

252
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:33,445
Lady.

253
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,800
I wish to die!

254
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:43,774
Lady.

255
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,133
Please come and sit, lady.

256
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:07,992
If not, then I shall go sit over there.

257
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,672
It's alright.

258
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:13,008
I do not wish to inconvenience you.

259
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:14,024
Please sit.

260
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:36,673
People's sorrows are like rain.

261
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:40,033
They come and they go.

262
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:44,418
Whatever troubles your heart now,

263
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:49,199
I believe it will pass soon.

264
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:51,863
All that is needed is patience.

265
00:13:53,926 --> 00:13:55,504
Have you ever heard that

266
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,793
the skies after rain

267
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,347
are always beautiful?

268
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:07,785
I suppose

269
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,573
mine is

270
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:13,281
more like a storm.

271
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:17,331
I do not know when it will end.

272
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:47,722
Thank you

273
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:49,964
for taking the trouble

274
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,308
to light a fire to warm me.

275
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,714
I did it for myself as well.

276
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:55,534
No need to thank me.

277
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,221
I hope thy sorrows lift soon.

278
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:03,682
Even storms fade away.

279
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:06,104
Your worries shall fade away too.

280
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,385
Just as the sun is sure to shine again,

281
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:12,736
as long as you don't lose hope,

282
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,221
there will always be chances

283
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:15,338
for new beginnings.

284
00:15:16,112 --> 00:15:17,150
I believe so.

285
00:15:19,323 --> 00:15:20,619
I will cheer you on.

286
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,322
People who are alive

287
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:25,721
can always fight and start over again.

288
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:29,570
Thank you very much,

289
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:32,297
I will remember that.

290
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,600
This is far enough.

291
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:41,761
I think I can find my own way back now.

292
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,250
Take care, lady.

293
00:15:58,578 --> 00:16:00,984
It was because of what you said to me,

294
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:04,062
that I endured

295
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:07,562
and was able to meet the viscount,

296
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:08,898
and am here today.

297
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:14,422
But it seems

298
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:19,222
my sun will still not rise.

299
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:28,118
Dech.

300
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:40,327
But my sun

301
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:42,123
rose since that day,

302
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,295
the day we first met.

303
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,932
I fell in love with you since then,

304
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:06,291
even though I knew

305
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,213
I would never see you again,

306
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:11,909
even though I knew

307
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:14,252
it was impossible.

308
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:17,909
You're far above someone

309
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,010
lowly like me.

310
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:21,026
But I never imagined

311
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,573
fate would play such a trick that

312
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:27,776
you would become the viscount's wife.

313
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,572
I do not expect Ms. Malai

314
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:53,900
to love a lowly servant like me.

315
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:56,752
But I vow to live to

316
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:58,947
protect Ms. Malai

317
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,543
and do everything to make you happy.

318
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:23,209
Ms. Malai of my heart.

319
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:15,770
Ms. Malai.

320
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,390
Ms. Malai!

321
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Ms. Malai!

322
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:23,521

I ran around looking for you

336
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,380
all over the house.

337
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:52,622
Is there something wrong

338
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:54,770
that got you so worked up?

339
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:57,481
The viscount is calling for you,

340
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,872
it seems he wants to discuss

341
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:00,122
something with you.

342
00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:14,364
You're here, Malai.

343
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:15,895
Please sit,

344
00:21:16,177 --> 00:21:17,755
I have something to tell you.

345
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:20,012
I was informed by Fueang.

346
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:23,372
Please get to the point, my lord.

347
00:21:25,193 --> 00:21:26,637
Good,

348
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:28,809
I have no need to beat around the bush.

349
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:30,044
I thought about

350
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:32,334
bringing you and Dech to Hua Hin.

351
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:34,356
Are you still thinking

352
00:21:34,381 --> 00:21:35,684
about this, my lord?

353
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:38,419
Even after Dech was bitten by the snake?

354
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,731
Why are you still so insistent?

355
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:45,247
I need an heir as you know.

356
00:21:45,724 --> 00:21:48,005
When will you be able to give me a child

357
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:49,389
if not using this method?

358
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:52,669
Hua Hin has a nice environment,

359
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,637
perhaps it will make you feel better.

360
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:55,864
Make me feel better, my lord?

361
00:21:56,427 --> 00:21:58,098
Dech was just bitten,

362
00:21:58,286 --> 00:21:59,989
does he still have to travel so far?

363
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:02,419
I refuse.

364
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:04,622
Dech has recovered from his fever.

365
00:22:04,638 --> 00:22:05,841
The doctor checked on him,

366
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,005
and he said Dech is fine now,

367
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:08,149
he's healthy.

368
00:22:09,193 --> 00:22:11,434
Malai, please don't be reluctant.

369
00:22:17,646 --> 00:22:19,012
Please, Malai,

370
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:21,208
let's help each other.

371
00:22:21,794 --> 00:22:23,598
I don't want to be infertile either,

372
00:22:23,794 --> 00:22:25,028
I want a child with you

373
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,637
without relying on Dech as well.

374
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,290
But what can we do

375
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,508
given the situation?

376
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:48,300
I will do as you wish, my lord.

377
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:54,363
Thank you so much, Malai.

378
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,089
I really didn't make a mistake

379
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:57,597
choosing you to be my wife.

380
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:13,301
Oww!

381
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,558
Ah!

00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:25,285
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

384
00:23:28,355 --> 00:23:29,402
My lord is going to

385
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:30,574
take Ms. Malai to Hua Hin.

386
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,245
Did you think I wouldn't know?

387
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,472
I'm just going for a short break,

388
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,496
then I'll be back.

389
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:38,917
What do you expect by making a scene?

390
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:42,863
Then why didn't you

391
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,175
take me too, my lord?

392
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,714
I also want to go to Hua Hin, my lord.

393
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:49,128
If you act this way,

394
00:23:49,315 --> 00:23:50,660
how can I not think

395
00:23:50,668 --> 00:23:52,348
you are being biased, my lord?

396
00:23:52,793 --> 00:23:54,035
I'm not being biased.

397
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:56,410
It's not just the two of us going,

398
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:57,800
Dech is also coming along.

399
00:23:59,683 --> 00:24:01,706
I don't care whether you bring.

400
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,931
Dech or any other servants, my lord.

401
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:06,691
If you go with Ms. Malai,

402
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:08,503
it's not fair to me.

403
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:10,441
You know, my lord,

404
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:12,222
even if you forbid me,

405
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:14,120
I will follow you there.

406
00:24:14,316 --> 00:24:15,589
Don't believe me? Just watch.

407
00:24:32,478 --> 00:24:33,665
Tell me what you want

408
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:34,923
and I'll buy it for you.

409
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:37,376
Anything at all, my lord?

410
00:24:37,752 --> 00:24:38,752
Indeed.

411
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:40,353
Anything you desire,

412
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,681
I'll buy it all for you,

413
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:43,181
however many things.

414
00:24:48,682 --> 00:24:49,931
The viscount must be afraid.

415
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,251
Ms. Ramphoei will be sad,

416
00:24:51,276 --> 00:24:52,548
that's why he's bringing

417
00:24:52,572 --> 00:24:53,642
you shopping.

418
00:24:55,236 --> 00:24:56,478
I didn't get to go to Hua Hin,

419
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,697
but getting jewelry is worth it.

420
00:24:58,744 --> 00:24:59,556
That's right.

421
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,478
When you return, you must show off

422
00:25:02,557 --> 00:25:03,939
to show who exactly is

423
00:25:03,947 --> 00:25:06,165
the viscount's favorite wife, ma'am.

424
00:25:08,502 --> 00:25:10,908
Steamed Coconut Custard, my favorite!

425
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:17,408
Oww!

426
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,650
Ah!

427
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,041
You psycho!

428
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:25,353
Ms. Ramphoei!

429
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,161
There's blood!

430
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:30,399
Someone help!

431
00:25:30,424 --> 00:25:31,424
Ramphoei!

432
00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:34,119
She got hit on the head!

433
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:35,681
He already ran away!

434
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:37,439
Ms. Ramphoei!

435
00:25:37,455 --> 00:25:39,033
Ms. Ramphoei, please don't die!

436
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,408
Oh, blood!

437
00:26:03,526 --> 00:26:04,830
- Hey!
- Kam!

438
00:26:08,424 --> 00:26:09,944
Apologies, my lord.

439
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:18,612
Well done.

440
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:26,439
Thank you, my lord.

441
00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:28,377
Hurry and return

442
00:26:28,635 --> 00:26:30,025
so as not to draw attention.

443
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:31,081
Yes, my lord.

444
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:44,890
It's a pity that

445
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:46,350
I couldn't catch the person

446
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,670
who harmed you, Ramphoei.

447
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:48,694
That's true, my lord.

448
00:26:48,718 --> 00:26:50,015
If I could catch them,

449
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:52,572
I would make them suffer tremendously!

450
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,530
How dare they harm my master.

451
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:01,077
My lord,

452
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:02,663
I'm in so much pain like this,

453
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:03,921
surely, you won't go to Hua Hin

454
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:05,608
and tend to me, right, my lord?

455
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:06,624
Of course not.

456
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
I have made arrangements.

457
00:27:07,656 --> 00:27:08,804
How could I not go?

458
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:11,468
You have Chaem to take care of you here.

459
00:27:11,835 --> 00:27:13,343
I will be back in just a few days,

460
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:15,233
by then, you should already recovered.

461
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:16,809
You don't really care about me,

462
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:17,834
do you, my lord?

463
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:19,007
Ouch!

464
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,694
Please don't be upset, Ramphoei.

465
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:23,991
How about this?

466
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,069
When I return from Hua Hin,

467
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:28,452
I will find an opportunity to take you

468
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,397
on a trip together to make up for it.

469
00:27:31,335 --> 00:27:32,405
Truly, my lord?

470
00:27:33,242 --> 00:27:34,257
Indeed.

471
00:27:35,085 --> 00:27:36,671
If you go on a trip with me,

472
00:27:37,335 --> 00:27:38,632
you probably wouldn't want Malai

473
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,858
to come along either, right?

474
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:42,104
Yes, my lord.

475
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:47,924
My lord is truly wonderful.

476
00:27:48,112 --> 00:27:49,463
It is truly a great fortune

477
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:51,159
for me to have met you.

478
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,494
In that case,

479
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:55,049
rest and recover.

480
00:27:55,393 --> 00:27:57,174
And take your medicine.

481
00:27:57,956 --> 00:27:59,065
When you're better,

482
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:00,229
we'll go on the trip.

483
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:02,799
Yes, my lord.

484
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:04,432
I will do everything as you say,

485
00:28:04,456 --> 00:28:05,456
my lord.

486
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:08,768
Please recover soon, Ramphoei.

487
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:21,278
Take care of her well, Chaem.

488
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:23,778
Let me know if anything is lacking.

489
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:25,356
Yes, my lord.

490
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,843
The viscount is truly concerned

491
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,179
about you, Ms. Ramphoei.

492
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:42,108
It seems you need to recover quickly

493
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:44,195
so that you can go on a trip soon.

494
00:28:44,726 --> 00:28:46,968
If I can go on a trip alone with him,

495
00:28:47,468 --> 00:28:50,068
I will definitely be pregnant for sure.

496
00:28:51,288 --> 00:28:52,507
As for that damn Malai,

497
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,897
who knows if she will be

498
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:55,398
pregnant when she returns.

499
00:28:55,882 --> 00:28:57,913
What if Malai gets pregnant before you?

500
00:29:00,976 --> 00:29:02,507
There are still many ways

501
00:29:02,717 --> 00:29:03,997
to obstruct her.

502
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,480
Why are you here, Saeng?

503
00:29:12,746 --> 00:29:14,534
Something concerning the servant abode?

504
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:17,605
No, my lord.

505
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,581
I merely wanted to see

506
00:29:19,606 --> 00:29:21,231
the face of a heartless person.

507
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:22,964
What are you saying, Saeng?

508
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:25,644
I truly believe that

509
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,644
you would go to any lengths

510
00:29:28,957 --> 00:29:30,339
to secure your lineage,

511
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:32,737
even allowing Ms. Ramphoei

512
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:34,128
to suffer from a blow on her head.

513
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,401
You're spouting nonsense, Saeng.

514
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:42,159
Ramphoei was attacked by a thief,

515
00:29:42,362 --> 00:29:43,362
not by me.

516
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,620
My lord, you may deceive anyone,

517
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:47,737
but don't assume that I would not

518
00:29:47,762 --> 00:29:48,980
see through your plan

519
00:29:49,005 --> 00:29:50,605
to hurt Ms. Ramphoei

520
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:52,885
in order to prevent her

521
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,526
from hindering you at Hua Hin.

522
00:29:55,183 --> 00:29:57,151
How dare you speak to me like this?

523
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:00,518
I wouldn't dare, my lord.

524
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:02,971
I'm merely speaking the truth.

525
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:06,143
But I'm just surprised

526
00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:08,268
why you had to make

527
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:10,160
ms. Ramphoei bleed so profusely.

528
00:30:10,315 --> 00:30:12,401
Someone as ambitious as Ms. Ramphoei

529
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:14,041
would easily be satisfied

530
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:15,159
when granted power.

531
00:30:15,183 --> 00:30:16,159
What do you desire by

532
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:17,291
speaking to me like this?

533
00:30:20,065 --> 00:30:21,729
Take me instead of Dech, my lord.

534
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:25,291
After all, he just recovered.

535
00:30:25,495 --> 00:30:27,635
There's no reason for you to select him.

536
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:32,838
Are you trying to threaten me

537
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,502
and negotiate, Saeng?

538
00:30:34,581 --> 00:30:36,260
You are clueless about your position.

539
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:38,573
Must I punish you

540
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:40,416
to make you remember that

541
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,440
you're a servant and I'm the master!

542
00:30:44,183 --> 00:30:45,666
No, my lord.

543
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:47,573
That did not cross my mind at all!

544
00:30:48,495 --> 00:30:49,659
Don't let me find out

545
00:30:50,073 --> 00:30:52,190
that you're an untamed servant,

546
00:30:53,495 --> 00:30:55,213
you lowly gigolo!

547
00:31:14,827 --> 00:31:15,764
Just you wait,

548
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:18,265
someone like me

549
00:31:19,023 --> 00:31:20,804
won't permit you to glorify Dech!

550
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:30,546
Geez.

551
00:31:30,827 --> 00:31:32,452
You've been on the run for so long.

552
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:34,061
What are you afraid of at this point?

553
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:36,108
I want you to kill that Malai woman

554
00:31:36,116 --> 00:31:38,053
and end this matter once and for all.

555
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:40,632
Kill her?

(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

558
00:32:25,186 --> 00:32:26,342
Enough already,

559
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:28,053
listening to this melody

560
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:29,678
makes me depressed.

561
00:32:29,936 --> 00:32:31,858
You just recovered from your illness.

562
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:35,608
I can play whatsoever

563
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:37,016
I please right, Fueang?

564
00:32:38,632 --> 00:32:40,694
Yes, it's your business,

565
00:32:41,108 --> 00:32:43,631
but listening to it makes me sad.

566
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:45,701
Makes me wonder whether

567
00:32:45,725 --> 00:32:46,936
the musician is suffering.

568
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,826
I'm not suffering or anything.

569
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:51,687
You're just spouting nonsense.

570
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:56,674
I thought you were suffering,

571
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,194
given that the viscount

572
00:32:58,219 --> 00:32:59,506
is dragging you to Hua Hin,

573
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:00,873
having barely recovered.

574
00:33:02,593 --> 00:33:04,553
There are many servants in the abode,

575
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:07,022
why did he choose you specifically?

576
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:08,592
He also doesn't allow me

577
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,686
to follow Ms. Malai,

578
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,710
so strange.

579
00:33:12,303 --> 00:33:13,342
It's not strange.

580
00:33:13,843 --> 00:33:15,928
The viscount must have needed my help.

581
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:18,256
Or do you wish to witness.

582
00:33:18,702 --> 00:33:20,084
Saeng become the favored servant

583
00:33:20,109 --> 00:33:20,983
instead of me?

584
00:33:21,014 --> 00:33:21,983
Ugh.

585
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:23,334
No way,

586
00:33:23,897 --> 00:33:25,381
it's better if it's you.

587
00:33:25,577 --> 00:33:26,600
Were it Saeng,

588
00:33:26,616 --> 00:33:28,030
he would strut about the house

589
00:33:28,055 --> 00:33:29,484
in a vainglorious manner.

590
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,701
The viscount's trip to Hua Hin this time

591
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:35,458
may bring good news,

592
00:33:35,968 --> 00:33:37,209
your mistress Ms. Malai

593
00:33:37,218 --> 00:33:38,287
will be at ease too.

594
00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:42,168
True,

595
00:33:43,247 --> 00:33:44,660
but part of me doesn't want

596
00:33:44,668 --> 00:33:45,902
the viscount to have a child,

597
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:47,629
that he may relinquish power,

598
00:33:47,637 --> 00:33:49,512
and finally granting us liberty.

599
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:54,535
You think too simply Fueang,

600
00:33:54,926 --> 00:33:56,332
the liberty you speak of

601
00:33:56,598 --> 00:33:58,049
would prove more arduous

602
00:33:58,074 --> 00:33:59,457
than our service here.

603
00:34:00,114 --> 00:34:01,121
I'm fine with that.

604
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:07,033
As long as I have you by my side,

605
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:09,331
I fear no difficulties.

606
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:11,565
Should we escape,

607
00:34:12,495 --> 00:34:14,182
we could live together.

608
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,230
Please, Dech?

609
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:17,378
Please, Dech?

610
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:19,581
Very well.

611
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,050
If we can break free,

612
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:22,237
I will live with you

613
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,940
and care for you like a real sister.

614
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:32,800
You've always been like a sister to me

615
00:34:33,152 --> 00:34:34,205
and I'll cherish

616
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,573
you as a sister forever.

617
00:34:36,464 --> 00:34:38,197
Do you understand, Fueang?

618
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:40,503
Yeah.

619
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:46,807
I'll take my leave.

620
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,502
Chaem, come and help me.

621
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:19,158
Take it slow, Ms. Ramphoei.

622
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:24,748
Hey!

623
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:27,232
How did you get in here?

624
00:35:27,264 --> 00:35:28,373
And where is Chaem?

625
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:29,662
She went downstairs

626
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:31,076
to fetch your breakfast,

627
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:33,240
so I came to stand in for her.

628
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:35,881
And where is the viscount?

629
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:37,225
Why don't I see him?

630
00:35:37,264 --> 00:35:38,623
The viscount went to Hua Hin

631
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,381
with Ms. Mali since dawn, ma'am.

632
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:41,467
What?

633
00:35:43,155 --> 00:35:44,155
How come?

634
00:35:44,357 --> 00:35:45,615
The viscount went without

635
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,646
saying goodbye to me.

636
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:48,410
I think the viscount probably

637
00:35:48,427 --> 00:35:50,043
didn't want to disturb your rest, ma'am.

638
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:51,928
Besides,

639
00:35:52,131 --> 00:35:53,537
he probably doesn't want to suffer

640
00:35:53,545 --> 00:35:54,967
through someone's incessant chatter

641
00:35:54,975 --> 00:35:56,779
and ruin his mood before departing.

642
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:58,959
Uan!

643
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,803
In this condition,

644
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,467
it would be a burden

645
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:04,529
if you tag along, ma'am.

646
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,787
You were just attacked

647
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:06,912
and soaked in blood.

648
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,341
I don't believe you will

649
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,521
die easily, ma'am.

650
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:12,209
Uan!

651
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:13,217
Oww...

652
00:36:13,592 --> 00:36:14,935
Cease this, Ms. Ramphoei.

653
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:16,771
Or everyone will know discover that

654
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:17,834
you're as tough as

655
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:18,882
any other servants here.

656
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:20,318
You're only lying down

657
00:36:20,827 --> 00:36:22,267
to gain sympathy.

658
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:25,803
Uan! Ah!

659
00:36:26,178 --> 00:36:26,881
Oww...

660
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:27,967
Your origin

661
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:29,850
is no different from me.

662
00:36:30,795 --> 00:36:31,865
You are not worthy enough

663
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:33,146
for the viscount to bid farewell.

664
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,435
Remember that!

665
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,158
Why, you little...!

666
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,370
Ouch!

667
00:36:51,018 --> 00:36:52,924
I know not what you are thinking,

668
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,877
but following after the viscount

669
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,932
now will surely incur his anger, ma'am.

670
00:36:57,003 --> 00:36:58,596
What I do is my own business,

671
00:36:59,323 --> 00:37:00,869
no need to stick your nose in.

672
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,562
I'm merely worried.

673
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,658
Ms. Ramphoei is still injured.

674
00:37:05,104 --> 00:37:06,385
Following the viscount now

675
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:07,502
would be dangerous.

676
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:09,158
I have my own ways,

677
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:11,518
no need for concern, Saeng.

678
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:13,123
You may leave.

679
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:15,846
Yes, ma'am.

680
00:37:21,885 --> 00:37:25,486
(Hua Hin House)

681
00:37:26,323 --> 00:37:27,455
Hurry and go now,

682
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:28,963
so you wouldn't reach there late.

683
00:37:29,065 --> 00:37:30,065
Ramphoei,

684
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:31,604
don't forget that

685
00:37:31,784 --> 00:37:32,984
I'm still on the run.

686
00:37:33,409 --> 00:37:34,409
Geez.

687
00:37:34,729 --> 00:37:36,268
You've been on the run for so long.

688
00:37:36,293 --> 00:37:38,150
What are you afraid of at this point?

689
00:37:39,143 --> 00:37:40,455
Even you

690
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:42,916
were attacked in broad daylight.

691
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,894
I find this to be so suspicious.

692
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,338
I don't care how suspicious it is.

693
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:52,500
I want you to kill that Malai woman

694
00:37:52,525 --> 00:37:54,580
and end this matter once and for all.

695
00:37:55,995 --> 00:37:56,995
Kill her?

696
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:00,096
No more rape?

697
00:38:00,135 --> 00:38:01,260
I've changed my mind.

698
00:38:01,285 --> 00:38:02,744
I don't want to keep her around

699
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,088
like a snake in the grass.

700
00:38:04,112 --> 00:38:06,080
Even though she won't suffer that much.

701
00:38:06,105 --> 00:38:07,175
Should have gone with this

702
00:38:07,183 --> 00:38:08,214
from the beginning.

703
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,555
Then it wouldn't be so troublesome.

704
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,580
Brother,

705
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:12,424
there are only a few people over there.

706
00:38:12,432 --> 00:38:13,775
When you return,

707
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:15,369
I hope to hear good news.

708
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,713
Believe in me, Ramphoei.

709
00:39:03,396 --> 00:39:05,083
You never think of loving others

710
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:06,536
except for yourself, my lord!

711
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,364
Dech!

712
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,380
My lord!

713
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:14,755
The woman just now is your mother?

714
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:16,153
Yes, her name is Fueang.

715
00:39:16,162 --> 00:39:17,380
If you don't wish to die,

716
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:19,435
do not get involved with that house!

717
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:24,950
That's not true, it was just a dream.

718
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,630
