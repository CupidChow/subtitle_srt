(Episode 41)

19
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:12,693
You promised me

20
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:15,160
if I find you the culprit,

21
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,716
you would tell me

22
00:02:17,823 --> 00:02:19,260
who my parents were

23
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,640
and what happened to Mr. Mueang.

24
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:27,103
Dech can't go anywhere.

25
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:29,196
Dech has to stay with me
as he vowed!

26
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,222
I'm ready to fulfill the vow.

27
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:34,222
I gave you, my lord.

28
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:35,516
My lord!

29
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,443
Are you gonna kill me?

30
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:20,400
Are you people gonna kill me?!

31
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:33,137
My lord!

32
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:07,267
My lord.

33
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,033
My lord!

34
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,107
- My lord!
- Father!

35
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:14,607
Father!

36
00:04:15,197 --> 00:04:16,197
My lord!

37
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,623
Father!

38
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:19,943
- My lord!
- Father!

39
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:21,600
My lord!

40
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:23,697
Father?

41
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,690
Father?

42
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:28,163
My lord?

43
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:29,640

00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:31,120
My lord!

45
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,470
Father?

46
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,750
Father?

47
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:38,103
My lord?

48
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:39,520
My lord?

49
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:02,024
Malai?

50
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,607
Someone, help Malai.

51
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:05,617
We can't, ma'am.

52
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,341
We can't, Ms. Bu-nga.

53
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,320
We can't go in there.

54
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:11,061
I have to help Malai.

55
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:12,587
- You can't.
- Malai!

56
00:05:12,957 --> 00:05:14,355
- Malai!
- She's gone, ma'am.

57
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:15,541
Count Phichit...

58
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,923
Im, keep your voice down.

59
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:19,590
He'll know we saw him.

60
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,027
Please come. Let's go. Please come.

61
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,230
Malai!

62
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:26,073
- Please come.
- Malai!

63
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,506
- Malai.
- Please come.

64
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:29,116
Malai.

65
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,200
Soon, Dech,

66
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,263
you're gonna stay with me
as you vowed.

67
00:05:58,303 --> 00:05:59,913
I swear that

68
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,209
I will love

69
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:03,600
and be faithful to His Lordship.

70
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:06,396
But if one day
Dech breaks his promise,

71
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,380
he will die with excruciating pain

72
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:11,561
for breaking my heart.

73
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,870
You...

74
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:28,080
You still have time.

75
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,263
My lord,

76
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:32,927
please let Dech go.

77
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,200
If you truly love him,

78
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:39,740
don't let him die here.

79
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:41,440
But it's too late, Malai.

80
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,000
I have no intention
to change my mind.

81
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:45,722
Even if I do,

82
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:48,957
he's too injured
to leave this place.

83
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,094
Don't be sad about this, Ms. Malai.

84
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,733
Just you knowing the truth

85
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:09,486
and understanding
the love I have for you.

86
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:14,933
That's enough for me.

87
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,346
As for my life,

88
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:23,920
it doesn't matter.

89
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:25,696
Dech.

90
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:27,257
Dech.

91
00:07:29,757 --> 00:07:30,757
Dech!

92
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,007
But I'm telling you
right now, my lord.

93
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,442
Even if I fulfill my vow to you,

94
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:49,133
my only love...

95
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:56,393
is Ms. Malai and Ms. Malai alone.

96
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:01,405
But Malai doesn't really love you.

97
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:05,212
Or she wouldn't have mistaken you
for her killer for 20 years!

98
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:06,880
Open your eyes already!

99
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:14,800
I never held it against her.

100
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:21,540
I was my fault even

101
00:08:22,237 --> 00:08:25,050
for not being able to free her
from this circle of vengeance.

102
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,440
None of this would have happened...

103
00:08:39,837 --> 00:08:42,207
if I had more trust in you,

104
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,550
if I had more trust...

105
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,360
in your love for me.

106
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:56,943
It's really okay, Ms. Malai.

107
00:09:02,523 --> 00:09:03,643
I was my fault...

108
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:07,184
for breaking your heart.

109
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:16,130
Please forgive me, Ms. Malai.

110
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,760
I forgive you.

111
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:23,080
We forgive each other.

112
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:27,160
And everyone else.

113
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,397
In case one day...

114
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:40,797
I get to meet you again.

115
00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:05,080
Let's forgive each other,

116
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:07,117
my lord.

117
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:11,356
Finally,

118
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:13,280
you're gonna stay with me.

I've realized now
how much you love me.

No matter what I do,

125
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:54,893
you'll never let me go.

126

please forgive me, my lord.

I promise you that

130
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,646
I will stay with you

00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:49,537
Malai!

191
00:20:50,503 --> 00:20:51,503
You!

192
00:20:57,217 --> 00:20:59,000
Now that things
turned out this way,

193
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,233
I apologize for the marquis

194
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:05,309
who was making everything
spiral out of control.

195
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:07,122
You don't have to apologize.

196
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:09,760
It wasn't even your fault.

197
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,280
The marquis did it on his own.

198
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:16,060
Greed doesn't discriminate.

199
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:18,827
But a lot of people died.

200
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,320
And he almost...

201
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,153
got the true heir,

202
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:26,467
who knew nothing, killed.

203
00:21:26,663 --> 00:21:28,162
It's water under the bridge.

204
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,667
I don't hold it against anyone.

205
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:33,727
Don't worry about it, my lady.

206
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,060
I appreciate that, Rerai.

207
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,320
I want to give all the fortune

208
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,366
back to Rerai

209
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:42,742
and you, Fueang.

210
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:46,897
Please don't refuse me.

211
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,040
It's time to put aside
your pride, Fueang.

212
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,840
It's not pride, ma'am.

213
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,960
- But...
- But you're afraid of more danger.

214
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:14,660
The marquis is dead.

215
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:16,626
Who else is gonna pose a danger?

216
00:22:16,993 --> 00:22:18,786
Stop making excuses

217
00:22:19,062 --> 00:22:20,547
and consider reality.

218
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,033
You have to learn to accept

219
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,120
that Rerai is
the viscount's daughter

220
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,314
even though you don't want to.

221
00:22:28,057 --> 00:22:29,907
- Ms. Bu-nga...
- If I were you,

222
00:22:30,037 --> 00:22:32,597
I wouldn't want to accept
my rapist as my child's father,

223
00:22:32,823 --> 00:22:35,914
But Rerai is still
the viscount's direct heir

224
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:39,843
and this fortune
will greatly benefit her.

225
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,613
Think about
your daughter's future, Fueang.

226
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:52,863
Mom...

227
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:56,524
I...

228
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,907
If you want the fortune,

229
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:02,243
take it.

230
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,840
I won't stop you.

231
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,010
You mean it?

232
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:11,014
Even if I stop you,

233
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:14,200
you wouldn't listen to me anyway.

234
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,710
Gee.

235
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,150
Mom.

236
00:23:23,057 --> 00:23:24,160
From now on,

237
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,800
you can make your own decisions.

238
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:48,140
I want to split
the fortune in half?

239
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:49,497
Yes.

240
00:23:50,183 --> 00:23:52,660
I think that's more fair.

241
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:56,360
Besides, the marquis
made it grow to where it is now.

242
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,583
Even though you say
you don't mind,

243
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:01,237
I don't think it's right.

244
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,943
Are you sure?

245
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:04,470
Because...

246
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,839
the marquis was the one who almost

247
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,630
got you and Mai killed.

248
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,283
Don't worry, my lady.

249
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:13,883
Besides, even if you don't agree,

250
00:24:14,006 --> 00:24:16,103
if she really insists,

251
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:17,590
I doubt you'll change her mind.

252
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,616
Hey, you talk too much, Mai.

253
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:24,453
If you thought it through,

254
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,400
I'm happy to accept it.

255
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,397
You like the scarf
I bought you that much?

256
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:03,186
I'll probably have to call you
a millionairess soon.

257
00:25:03,516 --> 00:25:05,554
What millionairess?

258
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,700
I'm still the same old me.

259
00:25:08,044 --> 00:25:09,427
If not "millionairess,"

260
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,843
I'll probably have to
call you Doctor Rerai?

261
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,514
Well, maybe.

262
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:18,366
Next time, if I come back here,

263
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:21,440
I'll visit you at the hospital.

264
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,000
"Come back here"?

265
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,490
Where are you going?

266
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,107
Going back to Ayutthaya.

267
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:31,620
I have a house to run.

268
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,110
Besides,

269
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,423
I want to go back
and make merit for...

270
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,707
My father Dech
and my mother Ramphoei.

271
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:40,900
No matter what they did,

272
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,720
they were still my parents.

273
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:45,872
At least I should make merit
and share it with them.

274
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,627
So... Uh... So...

275
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:49,637
I'm gonna go.

276
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,760
I wish you luck.

277
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,390
Dech?

278
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:13,883
Come back to me.

279
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,893
Don't leave me alone.

280
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:23,489
Come back to me.

281
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,070
Dech?

282
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,216
Come back to me.

283
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,200
Don't leave me alone.

284
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,883
Come back to me, Dech.

285
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:49,283
Come back to me.

286
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,237
Come back to me, Dech.

287
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,397
Come back to me.

288
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,423
Anyone, please get my scarf!

289
00:27:56,563 --> 00:27:57,563
You?

290
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,720
I bought this for you.
How could you lose it?

291
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,263
Well, I was in a hurry.

292
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,920
Thought it'd be too late.

293
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:06,033
All because of you.

294
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,617
And you're chiding me?

295
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,492
Scolding me as soon as you see me.

296
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:11,368
Tie it properly next time,

297
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:12,959
so it won't get
blown away and lost.

298
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Lost?

299
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,060
Like you're leaving me?

300
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:21,006
I saw when you two were together.

301
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:23,469
I can tell you have
feelings for each other.

302
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:26,133
So what are you overthinking?

303
00:28:26,516 --> 00:28:28,140
Even if I don't overthink,

304
00:28:28,662 --> 00:28:30,226
I'm still not worthy of her.

305
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:33,160
I'm just a son of a servant
and a commoner wife.

306
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:36,013
And my adoptive parents
stole her fortune.

307
00:28:36,402 --> 00:28:38,526
I'm lucky
she didn't ask for it back.

308
00:28:38,935 --> 00:28:40,299
Suit yourself.

309
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:42,753
I just wanted to remind you.

310
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:44,639
When two people fancy each other,

311
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:46,906
why ruin a good thing
over pettiness?

312
00:28:47,982 --> 00:28:49,395
But if you disagree with me,

313
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:51,187
I won't force you.

314
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,946
Have a safe trip.

315
00:28:58,469 --> 00:28:59,469
Then...

316
00:29:14,263 --> 00:29:15,600
You must tie it properly.

317
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:22,016
So I won't be lost again.

318
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,456
Came to see them too, Fueang?

319
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,040
Yes, I came to root for them

320
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:06,863

what are you doing here?

Hm, what are you doing?

328
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,203
Goodness, you read about
the legend of banana leaf vessels

329
00:31:46,214 --> 00:31:48,154
for luck in love,
so you wanted to try?

like you doesn't need

331
00:31:51,234 --> 00:31:52,707
to worry about being an old maid.

332
00:31:52,717 --> 00:31:54,407
I'm the one who should be worried.

333
00:31:54,888 --> 00:31:56,407
Nonsense, girl.

334
00:31:56,604 --> 00:31:58,654
Is May done getting dressed?

335
00:31:59,177 --> 00:32:00,861
She's waiting for you,
her bridesmaid.

336
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,274

Come on.

347
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:46,462
Smile properly.

Oh, I'm sorry.

356
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,407
I saw you walk out by yourself.

357
00:36:44,904 --> 00:36:46,314
And you weren't on the phone.

358
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,167
So I thought
it must have been cold inside.

359
00:36:50,723 --> 00:36:52,947
I came out for some fresh air.

Yes. Well...

the staff said I could
float it in the pond.

364
00:37:07,669 --> 00:37:08,669
Did I break the rules?

365

I'm sorry.

read about this place.

00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,210
It says...

374
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:31,540
someone picked up
someone's banana leaf vessel.

375
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,180
They ended up married later.

376
00:37:40,282 --> 00:37:42,153
They were my grandparents.

377
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:45,395
My grandmother floated the vessel,
my grandfather picked it up

378
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:46,600
before they got married.

379
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:49,113
But they died a long time ago

380
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,160
so I wrote it in their memory.

381
00:37:54,237 --> 00:37:55,774
You're the owner of this place?

382
00:37:56,556 --> 00:37:57,613
Yes.

383
00:37:57,623 --> 00:37:59,580
I'm Danai. You can call me Nai.

384
00:38:01,076 --> 00:38:03,673
Welcome to Ruean Rom Ngio
Boutique Hotel.

385
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,083
Yes.

386
00:38:06,343 --> 00:38:07,343
I'm Nira.

387
00:38:20,943 --> 00:38:22,473
What a beautiful red cotton tree.

388
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,094
It's grand.
Not like other ones I saw.

389
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,340
This one is from
the Rama VI period.

390
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:31,766
This house was burned down
and repaired many times

391
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,956
but this tree survived
and has stood to this day.

392
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:37,503
Beautiful.

393
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,393
But spooky.

394
00:38:40,816 --> 00:38:42,166
Let's call it classic.

395
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:46,333
If you don't mind,

396
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,750
I'd like to make up
for taking the liberty

397
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:50,273
of picking up your vessel.

398
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,894
We have a very special drink
for only VIP guests.

399
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:55,887
I'd like you to try.

400
00:38:58,529 --> 00:38:59,529
I'm happy to.

401
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,040
This way, please.

402
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,700
The atmosphere inside is excellent.

403
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:24,420
Yeah? You like it?

404
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,087
Dech swore to me

405
00:39:57,923 --> 00:39:59,800

Mistaking red cotton flowers
for lotus flowers,

431
00:43:16,556 --> 00:43:19,607
As if mistaking wrong for right.

432
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:23,481
Measure people at their core,

433
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:28,241
Or you will fall for the sight
of red cotton flowers and perish.

434
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:33,287
