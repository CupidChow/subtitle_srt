"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 36)

19
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,054
Did you see that Ms. Malai

20
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,358
finished it by herself?

21
00:02:01,383 --> 00:02:02,578
Ms. Malai brought it to eat

22
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:03,665
at Ms. Bu-nga's room.

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,047
If Dech killed everyone,

24
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,687
as both of us understand,

25
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,312
nowhere is safe, Bu-nga.

26
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,533
I thought there was something.

27
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:13,525
Who came to clean and

28
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:14,932
forgot to lock the window?

29
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:25,745
Oh.

30
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:27,182
Oh dear.

31
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:26,563
My apologies for the delay, ma'am.

32
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:28,118
I had to consult with a colleague from

33
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,243
another institution to

34
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:30,196
confirm my findings.

35
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,493
No need to apologize.

36
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:33,337
I should be thanking you for taking

37
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:34,884
the time to check thoroughly.

38
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,428
You must be tired.

39
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,400
So, what did you discover?

40
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,548
The substance in the bottle is

41
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:49,253
a type of poison, ma'am.

42
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:52,868
Poison?

43
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:35,962
The substance in the bottle is

44
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:37,667
a type of poison, ma'am.

45
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,259
Poison?

46
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:43,079
It's a toxin commonly used by hunters

47
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:44,712
to coat their weapons,

48
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:46,407
such as arrows or spearheads,

49
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:47,680
for hunting animals.

50
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:04,865
If this poison were used on a person?

51
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:07,029
In such cases, it could result in

52
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:09,659
either death or paralysis, ma'am.

53
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,707
You relayed to Count Phichit that

54
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:15,246
you saw the viscount in the morning,

55
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:16,925
yet you told me that you were with him

56
00:06:16,957 --> 00:06:18,890
when he fell down the stairs.

57
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:20,510
Can you clarify what really happened?

58
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:21,574
The reality is that

59
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:22,988
the viscount fell down the stairs,

60
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:24,097
resulting in paralysis.

61
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:25,378
Maybe I misspoke when

62
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:26,449
Count Phichit asked

63
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:28,042
because I was grieving.

64
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:41,029
Your schemes are not lost on me.

65
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:43,036
You and that wretched Ramphoei

66
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:44,545
plotted together to harm my lord,

67
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,696
leaving him paralyzed,

68
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,079
just as you conspired to conceal

69
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:48,651
the fact that woman is still alive!

70
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:18,145
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

71
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:35,284
We can talk in another room

72
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:36,989
if you prefer, Ms. Malai.

73
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:38,862
Why can't we talk here?

74
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:42,605
It's nothing.

75
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:45,087
What did you want to discuss with me?

76
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:50,237
I know what was in that bottle, Dech.

77
00:08:04,938 --> 00:08:07,735
I'm not sure what you're referring to.

78
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:10,977
At this point,

79
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:15,258
you'd still dare lie to me?

80
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:17,844
Why are you trying to

81
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,164
find fault with me again?

82
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,430
I told you I don't know.

83
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,008
Ms. Malai, don't!

84
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:35,024
- Let go!
- Ms. Malai!

85
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,516
Let go!

86
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,766
Malai!

87
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,819
- Please don't!
- Let go!

88
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:43,469
Malai, what happened? Malai?

89
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:45,281
- Please don't!
- Let go!

90
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:46,883
- Please don't!
- Let go!

91
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:51,758
Malai!

92
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:55,133
- Please don't!
- Let go!

93
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,461
- Please don't!
- Let go!

94
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:00,985
If you truly know nothing,

95
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,180
why were you afraid of me

96
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:03,305
drinking that poison?

97
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:05,907
Answer me!

98
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:08,391
I said answer me!

99
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,508
Answer me!

100
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:14,657
Malai!

101
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:17,055
Answer me!

102
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,227
Answer me!

103
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:21,360
Answer me!

104
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:31,555
Answer me!

105
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,031
Why must the person I love be so cruel?

106
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:42,985
Why, Dech?

107
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,297
Do you know how disappointed

108
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:48,322
I am in you?

109
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,274
Besides the viscount,

110
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:59,195
Saeng, Phoem, Ramphoei,

111
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:00,712
Chaem

112
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,210
it was all your doing, wasn't it?

113
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:08,283
What I'm about to tell you now will be

114
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:11,002
the unvarnished truth, Ms. Malai.

115
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:15,455
I confess that I did poison the viscount

116
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:17,892
and was responsible for Phoem's death.

117
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:18,955
Why, Dech?

118
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:21,883
I was compelled to take those actions

119
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:23,158
because both the viscount

120
00:10:23,183 --> 00:10:24,728
and Phoem posed a threat to your life,

121
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:26,494
so I felt I had to act preemptively.

122
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:27,517
Even considering

123
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:28,681
the viscount's paralysis,

124
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:30,252
why did you kill him?

125
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:32,244
No,

126
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,916
I swear I didn't kill the viscount.

127
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:35,814
I don't know either how he died.

128
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,814
If it wasn't you, who else would it be?

129
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,499
I genuinely don't know, ma'am.

130
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Just "I don't know"?

131
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:44,710
Is that the only answer

132
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:46,186
you can give me, Dech?

133
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,983
Because, truthfully, I have no idea.

134
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:49,599
What more can I say?

135
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,014
Is he telling the truth or just lying?

136
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,264
I've disclosed everything truthfully.

137
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:10,178
Ultimately, it's your decision

138
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:11,771
whether to accept it.

139
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:40,754
What are you planning to do?

140
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:46,344
I'll notify the authorities.

141
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:52,940
Regardless of my feelings for you,

142
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,760
regardless of my desire to trust you,

143
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:58,213
it doesn't change the fact that

144
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:01,883
you administered poison to the viscount

145
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:03,375
and caused Phoem's death,

146
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:05,556
correct?

147
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:18,743
I've expressed that

148
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:23,430
my life is yours.

149
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:27,954
If facing imprisonment

150
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:30,196
brings you solace,

151
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:35,758
then let it be so.

152
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:42,289
Ms. Malai...

153
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,430
Even if you perceive

154
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:50,508
my actions as wrong or malevolent,

155
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:52,734
understand that everything I did

156
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:55,914
stemmed from my love for you.

157
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:51,649
Please forgive me, my lord.

158
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,768
People's sorrows are like rain.

159
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:54,299
They come and they go.

160
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:56,661
Whatever troubles your heart now,

161
00:14:56,903 --> 00:14:59,559
I believe it will pass soon.

162
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:01,987
Have you ever heard that

163
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:04,174
the skies after the rain

164
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:05,728
are always beautiful?

165
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:35,424
Umm, well,

166
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:37,846
there's pollen stuck on you.

167
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:40,354
It's alright, Malai.

168
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,932
Your handkerchief is clean,

169
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,393
it shouldn't be dirtied by me.

170
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,002
Please take it,

171
00:15:46,018 --> 00:15:47,135
consider it a return gift

172
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,360

221

He was the one who begged

222

the viscount not to harm me.

he kept it a secret from me.

Dech probably didn't want

234
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,976
to discover what happened.

235
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:48,921
If Dech killed everyone,

236
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:51,169
as both of us understand,

237
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:55,677
nowhere is safe, Bu-nga.

238
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:17,161

the news this morning.

241
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,059
They discovered Chaem's body

242
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:22,301
by the roadside.

243
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,550
If not you, then who else?

244
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:31,160
You're the sole individual here

245
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:32,753
with motive to remove me!

246
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:34,129
I see,

247
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,339
are you planning to hoard

248
00:20:35,363 --> 00:20:36,441
all the assets to cater to

249
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:38,199
your numerous mistresses, perhaps?

250
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:39,191
We shall see.

251
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:40,271
I will unveil your

252
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:41,522
true nature to everyone,

253
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:43,819
so they know you're not a good person.

Ms. Ramphoei has died, ma'am.

255
00:20:58,116 --> 00:20:59,678
Currently, Dech has been taken

256
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:00,906
to the police station.

257
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:02,522
Why was Dech arrested?

258
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,906
This morning,

259
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:06,132
someone discovered Ms. Ramphoei's body.

260
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:07,539
She was stabbed to death.

261
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,554
Now, Dech is the prime suspect.

262
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,670
The viscount has passed away!

263
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:19,350
The viscount has passed away!

264
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:34,234
Dech,

265
00:21:34,624 --> 00:21:36,061
you didn't kill him, right?

266
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:40,649
Uan,

267
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,908
what are you saying?

268
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,374
I witnessed Dech exiting

269
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:46,187
the viscount's chambers last night.

270
00:22:00,977 --> 00:22:02,524
Why did you kill him?

271
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:04,227
I didn't kill the viscount.

272
00:22:04,252 --> 00:22:06,236
If it wasn't you, who else would it be?

273
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,473
I'll notify the authorities.

274
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,610

00:22:24,837 --> 00:22:26,087
Even if you perceive

276
00:22:26,322 --> 00:22:28,134
my actions as wrong or malevolent,

277
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,367
understand that everything I did

278
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,609
stemmed from my love for you.

Ms. Malai, where were you

282
00:25:08,327 --> 00:25:10,156
intending to go so early in the morning?

283
00:25:13,196 --> 00:25:14,500
I had planned to attend to

284
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:15,836
some matters in town.

285
00:25:15,868 --> 00:25:17,453
If you so desire, I can take care

286
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:18,797
of those tasks for you.

287
00:25:20,063 --> 00:25:21,375
Thank you so much.

288
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:23,516
After I'm done with errands,

289
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:25,172
I thought I'd go buy

290
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,937
some things for Bu-nga.

291
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,680
I'd rather buy women's things myself.

292
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:32,102
Have breakfast first, Ms. Malai.

293
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,937
I've made it fresh and hot

294

so you won't have to go out to eat.

295
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:37,359
Indeed, Ms. Malai.

296
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:39,367
Uan went to the trouble of

297
00:25:39,383 --> 00:25:40,734
waking up early to make it,

298
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,321
it won't take too long.

299
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:44,708
Alright then.

300
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:02,338

Yes.

373
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,038
Do not interfere!

374
00:43:19,921 --> 00:43:20,921
Kam!

375
00:43:22,093 --> 00:43:23,453
- Let's go!
- Kam!

376
00:43:23,922 --> 00:43:24,922
Kam.

377
00:43:24,945 --> 00:43:25,985
Let us hurry!

378
00:43:27,836 --> 00:43:29,226
Kam, Uan!

379
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,484
Kam, Uan!

380
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:34,679
Uan!

381
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:37,621
What is wrong with you two?

382
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,890
Did you abandon the house

383
00:43:38,906 --> 00:43:40,069
to save yourselves?

384
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:43,069
Uan!

385
00:43:45,047 --> 00:43:46,047
Ms. Bu-nga!

386
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:47,711
Ms. Malai!

387
00:43:49,086 --> 00:43:50,460
The things that happened

388
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,468
were because of you.

389
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:55,874
I have no choice but to kill you

390
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,944
so won't tell others.

391
00:44:16,992 --> 00:44:18,280
Goodbye,

392
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:20,117
Ms. Malai.

393
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,819
Ms. Malai showed me

394
00:45:36,828 --> 00:45:38,508
everything that happened.

395
00:45:38,742 --> 00:45:39,859
She insists that you were

396
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:41,023
the one who harmed her.

397
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,319
You betrayed me!

398
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:43,953
Whoa!

399
00:45:45,273 --> 00:45:46,273
