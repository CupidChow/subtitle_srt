- Hey!
- My lord!

19
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:01,156
Saeng!

20
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,036
It was your plan all along.

21
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,349
You set me up!

22
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:05,955
The mastermind behind it all,

23
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:07,150
is the Viscount!

24
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,284
Not me!

25
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:12,289
Why bother when they don't give a damn?

26
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:13,580
Better to exact revenge

27
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,593
and revel in his lavish inheritance!

28
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:33,796
Ms. Ramphoei!

29
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:35,006
What is it, Chaem?

30
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:36,177
It's terrible.

31
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,156
What's wrong? Is it the Viscount?

32
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:41,030
How did you know

33
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:42,930
that this is about my lord?

34
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:46,430
Isn't he the most important person

35
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:47,295
in the estate?

36
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:49,886
Stop blabbering and spit it out.

37
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,019
My Lord is in trouble.

38
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:53,572
Take me to him.

39
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,620
Yes, ma'am.

40
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,220
This way.

41
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:14,860
Chaem said that you were in trouble.

42
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:17,619
Just a trivial matter.

43
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:19,315
Why the need to report it

44
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,335
to your mistress?

45
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,402
So, what's the matter, my lord?

46
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:27,291
His shoelace broke before entering,

47
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:29,077
then he tripped and sprained his ankle.

48
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:30,678
It's nothing serious.

49
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:39,486
Chaem!

50
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:41,013
What were you thinking?

51
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:42,625
This is utter nonsense!

52
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:43,905
He's fine.

53
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:46,699
Apologies, ma'am.

54
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:48,074
What?

55
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,907
Must I bleed

56
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:51,373
for you to be satisfied?

57
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,930
No need to worry.

58
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:54,554
I'm not so weak that I'd perish

59
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:56,960
for you to indulge in my inheritance.

60
00:03:59,007 --> 00:03:59,866
Dech.

61
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,708
Carry my bag into the office.

62
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:03,183
Yes, my lord.

63
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:04,862
Will you be alright, my lord?

64
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,264
Please don't take it to heart, ma'am.

65
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:27,173
He must be feeling irritated

66
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:28,278
by his injury.

67
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:24,713
Damn it.

68
00:06:28,318 --> 00:06:29,691
You've treated me well.

69
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,246
I'll visit you more often.

70
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:34,496
Please do, sir.

71
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:38,062
Sir, you're so kind to me.

72
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:40,687
It's my happiness and pleasure

73
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:42,781
to be able to serve you.

74
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:44,871
Be consistent about it,

75
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:48,471
and I'll get you out of here.

76
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:52,404
You're not joking?

77
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,154
If you do,

78
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:57,825
I'll do anything you ask of me.

79
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:00,685
Even in the afterlife,
I shall serve you, sir.

80
00:07:05,197 --> 00:07:06,197
I'm leaving.

81
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:17,263
I love you, my lord.

82
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:22,166
I really can't do it.

You mean Ms. Ramphoei?

Who else would it be?
Isn't she the one you serve?

90
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:09,712
I apologize, my lord.

91
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:12,721
Ms. Ramphoei went out this evening.

92
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:14,657
She might be at the musical or

93
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:16,777
having a meal at the shopping district.

94
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,178
Dech.

95
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,550
Dech!

96
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:58,418
You damn Ramphoei.

97
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:33,628
You're here.

98
00:09:34,395 --> 00:09:35,395
You coward.

99
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:39,913
You couldn't do such an easy task?

100
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,015
You two. Don't get too cocky now.

101
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:45,216
You think I'm oblivious to your plan?

102
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:47,444
I know you'll get rid of me

103
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:49,242
after I kill the Viscount.

104
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,557
I may be drunk,

105
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:55,265
but I'm not stupid.

106
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:57,974
Listen well, both of you.

107
00:09:58,134 --> 00:09:59,342
Don't you dare

108
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:01,502
plot against the Viscount again.

109
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,243
What will you do?

110
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,274
If you try to harm him,

111
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:10,381
I...

112
00:10:10,574 --> 00:10:12,494
I will be the one protecting him.

113
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,580
One day,

114
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:17,747
he'll know that I'm more loyal to him.

115
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:19,102
Much more than you!

116
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:20,362
and Dech!

117
00:10:25,784 --> 00:10:27,023
Don't do it, Phoem!

118
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:28,791
I'll fight to the death.

119
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,870
Try it.

120
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:36,856
Your knife against my ax.

121
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:39,270
Who will meet their end first?

122
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:44,256
Saeng,

123
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:46,522
you think you can get out of this

124
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:47,555
alive?

125
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:51,453
Don't know, don't care.

126
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:53,460
But I know that if I report you and

127
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:56,324
your whereabouts to the officials,

128
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:59,438
you'll be no better than the street dogs!

129
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,059
Wait, Phoem!

130
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:06,460
Are you going against me, Saeng?

131
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,441
You stupid, brainless mongrel.

132
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:11,991
- If you...
- Oh, shut up!

133
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:15,771
Don't try to pit me against my lord!

134
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:19,357
Your tricks won't work on me anymore.

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,725
You better be careful.

136
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:25,790
If I expose you

137
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,045
for your debaucheries.

138
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:31,109
You're the one he'll send packing!

139
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,003
Saeng! You low life!

140
00:11:37,845 --> 00:11:38,845
Nah.

141
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,740
Don't even try.

142
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:15,855
Dech.

143
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:21,434
What is that gun for, my lord?

144
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:23,280
Did something happen?

145
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:25,567
Was there a burglar, my lord?

146
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,767
Where did you go, Dech?

147
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:29,367
You weren't in your room.

148
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:30,955
Mai wasn't feeling well,

149
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:32,342
so I asked Dech

150
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:33,942
to take him to the pharmacy.

151
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,094
Kam feared they might be closed.

152
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:38,103
So I talked to the owner for him

153
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:39,530
and got the medications.

154
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:44,274
What about Ramphoei?

155
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:45,714
Does anyone see her?

156
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,320
I heard you mention my name.

157
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:52,070
Did you miss me, my lord?

158
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,634
Where were you when it's this dark?

159
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:57,239
Forgot you had a home?

160
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:00,080
Home was dull,

161
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:01,000
so I decided

162
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:02,287
to take a stroll at the fair.

163
00:13:03,193 --> 00:13:04,193
A fair?

164
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:05,923
There's no fair today.

165
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:07,836
There's one near the market.

166
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:14,552
As for why I wasn't home.

167
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:15,732
There's nothing to do

168
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:17,258
when my husband isn't interested.

169
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,790
Or perhaps

170
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:20,937
you're seeking some attention tonight?

171
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,597
I'll pay you a visit, my lord.

172
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:24,724
Shameless!

173
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:34,068
Please be careful.

174
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,227
I don't know where you went

175
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:37,794
and I won't always

176
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:38,873
be there to save you.

177
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:40,884
Thanks.

178
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,553
Next time, I'll be careful.

179
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,060
Kam.

180
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:47,175
If you're not smart, just shut it.

181
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:49,412
Because if I'm in trouble,

182
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,805
I'm not going down without you.

183
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,133
Got it?

184
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:54,729
I'm sorry, ma'am.

185
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:00,211
Hey.

186
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:02,246
Stop worrying about her

187
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:03,832
and look after yourself.

188
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:05,445
I don't know how long

189
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:06,631
I can keep this a secret.

190
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,519
Thanks, man.

191
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,013
Aren't you wicked, Dech?

192
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,593
I didn't expect someone

193
00:14:22,618 --> 00:14:24,620
as naive as you to be embezzling.

00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:36,347
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

196
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:37,848
You're lucky.

197
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:40,109
I saw him on his way to your room,

198
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:42,462
so I got to you first.

199
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:43,933
It could've been bad.

200
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:46,960
He even had a gun ready in his hand!

201
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:51,273
From now on, I'll be more careful.

202
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:53,321
Lately,

203
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:55,711
I know that you miss her,

204
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:57,437
but aren't your visits too frequent?

205
00:14:58,118 --> 00:14:59,684
If the Viscount catches you,

206
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:02,766
our plan will go down the drain.

207
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,954
Thanks for the warning,

208
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:10,019
my man.

209
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:12,087
Sure.

210
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:13,919
Think long and hard.

211
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:42,850
At first, I didn't
think much about it.

212
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,136
But then I realized

213
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,747
you thought that I had

214
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,536
sneaked out with Ms. Ramphoei

215
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,510
and was going to shoot me dead.

216
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:58,905
I'm sorry, Dech.

217
00:15:59,623 --> 00:16:00,623
From now on,

218
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:02,896
I won't be so hasty.

219
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:05,666
Please forgive me, Dech.

220
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:08,323
Please.

221
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:13,186
Alright, my lord.

222
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:20,301
If you've truly forgiven me,

223
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:21,468
Can I...

224
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:23,381
stay the night here?

225
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:27,282
All done, my lord.

226
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:29,445
Don't you have to

227
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,070
meet the Duke today?

228
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:33,275
Oh, you're right.

229
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:35,454
Thanks for reminding me.

230
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:39,162
Go get dressed, my lord.

231
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:41,035
I'll meet you in the front yard.

232
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:43,023
I'll go fetch your bag for you.

233
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:45,240
Thanks.

234
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:47,241
Of course.

235
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:09,509
My lord!

236
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,772
What's the matter, Ms. Ramphoei?

237
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,753
Looks like he isn't here.

238
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:19,446
I just need some extra money.

239
00:18:19,714 --> 00:18:21,380
I'll come again in the evening.

240
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,407
Hold on, Ms. Ramphoei.

241
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:26,512
What?

242
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:27,885
Are you giving me money?

243
00:19:00,745 --> 00:19:02,052
Aren't you wicked, Dech?

244
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:03,565
I didn't expect someone

245
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,884
as naive as you to be embezzling.

246
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:08,303
That's not it.

247
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:10,178
This is from the farmers

248
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:11,999
who couldn't pay rent with money,

249
00:19:12,023 --> 00:19:13,817
so they paid with fruits.

250
00:19:15,802 --> 00:19:16,802
And?

251
00:19:17,962 --> 00:19:19,994
The Viscount let me handle it.

252
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:22,187
So I sold their produce.

253
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:23,896
This is what I got.

254
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,632
Not bad.

255
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,529
You're smarter than I thought.

256
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:30,977
Even without his salary,

257
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,857
with all the lands the Viscount owns,

258
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:34,645
I believe

259
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,993
I can make the most out of it,

260
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,420
to the point where

261
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,223
we can all live comfortably.

262
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,056
I'll take it from here.

263
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:43,598
You should go back.

264
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,583
You care so much for your apprearance.

265
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:42,762
If you could see your current state,

266
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,182
you'd be screaming in horror.

267
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:52,253
Bu-nga,

268
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,013
do you still remember?

269
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,227
The first time we met,

270
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:04,982
You taught me about bravery,

271
00:22:07,654 --> 00:22:09,620
and taught me about strength.

272
00:22:35,997 --> 00:22:37,170
Excuse me.

273
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:39,037
What did you say? Speak louder.

274
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:41,661
Excuse me.

275
00:22:41,996 --> 00:22:43,435
Did you hear anything?

276
00:22:44,308 --> 00:22:45,308
Yeah,

277
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:46,596
but not clearly.

278
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,396
Sounds like a fly buzzing in my ears.

279
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:50,936
Very annoying.

280
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,572
I beg to differ.

281
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:54,576
Doesn't it sound more like

282
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:56,570
that of an unwanted bastard?

283
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:03,974
What a klutz,

284
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:05,660
tripping over so randomly.

285
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,106
Be more careful, okay?

286
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:09,027
I've never wronged any of you.

287
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:11,613
Why are you bullying me?

288
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:13,326
If you haven't notice,

289
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:14,487
then listen well.

290
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,065
Her Highness favors you

291
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,938
because of your flattery and tricks,

292
00:23:18,052 --> 00:23:19,105
while we suffer from

293
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:20,668
being compared to you.

294
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,062
I've heard that

295
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,436
bastards like you

296
00:23:23,572 --> 00:23:26,345
can't survive outside the palace,

297
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:28,429
so you're always damn eager to please.

298
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,017
You're not even worthy

299
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:31,710
to work in the same palace as us.

300
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,412
As for us,

301
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:35,429
we don't want to be friends with you.

302
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,881
If Her Highness compares us again,

303
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:39,548
we'll beat your ass.

304
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:46,488
Let's go.

305
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:05,706
Just take it, will you?

306
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,202
I'm Bu-nga.

307
00:24:14,682 --> 00:24:16,799
Daughter of the Eastern Trade Minister.

308
00:24:18,093 --> 00:24:19,167
I'm Malai.

309
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,027
I saw you being bullied.

310
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:25,054
So I came over to check on you.

311
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:26,814
Look at you

312
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:29,022
bawling your pretty eyes out.

313
00:24:30,664 --> 00:24:31,664
I don't get it.

314
00:24:31,945 --> 00:24:33,023
Why did you just

315
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:35,149
let them walk all over you like that?

316
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:36,533
It's nothing.

317
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:39,626
They come from noble lineage,

318
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:42,245
while I,

319
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,184
am just a bastard.

320
00:24:44,537 --> 00:24:45,736
Mother died at my birth.

321
00:24:46,843 --> 00:24:48,323
Father ignores me,

322
00:24:49,103 --> 00:24:50,489
brother rejects me.

323
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,548
No one to support me.

324
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,119
It's not about lineage.

325
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,446
It's about being brave.

326
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,020
If you run once,

327
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:01,306
you'll always be running.

328
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:08,527
Follow me.

329
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:10,608
I'll show you something good.

330
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,201
Then why are you taking my lowly self

331
00:25:15,226 --> 00:25:16,168
as your mistress?

332
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:20,438
Since we're husband and wife,

333
00:25:20,463 --> 00:25:23,219
we should confide in each other, right?

334
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,734
If you weren't so close with Dech,

335
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,265
you'd have been kicked out long ago!

00:25:34,673 --> 00:25:39,569
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

338
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:40,694
I wonder,

339
00:25:40,712 --> 00:25:42,331
has she already jumped off the bridge?

340
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,319
No way.

341
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:45,686
She's such a coward.

342
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:48,285
She's probably bawling her eyes out.

343
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:50,165
- Agreed.
- Definitely.

344
00:25:53,037 --> 00:25:53,918
Having fun?

345
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:00,061
Here she is,

346
00:26:00,202 --> 00:26:01,481
the bastard child.

347
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,260
So you called for help?

348
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,060
Oh yeah, we're having so much fun.

349
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,758
Are you looking for trouble too?

350
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:08,792
Actually,

351
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,903
I think she's here to apologize.

352
00:26:12,995 --> 00:26:14,462
Let's go, Bu-nga.

353
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:15,782
You shouldn't do this.

354
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,756
Malai, stay there and watch.

355
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,735
I'm not here to apologize.

356
00:26:21,115 --> 00:26:23,010
I'm making the three of you

357
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:24,435
apologize to Malai.

358
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:28,318
It's one against three,

359
00:26:28,332 --> 00:26:29,758
are you crazy?

360
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:31,711
Malai won't be able to assist you.

361
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:34,383
Don't get ahead of yourself, alright?

362
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:37,551
Oh, you have no idea.

363
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:40,742
- What's that?
- Did you hear that? I...

364
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:44,372
- Crazy bit-
- Ah!

365
00:26:49,612 --> 00:26:51,705
You said bullying the weak is fun,

366
00:26:51,732 --> 00:26:53,006
so I want to try it too!

367
00:26:53,068 --> 00:26:54,895
- Here!
- Ah! No, don't!

368
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:57,634
Crazy bitch! You're crazy!

369
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:07,062
Wasn't that 'fun'?

370
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:08,930
- Or do you want more, huh?
- You!

371
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,525
Crazy bitch!

372
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:41,772
You harlot!

373
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:44,311
Ms. Bu-nga!

374
00:27:44,972 --> 00:27:46,965
Ms. Bu-nga, that's enough!

375
00:27:49,728 --> 00:27:51,881
Just a taste of what will happen.

376
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,147
If you dare to bully Malai again,

377
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,460
you'll all end up in the hospital.

378
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,393
You hear me?

379
00:27:58,775 --> 00:28:00,300
- Yes, yes!
- We get it!

380
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:02,427
Don't even think about tattling on me.

381
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:03,973
I'm pretty sure

382
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,381
my family has far more influence

383
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:06,910
than all three of yours combined!

384
00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:08,750
Get out of my sight!

385
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:10,031
Alright, alright!

386
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:11,611
Go!

387
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,599
This looks painful, Bu-nga.

388
00:28:28,738 --> 00:28:29,858
Just a little.

389
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:34,114
I'm sorry

390
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:38,040
for being the reason you got involved.

391
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:39,642
Ugh!

392
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:41,988
You should take the veil, Malai.

393
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:44,028
Enough with the apologies.

394
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:45,804
Aren't you sick of it?

395
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:47,134
I'm so-

396
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,930
What are you laughing about?

397
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:55,669
You, of course!

398
00:28:56,386 --> 00:28:58,386
If you don't stop apologizing,

399
00:28:58,674 --> 00:29:00,640
I'll starting calling you 'Ms. Sorry'!

400
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:04,435
Stop teasing me.

401
00:29:05,235 --> 00:29:06,595
You finally smile.

402
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:08,493
Listen to me, Malai.

403
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:11,504
Everyone's got two hands and two feet.

404
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:13,091
If they hurt us,

405
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:15,452
we can always hit them right back.

406
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,680
We've only got one life,

407
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:19,239
so do whatever you want

408
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,066
and live with no regrets.

409
00:29:24,227 --> 00:29:25,733
I'm so grateful, Bu-nga.

410
00:29:27,543 --> 00:29:29,663
I'll strive to be braver.

411
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:32,424
I'd be content with just

412
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:34,238
a fraction of your bravery, Bu-nga.

413
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,848
Foreigners call this 'shaking hands'.

414
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,721
It's way of greeting,

415
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,726
also used to express agreement

416
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:47,269
or promise between parties.

417
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,150
It's a promise, then.

418
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:15,512
Now, I'm standing up for myself.

419
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:21,339
You've got to fight, too.

420
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:32,267
Recover quickly, my dear friend.

421
00:31:44,142 --> 00:31:46,075
Did you miss me, Ms. Malai?

422
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:48,742
Well...

423
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,675
What should I say?

424
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,009
You were gone for days.

425
00:31:55,127 --> 00:31:56,361
Wouldn't be surprised if you

426
00:31:56,386 --> 00:31:57,992
were merry with someone else.

427
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:07,948
How could that be possible

428
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:10,032
when my heart

429
00:32:10,824 --> 00:32:11,912
belongs entirely to you?

430
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,031
It belongs to the beauty

431
00:32:16,315 --> 00:32:18,648
who stands before me right now.

432
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,379
You're becoming melodramatic.

433
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:25,725
It's like we're in some sort of play.

434
00:32:27,465 --> 00:32:29,070
Does that please you, Ms. Malai?

435
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:52,716
Is something bothering you?

436
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:57,257
Are you not happy,

437
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,408
even though I am here?

438
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:01,443
It's not like that.

439
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,330
I...

440
00:33:05,142 --> 00:33:07,349
I'm very happy I get to see you, Dech.

441
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:12,523
I just wonder

442
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,397
how much longer we have to keep

443
00:33:15,797 --> 00:33:17,507
our meetings a secret from everyone?

444
00:33:19,256 --> 00:33:21,056
Do you trust me, Ms. Malai?

445
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:30,945
I do.

446
00:33:31,992 --> 00:33:33,227
I have more faith in you

447
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:36,172
than in anyone else in this world.

448
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:37,808
Have patience.

449
00:33:39,925 --> 00:33:41,045
I promise you that

450
00:33:42,243 --> 00:33:44,792
we'll soon be together openly,

451
00:33:46,187 --> 00:33:47,299
without any harassment

452
00:33:47,728 --> 00:33:50,103
from the Viscount or Ms. Ramphoei.

453
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:53,009
I don't know when it will come true

454
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,884
or what...

455
00:33:55,748 --> 00:33:57,002
your plans may be.

456
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,131
But I...

457
00:34:01,402 --> 00:34:02,442
I'm confident

458
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:04,645
I'm confident that you'll...

459
00:34:05,364 --> 00:34:06,964
you'll keep your word

460
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:11,123
and fulfill your promise to me.

461
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:16,190
Thank you so much, Ms. Malai.

462
00:35:16,749 --> 00:35:18,370
Have you no shame, my lord?

463
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:19,927
Continuing to visit a man

464
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:21,024
who doesn't love you.

465
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,950
You've been talking too much lately.

466
00:35:25,305 --> 00:35:26,305
Just a servant,

467
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:27,464
know your place!

468
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,196
Then why are you taking my lowly self

469
00:35:35,221 --> 00:35:36,163
as your mistress?

470
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:40,454
Since we're husband and wife,

471
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:43,235
we should confide in each other, right?

472
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,756
If you weren't so close with Dech,

473
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:48,255
you'd have been kicked out long ago!

474
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:52,859
My lord, my dear.

475
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,345
Do you really

476
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:57,103
have the heart to shun me?

477
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,012
What if I end up with a child?

478
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,074
What will happen to it, my lord?

479
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:03,452
Ew!

480
00:36:05,826 --> 00:36:07,655
Even wild beasts nurture their young,

481
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,845
is your heart colder than stone,

482
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:12,164
unmoving for your own kin?

483
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:13,484
Fueang.

484
00:36:30,587 --> 00:36:32,454
Has your child taken this poison?

485
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:33,435
No!

486
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,893
What abomination is in that vial?!

487
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:45,275
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

488
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:50,283
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

489
00:36:54,823 --> 00:36:55,823
You damn Ramphoei!

490
00:36:57,768 --> 00:36:58,768
My lord!

491
00:36:58,773 --> 00:37:00,178
Must you be so loud?

492
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:01,922
My child might wake up.

493
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:03,531
Do you know how hard it is

494
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:04,778
to coax a child to sleep?

495
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Enough nonsense!

496
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:07,934
Is Dech in your room?

497
00:37:08,421 --> 00:37:09,403
Didn't I make it clear

498
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:10,793
to send the child directly

499
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:11,949
if Dech wishes to see it?

500
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:13,663
Dech isn't in my room, my lord.

501
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:15,542
As I said, the child is sleeping.

502
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:16,640
What if it wakes up?

503
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,517
You wish to hear the screaming again?

504
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:23,066
Out of my way.

505
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:25,202
Where else would he be?

506
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:26,686
I don't know!

507
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,343
If jealousy consumes you so,

508
00:37:28,368 --> 00:37:29,702
the just chain him up!

509
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,628
Don't let him roam freely,

510
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:34,268
chasing after him like a mother hen!

511
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:36,713
Haven't I warned you

512
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:38,468
to keep your distance?

513
00:37:42,277 --> 00:37:43,298
Don't you get it?

514
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:45,195
I already said he's not here!

515
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:46,381
You liar!

516
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:49,862
- No! No! No!
- Out of my way! You harlot!

517
00:37:49,979 --> 00:37:51,099
- No! I won't!
- Ramphoei!

518
00:37:51,414 --> 00:37:52,440
Listen to me!

519
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:53,472
You damn Ramphoei!

520
00:37:53,477 --> 00:37:54,477
- Ah!
- My lord.

521
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,208
What's the matter?

522
00:38:01,132 --> 00:38:02,132
See?

523
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:03,796
I told you he's not in my room!

524
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,351
Yet you won't believe me?

525
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:06,681
Where were you?

526
00:38:06,696 --> 00:38:07,879
I look for you everywhere.

527
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,732
I've been in the office since dawn,

528
00:38:09,946 --> 00:38:12,619
preparing today's documents

529
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:14,219
as you've ordered me to, my lord.

530
00:38:16,095 --> 00:38:17,463
Your forgetfulness led to this,

531
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:18,851
yet you lash out at everyone.

532
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,309
Some saint, you are.

533
00:38:28,595 --> 00:38:30,315
And where's my apology?

534
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,820
I regret becoming his mistress.

535
00:38:50,347 --> 00:38:51,562
All is in order.

536
00:38:53,362 --> 00:38:54,854
As expected from someone I trust.

537
00:38:56,456 --> 00:38:57,456
I'm honored, my lord.

538
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:07,819
Can you comprehend

539
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,878
the extent of joy I derive

540
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:11,689
from being with you daily.

541
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:17,018
Of course, my lord.

542
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,107
Ah.

543
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,863
I should go, or I shall be late.

544
00:39:52,445 --> 00:39:53,445
You damn Dech!

545
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:55,683
You almost killed my child!

546
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,030
Stop it, Kam!

547
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,170
Let go!

548
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:06,064
Here,

549
00:40:06,382 --> 00:40:07,382
your medicine.

550
00:40:12,591 --> 00:40:14,458
Has your child taken this poison?

551
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:15,550
No!

552
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:18,432
Luckily, I remembered what you said,

553
00:40:18,734 --> 00:40:21,026
or my child would've been paralyzed!

554
00:40:21,823 --> 00:40:22,823
My goodness!

555
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:25,493
What abomination is in that vial?

556
00:40:32,634 --> 00:40:33,634
Here it is.

557
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:35,649
It's extremely powerful.

558
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:38,836
What is it?

559
00:40:39,252 --> 00:40:41,452
Poison. My special concoction.

560
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:43,324
The effect is immediate.

561
00:40:43,638 --> 00:40:44,571
If you

562
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:45,974
coat your arrow with it,

563
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:47,392
even an elephant shall fall,

564
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,066
let alone a mere tiger.

565
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,449
This poison

566
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:53,162
isn't just for hunting games.

567
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:55,244
Whooever ingests the poison

568
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,103
shall suffer from total paralysis.

569
00:40:58,871 --> 00:40:59,871
My goodness!

570
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:03,308
My child is blessed.

571
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,125
I'm truly sorry, both of you.

572
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:08,680
It wasn't my intention.

573
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:09,887
Next time,

574
00:41:09,895 --> 00:41:11,421
I must hide it more discreetly.

575
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,371
You'd better do it, or else!

576
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:16,486
Again, I'm sorry for what happened.

577
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:18,493
You took the correct medicine,

578
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,304
didn't you?

579
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:20,527
Of course.

580
00:41:22,456 --> 00:41:23,748
My child is doing fine.

581
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:30,398
Ramphoei took the bait.

582
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:33,493
She'll exact her revenge.

583
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:36,693
What a brilliant plan.

584
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:41,594
You'll see, our freedom is imminent.

585
00:45:01,067 --> 00:45:02,508
There is no such thing as an oath!

586
00:45:02,764 --> 00:45:03,764
Burn it all!

587
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,123
So what really happened, Dech?

588
00:45:08,381 --> 00:45:09,093
I reckon

589
00:45:09,095 --> 00:45:10,625
he fell down the stairs last night.

590
00:45:11,148 --> 00:45:13,111
I found him at dawn.
