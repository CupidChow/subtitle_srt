00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:01,429
I refuse.

20
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:02,835
If you're going to shoot,

21
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,725
shoot me along with Ms. Malai.

22
00:02:04,742 --> 00:02:05,742
No!

23
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:09,507
How rowdy.

24
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:11,339
Hello, Father.

25
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:17,624
I didn't do anything wrong!

26
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:19,453
Why must you care about what

27
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,514
those people are spouting

28
00:02:22,437 --> 00:02:23,850
when it's not the truth?

29
00:02:25,593 --> 00:02:26,921
Rerai!

30
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:34,008
Let's go.

31
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:35,071
Hurry up, go!

32
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:36,219
Hey!

33
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:42,656
Robbers! Someone call the police!

34
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:44,539
Robbers!

35
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:48,656
Elder monk!

36
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,312
Elder monk!

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Whoa!

38
00:02:55,336 --> 00:02:57,468
Do you wish to know who killed me?

39
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:03,351
We've returned to

40
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:05,056
my past once again, Mai.

41
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,320
Viscount Wisan has finally

42
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:09,025
gotten what he desired,

43
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,945
(1920 CE)

44
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:11,093
(1920 CE)
but who would have anticipated

45
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:11,695
(1920 CE)

46
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:13,914
(1920 CE)
the horrors he did

47
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:14,820
(1920 CE)

48
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:17,078
(1920 CE)
in exchange for it?

49
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:31,046
Dech!

50
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:32,031
Dech.

51
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:33,874
Please step aside, I beg you.

52
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:34,890
I refuse.

53
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,296
If you're going to shoot,

54
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:38,186
shoot me along with Ms. Malai.

55
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:39,203
No!

56
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,710
Viscount Wisan wants you back!

57
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:44,539
Otherwise, my child will die!

58
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:47,734
Ms. Malai.

59
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:49,758
I'm sorry!

60
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:53,312
Dech!

61
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,241
Ms. Malai!

62
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:15,154
So, you've finally returned.

63
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:25,133
Did I have any other choice, my lord?

64
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:26,812
If you hadn't forgotten the oath

65
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:27,898
you swore to me under

66
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:29,024
the red cotton tree,

67
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:30,625
I wouldn't have had to do this.

68
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,992
And what about you, my lord?

69
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:35,078
Did you think

70
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:36,883
before you acted?

71
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:42,344
Ms. Malai is your primary wife,

72
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,844
the one you married with honor.

73
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,952
- And yet you still...
- Of course I thought.

74
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:49,156
Don't think I'm such a heartless scum

75
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:51,539
who doesn't know what's right or wrong.

76
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:53,031
I know I was wrong,

77
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:54,773
but I did it

78
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:57,254
because I love you, Dech.

79
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:07,539
I love you, Dech.

80
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:17,711
For you...

81
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:19,953
I would do anything.

82
00:05:21,993 --> 00:05:23,047
I would even die

83
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,765
if I had to lose you to someone else...

84
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:27,078
Even if it means killing

85
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:28,640
countless people, my lord?

86
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:50,868
I understand now

87
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:53,000
how much you love me.

88
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:55,461
Since no matter what I do,

89
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:57,883
you will never let me go.

90
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,883
Therefore...

91
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:05,378
forgive me, my lord.

92
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,159
Dech...

93
00:06:09,683 --> 00:06:11,018
I promise to

94
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,456
stay with you

95
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:16,550
until the end of time.

96
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:50,513
Dech.

97
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:52,489
Please stand up.

98
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:57,653
If you truly mean that,

99
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,512
then I will forget everything

100
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:00,575
that has happened.

101
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,051
Now I have wealth,

102
00:07:03,544 --> 00:07:04,676
a child,

103
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,590
and you by my side.

104
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:08,637
I need

105
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:11,199
nothing more in this life.

106
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:16,926
And what about Ms. Ramphoei?

107
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:19,638
Do no worry.

108
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,262
I will never let anyone bother you.

109
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:36,540
I love you a lot, Dech.

Thank you, my lord.

116
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:32,688
Aren't you going to count it?

117
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:38,648
I'm sure you wouldn't cheat me, my lord.

118
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,937
Clever.

119
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,969
I actually wanted you to count it

120
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,000
because I've doubled the reward.

121
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,164
And what about Malai's body?

122
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,453
I've buried her under the floorboards

123
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:58,789
of your residence in Hua Hin,

124
00:08:58,813 --> 00:08:59,961
locked the door,

125
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:01,406
and secured it tightly with chains.

126
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:02,539
I assure you, no one will

127
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:03,852
enter the house, my lord.

128
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,077
Very thorough.

129
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:07,923
If there's nothing else,

130
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:09,946
may I go see my child, please?

131
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:11,275
Wait.

132
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:14,251
Take this Chinese porcelain with you.

133
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:15,829
I intended for it to
be a gift for your child.

134
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:16,939
It is fine, my lord.

135
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:18,735
The money you've given me

136
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,205
is more than enough, my lord.

137
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,743
Take it.

138
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,814
Consider it my way of apologizing

139
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,454
for using your child as leverage.

140
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:26,970
And

141
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:28,502
currently,

142
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:31,064
where is my child, my lord?

143
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,853
This morning, I instructed Saeng

144
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:34,360
to return him to your quarters.

145
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:36,221
Yes, my lord.

146
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:51,812
My baby.

147
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,146
How is our child?

148
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:03,405
He is fine, dear.

149
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,333
But he must be so hungry.

150
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:07,044
He drank a lot.

151
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:10,130
Why did you buy that?

152
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:11,833
It must have been expensive.

153
00:10:14,724 --> 00:10:15,740
I wouldn't buy

154
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:17,810
something foolish like this.

155
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:19,216
Viscount Wisan gave it to us.

156
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:20,240
Let our child use it

157
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:21,427
as a chamber pot.

158
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:22,825
An item given by a scum,

159
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,294
if we use it to bathe our child,

160
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:25,638
it will only dirty him.

161
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,685
Watch what you say.

162
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,115
If it reaches his ears,

163
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,013
our family will face trouble.

164
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:34,448
Whatever resentment or hatred we have,

165
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:35,559
keep it in our hearts.

166
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:37,137
As servants,

167
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,637
what can we do against the Viscount?

168
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,342
My dear Ms. Malai...

169
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,130
your departure came too soon.

170
00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:57,662
I didn't want it to be like this either.

171
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:06,896
I'm sorry for getting you involved

172
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:08,448
in this ordeal that you
had to suffer through.

173
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,458
How did you come to know?

174
00:11:12,592 --> 00:11:14,083
Did the Viscount disclose it?

175
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:15,162
You alone possessed the

176
00:11:15,178 --> 00:11:16,872
knowledge of my whereabouts.

177
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:18,583
Considering your personality,

178
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:20,169
if you weren't almost killed,

179
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:21,872
you wouldn't have said anything.

180
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:27,770
Are you severely injured? Huh, Fueang?

181
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,903
It is despicable of the Viscount

182
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:33,989
to inflict harm upon

183
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:35,605
a defenseless woman.

184
00:11:41,443 --> 00:11:42,833
Endure it, Fueang.

185
00:11:44,116 --> 00:11:46,161
I will bring justice to all.

186
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:48,287
Dech.

187
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:51,833
What can you do

188
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,677
when our fate lies

189
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:57,106
in the Viscount's hands?

190
00:11:57,802 --> 00:11:59,341
Even in your escape,

191
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:02,075
he relentlessly pursued you.

192
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,677
We'll probably die in this house.

193
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,370
Don't worry too much.

194
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:16,033
I'll handle everything myself.

195
00:12:31,941 --> 00:12:33,808
Why is Dech still alive?

196
00:12:34,043 --> 00:12:36,434
I thought you would have
a traitor like him killed.

197
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,105
I will never harm Dech.

198
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:39,597
Mark my words!

200
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:51,158
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

201
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:03,127
You're truly a venomous snake.

202
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:05,026
I warned you before, didn't I?

203
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,783
Don't meddle with my people.

204
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,385
Your duty is to raise your child.

205
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,182
I just want to talk to

206
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:11,564
my child's father.

207
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:12,994
Is that too much to ask?

208
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:16,674
Oww!

209
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,354
Your duty to Dech ended

210
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:20,494
a long time ago.

211
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:22,237
Don't think about rekindling it.

212
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:25,473
And if I want to, what will you do?

213
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:27,385
Why, you little...

214
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:29,479
If you want to die and join Malai

215
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,105
in the next world, be my guest.

216
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:33,901
And don't assume

217
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,604
that the law can touch me.

218
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:38,151
I have both money and influence.

219
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,291
Prison

220
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:41,583
is reserved for the poor and curs!

221
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:43,307
Let go!

222
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,010
[?????]

223
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:51,846
If you consider yourself as my enemy,

224
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:53,651
it's not just you who will die.

225
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:54,854
Phoem, your brother,

226
00:13:54,878 --> 00:13:56,111
won't survive either.

227
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,604
Remember my words well!

228
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:20,286
Oh, Dech.

229
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:22,121
When did you came here?

230
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:23,762
I was just going to seek you.

231
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,629
A father naturally longs for his child.

232
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,113
So, you miss our child

233
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:32,355
yet flee with another woman?

234
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:48,336
Between enduring a lifetime

235
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:49,576
of servitude to the Viscount

236
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:50,992
and risking freedom,

237
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:54,227
I believe it's a gamble worth taking.

238
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:57,890
And what has it yielded?

239
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:01,273
It has revealed to me that everyone

240
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:03,164
within The House of The Dark Shadows

241
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,750
stands on the edge of a cliff.

242
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:07,132
Whenever someone displeases the Viscount

243
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,804
or the benefits aren't satisfactory,

244
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:10,273
he's ready

245
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:13,227
to eliminate them immediately.

246
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:18,359
Do you think I'm speaking the truth?

247
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:24,008
Why confide this in me?

248
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:26,007
I just want to know whether you

249
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,711
can actually endure this

250
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,452
kind of life indefinitely.

251
00:15:35,822 --> 00:15:37,118
And what do you want me to do?

252
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:39,157
I must depart now.

253
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,228
There are matters I must attend to.

254
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,196
He speaks the truth.

255
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:56,907
Either I wait for him to kill me

256
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,021
or I strike first and kill him.

257
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:12,858
Have you seen Dech?

258
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:13,866
No, my lord.

259
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:15,100
Wait, my lord,

260
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:16,514
why is Dech still alive?

261
00:16:16,897 --> 00:16:18,233
I thought you would order

262
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:19,537
to kill a traitor like him.

263
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,123
If Dech dies,

264
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:23,748
you would be satisfied, right?

265
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:28,447
Even if I truly think so, is it wrong?

266
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:30,104
I love you with all my heart,

267
00:16:30,135 --> 00:16:31,736
I naturally want you to belong

268
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:33,041
to me alone, my lord.

269
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:36,409
My lord.

270
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:44,940
Are you living uncomfortably here?

271
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:47,775
I provide you with more

272
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,455
comfort than other servants,

273
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,385
but don't get too arrogant

274
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:54,322
because I will never harm Dech.

275
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:55,656
Mark my words!

276
00:16:58,112 --> 00:16:59,455
Go wherever you want!

277
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,721
I do not wish to see your face, scram!

278
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,041
Yes, my lord.

279
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:23,448
Saeng.

280
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:27,166
Has the Viscount cast you out once more?

281
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:29,783
You should have perished

282
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,104
alongside that Malai.

283
00:17:31,128 --> 00:17:32,197
Returning here only serves

284
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:33,377
to vex me further.

285
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,416
Feeling envious?

286
00:17:36,885 --> 00:17:37,815
No matter how much

287
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:39,072
the viscount hates me,

288
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:40,893
he would never harm me.

289
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,705
Now that I'm confined here,

290
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,229
you can watch me enjoy my life

291
00:17:47,254 --> 00:17:48,980
within the House of The Dark Shadows.

292
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:56,127
The Viscount's affections are mine.

293
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:57,322
You are merely a vessel

294
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:58,697
for his emotional release.

295
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,018
Let go, Dech!

296
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,986
From now on, I shall not tolerate

297
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:11,752
your attempts to harm me alone.

298
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:13,697
Just you watch.

299
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:19,173
Dech!

300
00:18:31,755 --> 00:18:33,833
I am aware of your lingering anger,

301
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:36,231
but in time, it will dissipate,

302
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,248
trust me.

303
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:39,802
Presently,

304
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:41,316
my father's estate

305
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:42,489
lies under my control.

306
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:44,044
I pledge to

307
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,833
ensure your well-being and

308
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,747
provide you with a life of comfort

309
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:50,052
befitting the love I hold for you, Dech.

310
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:54,003
Did anyone suspect us?

311
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:55,346
No,

312
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:56,846
all appears to be well.

313
00:20:58,284 --> 00:20:59,324
And yourself?

314
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,502
Everything must go according to plan.

315
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:10,049
There's no need to end Ms. Malai's life.

316
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,400
We both know

317
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:14,119
she's still living.

318
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,260
You can present me to

319
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:19,479
the Viscount instead.

320
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:20,674
Once he's convinced,

321
00:21:21,838 --> 00:21:23,471
I'll aid you in rescuing Mai.

322
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:25,385
Together, we can escape

323
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,854
the Viscount's grasp.

324
00:21:29,697 --> 00:21:30,579
No!

325
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:33,259
The Viscount

326
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,055
will seek vengeance

327
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,760
and obliterate us all!

328
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:38,977
Ms. Malai,

329
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,173
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:45,689
Dech!

331
00:21:57,158 --> 00:21:58,220
I told you to let go!

332
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,261
Ms. Malai!

333
00:22:57,694 --> 00:22:59,069
Why didn't you kill me?

334
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:00,961
We shouldn't be adversaries.

335
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:04,589
I apologize, but...

336
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,670
I get that you did it for your child.

337
00:23:07,046 --> 00:23:08,374
I would have done the same.

338
00:23:09,812 --> 00:23:11,138
However, there's never been

339
00:23:11,163 --> 00:23:12,327
enmity between us.

340
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:13,791
Let me assist you.

341
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:20,819
So, what of my son's life?

342
00:23:20,844 --> 00:23:22,546
Should Ms. Malai and I escape,

343
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:24,194
your son will be in danger.

344
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:25,491
Ms. Malai and

345
00:23:25,516 --> 00:23:26,999
I don't want that to happen.

346
00:23:27,024 --> 00:23:28,672
Therefore, only one option remains.

347
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:29,952
You'll return with Kam and

348
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:31,311
tell him that I'm dead?

349
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:33,936
I will journey back to

350
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:35,452
the House of the Dark Shadows

351
00:23:35,477 --> 00:23:37,241
and convince him that I have returned

352
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:38,725
due to you getting killed by Kam.

353
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:41,085
This should halt the

354
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:42,319
Viscount's pursuit of you.

355
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:43,991
Then

356
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:45,460
I can reclaim my son, right?

357
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,280
How can you ensure the Viscount

358
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:48,811
won't retaliate against you?

359
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:51,741
There are no certainties,

360
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:53,225
but presently, this appears to be

361
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,249
our most viable course to aid Kam's son.

362
00:23:57,201 --> 00:23:58,884
In that case, I'll accompany you.

363
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:00,267
No, Ms. Malai.

364
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,533
Your return would jeopardize everyone,

365
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:06,119
the Viscount will not spare any lives.

366
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:08,275
Kam speaks the truth.

367
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,626
Ms. Malai please seek sanctuary

368
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:10,751
elsewhere while I return

369
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:12,001
the House of the Dark Shadows.

370
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:14,447
But I still don't know where,

371
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:16,783
and it isn't safe here anymore.

372
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,754
I've figured out where to hide.

373
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:26,605
A place the Viscount wouldn't suspect.

374
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,365
Help!

375
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:41,528
Are you going to tell me or not?

376
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:43,310
A guy named Saeng who hired me, my lord.

377
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:44,764
Saeng!

378

(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

379
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:57,990
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

380
00:25:04,163 --> 00:25:05,865
Dech!

381
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:16,792
I apologize, but...

382
00:25:16,843 --> 00:25:18,873
I get that you did it for your child.

383
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:20,577
I'll find a way to help your son.

384
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:24,771
I will journey back to

385
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:26,287
the House of the Dark Shadows

386
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:28,076
and convince him that I have returned

387
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:29,560
due to you getting killed by Kam.

388
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,293
Ms. Malai please seek sanctuary

389
00:25:31,318 --> 00:25:32,418
elsewhere while I return

390
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:33,668
the House of the Dark Shadows.

391
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:35,879
But I still don't know where.

392
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,803
I've figured out where to hide.

393
00:25:38,217 --> 00:25:40,654
A place the Viscount wouldn't suspect.

394
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,908
When do you propose to act?

395
00:25:54,363 --> 00:25:56,612
We need to proceed cautiously.

396
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:01,503
First, we must eliminate
Saeng from the picture

397
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:03,659
to sever the Viscount's support,

398
00:26:03,832 --> 00:26:05,886
for he is too devoted to the Viscount.

399
00:26:06,644 --> 00:26:07,644
True.

400
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,058
If Saeng catches wind of

401
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:10,542
our intentions against the Viscount,

402
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:11,965
he'll swiftly inform him.

403
00:26:12,425 --> 00:26:13,862
How will we deal with him?

404
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,315
I intend to leverage

405
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:18,573
Ms. Ramphoei to our advantage.

406
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:21,517
I've harbored suspicions for some time

407
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:22,987
that the two attempts

408
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,539
on Ms. Malai's life

409
00:26:24,691 --> 00:26:26,371
were orchestrated by her.

410
00:26:28,615 --> 00:26:30,232
Sometimes, individuals with

411
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,747
warped motives like hers

412
00:26:31,772 --> 00:26:33,841
can be manipulated to

413
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:36,647
eliminate the Viscount.

414
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:56,373
My lord, this portrait?

415
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:57,420
Keep it behind the house.

416
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:58,451
Yes, my lord.

417
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:17,383
It's nice that you come and go

418
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:19,078
to spend time with our child daily.

419
00:27:19,368 --> 00:27:21,383
It gives me a chance to be close to you.

420
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,914
Why do you find it nice, ma'am?

421
00:27:25,368 --> 00:27:27,351
In case someday your heart becomes soft

422
00:27:27,376 --> 00:27:29,203
and you desire another child.

423
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:30,828
I'm always ready, you know?

424
00:27:31,844 --> 00:27:33,625
Ramphoei, what are you doing?

425
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:40,940
What am I doing?

426
00:27:40,964 --> 00:27:42,503
Dech is simply visiting his child.

427
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:43,558
How is it wrong?

428
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:45,925
Shameless woman,

429
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,737
it's clear you're flirting with Dech.

430
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,198
You're well aware of who

431
00:27:50,223 --> 00:27:51,808
the child's father is, my lord.

432
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:54,769
There's no harm in showing affection

433
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:56,377
to my real husband.

434
00:27:59,332 --> 00:28:00,636
I decree that Dech will not visit

435
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:01,901
Ramphoei's quarters anymore.

436
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,573
And if I wish to see my child, my lord?

437
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:07,956
Then have a servant

438
00:28:07,972 --> 00:28:09,440
bring the child to you,

439
00:28:09,465 --> 00:28:10,558
so you don't have to enter

440
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:12,151
this woman's chambers alone.

441
00:28:12,894 --> 00:28:13,878
Yes, my lord.

442
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,243
Isn't that excessive, my lord?

443
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:25,314
When you neglect

444
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,673
your duties as a husband.

445
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:27,454
So, I...

446
00:28:27,478 --> 00:28:28,321
Come here!

447
00:28:28,346 --> 00:28:30,594
Oww! Let go, my lord!

448
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:33,228
- Where are you taking me, my lord?
- Come here!

449
00:28:33,284 --> 00:28:34,644
- Come with me now!
- My lord!

450
00:28:34,994 --> 00:28:36,838
- Come!
- Let go!

451
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:38,736
- Let go!
- Oh, I will!

452
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:42,853
How dare you strike me?

453
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,189
You think I don't dare? Take that!

454
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:46,455
Take that!

455
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,111
You damn viscount, you coward!

456
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:51,861
The nerve!

457
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:53,556
I've cautioned you repeatedly

458
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,955
against meddling with my Dech.

459
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:56,502
Should it occur again,

460
00:28:56,721 --> 00:28:58,401
I'll show no restraint.

461
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:00,502
Go!

462
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,044
It has revealed to me that everyone

463
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:15,935
within The House of The Dark Shadows

464
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:17,521
stands on the edge of a cliff.

465
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,903
Whenever someone displeases the Viscount

466
00:29:19,928 --> 00:29:21,575
or the benefits aren't satisfactory,

467
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,044
he's ready

468
00:29:23,444 --> 00:29:26,583
to eliminate them immediately.

469
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:30,685
Do you think I'm speaking the truth?

470
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:32,928
Why confide this in me?

471
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:34,778
I just want to know whether you

472
00:29:35,224 --> 00:29:37,396
can actually endure this

473
00:29:38,091 --> 00:29:39,457
kind of life indefinitely.

474
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,982
Looks like you and I can't

475
00:29:43,006 --> 00:29:44,598
coexist in this world anymore,

476
00:29:44,623 --> 00:29:45,794
you wretched Wisan!

477
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:23,120
My own brother dares to refuse me?

478
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:29,683
Look at what he's done to me.

479
00:30:30,465 --> 00:30:32,449
Would the Viscount truly harm you?

480
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:33,598
Exactly.

481
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,831
Would you wait for him to kill me next?

482
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:37,902
He wouldn't risk such an extreme action.

483
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:39,792
One of his wives has recently vanished.

484
00:30:39,817 --> 00:30:41,370
Nobody can answer that.

485
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:44,253
You know how influential he is.

486
00:30:44,683 --> 00:30:46,269
His brother holds the title of Count.

487
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:48,027
Even if he were to meet an untimely end,

488
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,480
do you believe it wouldn't provoke

489
00:30:50,505 --> 00:30:51,761
an investigation?

490
00:30:53,097 --> 00:30:55,401
Is this the fearsome Bandit Phoem?

491
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:58,058
The mention of your name
alone scared people stiff.

492
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,276
Yet, it seems you are merely a coward.

493
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,026
If won't do it, I'll kill him myself.

494
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:07,870
Hey! Calm down!

495
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,854
Reflect carefully.

496
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:11,237
Should the Viscount die,

497
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:12,940
it'll cause more trouble than it solves.

498
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:16,926
What do you mean?

499
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:20,537
You're clever.

500
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:22,245
You're not listening to me now

501
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,371
because you're angry.

502
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:24,542
Consider my words.

503
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:27,552
Without additional funds,

504
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:29,684
won't the Viscount's inheritance

505
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:31,149
eventually deplete?

506
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:34,692
Are you saying I have to live with this

507
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,677
unhinged viscount for the rest of my life?

508
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,247
Bear with it.

509
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:39,716
You and I need to work together

510
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:40,974
to think this through.

511
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:42,692
Killing him wouldn't be difficult,

512
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:43,927
but how would you ensure

513
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,552
a comfortable life for yourself?

514
00:31:47,302 --> 00:31:48,341
Do you wish to revert

515
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:49,395
to a life of hardship?

516
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,934
Ramphoei's elder brother is a bandit.

517
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:16,833
No wonder she exhibits such behavior.

518
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:19,099
Both are reprehensible.

519
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:21,169
Yeah.

520
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,583
Dech.

521
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,020
I apologize for not

522
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:26,849
having the courage to follow him

523
00:33:26,865 --> 00:33:27,778
to his hideout.

524
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:28,934
It's good that you've

525
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,160
decided to come back.

526
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:32,911
I apologize to you as well.

527
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:34,661
In the future, I won't let you take

528
00:33:34,686 --> 00:33:36,052
any risks like this again.

529
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:38,481
Hey.

530
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:40,520
If anything were to befall you,

531
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:43,345
how would our son and I manage?

532
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:46,246
It's fine, I'm uninjured.

533
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:49,715
What's your next move?

534
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,168
The plan to use

535
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,387
their hands fell flat.

536
00:33:53,036 --> 00:33:54,716
We must adhere to the original strategy.

537
00:33:56,762 --> 00:33:58,160
Are you certain about this?

538
00:34:27,803 --> 00:34:28,803
Hey!

539
00:34:34,249 --> 00:34:36,225
Help!

540
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:37,459
Help me!

541
00:34:38,288 --> 00:34:39,288
Hey!

542
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,090
Dech!

543
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:00,262
Are you alright?

544
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,764
Here he is, my lord.

545
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:13,327
Dech!

546
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:14,983
Are you alright?

547
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:16,491
Blood!

548
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:18,483
I'll take you to the hospital.

549
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:22,147
You!

550
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,936
How dare anyone lay a hand on my people?

551
00:35:27,053 --> 00:35:28,053
Take that!

552
00:35:28,615 --> 00:35:29,615
Take that!

553
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:32,819
My lord!

554
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:33,990
Please calm down!

555
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:35,959
He might not make it at this rate.

556
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:38,514
This is too lenient for what he's done!

557
00:35:39,249 --> 00:35:40,889
My lord!

558
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,381
Why would you suddenly attack

559
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:43,509
Dech like this?

560
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:02,391
Tell me right now who sent you?

561
00:36:03,524 --> 00:36:05,391
How dare you harm my people?

562
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,211
Are you going to tell me or not?

563
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:13,117
A guy named Saeng who hired me, my lord.

564
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,190
My lord, do you believe this money

565
00:36:18,215 --> 00:36:19,752
can buy my silence regarding all

566
00:36:19,768 --> 00:36:21,673
the unsavory truths you've created?

567
00:36:21,698 --> 00:36:22,698
You wretched Saeng!

568
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:30,714
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

569
00:36:30,723 --> 00:36:35,690
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

570
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:37,348
Saeng!

571
00:36:38,317 --> 00:36:39,317
Saeng.

572
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,333
Saeng.

573
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:47,745
I suspected Saeng

574
00:36:48,168 --> 00:36:49,980
always held animosity towards me,

575
00:36:51,097 --> 00:36:52,159
but I never imagined it'd

576
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:53,222
escalate to this extent.

577
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:55,644
Perhaps he's envious that I returned

578
00:36:55,669 --> 00:36:57,464
and decided to stay with you, my lord.

579
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:01,168
Kam.

580
00:37:01,628 --> 00:37:03,120
Turn him to the police immediately.

581
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,073
And what about Saeng, my lord?

582
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:10,469
Someone like him,

583
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:12,105
I'll handle him myself.

584
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:52,348
Here,

585
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:54,652
your payment.

586
00:37:59,226 --> 00:38:00,772
Much obliged.

587
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,788
Despite being more injured

588
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:02,710
than I expected,

589
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:04,804
it was worth it.

590
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:06,202
Now that you've got your money,

591
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:07,250
hurry up and leave.

592
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:08,999
The viscount might remember you,

593
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:10,358
and it could be troublesome.

594
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:11,460
No worries.

595
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:12,850
I'm heading to work for

596
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:14,179
some relatives in the south.

597
00:38:14,203 --> 00:38:15,827
I probably won't come back here again.

598
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,902
Thanks for the travel expenses.

599
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,460
No problem.

600
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,546
Take

601
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,350
this path,

602
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:24,913
you might encounter some

603
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:26,871
trade caravans heading south.

604
00:38:27,218 --> 00:38:28,304
Got it. Farewell.

605
00:38:28,335 --> 00:38:29,335
Thank you.

606
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,140
One of my men,

607
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:49,341
he's reliable.

608
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:52,840
You want me to ambush him?

609
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,208
Exactly.

610
00:38:55,786 --> 00:38:56,786
Hey.

611
00:38:56,927 --> 00:38:58,028
Are you up for it?

612
00:38:58,567 --> 00:38:59,848
Beat me until my head cracks open.

613
00:38:59,856 --> 00:39:00,848
It has to look real.

614
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:02,551
Is this truly necessary?

615
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:04,035
Unless I'm injured,

616
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,450
the viscount won't believe.

617
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:07,200
You know how to make

618
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:08,895
it seem real with my build.

619
00:39:13,797 --> 00:39:15,562
I can handle this.

620
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:20,359
We can trust him.

621
00:39:20,743 --> 00:39:22,078
My friend recommended him to me.

622
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:34,122
You all receive equal treatment,

623
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,192
yet you,

624
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,440
are a disgrace.

625
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:38,974
No, my lord. I've been falsely accused.

626
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:41,911
Despite my animosity towards him,

627
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:42,638
I would never...

628
00:39:42,677 --> 00:39:44,044
Since it has come to this,

629
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,216
there's no need for me

630
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:47,708
to continue covering for you.

631
00:39:48,544 --> 00:39:49,560
The robber,

632
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:50,981
disguised as a rickshaw puller,

633
00:39:51,006 --> 00:39:52,724
didn't assume that I was unaware

634
00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:54,749
that you attempted to stab and kill me.

635
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:13,974
Saeng!

636
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:46,997
Kam has handed over the individual

637
00:40:47,005 --> 00:40:48,551
you hired to the authorities.

638
00:40:48,607 --> 00:40:50,778
The police will soon arrive.

639
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,739
I offer you an chance

640
00:40:52,763 --> 00:40:53,880
to flee before then.

641
00:40:53,904 --> 00:40:55,731
Consider it my final act of clemency.

642
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:57,981
Are you

643
00:40:58,114 --> 00:40:59,903
banishing me, my lord?

644
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:02,114
I swear,

645
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,958
I had no involvement

646
00:41:03,982 --> 00:41:05,442
in any plot against Dech.

647
00:41:05,482 --> 00:41:06,981
Please, believe me, my lord!

648
00:41:07,825 --> 00:41:08,879
- My lord!
- Let go!

649
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,630
Saeng!

650
00:41:14,966 --> 00:41:16,450
I hope I won't see

651
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,154
your face here tomorrow.

652
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:20,241
Throw him out!

653
00:41:21,255 --> 00:41:22,295
Yes, my lord.

654
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,184
My lord.

655
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:26,129
My lord!

656
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,130
Let me go!

657
00:41:29,146 --> 00:41:31,059
Let me go, Dech, Kam!

658
00:41:32,107 --> 00:41:33,825
Please hear me out first, my lord.

659
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:35,349
My lord!

660
00:41:36,724 --> 00:41:38,145
Release me!

661
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:39,926
I said release me!

662
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:41,099
Let go!

663
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:42,474
My lord!

664
00:41:42,778 --> 00:41:44,497
Please hear me out first, my lord!

665
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:45,771
My lord!

666
00:41:46,246 --> 00:41:47,246
My lord!

667
00:41:59,655 --> 00:42:01,678
Please hear me out first, my lord!

668
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:02,912
- Saeng!
- My lord!

669
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:05,350
- Please hear me out first, my lord!
- You wretched Saeng!

670
00:42:10,717 --> 00:42:11,717
My lord!

671
00:42:12,038 --> 00:42:13,662
I beg you not to cast me aside.

672
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:16,194
You are aware that

673
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:18,522
you are my sole anchor in life, my lord.

674
00:42:19,397 --> 00:42:20,397
Release me.

675
00:42:20,422 --> 00:42:21,422
I said release me!

676
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:22,772
My lord!

677
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:24,819
I have no family,

678
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:27,194
no inheritance.

679
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,881
You know this, my lord.

680
00:42:30,022 --> 00:42:31,022
I said release me!

681
00:43:00,615 --> 00:43:02,146
The funds for starting anew,

682
00:43:02,232 --> 00:43:03,919
you've exhausted your excuses.

683
00:43:04,232 --> 00:43:05,349
Depart, and never show your

684
00:43:05,365 --> 00:43:06,372
face to me again!

685
00:43:08,976 --> 00:43:11,491
My loyalty and devotion to you, my lord,

686
00:43:11,516 --> 00:43:12,999
are unwavering and you know that.

687
00:43:14,765 --> 00:43:15,765
Yet,

688
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,796
after aiding in the removal of

689
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,655
that Malai woman from your life,

690
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,343
you chase me away as if I were

691
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:22,546
a mere swine or cur?

692
00:43:45,942 --> 00:43:47,575
My lord, do you believe this money

693
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:50,067
can buy my silence regarding all

694
00:43:50,091 --> 00:43:51,997
the unsavory truths you've created?

695
00:43:52,888 --> 00:43:54,129
You wretched Saeng!

696
00:43:55,325 --> 00:43:56,325
My lord!

697
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:15,489
- Hey!
- My lord!

698
00:44:15,817 --> 00:44:16,668
Saeng!

699
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,551
It's all your doing, isn't it?

700
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,926
You've framed me!

701
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,363
The mastermind behind

702
00:44:21,372 --> 00:44:22,684
everything is the Viscount.

703
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:23,692
Not me.

704
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:26,871
If they don't love you,

705
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:27,957
why hold on to them?

706
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:29,465
Wouldn't it be preferable to

707
00:44:29,497 --> 00:44:31,113
seek vengeance and revel in his riches?
