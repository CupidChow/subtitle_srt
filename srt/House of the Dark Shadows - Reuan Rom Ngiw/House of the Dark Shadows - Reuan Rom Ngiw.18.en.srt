18

Ungrateful. No matter how well

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,187
you raise them, they can't help but cheat.

20
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:06,703
Acting so high and mighty

21
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:08,156
when you're having an affair

22
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:09,093
with a servant!

23
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:20,303
If Ms. Malai abandons me, my lord,

24
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:22,328
I'll reveal all of your secrets.

25
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,967
How dare you threaten me?

26
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,872
Ranchaun, why the smile?

27
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:38,419
How peculiar.

28
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:40,301
My lord, I'm smiling because

29
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,036
I don't have to witness Ramphoei

30
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,194
being an eyesore at the funeral.

31
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:46,715
Indeed.

32
00:02:46,778 --> 00:02:47,965
She only sought attention

33
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,098
on the first day.

34
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,715
Yesterday, she complained

35
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,020
about leg pain,

36
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:54,934
so today she requested a break.

37
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:58,067
How could she not experience leg pain?

38
00:02:58,092 --> 00:02:59,364
She incessantly walked around

39
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,028
introducing herself to the guests

40
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:02,567
as the Viscount's wife.

41
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:05,528
Her mouth is probably aching as well,

42
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,078
right, Bu-nga?

43
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,208
Oh my,

44
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:10,434
so true, Ms. Ranchaun.

45
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:12,380
Lower your voice,

46
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:14,381
show consideration for Father's guests.

47
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:44,849
My lord.

48
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:48,020
The funeral is concluding.

49
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:49,287
Please don't forget about

50
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,755
the money we agreed upon.

51
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:53,465
How persistent, I haven't forgotten.

52
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:55,012
I'm not prepared at the moment.

53
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:57,137
Not ready, or just looking to delay?

54
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:59,333
Should you fail to honor our agreement,

55
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:01,038
be prepared for exposure, my lord.

56
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,223
Your audacity is growing.

57
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:18,997
The sum you request is substantial,

58
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:20,856
and I require time to gather the funds.

59
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:23,387
Please stop lying.

60
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:25,434
Considering the revenue from your father

61
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:27,106
leasing the property to the ministry.

62
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:28,567
My request is reasonable,

63
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:30,192
and there should be no difficulty.

64
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:31,708
Dech!

65
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:34,465
You're disrespecting my brother.

66
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:36,583
How can a household servant

67
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:38,715
ask the master for money?

68
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,481
I am unaware of the details,

69
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:44,169
but if the master chooses not to comply,

70
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:45,825
you have no right to demand it.

71
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:48,559
I suggest you ask

72
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:49,786
the Viscount himself, my lord,

73
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,130
whether I'm capable or not.

74
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,887
There's no need for concern.

75
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,442
I was facing a financial shortfall,

76
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,786
I owed Dech money,

77
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:02,552
since I borrowed from Dech.

78
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:04,044
But Dech is impatient and

79
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:05,333
wants the money back quickly.

80
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:08,653
Are you sure?

81
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,903
I've now received Father's inheritance.

82
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,404
Dech will receive his repayment soon.

83
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:14,941
I appreciate your concern.

84
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:31,916
We almost got caught.

85
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:34,002
If you have anything to discuss,

86
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:35,088
do it at home.

87
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:48,261
Excuse me for a moment, ma'am.

88
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:55,057
My lord, what is wrong?

89
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:57,019
Your face looks tense.

90
00:05:58,198 --> 00:05:59,276
It concerns Dech.

91
00:05:59,628 --> 00:06:01,120
His audacity has reached new heights,

92
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:02,190
loudly demanding money

93
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:03,245
from the Viscount.

94
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,284
Can servants demand money

95
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:07,338
from the master?

96
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:09,726
That is unusual.

97
00:06:09,808 --> 00:06:10,862
I'm uncertain how

98
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:12,057
the Viscount slipped up.

99
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:13,901
It is humiliating.

100
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:15,723
Count Phichit.

101
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:17,745
Count Phichit.

102
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:19,299
The monks are experiencing

103
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:20,370
persistent vomiting.

104
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:22,338
Could you kindly check on them, my lord?

105
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:23,650
Lead the way, please.

106
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:25,018
Ms. Bu-nga, please wait here.

107
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:26,237
Alright.

108
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,010
My lord,

109
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:34,666
we must have a discussion.

110
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:36,245
Even upon our return home,

111
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:37,448
we must be cautious.

112
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:39,088
Let's discuss the matter here, my lord.

113
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:45,260
Please tell me

114
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:46,737
when will I receive the money?

115
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:54,612
Do you wish to know why

116
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:56,291
I'm reluctant to give you the money?

117
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:06,495
It's because I don't want you

118
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:07,370
to leave me.

119
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:09,073
You know the depth of my love for you.

120
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:10,323
I've treated you

121
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,830
with kindness throughout.

122
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:13,948
Why don't you reciprocate that love?

123
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:18,455
I've always been grateful

124
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,604
for your kindness, my lord.

125
00:07:20,534 --> 00:07:21,729
But I don't harbor romantic

126
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:22,799
feelings for you.

127
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:25,237
You've been well aware of this.

128
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:26,721
Then what was the connection

129
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,213
between us all this time?

130
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:30,112
I merely acted out of duty to

131
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:32,002
repay your kindness.

132
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:37,252
Dech!

133
00:07:37,722 --> 00:07:38,924
- Dech!
- My lord!

134
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:40,471
My lord, please listen to me.

135
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:42,166
The only person

136
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:43,971
I truly love is Ms. Malai.

137
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:48,096
You swore an oath to love only me!

138
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:50,080
You forced me to take an oath!

139
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,057
I did it for your peace of mind.

140
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:54,252
But I have never loved you,

141
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:56,830
and it's impossible for me to do so.

142
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:22,827
I agreed to let you have

143
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:24,147
a child with Ramphoei

144
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:28,577
not solely for my father's assets.

145
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:33,273
I want you to stay with the child,

146
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:36,117
stay with me indefinitely.

147
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
Dech!

148
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:39,445
Please don't abandon me!

149
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:42,624
Please don't abandon me, Dech!

150
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:43,796
Stay with me, Dech.

151
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,219
Please don't abandon me, Dech!

152
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:47,328
I beg you!

153
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:49,398
Please don't abandon me, Dech!

154
00:08:58,515 --> 00:08:59,515
Ms. Bu-nga!

155
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:32,858
Ms. Ra...

156
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:46,256
Who are you looking for, Ranchaun?

157
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,154
I suppose I have misheard.

158
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,256
Let us go and assist Malai.

159
00:09:52,913 --> 00:09:53,953
Yes, my lord.

160
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:09,463
Ranchaun, have you seen the Viscount?

161
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:10,564
Why did he let Malai

162
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:11,619
handle the tasks alone?

163
00:10:13,557 --> 00:10:14,892
You're right, my lord.

164
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:16,838
I saw him before the ceremony started,

165
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:18,478
but haven't seen him since then.

166
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:29,642
Count Phichit and Ms. Ranchaun,

167
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,822
have you seen the Viscount and Bu-nga?

168
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:33,908
I just asked Ranchaun a moment ago.

169
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,970
Guests are gradually leaving,

170
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:38,463
and I don't know where he went.

171
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:39,972
This is Father's funeral no less.

172
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:43,416
Stay calm, my lord.

173
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:45,892
The Viscount might be attempting

174
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:47,197
to cope with his grief.

175
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:51,595
I haven't seen Bu-nga since

176
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,430
I came to check on the unwell monk.

177
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:55,056
I'm unsure if she returned or not.

178
00:10:55,315 --> 00:10:57,715
Shall we divide and search for them?

179
00:10:58,002 --> 00:10:59,002
Let's wait until

180
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:00,324
all the guests have left,

181
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,080
there are only a few remaining.

182
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,159
Yes, my lord.

183
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:09,189
You are not a man,

184
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:10,564
harming a woman like this.

185
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:12,064
Please stop, my lord!

186
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:15,447
Ms. Bu-nga, can you refrain from

187
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:17,078
discussing what you heard with anyone,

188
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:18,150
especially with Ms. Malai?

189
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,166
Why?

190
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,408
Afraid of being denied inheritance?

191
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:24,666
Yes, I've been striving for this deeply

192
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,853
until Father wrote a will for me.

193
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:29,852
A bit more and everything will be mine!

194
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:31,142
You're truly selfish,

195
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:32,424
only think about yourself.

196
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:34,525
You even hurt your own wife's feelings.

197
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:37,994
No,

198
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:39,588
not even a wife,

199
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,986
as you've never acted as a husband!

200
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:44,408
My lord!

201
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:45,968
- Let go!
- My lord!

202
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:46,861
Let go!

203
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:06,469
Thank you very much.

204
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,750
Let's split up and search.

205
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,547
They should still be within the estate.

206
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:16,611
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

207
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,313
So, these are your true colors.

208
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,836
Very well. I'll consider myself

209
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,313
picking a fight with a fellow woman.

210
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,102
- Damn Bu-nga!
- No, my lord!

211
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:29,867
Have some self-control, my lord.

212
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,078
Using violence will only

213
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:32,391
make everything worse.

214
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,063
Ms. Bu-nga.

215
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,380
I love Ms. Malai.

216
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:51,633
I agreed to have a child for the Viscount

217
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:53,141
in exchange for a lump sum

218
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:54,499
to start a new life

219
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,724
with Ms. Malai.

220
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:57,110
What Bu-nga overheard was me

221
00:12:57,135 --> 00:12:58,299
urging the Viscount

222
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:00,383
because I learned that you had found

223
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:01,945
a job on Ko Mak for Ms. Malai.

224
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:05,070
I intend to leave this place

225
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:06,295
with Ms. Malai.

226
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,250
So, does this mean Malai

227
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:11,797
also has feelings for you?

228
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:13,219
Yes, Ms. Bu-nga.

229
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:17,789
For the sake of my love for Ms. Malai,

230
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:19,539
I implore you to keep

231
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,602
this matter confidential.

232
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:26,266
Malai's transformation

233
00:13:26,977 --> 00:13:28,203
is all because of you.

234
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:30,422
If you wish to divulge my affairs,

235
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:31,438
go ahead.

236
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:32,563
Your friend can prepare

237
00:13:32,588 --> 00:13:33,922
to face hardship on the streets

238
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,007
like a stray dog.

239
00:13:35,032 --> 00:13:36,250
Being a street dog is still

240
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,602
preferable to being the wife

241
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:38,797
of a queer like you!

242
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Hey!

243
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,039
- Come here!
- My lord!

244
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:44,321
Come here!

245
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:45,555
Let go!

246
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:46,673
Come!

247
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:49,132
If you strike me, I'll strike back.

248
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:51,149
My lord.

249
00:13:52,977 --> 00:13:54,657
Bu-nga! My lord!

250
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,473
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

251
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:18,451
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

252
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,083
Let go!

253
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:21,201
Come!

254
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,660
If you strike me, I'll strike back.

255
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:25,677
My lord.

256
00:14:27,505 --> 00:14:29,816
Bu-nga! My lord!

257
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:31,887
Bu-nga!

258
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:35,411
My lord!

259
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:38,628
Can you two hear me?

260
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:40,777
Are you two around here?

261
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:43,582
Ms. Malai is searching for Ms. Bu-nga.

262
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:46,113
Please acknowledge that we can

263
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:47,207
no longer keep this

264
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:48,246
matter private, my lord.

265
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:51,980
If it is revealed that

266
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:53,020
Mueang is not my child,

267
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:54,723
all the assets will

268
00:14:55,043 --> 00:14:56,738
immediately be donated to the temple.

269
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:57,949
I cannot accept it.

270
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:01,621
Dech, attend to Malai.

271
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:02,848
I will manage things here.

272
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:05,231
Malai...

273
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:07,528
My lord!

274
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:09,895
Hurry, Dech.

275
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,035
Do you want Malai to

276
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,074
discover the truth?

277
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:14,192
Go!

278
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:14,858
Dech.

279
00:16:15,998 --> 00:16:17,217
Are you searching for

280
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,109
the Viscount and Ms. Bu-nga?

281
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,037
Yes,

282
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,584
I thought I heard Bu-nga's voice

283
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:22,693
around here earlier.

284
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:24,357
There's no one around,

285
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,568
I walked here and didn't see anyone.

286
00:16:27,623 --> 00:16:28,639
The Viscount is sick and

287
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,662
returned a while ago.

288
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:32,334
No wonder I couldn't find anyone.

289
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,967
Why didn't he inform anyone?

290
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,584
Count Phichit will be offended

291
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:38,771
when he finds out.

292
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:42,756
Then it's better for me

293
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:43,826
to accompany you.

294
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:46,475
It's getting dark and it can be dangerous.

295
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:48,631
It's better to search

296
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:49,896
for her in that direction.

297
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:51,842
Alright.

298
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:16,412
Help...

299
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:22,685
The Viscount might

300
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,013
truly be feeling unwell.

301
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:26,217
He was fine before the ceremony started.

302
00:17:26,897 --> 00:17:28,505
The Viscount is indeed feeling unwell.

303
00:17:28,576 --> 00:17:29,982
You don't need to explain.

304
00:17:30,443 --> 00:17:31,568
Servants would naturally

305
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:32,591
take the master's side.

306
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:35,052
Don't think I'm unaware.

307
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:36,701
Whether he's sick or not,

308
00:17:36,726 --> 00:17:37,747
he has to endure.

309
00:17:37,771 --> 00:17:39,295
It's his own father's funeral.

310
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,263
I apologize on behalf

311
00:17:41,288 --> 00:17:42,701
of the Viscount, my lord.

312
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,848
Why are you apologizing on his behalf?

313
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:49,076
Just leave it be, my lord.

314
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:51,443
The Viscount has always

315
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:52,979
been self-centered.

316
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:54,349
Now that Father is absent,

317
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,209
he is even less considerate.

318
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
Malai,

319
00:18:08,623 --> 00:18:10,552
please don't mind Count Phichit.

320
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:12,927
He loves Father a lot.

321
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:17,029
Dech,

322
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,146
take Ms. Malai back home to rest.

323
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:21,611
She must be tired.

324
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:23,443
Yes, ma'am.

325
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,458
Let us go, ma'am.

326
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,453
Ms. Malai, where are you going?

327
00:19:22,478 --> 00:19:23,883
The rickshaw is on its way.

328
00:19:24,993 --> 00:19:26,633
I want to find Bu-nga first.

329
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:29,360
Normally, she would tell me

330
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:30,563
where she would be going.

331
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:32,102
She has never disappeared like this.

332
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,469
If you're feeling uneasy,

333
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:36,086
I can go look for her in your place.

334
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:37,211
This area can be unsafe,

335
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,250
and it's right next to

336
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:39,289
other people's gardens.

337
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:40,438
I'm concerned for

338
00:19:40,463 --> 00:19:41,735
your safety, Ms. Malai.

339
00:19:43,922 --> 00:19:45,125
I'll wait here to escort you

340
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:46,335
to the rickshaw

341
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,366
and then go look for Ms. Bu-nga.

342
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:53,242
Alright then.

343
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,458
Help...

344
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:06,075
Bu-nga!

345
00:21:14,396 --> 00:21:15,497
Make sure the corners

346
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:17,116
- of the cloth are spread evenly.
- Yes, ma'am.

347
00:21:25,638 --> 00:21:26,638
Oh, Kam.

348
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:31,161
What's in that bundle of cloth?

349
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:32,856
It's the viscount's shirt, ma'am.

350
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:34,356
It's stained with dirt

351
00:21:34,372 --> 00:21:35,738
and couldn't be cleaned,

352
00:21:35,763 --> 00:21:37,896
so I've been asked to burn it, ma'am.

353
00:21:38,724 --> 00:21:39,844
Let me see it.

354
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,129
Oh, Uan.

355
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:08,325
What is wrong? You look troubled.

356
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,090
Ms. Malai, it's terrible!

357
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:14,769
What is it, Uan?

358
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:16,512
A servant of Ms. Bu-nga came to inform

359
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,176
that she hasn't returned home, ma'am.

360
00:22:19,114 --> 00:22:20,418
Where is Bu-nga's servant?

361
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:21,543
This way, ma'am.

362
00:22:29,469 --> 00:22:30,836
Where did Ms. Bu-nga go?

363
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:32,110
How would I know?

364
00:22:32,126 --> 00:22:33,126
Geez, you...

365
00:22:40,472 --> 00:22:41,659
As Dech mentioned,

366
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:42,855
I wasn't feeling well,

367
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:43,925
so I returned early.

368
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,097
I don't really care when Bu-nga

369
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:47,386
returned home.

370
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:51,800
Perhaps she's staying overnight

371
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:53,526
at a guy's place.

372
00:22:54,418 --> 00:22:55,995
Aren't you overly worried?

373
00:22:57,871 --> 00:22:58,871
My lord.

374
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:03,730
What were you doing, my lord?

375
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:07,995
Your body is covered in wounds.

376
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:14,115
Yesterday, the rickshaw I sat

377
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:15,530
hit a rock and tipped over.

378
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:16,835
Oh no...

379
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:18,506
Are you hurt, my lord?

380
00:23:19,561 --> 00:23:20,686
Would you like me to apply

381
00:23:20,702 --> 00:23:21,889
some medicine for you?

382
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,006
It's not a big deal.

383
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,678
Just a few scratches.

384
00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:26,412
Thanks for offering.

385
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:29,069
No wonder you sent Kam

386
00:23:29,094 --> 00:23:31,414
to burn your shirt, my lord.

387
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,584
It must be very dirty.

388
00:23:34,452 --> 00:23:36,428
Yes, it was torn and dirty.

389
00:23:37,147 --> 00:23:38,623
Since it was an official outfit,

390
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:40,079
so I had it burnt.

391
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:41,615
So no one else can wear it.

392
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,694
I'll be going to work, I'm running late.

393
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:45,883
Yes, my lord.

394
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:56,527
Too bad.

395
00:23:56,574 --> 00:23:58,120
She should have died,

396
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:00,050
so I could hold a celebration.

397
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:01,066
Hey,

398
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:03,538
what kind of person are you?

399
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:08,589
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

400
00:24:08,605 --> 00:24:13,558
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

401
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:39,577
Ms. Bu-nga.

402
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,053
- Dech!
- Ms. Bu-nga!

403
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:57,087
Viscount...

404
00:25:02,056 --> 00:25:03,056
My lord!

405
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:22,437
Why did you have to do this?

406
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:30,824
Isn't the situation bad enough?

407
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:33,874
It's because of you, isn't it?

408
00:25:33,922 --> 00:25:35,296
You started this whole thing.

409
00:25:35,321 --> 00:25:37,521
I told you to discuss it at home.

410
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:41,382
Just turn yourself in, my lord.

411
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:42,546
No,

412
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:45,462
if I have to go to jail, I'd rather die.

413
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:46,742
Step aside!

414
00:25:58,437 --> 00:25:59,804
You handle it from here.

415
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,257
I'll hurry back home.

416
00:26:21,726 --> 00:26:22,945
Remember,

417
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:24,484
everything that happens tonight

418
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:25,898
has never occurred before.

419
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,906
Please forgive me,

420
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,570
Ms. Bu-nga.

421
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,095
Dech.

422
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:22,345
Dech!

423
00:27:22,736 --> 00:27:23,736
Whoa!

424
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:25,859
Don't sneak up on me like that,

425
00:27:25,884 --> 00:27:26,883
you startled me.

426
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:28,470
I've been calling you for a while,

427
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:29,704
but you didn't respond.

428
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:31,282
Hiding silently in the room,

429
00:27:31,306 --> 00:27:32,673
refusing to do your duties?

430
00:27:34,072 --> 00:27:35,110
I have a fever and

431
00:27:35,135 --> 00:27:36,313
wanted to take a rest.

432
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,180
Why did you come looking for me?

433
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,188
The police

434
00:27:42,212 --> 00:27:43,907
came to report about Ms. Bu-nga.

435
00:27:44,853 --> 00:27:46,735
Did someone find Ms. Bu-nga's body?

436
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,204
Why would you assume Ms. Bu-nga is dead?

437
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,501
Well...

438
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:55,149
you mentioned the police

439
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:56,712
reporting about Ms. Bu-nga,

440
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,079
and your expression seemed

441
00:27:58,103 --> 00:27:59,180
as if someone had died.

442
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,516
No, Ms. Bu-nga is not dead,

443
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:01,649
but she has been assaulted

444
00:28:01,658 --> 00:28:02,626
and injured badly.

445
00:28:13,388 --> 00:28:15,068
What happened to Bu-nga?

446
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:16,661
We suspect that she was

447
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:17,950
a victim of a robbery,

448
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:20,505
as she has injuries to her head

449
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:22,715
and her valuables are missing.

450
00:28:23,357 --> 00:28:24,957
Where is Bu-nga now?

451
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:26,450
the perpetrator probably

452
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:27,575
thought she was dead

453
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,997
and left her here.

454
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:32,106
Fortunately, she is still alive.

455
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:34,841
We have sent her to the hospital

456
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:36,066
for treatment.

457
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:37,411
Bu-nga...

458
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,997
You poor thing.

459
00:28:39,943 --> 00:28:41,692
Don't worry too much, Ms. Malai.

460
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:43,583
Bu-nga is safe with the doctors now,

461
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:44,849
and she should be fine.

462
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:47,231
I'll go to the hospital to check

463
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:48,536
on Bu-nga, then.

464
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,091
Let us depart, ma'am.

465
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:53,989
Oh dear, Bu-nga dispelled misfortune

466
00:28:56,076 --> 00:28:57,583
Bu-nga is an acquaintance of mine

467
00:28:57,607 --> 00:28:58,614
and the viscount.

468
00:28:58,638 --> 00:29:00,224
Moreover, it happened on the night

469
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,669
of my father's funeral.

470
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,005
Catch the suspect quickly,

471
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:04,221
understand?

472
00:29:04,232 --> 00:29:05,272
Yes, my lord.

473
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,407
We are currently gathering evidence.

474
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,726
I don't care how much money it takes,

475
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:18,524
the culprit must be apprehended.

476
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:20,243
How dare they harm

477
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:21,938
a guest at my father's funeral?

478
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,321
In that case, the police would like to

479
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,469
interview your servants who

480
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:27,477
attended the funeral yesterday, my lord.

481
00:29:27,571 --> 00:29:28,686
Go ahead.

482
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:30,008
I trust all the servants

483
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:31,063
in my household.

484
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:34,626
Dech,

485
00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:36,407
I will leave this matter to you.

486
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:38,932
Yes, my lord.

487
00:29:41,556 --> 00:29:42,758
This way, please.

488
00:29:58,712 --> 00:29:59,712
Dear Malai,

489
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,954
please don't worry.

490
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:04,055
You've been crying all day.

491
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:07,360
At least Bu-nga survived the assault.

492
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,157
Bu-nga survived the attack,

493
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,836
but she hasn't regained consciousness.

494
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:17,603
Oh dear...

495
00:30:18,353 --> 00:30:20,227
She's in a coma.

496
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,877
We don't know when she'll wake up.

497
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:25,461
Too bad.

498
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:27,094
She should have died,

499
00:30:27,524 --> 00:30:28,985
so I could hold a celebration.

500
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:30,001
Hey,

501
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,469
what kind of person are you

502
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:34,239
to speak like this?

503
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:36,594
Why can't I speak my mind

504
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:38,225
when I genuinely feel

505
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,282
satisfied about it?

506
00:30:43,735 --> 00:30:45,649
Someone is on the brink of death,

507
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:47,469
and you still mock and ridicule them.

508
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:50,258
Your heart is so dark

509
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,963
that it is beyond repair.

510
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,290
Who kicked me?

511
00:30:58,384 --> 00:30:59,384
It is I!

514
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:14,327
Too bad.

515
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:15,960
She should have died,

516
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,851
so I could hold a celebration.

what kind of person are you

Oh, Malai,

crying until your eyes are swollen.

529
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:50,319
Truly pitiful.

530
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:54,303
I apologize for coming to pick on you

531
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:55,421
not realizing the gravity

532
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,711
of the situation.

533
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,357
Let me help comfort you.

you

537
00:32:14,745 --> 00:32:15,745
right.

538
00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:52,986
Who kicked me?

539
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:54,011
It is I!

540
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:00,807
Let go!

541
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:03,674
Let go!

542
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:06,221
Damn you Malai!

543
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,627
You dare slap me?

544
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:09,502
Have you ever heard

545
00:33:09,628 --> 00:33:11,369
"don't count your chickens

546
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,501
before they hatch"!

547
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,595
Let go!

548
00:33:15,987 --> 00:33:17,049
Let go!

549
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:18,877
Malai, have you gone mad?

550
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:22,065
Ms. Malai!

551
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,370
No need.

552
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:25,682
Ramphoei should experience

553
00:33:25,698 --> 00:33:27,166
Malai's wrath so she'll learn.

554
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,979
Go wherever you want.

555
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:29,995
Yes, ma'am.

556
00:33:38,303 --> 00:33:40,193
Let go! You crazy woman!

557
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:44,701
Let go! You crazy woman!

558
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:45,889
Let go!

559
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:46,904
My lord,

560
00:33:46,936 --> 00:33:49,310
You have to handle Malai for me!

561
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,255
See what she did to me.

562
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:53,873
Who knows when these bruises will heal.

563
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:56,738
And how do you propose I handle it?

564
00:33:58,318 --> 00:33:59,966
Punish her in any way you like, my lord.

565
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,826
Or better yet, just chase her away.

566
00:34:01,951 --> 00:34:04,654
But I think you are in the wrong

567
00:34:05,264 --> 00:34:07,076
for picking a fight with Malai

568
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:08,638
when she was grieving.

569
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:09,755
It being dealt like this

570
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:10,818
is already lenient.

571
00:34:12,022 --> 00:34:14,107
Are you taking Malai's side, my lord?

572
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:15,881
I won't stand for it!

573
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:18,771
Oww!

574
00:34:19,162 --> 00:34:20,333
Just because you're holding

575
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,466
the upper hand doesn't mean

576
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:22,520
I'll always yield to you.

577
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:24,138
If I lose patience with you,

578
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:25,795
you'll see what I'm capable of.

579
00:34:25,904 --> 00:34:26,904
Oww...

580
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:48,961
Take this money for medical treatment.

581
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,578
Keep the rest as a gift.

582
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:52,715
And cease giving me headaches.

583
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,892
Has everyone in this household gone mad?

584
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:47,304
What did the doctor say, Ms. Malai?

585
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:53,538
The doctor said

586
00:35:55,601 --> 00:35:56,905
that Bu-nga was seriously

587
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,038
injured in the head.

588
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:00,578
She...

589
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,390
So, does it mean Ms. Bu-nga

590
00:36:04,468 --> 00:36:06,671
will have to live like this forever?

591
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:08,522
Yes,

592
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,296
the doctor said they don't know

593
00:36:11,321 --> 00:36:12,366
when she'll recover.

594
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:16,028
Even if she does,

595
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,638
it's uncertain if

596
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,606
she'll be the same as before.

597
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,825
Thankfully, Bu-nga has a lot of assets.

598
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:27,177
Relatives have been

599
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:29,731
taking turns to look after her.

600
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:46,443
- Dech!
- Ms. Bu-nga!

601
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:48,485
Viscount...

602
00:36:58,619 --> 00:36:59,619
Remember,

603
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:01,369
everything that happens tonight

604
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:02,783
has never occurred before.

605
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:08,212
Please forgive my sins, Ms. Bu-nga.

606
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:18,500
You never had any problems with Bu-nga.

607
00:37:19,618 --> 00:37:21,274
Why are you asking for her forgiveness?

608
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:25,156
We never know if we've caused

609
00:37:25,181 --> 00:37:26,680
displeasure to others through

610
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,414
our actions, words, or thoughts.

611
00:37:32,165 --> 00:37:34,765
And what about your teaching at Ko Mak?

612
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:36,617
Bu-nga hasn't disclosed

613
00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:37,727
the details to me.

614
00:37:38,313 --> 00:37:39,586
And now this happened.

615
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:47,540
Now I see no way out, Dech.

616
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,727
Don't worry too much, Ms. Malai.

617
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,820
Even if you don't get a job at Ko Mak,

618
00:37:56,446 --> 00:37:59,016
I'll follow you everywhere you go.

619
00:38:01,587 --> 00:38:02,587
Truly, Dech?

620
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:05,133
Yes, ma'am.

621
00:38:18,282 --> 00:38:19,282
Bu-nga...

622
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:32,986
What did you say?

623
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:36,142
Have you decided?

624
00:38:36,205 --> 00:38:37,470
Will you come with me?

625
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:43,404
I truly want you to join me.

626
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:48,400
I've been thinking

627
00:38:48,408 --> 00:38:49,704
about this many times,

628
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,564
Initially, I wanted to go,

629
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,111
but now, with you having

630
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:54,385
Ms. Malai to take care of,

631
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:55,744
it would be

632
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,142
an additional burden if I joined you.

633
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:01,564
Does that mean you're staying here?

634
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,092
Yes.

635
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,755
I wish you and Ms. Malai all the best.

636
00:39:10,342 --> 00:39:12,294
Just don't forget about me, understand?

637
00:39:17,408 --> 00:39:19,228
I love you like a real sister.

638
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:22,741
How about this?

639
00:39:23,032 --> 00:39:24,205
When Ms. Malai and I

640
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:25,697
have established ourselves,

641
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:27,787
I promise to come and get you.

642
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:31,314
Yeah!

643
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:33,939
Your words alone make me happy.

644
00:39:35,705 --> 00:39:37,150
I'll be waiting for you.

645
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:39,268
Yeah.

646
00:39:42,744 --> 00:39:43,775
But are you sure

647
00:39:44,361 --> 00:39:45,915
the Viscount will allow you and

648
00:39:45,947 --> 00:39:47,720
Ms. Malai to leave this house easily?

649
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:53,072
He has no choice but to allow it.

650
00:39:53,697 --> 00:39:54,697
Yeah.

651
00:39:59,971 --> 00:40:01,091
- I won't allow it!
- My lord!

652
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,299
Dech is mine!

653
00:40:02,455 --> 00:40:03,900
I refuse to let you go!

654
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,252
My lord!

655
00:40:10,205 --> 00:40:11,759
If my lord is going to kill Ms. Malai,

656
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,456
I'd rather you kill me.

657
00:40:13,526 --> 00:40:15,017
