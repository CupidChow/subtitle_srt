You're the lady of the house!
You have full power!

19
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:03,143
How could you let this happen?!

20
00:02:03,784 --> 00:02:05,730
Even since she found out
she was pregnant,

21
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:07,284
she doesn't listen to anyone.

22
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:08,403
Malai!

23
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,405
If you didn't bring
Ms. Ramphoei into this house,

24
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,007
it wouldn't have been in turmoil.

25
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:16,436
I'm protecting my child.
What's wrong with that?

26
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:18,298
You son of a bitch.

27
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:20,526
You dare abandon your own child.

28
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,533
The baby's out. Dech, are you
hearing the same thing?

29
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:29,199
I don't want to live with you and
Ramphoei as a third wheel anymore.

30
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:30,991
Please give me a divorce!

31
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:36,679
How adorable. Look at him.

32
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,550
Are you sure he's yours, Wisan?

33
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:42,956
Goodness, Father.

34
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:44,556
Please don't say that.

35
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:47,602
I'm asking to make sure

36
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:51,156
that you didn't take
another man's child as yours.

37
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:53,103
I'm not that vile, sir.

38
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,049
Phichit,

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,881
get me the Phra Somdej amulet.

40
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:00,953
I'm gonna welcome my grandson.

41
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:04,193
The Phra Somdej amulet?

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
Of course.

43
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:10,429
I finally have a grandchild,
my own flesh and blood.

44
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:12,629
He deserves the Phra Somdej amulet.

45
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:15,827
Don't argue.
Get it for me as you're told.

46
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:17,476
It's over there.

47
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:19,043
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:25,516
You're hiccupping?
Oh, look, you're smiling for me.

49
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:28,776
Just a second, baby.

50
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,703
Let me help you.

51
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:38,048
By the grace of the Buddha,
the dharma and the sangha,

52
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:41,066
may you be protected.

53
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:44,208
May no harm come to you, baby.

54
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,498
Make sure you keep
this amulet safe for your son.

55
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:53,551
It's our family heirloom.

56
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:54,938
Don't lose it.

57
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,937
Keep it safe and sound.

58
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,671
I will, Father.

59
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,543
May you be protected.

60
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,310
Uh, when will you...

61
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,537
When will I sign over
my fortune to you?

62
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:09,483
Can't you let me be
happy for a while?

63
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:13,130
You have to offend me
with your greed again.

64
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,010
You must want me
to die quickly, Wisan.

65
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,400
No, Father. I just...

66
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:22,377
Never mind. I prepared it.

67
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:28,612
Oh, don't cry, baby. Don't cry.

68
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:30,798
Yeah? Good boy.

69
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:34,319
My lord, may I hold
my nephew for a while?

70
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:35,854
That's a good idea. Here.

71
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:38,261
Ranchuan, look at him.

72
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:39,471
That's right.

73
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,211
That's a good boy.

74
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:42,951
Oh, be careful. Oh, be gentle.

75
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:51,831
I'll take him for a walk, my lord.

76
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,579
Come on, baby.

77
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:56,232
Let's go take a walk.

78
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:05,256
I'm signing this
only for my grandson's sake.

79
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:18,243
(Marquis Srisombat)

80
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:23,701
Here, take it.

81
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:25,858
You've got what you wanted.

82
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:31,623
From now on, you'll probably
curse me to die morning and night.

83
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:33,390
That's not true, sir.

84
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:35,118
Even if you don't say it,

85
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:38,584
I can tell from your eyes
what you're thinking.

86
00:05:48,503 --> 00:05:49,730
What a lovely child.

87
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,683
He's adorable, my lord.

88
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:09,061
He's blessed
right after he was born.

89
00:06:09,072 --> 00:06:11,338
He was welcomed by
the Phra Somdej amulet.

90
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:15,449
The saying is "born with
a silver spoon in his mouth."

91
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:17,232
That's right.

92
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:20,115
I'll keep this amulet
safe and sound for Mueang.

93
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:23,285
Hey, how's your child doing?

94
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,368
Completely healthy, sir.

95
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:29,519
I have to apologize for Uan
for not welcoming you.

96
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,442
Oh, it's all right.

97
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:34,074
I'll give you something
to welcome the child.

98
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:35,623
Yes, sir.

99
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:37,575
Hey.

100
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:40,904
Malai and Fueang, please
help Ramphoei raise my son.

101
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:44,028
So you all can rely
on each other in the future.

102
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:45,420
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

103
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:47,941
What's up, son?

104
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:50,800
Hey, Malai,

105
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:52,660
do you want to hold him?

106
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,121
Uh, is that a good idea, my lord?

107
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:57,387
It's not hard, Malai.

108
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:01,946
Baby.

109
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:03,846
Be careful.

110
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:19,090
He must be hungry.

111
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,710
I think we should let
Ms. Ramphoei feed him.

112
00:07:26,643 --> 00:07:27,754
Let's go, ma'am.

113
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:29,229
Come on, baby.

114
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:32,136
Fueang.

115
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,676
He's such a happy child, ma'am.

116
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:54,290
He's lucky I carried
his heavy ass to term.

117
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:57,582
You want my breasts
to sag like old women? No way.

118
00:07:58,302 --> 00:07:59,302
It's true, ma'am.

119
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,035
They say if a woman nurses
a child, her breasts will deform.

120
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:05,005
You're still young, ma'am.
Don't give in.

121
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:08,709
They'll sag only temporarily.

122
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:10,940
They'll look the same
after he's weaned.

123
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,268
What's so scary?
You already have a husband.

124
00:08:14,256 --> 00:08:15,502
Shut up, Fueang.

125
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:17,862
Jeez, you act like a know-it-all.

126
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:19,848
You act like you have children.

127
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:21,946
I don't care. I won't do it.

128
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,674
So are you gonna let him go hungry?

129
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:29,182
If you adore him so much,
get him some rice water.

130
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,703
Let's go, Ms. Malai.

131
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,880
With this kind of person,
he only rented her womb.

132
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:40,230
Don't call her a mother.

133
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,840
Fueang, you're crossing
the line with my master.

134
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,440
Fueang, what do we do?
Do we have to feed him rice water?

135
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:51,383
No, ma'am.

136
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,130
I have a better way.

137
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:57,203
Let's go, ma'am.

138
00:08:57,997 --> 00:08:59,080
Let's go, sir.

139
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:00,880
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

140
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:12,520
What do you think they'll feed him?

141
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,870
I don't care.

142
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:17,344
Malai will never let my son starve.

143
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:23,116
Hey, don't slack off.
Get back to my massage.

144
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,630
-Yes, ma'am.
-Come on.

145
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,000
Are you full yet?

146
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,717
I completely forgot that
Uan had just given birth too.

147
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:47,785
We don't have to bother
Ms. Ramphoei anymore, ma'am.

148
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,637
I hope you don't mind.

149
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,613
You have both
your child and Mueang.

150
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:56,600
I don't mind, ma'am.

151
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,383
The most I nurse,
the more milk I produce.

152
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,760
*baby talk*

153
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,200
You are so adorable, sir.

154
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,030
How can you be this adorable, sir?

155
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:10,895
You are so adorable.

156
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:14,729
Eh?

157
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Dech.

158
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,200
Why are you standing there?

159
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:26,927
I haven't seen him
ever since he was born.

160
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:29,347
I can't help feeling excited.

161
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:30,954
Come see him up close.

162
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:32,943
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,970
He remembers you.

164
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,950
You remember me?

165
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,250
What do you think, sir?

166
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:48,120
What do you think, sir?

167
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:56,880
Hey, you remember me?

168
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:08,843
May I touch him, ma'am?

169
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:31,843
Yes, sir.

170
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,483
Yes, sir.

171
00:11:56,477 --> 00:12:00,200
Hey, dust got in your eyes.
Your tears are gonna fall on him.

172
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:05,120
I'm sorry, Ms. Malai.

173
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:07,800
I was walking from the garden.

174
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:09,600
Dust probably got on me then.

175
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:11,516
Come with me.

176
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,120
I'll take you to wash your face.
Come on.

177
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:21,963
Come here.

178
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:25,040
Where are you dragging me to?

179
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,977
Don't argue.
You almost spilled the beans.

180
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:33,696
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:37,369
My dear Dech,

182
00:12:38,262 --> 00:12:40,760
if seeing him for the first time
got you this emotional,

183
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,416
what's gonna happen in the future?

184
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,623
What do you mean?

185
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:46,120
You're usually quite clever.

186
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:48,337
Why does this stump you?

187
00:12:50,043 --> 00:12:52,016
I'm referring to
what you said once that

188
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:54,284
you would leave after his birth.

189
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,046
His Lordship got
his inheritance as he'd wished.

190
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:04,720
So you have to make a decision.

191
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,433
If the first sight of your son

192
00:13:08,457 --> 00:13:11,514
got you wrapped
around his finger like this,

193
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,790
will you really be able to make
yourself leave this house?

194
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,670
Jeez!

195
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,950
What are you crying so hard for?

196
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,490
Chaem!

197
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,230
Chaem!

198
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:49,697
Where the hell is she?

199
00:13:50,803 --> 00:13:51,803
Chaem!

200
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,544
You called me so loudly.
What did you need, ma'am?

201
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:58,760
Take this brat away.

202
00:13:58,996 --> 00:13:59,996
He's so annoying.

203
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:03,343
Eh? Who do you want me
to take him to?

204
00:14:05,497 --> 00:14:07,870
Take him to whoever.
I'm not taking care of him.

205
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:09,680
He cries all day. It's annoying.

206
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,410
Yes, ma'am.

207
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,280
Be quick about it.

208
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:18,643
Jeez.

209
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,600
Even dogs love their pups.

210
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:23,280
You're so unlucky.

211
00:14:24,057 --> 00:14:25,630
Who should I take you to?

212
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,440
Don't cry. Don't cry. Come here.

213
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:32,886
Don't cry. Don't cry.

214
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
It's okay.

215
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:37,760
Don't cry. Don't cry.

216
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,164
Chaem, what's wrong with him?

217
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,520
Well, It's Ms. Ramphoei.
She completely ignores him.

218
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,997
And she told me to take him away.

219
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,810
It's okay.

220
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,477
I'll watch him.

221
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,290
Really, ma'am?

222
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,520
Then I'm gonna go.

223
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,670
It's okay.

224
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,057
It's okay if your mother
won't take care of you.

225
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:16,640
I'll take care of you myself.

226
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:20,040
You don't have to cry.

227
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:28,800
You're a good boy, aren't you?

228
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,443
Come in.

229
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,230
Dech.

230
00:15:57,837 --> 00:16:00,893
Please make good on your promise
about letting Fueang and me leave.

231
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:03,360
Are you sure you're leaving
with just Fueang,

232
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,560
and not my wife as well?

233
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:08,480
If you mean
Ms. Malai who is my wife,

234
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,200
you understand correctly.

235
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:11,643
Dech!

236
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:13,323
You ingrate.

237
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:16,509
So you're admitting
you're taking Malai with you?

238
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:19,603
Ms. Malai is not
your wife, but mine.

239
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,320
I hope you will keep
the promise you made me.

240
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:26,280
Or are you a liar?

241
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,603
My father's seriously ill.

242
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,160
You've been waiting this long.

243
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,590
Would it kill you
to wait a little longer?

244
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,537
I shall wait for that day, sir.

245
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,113
Why are you here?
Who gave you permission?

246
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,700
Calm down, my lord.

247
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,560
State your business.

248
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,120
You won't believe my words.

249
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,467
You should see it for yourself.

250
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,160
Ungrateful. No matter how well
I treat them, they still stray.

251
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:29,092
You act so noble when in reality

252
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:31,000
you're having an affair
with a servant.

254
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,935
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

255
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:54,553
Ms. Ramphoei!

256
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
What's the matter?

257
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:02,750
What's wrong with
a wife visiting her husband?

258
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:06,166
Dech, don't you miss me?

259
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,280
Ms. Ramphoei,
what's the hell are you doing?

260
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,803
Get out of my room
before anyone sees.

261
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,120
Dech! You idiot!

262
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:17,795
A woman comes to your room
and you're playing hard to get.

263
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:21,200
Did you want everyone to know
you slept with me?

264
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,150
Why would I care?

265
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,373
The viscount got both
his child and inheritance.

266
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,080
It can still be reversed.

267
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,840
His father is still alive.

268
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:31,513
If he finds out the child's
not his flesh and blood,

269
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,360
do you think His Lordship
would still get his inheritance?

270
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,017
Get out, ma'am.

271
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,270
Dech!

272
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,870
Dech! Dech!

273
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:45,377
Dech!

274
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:22,640
Dech's charm is potent.

275
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,600
He's got both of your wives.

276
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:29,217
Ungrateful. No matter how well
I treat them, they still stray.

277
00:19:30,257 --> 00:19:31,623
Do you see now, my lord,

278
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:34,535
that no one loves
and obeys you as I do?

279
00:19:36,997 --> 00:19:39,257
If there's anything you need,
give me your order.

280
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,913
Are you sure you don't want me
to come with you?

281
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:08,560
It's just watching the sick.

282
00:20:09,313 --> 00:20:13,800
My father-in-law's sick.
I should pay him a visit.

283
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:18,104
I wish Ramphoei was
as thoughtful as you were.

284
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:21,720
She complained nonstop
after just one visit.

285
00:20:22,363 --> 00:20:25,280
And she's evasive about
another visit, making excuses.

286
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:29,486
It's better if you and Dech
hold down the fort here.

287
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:31,880
Especially with Ramphoei.

288
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,480
She doesn't even
take care of her own son.

289
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,597
You knew about that, my lord?

290
00:20:37,057 --> 00:20:39,000
Good deeds quietly done are seen.

291
00:20:43,523 --> 00:20:44,800
I'm grateful to you

292
00:20:45,737 --> 00:20:47,280
for taking good care of my son.

293
00:20:50,643 --> 00:20:51,843
I'm counting on you too.

294
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,330
Yes, my lord.

295
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,890
I'm gonna go.

296
00:21:12,283 --> 00:21:14,120
What? Dech's quitting?

297
00:21:15,897 --> 00:21:17,885
What is a penniless,
uneducated servant

298
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:19,563
like him gonna do for a living?

299
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,960
You're smart.
You should be able to guess.

300
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,790
People do things
for only very few reasons.

301
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,503
It's either love or money.

302
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,430
I know someone like Dech
can't be bought.

303
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:35,546
Don't tell me that
he's quitting to get married.

304
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:38,580
Who is she?
Does he dare betray His Lordship?

305
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:39,807
Uh...

306
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:42,047
Well...

307
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,840
I'd rather not say it.

308
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,437
I don't want trouble.

309
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:49,160
Tell me right now
who that woman is.

310
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:51,010
How dare she take...?

311
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,370
Take His Lordship's man?

312
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,237
She is very important, ma'am.

313
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,600
If I accuse her without proof,
I could get fired.

314
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:05,400
You're being difficult, Saeng.

315
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,520
What do I have to do
to find out who she is?

316
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,140
Uh...

317
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:24,256
Why are you giving me
a river tamarind flower?

318
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,000
Do you know its meaning, ma'am?

319
00:22:30,197 --> 00:22:31,197
I don't.

320
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,080
Until now,

321
00:22:33,717 --> 00:22:35,717
no one gave me flowers.

322
00:22:37,383 --> 00:22:38,783
You're my first, you know?

323
00:22:41,997 --> 00:22:46,200
A river tamarind flower symbolizes
a firm and straightforward love.

324
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:49,590
Like my love for you, Ms. Malai.

325
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:53,880
I'm sorry

326
00:22:54,647 --> 00:22:57,680
that I couldn't afford to give you
beautiful foreign flowers

327
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,226
to represent my feelings.

328
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:01,687
It's okay.

329
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,030
I'm so moved by this
I'm left speechless.

330
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Malai!

331
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,930
Don't, Ms. Ramphoei.

332
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,290
-Get off! Get off me!
-Ms. Ramphoei! Ms. Ramphoei!

333
00:23:15,503 --> 00:23:17,036
-Get off!
-Ms. Ramphoei, don't!

334
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:18,400
-Ms. Ramphoei, don't!\
-Let go!

335
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:20,910
Ms. Ramphoei!

336
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,400
-Ms. Ramphoei?
-Jeez.

337
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:24,252
You act so noble when in reality

338
00:23:24,263 --> 00:23:26,161
you're having an affair
with a servant.

339
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,903
If His Lordship finds out,

340
00:23:27,936 --> 00:23:30,317
you'll be kicked out
and become a beggar.

341
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:35,071
You don't know anything!

342
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,544
I was just talking to Dech.

343
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:41,400
You can't assume that I'd do
despicable things like you do.

344
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:42,949
Stop mouthing off.

345
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:44,203
Enough, Ms. Ramphoei!

346
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,516
-Enough.
-Get off! Don't stop me.

347
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:47,657
I'm gonna tell...

348
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,610
Let go! Let me go!
I haven't finished!

349
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,130
Let go! Dech, let me go!

350
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,203
What, Saeng?

351
00:24:16,637 --> 00:24:18,157
Aren't you wondering, ma'am,

352
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,196
why Dech was quick to take her away?

353
00:24:23,516 --> 00:24:25,137
Well, she was about to slap me.

354
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,920
You're well aware how she is.

355
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,627
Why did you ask?

356
00:24:30,153 --> 00:24:31,153
Ms. Malai,

357
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:33,120
is that all you think?

358
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,587
But why do I think...

359
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:37,800
Dech looked panicky somehow.

360
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:42,003
Like he didn't want you to hear
what Ms. Ramphoei had to say.

361
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:49,823
Let go, Dech!

362
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,160
Let go! Let me go!

363
00:24:52,383 --> 00:24:53,383
Dech!

364
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:54,917
Dech!

365
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:55,977
Dech!

366
00:24:56,217 --> 00:24:57,217
Let go!

367
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,920
Dech, you can't do this to me!

368
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:06,736
What's wrong with you?

369
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,123
Did you want everyone to know?

370
00:25:08,276 --> 00:25:10,283
Didn't you understand
what I said last night?

371
00:25:10,702 --> 00:25:12,982
I was just jealous of my husband.
Is that so wrong?

372
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:15,080
Ms. Ramphoei, get it together.

373
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:17,668
Do you want
his inheritance taken back?

374
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:20,400
Don't threaten me with that.

375
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:22,120
Even if the whole house knows,

376
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:24,480
they'll have to keep
his secret anyway.

377
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,148
Especially Malai.

378
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:29,603
She loves him too much
to let him get into trouble.

379
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,880
-Stop talking, Ms. Ramphoei.
-No.

380
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:34,523
I'm gonna let everyone
in the house know

381
00:25:34,643 --> 00:25:35,643
-that you're...
-Dech!

382
00:25:44,563 --> 00:25:45,783

385
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,460
Don't threaten me with that.

386
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:03,180
Even if the whole house knows,

387
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:05,540

388
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,208

389
00:26:07,548 --> 00:26:10,663
She loves him too much
to let him get into trouble.

390
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:12,940
-Stop talking, Ms. Ramphoei.
-No.

391
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:15,583
I'm gonna let everyone
in the house know

392
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:16,703
-that you're...
-Dech!

393
00:26:17,016 --> 00:26:19,200
Dech! Dech, it's bad!

394
00:26:19,906 --> 00:26:20,906
Dech!

395
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:23,129
Dech, it's bad! Dech!

396
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,840
It's bad! Dech!

397
00:26:25,696 --> 00:26:28,400
Say what you have to say, Fueang.
Get to the point.

398
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:32,843
His Lordship's father passed away.

399
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:38,076
When, Fueang?

400
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,916
His Lordship just went
to see him this morning.

401
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,680
Someone from the count's
just came with the news.

402
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,360
Where's his body now?

403
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,170
The count's, ma'am.

404
00:26:58,939 --> 00:27:00,040
I'm gonna get dressed.

405
00:27:00,893 --> 00:27:03,600
Get rickshaws for me
and Ms. Ramphoei, Saeng.

406
00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:05,173
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:11,983
You two go get dressed too.

408
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,403
Let's give them a hand.

409
00:27:14,797 --> 00:27:15,920
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

410
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:19,723
Dech.

411
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,673
Come here. Come here, you.

412
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:24,400
-What's with you?
-Come here.

413
00:27:30,143 --> 00:27:32,080
Why are you being so secretive?

414
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,510
Idiot.

415
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:37,400
If it weren't for me,

416
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,429
Ms. Malai would have
found out that...

417
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:42,040
you're Ms. Ramphoei's lover.

418
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,320
-Saeng, right?
-Yeah.

419
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,623
I heard him convincing Ms. Malai
to follow you and Ms. Ramphoei.

420
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Ms. Malai,

421
00:27:52,534 --> 00:27:53,647
is that all you think?

422
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,114
But why do I think...

423
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,327
Dech looked panicky somehow.

424
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,530
Like he didn't want you to hear
what Ms. Ramphoei had to say.

425
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,320
What did Ms. Malai hear?

426
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,553
I'm not sure either.

427
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,680
But in case Ms. Malai asks you,

428
00:28:25,547 --> 00:28:27,720
think of a good excuse.

429
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:29,140
You still have time.

430
00:28:30,797 --> 00:28:31,837
Thanks a lot.

431
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,390
You saved me again.

432
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,270
Yeah. Don't mention it.

433
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:37,844
Be more careful next time.

434
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:40,400
You won't get lucky every time.

435
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,430
I will.

436
00:29:00,043 --> 00:29:01,156
Hello.

437
00:29:04,223 --> 00:29:07,350
Oh, I'm Ramphoei,
Viscount Wisan's wife.

438
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,477
You're welcomed inside.

439
00:29:15,557 --> 00:29:17,040
Hello, my lord.

440
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:21,563
I'm Ramphoei.
I'm Viscount Wisan's wife.

441
00:29:29,063 --> 00:29:31,056
She parades herself
more than his own family.

442
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:35,560
I don't understand how the viscount
took that lowlife as his mistress.

443
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,377
What's the point of talking
about it, Ranchuan?

444
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,477
They have a son together.

445
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,370
All we can do is let it go.

446
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,120
Malai, you should go in
and keep my brother company.

447
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,560
Yes, my lord.

448
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,120
I want the viscount
and Malai have a child,

449
00:29:58,676 --> 00:30:01,240
so that lowlife stops
presenting herself as a swan.

450
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,271
Let's welcome our guests inside

451
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:07,661
before we lose more face.

452
00:30:08,577 --> 00:30:09,577
Yes, sir.

453
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:46,163
No need to look at me
like that, Malai.

454
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,117
I've prepared myself
for his death for a while.

455
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:55,000
Hearing that gives me some comfort.

456
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,080
Even though I'd prepared myself
for this day,

457
00:31:01,257 --> 00:31:02,490
when it finally came,

458
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:04,920
my heart dropped.

459
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:19,143
My father and I

460
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:21,170
had our differences

461
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:23,160
since I was a child.

462
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,270
Rit!

463
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:35,643
Rit!

464
00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:38,760
If you love him so much,
go live with him!

465
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,783
Your father's in
a better place now, my lord.

466
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:51,000
Don't worry about it.

467
00:31:53,503 --> 00:31:56,200
It's best to forgive each other.

468
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:04,160
You're secretly
comforting him here.

469
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,563
You thought this would
lessen your punishment?

470
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,750
That was smart, Malai.

471
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:20,080
What do you mean?

472
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,956
If you're done being sad
about your father,

473
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,557
I'll tell you all about it.

474
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Ramphoei,

475
00:32:28,683 --> 00:32:32,320
aside from having
despicable manners,

476
00:32:33,163 --> 00:32:34,800
you have no sense of propriety.

477
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:46,760
For the marquis' sake,
I'll let that slide.

478
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,541
But as soon as the funeral's over,
I'll make you sorry.

479
00:33:16,417 --> 00:33:17,417
Oh, Saeng.

480
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,506
It's gonna be dark soon.
Where are you going?

481
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:21,517
None of your business.

482
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,680
Jeez. I'm warning you
because I mean well.

483
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
You go out
when His Lordship's away.

484
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,846
And you haven't gone to help
with the marquis' funeral.

485
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:34,100
I'm going to
Bang Lamphu for drinks.

486
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,670
Happy?

487
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:39,676
If the viscount wants me there,

488
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,160
he has to order me.

489
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:46,440
We're both servants.

490
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,703
Don't teach me.

491
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:30,666
Who the hell are you?!

492
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,596
Dech, it's me.

493
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:08,603
How was it?

494
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:10,360
Passed out by the road.

495
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Thanks a lot.

496
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,616
You're welcome.

497
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:15,680
I never liked him.

498
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,410
He deserved it.

499
00:35:18,037 --> 00:35:19,037
In this house,

500
00:35:19,803 --> 00:35:22,120
only you and Fueang
treat me and my wife well.

501
00:35:22,556 --> 00:35:24,123
There's no one I'd rather help.

502
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:27,899
Hey, let me as you something.

503
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,953
You've tolerated him for so long.

504
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:33,046
What did he do this time
to offend you so much?

505
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,840
Well, like you said.

506
00:35:36,413 --> 00:35:37,983
He harasses me daily.

507
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,720
This is for all of that.

508
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,590
Okay.

509
00:35:41,757 --> 00:35:43,584
I gotta get back to my wife, okay?

510
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:46,603
Bye.

511
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,929
If Ms. Malai leaves me,

512
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,803
I'll expose all your secrets.

513
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,430
You dare threaten me?!

515
00:36:10,088 --> 00:36:14,635
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

516
00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:19,450
I insist I saw them
with my own eyes.

517
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:23,840
Malai and Dech were flirting
in secret at the pier.

518
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,217
They must be having an affair.

519
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:27,890
And then what?

520
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:32,480
Malai probably seduced Dech

521
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,143
to get him to sleep
with her, my lord.

522
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:37,800
You can't let her
make a cuckold out of you.

523
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Is that all?

524
00:36:56,303 --> 00:36:57,570
So I can get back to work.

525
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
My lord?

526
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,238
Aren't you going to do
anything to this harlot?

527
00:37:07,117 --> 00:37:08,157
Shut up, Ramphoei.

528
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:11,044
If I won't stop accusing Malai,

529
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,236
I won't spare your feelings
even though you gave me a son.

530
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:15,643
You wanna try me?!

531
00:37:28,277 --> 00:37:29,600
I know Malai well.

532
00:37:30,323 --> 00:37:32,876
She would never do
what you're accusing her of.

533
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,680
But if it were you,
I wouldn't be so sure.

534
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:40,160
Thank you, my lord.

535
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,960
If there's nothing else,
I'll get back to your son.

536
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:14,550
(The night before)

537
00:38:16,275 --> 00:38:19,362
Are you here waiting for me
to talk about Malai?

538
00:38:21,963 --> 00:38:24,790
You had Saeng provoke
Ms. Ramphoei to punish me.

539
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:28,497
You did all that to let Ms. Malai
know I slept with Ms. Ramphoei.

540
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,627
Your infatuation made you
so delusional that you accuse me.

541
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,393
You're crossing the line, Dech.

542
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:36,390
I've served you for decades.

543
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:38,320
I know what you're thinking.

544
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,840
You tried to manipulate
Ms. Malai and Ms. Ramphoei

545
00:38:43,317 --> 00:38:45,040
to kick them out of the house.

546
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:48,490
Or at the very least, expose me to
Ms. Malai so she stopped loving me.

547
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:50,320
Don't accuse me, Dech.

548
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:51,957
If Ms. Malai leaves me,

549
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,583
I'll expose all your secrets.

550
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,357
You dare threaten me?!

551
00:38:58,517 --> 00:39:00,000
When we're desperate,

552
00:39:00,483 --> 00:39:01,920
we can do anything.

553
00:39:02,483 --> 00:39:03,880
Isn't that right, my lord?

554
00:39:08,903 --> 00:39:10,200
So what do you want?

555
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:12,440
Protect Ms. Malai's honor.

556
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:14,822
I know you're smart, my lord.

557
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:16,920
You already know what to do.

558
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:29,465
Hey, don't think
you're off the hook

559
00:39:29,475 --> 00:39:31,383
just because
His Lordship sides with you.

560
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:32,686
I won't let you...

561
00:39:32,697 --> 00:39:35,040
I already told you
to leave my friend alone.

562
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,297
Or do you want
history to repeat itself?

563
00:39:37,797 --> 00:39:39,720
-Bu-nga!
-Yeah, it's me!

564
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:40,960
Do you have a problem?

565
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:44,240
I'm not a fan of violence.

566
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:47,443
But if you keep harassing me,
I won't stand for it either.

567
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,263
Why? Gonna gang up on me?

568
00:39:58,153 --> 00:39:59,520
I expected more from you.

569
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,000
Very good, my dear friend.

570
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:05,439
Well done.

571
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,680
He's an easy child.

572
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,003
He doesn't cry
no matter who holds him.

573
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That's true.

574
00:40:18,397 --> 00:40:19,964
Easy to feed and tuck in bed.

575
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,120
I have him with my child.

576
00:40:22,477 --> 00:40:24,404
They fall asleep
right after I nurse them.

577
00:40:25,177 --> 00:40:27,630
I only say this
because it's you two.

578
00:40:28,197 --> 00:40:31,070
I love him as my own, ma'am.

579
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,423
It's a shame he's not yours, Malai.

580
00:40:35,577 --> 00:40:37,640
I would love him completely.

581
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,720
Bu-nga, children
can't choose their parents.

582
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,720
Don't overthink it.

583
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,920
My friend is a saint.

584
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:47,382
Hey, I've only been gone a while.

585
00:40:47,522 --> 00:40:50,560
I heard that a country bumpkin
made you move to a smaller room?

586
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,220
You should have told me earlier.
I'd have slapped her to the floor.

587
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:58,852
But do you want your big room back?
I'll take care of it for you.

588
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:01,520
That's okay. I can manage.

589
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,800
You came to see me.
Is everything okay?

590
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,010
Uan, can you take him for a bit?

591
00:41:10,477 --> 00:41:11,477
Yes, ma'am.

592
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:14,970
Give us a minute, baby.

593
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,680
Come with me. Come with me.

594
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,803
I found you a job, Malai.

595
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,950
Even though the viscount
won't give you a divorce,

596
00:41:33,997 --> 00:41:36,530
you might as well get one
if you work there.

597
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:38,770
What job?

598
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,830
Teaching home economics

599
00:41:40,841 --> 00:41:43,040
to government officials'
children in Ko Mak.

600
00:41:52,837 --> 00:41:54,247
Why do you need to think, Dech?

601
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:57,640
Bu-nga finally found me a job.

602
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,423
And I have the money
from His Lordship's father.

603
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,120
Although it's not much,

604
00:42:03,577 --> 00:42:05,640
it's enough for me to start over.

605
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,480
Are you sure you want to leave
the Dark Shadow House?

606
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,720
If I work on Ko Mak,

607
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,640
I might as well be a divorcee.

608
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,036
If I use this excuse,

609
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,160
His Lordship won't be able
to force me anymore.

610
00:42:30,563 --> 00:42:33,760
Unless... you don't want to
struggle with me anymore.

611
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,920
That's not it, Ms. Malai.

612
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,200
Then why the hesitation?

613
00:42:38,943 --> 00:42:39,943
Why?

614
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,137
Do you know Ramphoei
is above me in every way?

615
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:46,080
She gave His Lordship a child.

616
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,600
And he got his inheritance
as he wished.

617
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:50,963
I don't have children.

618
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,440
Why would I
tolerate living here, Dech?

619
00:43:06,743 --> 00:43:08,076
Even if you won't leave,

620
00:43:09,343 --> 00:43:10,343
I'll leave.

622
00:43:40,123 --> 00:43:42,690

So I could throw a party.

624
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:45,670
