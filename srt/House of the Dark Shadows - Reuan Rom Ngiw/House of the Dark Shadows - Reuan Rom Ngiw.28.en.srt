Why don't we just...

19
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:01,786
get rid of Ms. Ramphoei?

20
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,808
We can't.

21
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:03,874
Saeng just died.

22
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:05,408
You need not worry.

23
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,305
I won't let her keep

24
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:09,063
putting pressure on us.

25
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,291
Why don't we just...

26
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,125
get rid of Ms. Ramphoei?

27
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,147
We can't.

28
00:02:13,148 --> 00:02:14,213
Saeng just died.

29
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:15,747
You need not worry.

30
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:17,644
I won't let her keep

31
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:19,402
putting pressure on us.

32
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:20,653
Why don't we just...

33
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:22,487
get rid of Ms. Ramphoei?

34
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:23,509
We can't.

35
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,575
Saeng just died.

36
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:26,109
You need not worry.

37
00:02:26,326 --> 00:02:28,006
I won't let her keep

38
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:29,764
putting pressure on us.

39
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:32,077
As you've stated,

40
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:33,544
Saeng came to the estate.

41
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:34,804
And then?

42
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:36,155
He went on a rampage,

43
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:37,906
accusing us of conspiring

44
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:39,367
to have him expelled.

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,219
So we grappled,

46
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:44,761
and Saeng agreed to leave after

47
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,612
Dech fired a warning shot.

48
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:49,051
I may not have been at the scene,

49
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:52,078
but I can attest they've spoken truth.

50
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,353
They all said the same thing.

51
00:02:57,897 --> 00:02:58,897
Regardless,

52
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:00,237
we still need to

53
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,250
question the residents.

54
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,682
Very well.

55
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,502
We shall gladly cooperate

56
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:05,755
with the police force.

57
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:08,307
Then I shall...

58
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:10,248
go fetch my wife, sir.

59
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:17,673
Right this way, officers.

60
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,005
Please.

61
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:30,462
I was present at the scene.

62
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,277
Dech did fire a shot into the air

63
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,590
to warn Saeng

64
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,375
who was having a go at Kam.

65
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:38,767
Just like my husband said,

66
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:40,597
Saeng has a bad temper.

67
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:43,297
Nobody here likes his attitude,

68
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:44,603
but nobody would

69
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,310
go as far as to kill him.

70
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:48,590
Please calm down, Ms. Ramphoei.

71
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,320
How can I stay calm, officer?

72
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,737
My lord compensated him generously

73
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:56,317
upon his dismissal.

74
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:59,065
And yet, instead of being grateful,

75
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:00,935
he brought upon us more trouble

76
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,866
and even got us all interrogated.

77
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:04,233
Why was this Saeng

78
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:05,920
dismissed from the estate?

79
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:08,084
Saeng grew envious because

80
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:09,756
the Viscount favored Dech,

81
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:11,897
so he hired someone to harm him.

82
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,666
The he was caught and dismissed

83
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:16,357
to avoid further trouble from him.

84
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:18,203
Well... Is it possible

85
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:21,553
that Dech sought him out for revenge.

86
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,223
From what I've seen,

87
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:26,073
I'm confident he's not one to be

88
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,523
ill tempered nor vengeful.

89
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:29,095
If you ask me,

90
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:30,963
he probably crossed

91
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,225
the wrong folks outside

92
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:35,509
and then got himself killed

93
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:37,255
Where were you

94
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:38,901
the night Saeng died?

95
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,784
Where else would I be but here?

96
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:43,939
I went to bed with my baby,

97
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:47,276
fearing he might burst in and harm us.

98
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,000
More importantly…

99
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:51,607
What is it, Ms. Malai?

100
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:52,601
At present,

101
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,163
Dech acts as my lord's proxy,

102
00:04:54,188 --> 00:04:56,039
managing all affairs within the estate.

103
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,019
He wouldn't risk getting

104
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:01,117
arrested for something like this.

105
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:02,898
Who knows what sort of enemy

106
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:04,296
a man like Saeng had made.

107
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:06,338
I do pity him, but...

108
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,683
He brought it upon himself.

109
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,075
But...

110
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,715
What about hiring someone to do it?

111
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:15,051
If Dech truly desired Saeng's demise,

112
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:16,696
he would've taken action long ago.

113
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:19,537
He wouldn't have let it go on this long.

114
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:21,667
Thank you very much, Ms. Malai.

115
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Thank you.

116
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:44,320
How did it go, officers?

117
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,046
Yes, they are very cooperative.

118
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:47,726
Their answers lined up.

119
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:50,994
If it's alright,

120
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:52,907
may we see the Viscount?

121
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,189
Certainly.

122
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:57,076
This way please.

123
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,199
Come on in.

124
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:23,536
Ever since he was paralyzed,

125
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:25,219
he can only move his eyes

126
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:26,611
and make some noises.

127
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,291
That's all he can do to communicate,

128
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:33,144
which may not be very helpful.

129
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:39,205
Is he saying something?

130
00:06:43,716 --> 00:06:44,866
Is he all right?

131
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:49,171
He seems upset I hadn't

132
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,439
sought his approval first.

133
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:53,602
He might not want outsiders

134
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:55,585
to see him in such a state.

135
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:57,818
It's usually just the Count,

136
00:06:58,038 --> 00:06:59,918
Ms. Ranchuan and us residents.

137
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:08,632
Well, I guess you better leave now.

138
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,137
I don't want to further irritate him.

139
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,404
Please.

140
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:24,828
Is it still troubling you?

141
00:08:26,403 --> 00:08:27,403
It is,

142
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,602
and you must be feeling the same.

143
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:33,159
Yes.

144
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:35,607
Saeng was murdered outside,

145
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,401
yet it causes everyone here

146
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:39,637
to go through an interrogation.

147
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:47,153
Don't stress over it.

148
00:08:47,782 --> 00:08:49,475
The officers already left without

149
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,952
harboring suspicion toward anyone here.

150
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:53,840
That may be the case,

151
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:55,827
but it still bothers me.

152
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,514
Because Saeng accused me

153
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,612
of harming my lord,

154
00:08:58,749 --> 00:08:59,696
you're wondering if

155
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,537
I would hire someone to kill him.

156
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:04,086
It's not like that.

157
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:06,227
I trust you, completely.

158
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:09,506
You wouldn't do something so horrible.

159
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:12,312
I just...

160
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,239
I can't stop myself from worrying.

161
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:18,917
Don't worry, Ms. Malai.

162
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:22,257
I swear to you, I did not kill Saeng.

163
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,495
How about this?

164
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,398
We visit the temple and make offerings

165
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:30,068
to lift your spirits.

166
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,750
Alright.

167
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,380
Who is it?

168
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:07,967
I heard you!

169
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,700
It's me. Be quiet, please.

170
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:21,111
Oh dear,

171
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:23,912
seems you've missed my company.

172
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:28,209
How about I entertain you tonight?

173
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:30,237
Let's give Mueang a sibling.

174
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:32,223
I'm not here for that.

175
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:34,850
Ugh, what a waste of time.

176
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,564
Say your piece and scram!

177
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:42,973
Do you realize

178
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:44,932
you almost got us all in trouble?

179
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,340
There's no need to panic.

180
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:49,707
Did the police arrest anyone?

181
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:51,559
No witness, no evidence.

182
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:52,772
Nothing to fear.

183
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,614
Even so, may I ask you to stop

184
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:57,680
stirring up more trouble?

185
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:04,475
You should be grateful

186
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:06,875
instead of threatening me like this.

187
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:09,742
I helped you get rid of Saeng,

188
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:13,163
the man who worships the Viscount.

189
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,240
He wouldn't let this be over so easily.

190
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,101
Do you feel no shame?

191
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:20,543
You fear he'll expose your role

192
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:22,901
in inciting him to harm the Viscount.

193
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:24,617
You resort to killing him

194
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:26,054
to avoid further trouble.

195
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:29,202
Don't give yourself too much credit.

196
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:31,849
Even so,

197
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:33,810
you still benefit from this.

198
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:34,568
Am I right?

199
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,635
Mark my words.

200
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:41,955
If I go down, I won't go down alone.

201
00:11:42,438 --> 00:11:44,225
You're going with me.

202
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:46,702
Besides,

203
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,477
you probably don't want

204
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,741
your child to be motherless, do you?

205
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,090
Dech!

206
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,329
Why are you looking for him here?

207
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:19,772
Why can't it? We already slept together!

209
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:33,118
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

210
00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:40,200
Dech, my dear!

211
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,272
Dech,

212
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,397
won't you open the door for me?

213
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:48,087
Dech!

214
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,562
Honey,

215
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:55,203
I think I hear a cat's mating call,

216
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:56,539
can you hear it?

217
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:57,825
Indeed.

218
00:12:57,832 --> 00:13:00,338
I couldn't tell if it was a cat or a dog,

219
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:02,014
but it's very annoying.

220
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:03,879
Shut it, you lot!

221
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:05,544
Get the hell away!

222
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:07,478
And where would we go?

223
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,717
This is the servants' quarters,

224
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:12,573
it's you who should leave, Ma'am.

225
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,460
Perhaps...

226
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,318
you're feeling homesick and

227
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:18,911
seeking comfort in our humble company?

228
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,467
Uan! How dare you!

229
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,277
Calm down, ma'am.

230
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:26,610
However, Uan's right.

231
00:13:27,143 --> 00:13:29,456
You shouldn't be here unless

232
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:31,410
you've got some work for us.

233
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:34,482
Should we move to the main hall?

234
00:13:35,254 --> 00:13:36,787
Right? She insists.

235
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:39,383
- How about we go to the main hall?
- Sure, sure.

236
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:41,009
You scoundrels!

237
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:42,131
Scram!

238
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:46,427
Oh no. Let's go, Kam.

239
00:13:46,488 --> 00:13:48,581
- I don't want to be beaten up.
- Go away!

240
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:50,376
- It's not worth it.
- You pests!

241
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:53,508
Leave!

242
00:13:58,319 --> 00:13:59,319
Dech!

243
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:01,512
Dech!

244
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:14,475
Where in the world is he?

245
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,046
Are you sleepy, baby?

246
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:20,715
Sleeping? No?

247
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,070
Let's go to sleep.

248
00:14:23,341 --> 00:14:24,341
Baby.

249
00:14:24,387 --> 00:14:25,387
Dech!

250
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:28,704
Dech!

251
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:31,443
Dech!

252
00:14:32,577 --> 00:14:33,577
Dech!

253
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:36,450
I know he's in your room, Malai!

254
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:38,247
What's this, Ramphoei?

255
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,447
Why are you here shouting and yelling?

256
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:41,534
Look.

257
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,495
Poor baby, he's wide awake now.

258
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:46,996
Don't even try to dodge the topic.

259
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:49,935
Where is he hiding? Dech!

260
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,534
This is my room,

261
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:53,488
why are you looking for him here?

262
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,580
Stop pretending to be innocent.

263
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:57,748
Thanks to my lord's jealousy,

264
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:00,426
I already know about you and Dech.

265
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,983
You have no right to

266
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:03,030
meddle in our affairs!

267
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,670
Why are you

268
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,143
looking for him at such hour?

269
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:14,381
Why would that matter?

270
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:16,892
Dech and I...

271
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:19,573
have already slept together!

272
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:25,856
Ms. Ramphoei.

273
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:27,851
Stop right there!

274
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,190
No!

275
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,082
Why?

276
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,460
Because you can't face to truth?

277
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,983
You're too drunk, ma'am.

278
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,319
You're not making sense.

279
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:36,593
I'm not drunk!

280
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:40,912
I'll make it clear to you.

281
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:42,151
Mueang, our baby

282
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:44,464
is Dech's and mine!

283
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,790
That's enough, Ms. Ramphoei!

284
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:00,881
It's not!

285
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:02,607
Why?

286
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,359
Haven't you told her we did it

287
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,153
on the Viscount's order

288
00:16:06,177 --> 00:16:07,760
to secure the inheritance?

289
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,195
Don't you dare say that I lied!

290
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:12,402
There, I said it!

291
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:37,780
My lord, you told me you're infertile!

292
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:39,465
I didn't lie to you.

293
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:41,259
I always thought I was,

294
00:17:41,514 --> 00:17:42,871
because the doctor said so.

295
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,201
My brother also has it.

296
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:47,597
I have no idea how she became pregnant.

297
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:50,311
Perhaps it's fate.

298
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,551
You should return, Ms. Malai.

299
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,176
I'll take care of this.

300
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:04,590
Sure, because you're-

301
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:08,536
She's extremely drunk.

302
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:10,340
Please don't mind her.

303
00:18:14,097 --> 00:18:15,715
I'll make it clear to you.

304
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:16,954
Mueang, our baby

305
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:19,267
is Dech's and mine!

306
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:22,319
Haven't you told her we did it

307
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,113
on the Viscount's order

308
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,720
to secure the inheritance?

309
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:10,815
The look in your eyes...

310
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:12,794
You must think I deserve it.

311
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:20,214
All along, you knew

312
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:22,455
things would turn out like this.

313
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,597
But it's alright.

314
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,895
I'm not upset in the slightest,

315
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:30,764
my lord.

316
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:56,795
The food is ready, Ms. Malai.

317
00:19:57,234 --> 00:19:58,343
Thank you, Fueang.

318
00:19:59,222 --> 00:20:01,088
Are you full, my lord?

319
00:20:05,084 --> 00:20:07,417
Please take my lord's portion away.

320
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:09,710
I've tried but he's not eating.

321
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:11,250
He must be full.

322
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,079
Yes, ma'am.

323
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:16,334
Would you like some refreshments?

324
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:20,999
You should head down and eat.

325
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,968
You're nursing a snake in your bosom.

326
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:26,307
It's just a waste of time

327
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:28,408
since they take it for granted.

328
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:29,731
Don't be like that.

329
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:34,716
I apologize, my lord.

330
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:38,041
I'll be back soon.

331
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:03,908
Ms. Malai may feel sorry,

332
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,134
but I won't apologize.

333
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:09,972
I forgave you

334
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,876
solely because you've fallen ill.

335
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,118
But I won't let you abuse me

336
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:16,140
as you have done before.

337
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,900
You should be grateful that

338
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,795
she still shows mercy towards you.

339
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,775
If it were the others,

340
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:29,900
they wouldn't spare you a glance.

341
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:33,310
I bet they'd eagerly await your death.

342
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:01,571
Ms. Malai...

343
00:22:02,095 --> 00:22:03,659
Please try to eat some more.

344
00:22:03,786 --> 00:22:05,344
I fear you'll fall ill too.

345
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:09,352
Thanks, Fueang.

346
00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:12,019
How wonderful.

347
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:13,656
You still have the nerve

348
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,121
to come downstairs to eat.

349
00:22:15,715 --> 00:22:16,824
It it were me...

350
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,737
Besides lacking appetite,

351
00:22:18,822 --> 00:22:21,067
I wouldn't dare show my face here.

352
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,168
Why should she feel that way

353
00:22:23,286 --> 00:22:25,825
when she's the Viscount's wife?

354
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:30,014
She may be the Viscount's wife,

355
00:22:30,477 --> 00:22:32,464
but she's a certain someone's mistress.

356
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,691
Ms. Malai is someone's mistress?

357
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:37,875
Oh dear!

358
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:40,588
Is Ms. Malai having an affair

359
00:22:40,697 --> 00:22:42,933
while her husband is still alive?

360
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:44,043
Chaem!

361
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:46,225
Chaem!

362
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:47,712
Fueang, you-

363
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,715
Don't be arrogant.

364
00:22:50,947 --> 00:22:51,784
At worst,

365
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:53,413
I'll return to how I was.

366
00:22:53,892 --> 00:22:54,892
But can you bear

367
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:56,328
being penniless?

368
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:01,254
Remove the food, I've lost my appetite.

369
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:02,652
Yes, ma'am.

370
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:28,509
Ms. Malai.

371
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:29,643
Ms. Malai!

372
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:35,902
Ms. Malai...

373
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:38,414
Why are you addressing me?

374
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:41,110
Why are you treating me so coldly?

375
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:45,082
How else shall I treat you?

376
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,344
My presence is a nuisance.

377
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,917
I'm in the way of a happy family.

378
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,522
If you'd like me to leave,

379
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:55,284
just say it.

380
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,429
I don't want to be an eyesore.

381
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,373
No, Ms. Malai.

382
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:00,601
- Let go!
- No, I won't.

383
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:01,672
- Let me go!
- I won't!

384
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,742
No, no. No, I won't.

385
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,315
No, I won't ever let you go.

386
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:09,252
Haven't I proven myself to you?

387
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:11,150

Ms. Malai, please don't leave me.

400
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
To me,

401
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:00,163
you're the air that I breathe.

402
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Without you,

403
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:04,911
I'd perish.

404
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:11,915
Listen to me.

405
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:14,330
I may be Mueang's father,

406
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:16,175
but what occurred with

407
00:25:16,638 --> 00:25:18,476
Ms. Ramphoei wasn't driven by love.

408
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,584
I only did it because it was an order.

409
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:26,764
Anyway, you're still Mueang's father.

410
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:30,195
There's no bigger love than

411
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,213
the love between father and son, Dech.

412
00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:37,397
My love is for you, Ms. Malai.

413
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,423
I love you.

414
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:48,068
I love you with all of my heart.

415
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:49,670
I always love you.

416
00:25:56,876 --> 00:25:58,566
No matter how much your love is,

417
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,867
I can't stay here any longer, Dech.

418
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:03,674
The Viscount is in this state

419
00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:06,216
and I no longer have a place here.

420
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:08,614
If you wish to leave,

421
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,728
I will gladly accompany you

422
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:12,705
to wherever you may go.

423
00:26:14,123 --> 00:26:15,696
I will never be apart from you.

424
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:26,252
Can you truly leave your child behind?

425
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:30,282
No matter how much I love my child,

426
00:26:30,437 --> 00:26:33,220
it will never trump my love for you.

427
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:35,217
Even in my absence,

428
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:36,821
he'll inherit everything

429
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:37,865
and lack nothing.

430
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:42,540
But I can't go on living

431
00:26:43,286 --> 00:26:44,686
without you, Ms. Malai.

432
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:58,545
I won't let you go!

433
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,499
I don't care where you go,

434
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:05,908
but you can't take my man away.

435
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:07,162
Got it, mistress?

436
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,500
She's not a mistress!

00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,292
I won't let you go!

440
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,399
Leave this place alone

441
00:27:27,436 --> 00:27:29,023
and don't take my man away!

442
00:27:29,262 --> 00:27:30,942
Stop saying I'm your man.

443
00:27:31,543 --> 00:27:33,549
I didn't consent to sleeping with you.

444
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:36,325
But you're still my baby's father.

445
00:27:36,627 --> 00:27:37,839
If I say you can't,

446
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:39,172
then you can't leave!

447
00:27:39,256 --> 00:27:40,398
Enough, Ramphoei!

448
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:42,332
You're only slandering yourself.

449
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,805
I'll talk, you shut up!

450
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,712
I don't care where you go,

451
00:27:46,057 --> 00:27:48,098
but you can't take my man away.

452
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:49,339
Got it, mistress?

453
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:53,403
Ms. Ramphoei.

454
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:58,148
Never disrespect her again!

455
00:27:58,508 --> 00:27:59,938
She's not a mistress!

456
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:01,649
Of course, she is!

457
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:04,278
I'm your woman and your baby's mother.

458
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:06,784
What else could she be but a mistress?

459
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,025
I may be my child's mother.

460
00:28:09,243 --> 00:28:10,530
I'll consider him mine.

461
00:28:10,894 --> 00:28:11,899
You're no one to me.

462
00:28:12,682 --> 00:28:15,595
I only did it because it was an order.

463
00:28:16,036 --> 00:28:17,316
I was forced to.

464
00:28:17,726 --> 00:28:18,729
I wasn't willing.

465
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:26,874
The only one

466
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:28,737
I willingly call my own

467
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,150
is Ms. Malai.

468
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:37,182
You should go rest indoors.

469
00:28:39,347 --> 00:28:40,910
- Come. Come here!
- Ms. Ramphoei!

470
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:41,880
Come here!

471
00:28:41,939 --> 00:28:43,151
You say you love her?

472
00:28:43,523 --> 00:28:44,250
Alright.

473
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:45,996
What if her face's bruised?

474
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:49,255
That's enough!

475
00:28:49,823 --> 00:28:51,811
He has made his intentions clear.

476
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,948
You better be careful and make sure

477
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:57,026
Mueang's heritage remains undiscovered.

478
00:28:57,223 --> 00:28:58,223
Otherwise,

479
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:00,453
all the treasures you coveted

480
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:02,693
won't be of any help to you.

481
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:04,795
You are threatening me?

482
00:29:04,835 --> 00:29:05,835
Alright, you-

483
00:29:06,685 --> 00:29:07,685
- No!
- Ms. Ramphoei!

484
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:09,386
Let me go! I'll slap her good!

485
00:29:09,506 --> 00:29:10,506
Stop going crazy!

486
00:29:11,514 --> 00:29:12,514
Come here!

487
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,910
Let go! Let me go!

488
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:36,840
You all deserve it!

489
00:30:12,674 --> 00:30:14,837
- Let me go! I'll slap her!
- Here you go!

490
00:30:17,705 --> 00:30:20,372
Dech! You can't treat me like this!

491
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:28,277
This is from renting out our land.

492
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:31,258
There'll be more if we keep investing.

493
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:32,791
Did you forget?

494
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:38,145
But if you keep bothering Ms. Malai,

495
00:30:38,402 --> 00:30:40,492
this money won't reach your hands.

496
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:42,029
You dare negotiate with me?

497
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:43,411
I'm not negotiating,

498
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,611
but this is the deal we made.

499
00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:48,381
I'll make sure we keep earning more.

500
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:50,624
while you stop behaving like that!

501
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:55,245
I want you to think of Mueang

502
00:30:55,344 --> 00:30:57,174
and think before you act!

503
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,760
I've never loved you.

504
00:31:01,515 --> 00:31:02,690
Need me to repeat it?

505
00:31:02,864 --> 00:31:04,540
My words shall remain unchanged.

506
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:09,592
But I love you.

507
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:11,507
Do you not think of me at all?

508
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:14,542
If you still want the money,

509
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:16,940
stop harrassing me and Ms. Malai!

510
00:31:18,486 --> 00:31:19,575
And remember,

511
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:21,124
the person I love

512
00:31:21,407 --> 00:31:23,019
is none other than Ms. Malai.

513
00:31:37,614 --> 00:31:38,614
Malai,

514
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:40,214
you keep interfering

515
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:41,667
with all of my relationships!

516
00:32:05,943 --> 00:32:07,288
Ms. Malai.

517
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,985
Here's your butterfly pea drink.

518
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:12,476
Thank you.

519
00:32:23,454 --> 00:32:26,278
Please don't listen to Ms. Ramphoei.

520
00:32:27,386 --> 00:32:29,725
You know how she is.

521
00:32:33,177 --> 00:32:35,976
I didn't take her words to heart.

522
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:37,872
I simply

523
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:40,446
yearn to be far from this place.

524
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:41,701
This return

525
00:32:42,113 --> 00:32:43,713
has confirmed that I

526
00:32:44,537 --> 00:32:45,943
can't live peacefully here.

527
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:51,413
But if you leave,

528
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:53,589
she'll get more conceited.

529
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,559
Isn't she already conceited?

530
00:32:56,202 --> 00:32:58,280
Here or not, I see no difference.

531
00:32:58,592 --> 00:33:00,961
But with you here,

532
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,426
Ms. Ramphoei's toned down.

533
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:04,779
Someone like her

534
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:06,469
can't manage a household.

535
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:07,912
She'll only

536
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:09,663
manage to give us migraines.

537
00:33:11,063 --> 00:33:13,263
So you only worry about yourself.

538
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:15,827
No, ma'am.

539
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:22,134
Fueang!

540
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:25,105
Fueang!

541
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,338
Are you alright?

542
00:33:33,498 --> 00:33:34,862
It's nothing, ma'am.

543
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:37,211
Just feeling a little unwell.

544
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:38,469
Oh dear,

545
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,371
why didn't you tell me you're unwell?

546
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,315
Should I call for a doctor?

547
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:43,418
No need, ma'am.

548
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:46,055
I'll be fine after a rest.

549
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:48,392
Then you better hurry back and rest.

550
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:50,101
Thank you, ma'am.

551
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:57,166
If you'll excuse me.

552
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:00,113
- Be careful on your way.
- Yes, ma'am.

553
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:31,954
Are you awake?

554
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:33,676
Did you sleep well?

555
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:39,343
How did I end up here, in your room?

556
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:50,532
Last night you

557
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:51,708
drank a lot

558
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:53,725
and fell asleep, that's all.

559
00:34:54,355 --> 00:34:55,281
It's expected,

560
00:34:56,425 --> 00:34:57,687
given that it's your

561
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,541
first time drinking.

562
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,717
And why am I...

563
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:12,490
I was drunk.

564
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:14,182
You were drunk.

565
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,293
We had a great time together.

566
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:17,938
You truly don't remember?

567
00:35:18,605 --> 00:35:19,605
Hm?

568
00:35:20,612 --> 00:35:21,612
Baron.

569
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,190
- Yes?
- You're saying...

570
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:35,479
What is it?

571
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:37,900
The Duke requests your presence.

572
00:35:38,515 --> 00:35:39,957
Tell him I'll be there.

573
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:40,877
Yes, my lord.

574
00:35:42,778 --> 00:35:44,172
We'll talk when I get back.

575
00:35:46,587 --> 00:35:47,780
You can wait here.

576
00:35:47,951 --> 00:35:48,817
I don't mind.

577
00:36:58,111 --> 00:36:59,231
Our boy, Mai,

578
00:36:59,748 --> 00:37:00,788
is he asleep?

579
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:02,550
He is, after having some milk.

580
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,558
Our child is so easy to handle,

581
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,261
unlike Mueang

582
00:37:06,328 --> 00:37:08,134
who always fusses about.

583
00:37:08,658 --> 00:37:09,912
Despite his fussing,

584
00:37:10,749 --> 00:37:12,424
he'll grow into a wealthy man.

585
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,272
As for Mai, our boy,

586
00:37:14,503 --> 00:37:15,794
he'd be fortunate to

587
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:17,097
rise above our status.

588
00:37:17,665 --> 00:37:19,416
Mueang will become filthy rich,

589
00:37:19,993 --> 00:37:21,108
taking everything

590
00:37:21,296 --> 00:37:22,574
without having to share.

591
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,441
If he has siblings

592
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:26,696
who aren't from Ramphoei,

593
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:28,108
they won't get anything.

594
00:37:28,684 --> 00:37:29,756
Someone like her,

595
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:32,043
greedy and evil, she won't let

596
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:33,372
the fortune be shared

597
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:35,130
with someone else's baby.

598
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:19,599
Fate is cruel, my lord.

599
00:38:20,018 --> 00:38:21,884
You've wanted a baby for so long,

600
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:24,001
but the baby's in my womb.

601
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:32,782
No, my lord!

602
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:33,946
My lord, release me!

603
00:38:36,926 --> 00:38:37,926
Are you surprised?

604
00:38:40,748 --> 00:38:42,301
If they know about this,

605
00:38:42,568 --> 00:38:44,636
the baby will get the inheritance.

606
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:47,555
But I won't let it

607
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:50,059
have any of that fortune!

608
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,537
The damned inheritance

609
00:38:54,562 --> 00:38:56,654
made through your abuse, causing

610
00:38:57,426 --> 00:38:59,012
tragedy after tragedy!

611
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:02,462
It's not just me,

612
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:03,929
Dech,

613
00:39:03,935 --> 00:39:04,975
Or Ms. Malai.

614
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:06,807
Even the baby inside me,

615
00:39:06,832 --> 00:39:08,719
who knows what tragedy will befall

616
00:39:08,744 --> 00:39:10,298
from your cursed fortunes!

617
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:14,665
All of this

618
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:17,879
happened solely because

619
00:39:17,904 --> 00:39:19,517
of your own selfishness!

620
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:44,964
Help!

622
00:39:55,053 --> 00:40:00,061
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

623
00:40:12,295 --> 00:40:13,907
For my child's safety,

624
00:40:14,362 --> 00:40:16,253
nobody will know the truth.

625
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,663
I won't say who the father is.

626
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:23,226
Your lineage,

627
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:26,908
will end with you.

628
00:40:27,712 --> 00:40:28,857
I don't care to whom

629
00:40:28,882 --> 00:40:30,225
the fortune will go!

630
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:34,426
I know, my lord.

631
00:40:34,695 --> 00:40:37,088
You must be furious

632
00:40:37,414 --> 00:40:38,974
that things will end this way.

633
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,423
But you deserve it, my lord.

634
00:40:41,782 --> 00:40:43,587
For all the things done to me,

635
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,027
to Dech,

636
00:40:45,495 --> 00:40:46,601
and to your child.

637
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:52,163
Ma'am,

638
00:41:56,627 --> 00:41:57,747
Hey, handsome.

639
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:00,345
I saw you in the pub.

640
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:01,989
You've drank a lot

641
00:42:02,034 --> 00:42:03,013
and I was worried.

642
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:04,740
Can I walk you home, ma'am?

643
00:42:04,827 --> 00:42:05,827
Dear,

644
00:42:05,915 --> 00:42:07,942
you're handsome and also kind.

645
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:11,131
I appreciate your kind gesture.

646
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,430
What if...

647
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:16,295
I don't want to go home?

648
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,327
I'm still in the mood for some fun

649
00:42:19,386 --> 00:42:20,505
with you.

650
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,959
What do you say, my dear?

651
00:42:24,363 --> 00:42:25,782
If that's what you want,

652
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,022
I wouldn't refuse you.

653
00:42:27,902 --> 00:42:30,535
Well, I do have a place in mind.

654
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:34,009
Lead the way, then.

655
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:35,462
Follow me.

656
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,531
Are we not there yet?

657
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:48,862
Why is it so far?

658
00:42:49,548 --> 00:42:50,988
Be patient, ma'am.

659
00:42:51,348 --> 00:42:54,221
I assure you, heaven is not far away.

660
00:42:55,822 --> 00:42:57,415
Don't be all talk.

661
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:03,165
How about we find our way to heaven,

662
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:04,631
ma'am?

663
00:43:05,005 --> 00:43:06,005
What?

664
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,463
I mean, the pleasure heaven, ma'am.

665
00:43:10,365 --> 00:43:11,451
No, I don't want to!

666
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:12,905
Don't want heaven?

667
00:43:13,113 --> 00:43:14,539
Then how about hell?

668
00:43:18,705 --> 00:43:19,618
Help!

669
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:52,458
Phoem!

670
00:43:52,578 --> 00:43:53,578
It's me.

671
00:44:00,452 --> 00:44:01,672
Let go!

672
00:44:02,382 --> 00:44:04,368
Why did you drag me all this way?

673
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:06,224
You're already a mother,

674
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:07,771
where's your morality?

675
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,652
If I hadn't followed you,

676
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:11,978
you'd already be dead.

677
00:44:13,096 --> 00:44:15,329
Don't scold me, scold Dech!

678
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:17,995
He's not doing his duty as my man.

679
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:20,078
So you're looking for some action?

680
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:21,638
With strangers, even!

681
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,444
Brother, are you a father now?

682
00:44:23,471 --> 00:44:24,979
Stop your preaching!

683
00:44:25,241 --> 00:44:28,114
I'm only human. I have desires!

684
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,053
Otherwise, I'd already become a nun.

685
00:44:37,163 --> 00:44:38,163
About Dech,

686
00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:39,805
when will it end?

687
00:44:42,087 --> 00:44:43,260
If he's such a pain,

688
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,933
I'll just finish him.

689
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,677
No, you can't!

690
00:44:46,814 --> 00:44:49,268
He's still managing my lord's fortune.

691
00:44:49,547 --> 00:44:51,281
Neither of us can't do it.

692
00:44:53,062 --> 00:44:54,288
But if you want to help,

693
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:56,498
can you get rid of Malai for me?

694
00:44:57,025 --> 00:44:58,025
Without her,

695
00:44:58,189 --> 00:44:59,549
Dech might cave in

696
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:01,282
and become my man willingly.

697
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,963
I just ate, Dech.

698
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:13,308
Eat some more.

699
00:45:13,527 --> 00:45:15,527
Just think of the baby inside you.

700
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:17,435
What medicine is Fueang brewing?

701
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:19,503
Medicine for the pregnant.

702
00:45:19,749 --> 00:45:21,715
You two should stop lying!

703
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,612
You try to steal my man?

704
00:45:28,273 --> 00:45:31,419
You will pay for all your sins!

705
00:45:31,454 --> 00:45:34,700
Malai has one friend she holds dear.

706
00:45:34,997 --> 00:45:37,377
I know she'll rush over to see her.
