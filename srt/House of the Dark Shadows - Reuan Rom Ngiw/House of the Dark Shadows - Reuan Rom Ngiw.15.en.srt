"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 15)

19
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:00,097
Dech!

20
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:03,897
- You have to do it!
- No!

21
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:06,184
It's an order! You have to do it!

22
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:08,199
I won't do it.

23
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:19,729
Where are you going, Dech?

24
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:21,509
Let go of me, Ms. Ramphoei.

25
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:24,556
My dear Dech,
don't do this to your wife.

26
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:26,988
Don't address me like that, ma'am.

27
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:28,893
I'm not your husband.

28
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,643
You must be tired
getting back from the department.

29
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,951
Drink some orange juice
so you feel refreshed.

30
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:42,179
I had Uan make it fresh for you.

31
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:45,027
Thanks, Malai.

32
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,833
It's my duty, my lord.

33
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,672
Good morning, my lord.

34
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:57,347
Ms. Malai.

35
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,676
I'm glad you're here.

36
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,830
Why don't you join us?

37
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:03,987
It's okay.

38
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:08,519
Prepare my meal
and take it to my room.

39
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:11,047
I feel a little tired today.

40
00:03:11,494 --> 00:03:13,067
Yes, Ms. Ramphoei.

41
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:14,802
Orange juice, sir.

42
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,330
Thanks, Uan.

43
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,703
Oh, there's orange juice today.

44
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:21,663
Can you pour me a glass, Uan?

45
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,950
I'm afraid I can't.

46
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:27,008
Because Ms. Malai had me
make it for only His Lordship.

47
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:36,976
Your Lordship,

48
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:40,582
can't I have one glass
of orange juice?

49
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:45,316
I had it made because he's tired
from staying the night at work.

50
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:48,882
If you want some, why don't
you have Chaem make it for you?

51
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:55,412
My lord, but I want to
have some right now.

52
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,407
Uan.

53
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:03,407
Pour Ms. Ramphoei a glass.

54
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:06,450
- My lord...
- Didn't you hear me?

55
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:09,873
Yes, my lord.

56
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:19,308
Chaem,

57
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:22,222
take everything to my room.

58
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:24,322
Yes, Ms. Ramphoei.

59
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:46,556
Did you see Malai's face?

60
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:48,720
She was baffled.

61
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,200
I did. I wanted to laugh so bad.

62
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,569
She's always so arrogant with me.

63
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:58,009
Now she knows who rules this house.

64
00:04:58,483 --> 00:04:59,483
You're right.

65
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:04,721
But aren't you going to eat?

66
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:07,033
You can have it. It's all yours.

67
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:08,928
Really, ma'am?

68
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:13,075
Yes, I'm so happy
I'm too full to eat anything.

69
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:14,643
Thank you, ma'am.

70
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:34,720
Ms. Malai?

71
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:37,578
I really don't understand

72
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:41,404
why His Lordship let
Ms. Ramphoei insult you like that.

73
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:44,879
I don't know why either, Uan.

74
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,031
Or...

75
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:49,551
Ms. Ramphoei's
trying to cajole him?

76
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,051
Leave it alone, Uan.

77
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:56,376
What happened happened.
Don't worry yourself about it.

78
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:00,271
That won't do, Ms. Malai.

79
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:03,651
If His Lordship's ends up any
more charmed by Ms. Ramphoei,

80
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:05,698
you'll be in a difficult situation.

81
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:07,553
Thanks for your concern.

82
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:10,803
But whomever he favors

83
00:06:11,683 --> 00:06:12,683
is fine with me.

84
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:14,664
I don't want to force
anyone anymore.

85
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,812
I can't help despising her.

86
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,763
- I saw...
- It's a beautiful day.

87
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:21,603
I think I'll go pick flowers.

88
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,967
Hey.

89
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,779
Why isn't she possessive
over her husband?

90
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,187
It's so bizarre.

91
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,663
Last night must have gone well.

92
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:45,326
Ramphoei acted all fearless
with me and Malai this morning.

93
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:48,643
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:51,333
But wasn't that
what you want, my lord?

95
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:54,479
If Ms. Ramphoei
doesn't get pregnant,

96
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:57,492
I have no idea how to help you.

97
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:00,900
But if she gets pregnant,
you'll leave me anyway.

98
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:04,893
Yes, sir.

99
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,638
A promise is a promise,
isn't it, my lord?

100
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:09,819
But I still want you with me.

101
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,026
When Ms. Ramphoei gives birth,

102
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:15,777
you will get your inheritance.

103
00:07:16,272 --> 00:07:19,809
Whomever you want then
wouldn't dare refuse you.

104
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,239
But not you.

105
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:23,885
No, sir.

106
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:25,991
You won't need me, sir.

107
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:32,262
Please let me go back to work.

108
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:53,163
(One month later)

109
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:56,968
Are you okay, Ms. Ramphoei?

110
00:07:56,994 --> 00:07:58,334
Want me to get a doctor?

111
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:00,972
What are you waiting for? Get him!

112
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,747
Are you really that sick?

113
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,301
You idiot!

114
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,119
I've been barfing every morning.

115
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:12,060
If I'm not sick,
what else can I be?

116
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:17,341
Really, Chaem?
Is Ramphoei really pregnant?

117
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:18,488
Really, my lord.

118
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:21,815
The doctor I sent for
told me that himself.

119
00:08:23,221 --> 00:08:25,087
Good. That's very good news.

120
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,087
Here. Take it. It's yours.

121
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:31,461
Really, my lord?

122
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:33,991
Your reward
for bringing me good news.

123
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,156
Thank you, my lord.

124
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:37,989
Go take care of
your master, Chaem.

125
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,142
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

126
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,389
Malai.

127
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,470
Malai.

128
00:08:53,685 --> 00:08:54,685
Malai.

129
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:58,391
Malai, hear my out, please.

130
00:09:00,782 --> 00:09:03,283
What excuse are you
going to give me?

131
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:06,954
Didn't you tell me
you were sterile?

132
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,777
I didn't lie about that.

133
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:12,182
I'd already thought I was sterile
because my doctor told me I was.

134
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:13,582
Plus my brother is too.

135
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:16,947
I have no idea
how Ramphoei got pregnant.

136
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:19,629
The heavens may have pitied me.

137
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:23,096
That is such a broad justification.

138
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:26,209
I can't possibly argue with that.

139
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:27,849
Malai.

140
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:31,489
Please believe me.
I really didn't lie to you.

141
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:34,127
It doesn't matter

142
00:09:34,913 --> 00:09:36,719
whether I believe you or not.

143
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:39,353
Now that you're having a child...

144
00:09:42,904 --> 00:09:44,951
let me be direct with you, my lord.

145
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,291
What is it?

146
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:49,944
I want a divorce.

147
00:09:55,617 --> 00:09:59,363
Hey, Malai,
is this some kind of a joke?

148
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,700
What's your reason
for divorcing me?

149
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:04,504
I've never hurt you.

150
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,357
I've never wronged you.

151
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:09,316
Of course you have.
You've hurt me. You...

152
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:12,221
Are you gonna tell the court
about you sleeping with Dech?

153
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:19,067
If you do, the only one
disgraced would be you.

154
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:23,474
Who would believe that
I ordered you to sleep with Dech?

155
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:36,086
Malai, please don't divorce me.

156
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:38,887
I really love you.

157
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:43,712
Nothing can take you away from me.

158
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:46,790
Not even death.

159
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:02,611
Don't think I would ever
let you take Dech from me.

160
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:28,111
Ms. Ramphoei.

161
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:30,174
Don't do this, ma'am.

162
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:32,094
Someone might see.

163
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:35,608
Dech, this shouldn't shock you.

164
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,634
That's not funny, Ms. Ramphoei.

165
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:43,481
Dech, you don't have to be afraid.

166
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:46,551
I'm already your wife.

167
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,010
And the child in my belly...

168
00:11:52,785 --> 00:11:53,994
is yours.

169
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,191
Don't say that, ma'am.

170
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:01,860
The child in your belly
is His Lordship's, not mine.

171
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:04,637
We'll be in trouble
if someone hear you.

172
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,777
Let them hear.

173
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:11,419
So that our child gets
this house in the future.

174
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,484
There's nothing to be afraid of.

175
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,779
Am I saying anything wrong?

176
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:22,496
As soon as our child gets
everything from His Lordship,

177
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,532
you will get your cut
as the father.

178
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,603
Unless you're planning
on leaving our child.

179
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,761
I don't know
what you're talking about.

180
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,741
I have work to do.

181
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:40,697
Please excuse me.

182
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:50,572
You can't avoid me for long,

183
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:52,191
Dech.

184
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,072
Take that.

185
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,332
I told you to move,
but you wouldn't.

186
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:05,999
But this isn't your room.

187
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:09,139
How about that?

188
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:12,183
Uan, shut your mouth
if you're clueless.

189
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:14,165
Don't think of insulting me.

190
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:17,684
What's so noble about you
that I can't insult you?

191
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:19,222
This is Ms. Malai's room.

192
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:21,336
You have no right
to even be in here!

193
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,189
- Watch your mouth.
- Stop it!

194
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:26,813
What's going on here?

195
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:31,388
They're moving
their things into your room.

196
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:34,666
When I stopped them,
they ganged up on me.

197
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:42,090
This is my room.

198
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:44,592
How can you move in here, Ramphoei?

199
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:47,191
My old room is too small.

200
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,484
And I'm currently carrying
His Lordship's child.

201
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:56,211
So I felt confined in that room
and wanted to move in here, ma'am.

202
00:13:56,678 --> 00:13:57,991
Who gave you that permission?

203
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:01,582
My goodness,
you must haven't heard

204
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:06,085
that His Lordship gave me
full power to run this household.

205
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:11,516
So I can do anything in this house.

206
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,345
What you're asking
is a lot, my lord.

207
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:19,514
You will hurt both
my honor and my feelings

208
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,500
for having to sleep
with another man.

209
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,697
But if you want me to do it,

210
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:29,646
can I ask one thing from you?

211
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:31,771
What is it that you want?

212
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,012
I want full power
to run the household

213
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:37,531
in place of Ms. Malai.

214
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:40,550
Both its finance and personnel.

215
00:14:41,193 --> 00:14:44,012
Can I have full control, my lord?

216
00:14:53,038 --> 00:14:54,823
But he didn't give
Chaem permission.

217
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:00,732
Why would he have to?

218
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:09,224
That's a lesson that you can't
hurt my people in this house.

219
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,477
Come, Uan.

220
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:20,975
Can she do that?

221
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:23,355
Stop talking. Unpack my things.

222
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:26,982
I almost hit the door, ma'am.

223
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:41,242
Even heaven and earth are no more,
I still want to be with you, Malai.

224
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:43,650
I don't believe a word you say.

225
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:49,549
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

226
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:54,542
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

227
00:15:56,962 --> 00:16:00,289
I caved because she's pregnant.

228
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:01,952
I didn't want to offend her.

229
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:07,179
If you love and appease
Ramphoei this much,

230
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:09,950
there's no reason
for you to keep me here

231
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:11,272
as your wife.

232
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:13,855
Just divorce me
and get it over with.

233
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:18,100
I already told you
I truly loved you.

234
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,307
Even if heaven and earth are no more,
I still want to be with you, Malai.

235
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:28,774
I don't believe a word you say.

236
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:33,249
If you don't believe in my love,

237
00:16:33,803 --> 00:16:35,423
then believe in our friendship.

238
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:37,802
Aside from the business with Dech,

239
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:39,747
I've never wronged you, Malai.

240
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,779
Ramphoei.

241
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,793
You could at least
be considerate of me.

242
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:55,087
Why did you have to
insult Malai like that?

243
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:59,813
Do I have to be considerate
and thoughtful of anyone?

244
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:01,215
Ramphoei.

245
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,480
Isn't all this what I deserve
to have, my lord?

246
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:07,280
You're crossing the line.

247
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:08,923
I'm not.

248
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:13,950
Don't you forget
what you promised me.

249
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:20,437
One day, the child in my belly
will be the owner of this house.

250
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:23,596
Whichever room in this house
I want to sleep in

251
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:25,774
is within my rights, my lord.

252
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:27,069
Insolent.

253
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:29,875
You're already acting like
a toad riding a palanquin.

254
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:30,933
You...

255
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:36,738
But this toad is where she is
because you wanted her.

256
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:42,886
If you don't have me,

257
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:46,468
you won't get your inheritance,
will you, my lord?

258
00:18:56,203 --> 00:19:00,849
You probably understand now
who, in fact, have the power here.

259
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:47,406
Ms. Malai,

260
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:49,584
I warned you, ma'am,

261
00:19:50,297 --> 00:19:52,152
that you'd be
in a difficult situation.

262
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:56,124
Even if I tried to fight her,

263
00:19:56,714 --> 00:19:58,478
it would still end up this way.

264
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:01,184
Dear me, Ms. Malai.

265
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:05,482
Why are you talking like this?

266
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:07,895
It's the truth, Uan.

267
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:10,795
Ramphoei's carrying
His Lordship's child.

268
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:12,800
How can I compete?

269
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,726
But I'm afraid...

270
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,274
this house will be in turmoil.

271
00:20:19,414 --> 00:20:20,723
It won't be that bad.

272
00:20:22,223 --> 00:20:24,906
All right. You've moved
all my things here, right?

273
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,443
Not yet. Fueang will
bring more tomorrow.

274
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:37,050
Thank you very much, Uan,

275
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:41,706
for helping me to the point
you got yourself hurt.

276
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:43,702
It's okay, ma'am.

277
00:20:44,093 --> 00:20:45,442
It's been my pleasure.

278
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:49,806
Uh...

279
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:02,066
What are you looking for?

280
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,497
This perfume is heavenly.

281
00:21:14,276 --> 00:21:15,276
It's yours.

282
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:18,792
Is that a good idea?

283
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:20,950
It's expensive.

284
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:24,379
Think of it as your reward
for protecting me.

285
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:25,858
Take it.

286
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:28,305
Thank you, ma'am.

287
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:47,237
Why did it smell so bad?

288
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:55,827
I'm pregnant, honey.

289
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:01,287
Congratulations, Kam.
You're gonna be a father.

290
00:22:01,594 --> 00:22:02,594
Thanks, Dech.

291
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:03,767
Hey,

292
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:06,267
from now on, lay off hard labor.

293
00:22:06,645 --> 00:22:08,692
Or let me know
if you have to do it.

294
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:11,291
- I'll do it for you!
- I will, Kam.

295
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,098
Dech!

296
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:15,331
Dech!

297
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:16,905
Dech! Dech! Dech!

298
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:20,111
Ms. Ramphoei fell! Go help her!

299
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:21,805
Move!

300
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:31,069
Weasel.

301
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,120
I heard that.

302
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,809
Whatever.

303
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,209
Ms. Ramphoei! Ms. Ramphoei!

304
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,156
Ms. Ramphoei.

305
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:40,596
How are you feeling, ma'am?

306
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:42,619
My leg really hurts, Dech.

307
00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:44,556
Let me help.

308
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:51,079
I can't walk, Dech.

309
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:53,791
Forgive me.

310
00:23:01,502 --> 00:23:02,502
It hurts.

311
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,803
It hurts so bad.

312
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,243
Ms. Ramphoei.

313
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,127
How are you feeling?

314
00:23:21,588 --> 00:23:22,928
What are you doing, ma'am?

315
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:28,735
I'm just wondering if you're
worried about me or our child.

316
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:31,055
Don't joke about this,
Ms. Ramphoei.

317
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:33,625
Where does it hurt?
Does your belly hurt?

318
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:35,438
Dech.

319
00:23:35,985 --> 00:23:37,914
Pay some attention to your wife.

320
00:23:38,122 --> 00:23:39,896
You're His Lordship's wife,

321
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:41,022
not mine.

322
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,635
My dear Dech, no matter
how much you protest,

323
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:47,102
the child in my belly

324
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:50,588
is proof that you're my husband.

325
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:56,195
To be honest, I love you
more than I love His Lordship.

326
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,860
Someone like you doesn't know
how to love anyone.

327
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:05,147
Do you want me to prove it? Huh?

328
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:08,341
Ms. Ramphoei, don't do this.

329
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:10,424
You'll be in danger
if His Lordship sees us.

330
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:12,528
What can he do?

331
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:14,989
Without me, he'll lose this child

332
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,082
along with his inheritance.

333
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:18,882
There's nothing
to be afraid of, Dech.

334
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:21,411
You don't know His Lordship.

335
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:23,638
I'm warning you
because I mean well.

336
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,372
Stop saying that the child is mine.

337
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,361
And leave me alone.

338
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,008
Then you must come
to my room tonight.

339
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
Why?

340
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:38,861
Because if you don't,

341
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:40,813
I won't take care of myself.

342
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,058
I won't eat or drink.

343
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,440
And if something happens
to this child,

344
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,542
you can't blame me.

345
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:54,497
In my entire life,

346
00:24:55,114 --> 00:24:57,105
I've never met anyone as vile

347
00:24:57,634 --> 00:24:59,405
and as shameless as you.

348
00:25:02,355 --> 00:25:04,115
No matter how shameless I am,

349
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:07,696
I'm still the mother
of your child, Dech.

350
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:46,384
Thank you for
paying me a visit, Malai.

351
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,677
It's my pleasure, my lord.

352
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:54,017
Ever since Ms. Malai dropped by,
you've looked much better, my lord.

353
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:56,385
Of course.

354
00:25:57,378 --> 00:25:58,711
Because no matter what,

355
00:25:59,384 --> 00:26:01,120
I won't die easily.

356
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:05,492
Not until Wisan gives me an heir

357
00:26:05,845 --> 00:26:08,030
whom I can hold in my arms.

358
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:12,589
Even if the child's mother
is his concubine.

359
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:14,028
What's her name again?

360
00:26:14,603 --> 00:26:15,684
Ramphoei, my lord.

361
00:26:15,695 --> 00:26:17,814
Yeah, even if it's by Ramphoei.

362
00:26:19,306 --> 00:26:20,572
It's my fault

363
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:24,565
that I can't give you
an heir, my lord.

364
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,954
Don't blame yourself, Malai.

365
00:26:28,423 --> 00:26:30,230
And don't worry about anything.

366
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:35,288
Because even though Wisan's child
doesn't come from you,

367
00:26:36,324 --> 00:26:39,774
I will still give you
some of my fortune.

368
00:26:41,355 --> 00:26:42,626
And no matter what,

369
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:45,661
I won't let anyone insult you

370
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:49,869
and say marrying into my family
leaves you destitute.

371
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:51,775
Thank you, my lord.

372
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,461
That's good news, Malai.

373
00:27:05,432 --> 00:27:07,152
Do you find me so disgusting?

374
00:27:07,645 --> 00:27:09,598
I'm not an ugly woman.

375
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:12,111
You should thank their lucky stars

376
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:15,080
that you got to sleep with me!

377
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:21,185
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

378
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:26,178
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

379
00:27:28,518 --> 00:27:29,985
It's infuriating

380
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:32,117
that she got pregnant first.

381
00:27:32,924 --> 00:27:34,217
The viscount's heir

382
00:27:34,631 --> 00:27:36,729
shouldn't come from
a concubine like her.

383
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:41,708
There's no telling
what nature that child will have

384
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:44,541
since their mother is so vile.

385
00:27:44,754 --> 00:27:47,531
Ranchuan, don't waste your breath.

386
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:49,417
Things have gotten this far.

387
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:51,810
You're right, my lord.

388
00:27:53,197 --> 00:27:55,463
Well, it's infuriating, my lord.

389
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:59,041
Malai,

390
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:02,801
don't get discouraged
and don't back down.

391
00:28:03,888 --> 00:28:06,653
Because you're still
the viscount's wife.

392
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,180
If you have a child,
your child will replace her child.

393
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,698
I prepared myself, ma'am.

394
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:15,580
Even if I can't give him a child,

395
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,913
I'm not troubled anymore.

396
00:28:18,107 --> 00:28:19,993
Why do you say that, Ms. Malai?

397
00:28:20,947 --> 00:28:21,947
Yeah.

398
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:24,433
You used to seem
frightened of being helpless.

399
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:26,968
Why do you seem so assured now?

400
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:30,682
Probably because
I already made peace

401
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:34,387
with the fact that the viscount
would never prefer me to Ramphoei.

402
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:37,963
Don't talk like you've lost
the will to live, Malai.

403
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,794
It worries me.

404
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:42,833
Or are you feeling assured

405
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:45,220
because you think
you'll get money from my father?

406
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:46,841
Not at all, my lord.

407
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:50,946
Even if he didn't promise
to give me some money,

408
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,627
I finally realized...

409
00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:58,981
no matter how much money I have,

410
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:02,143
it's no match for
happiness and peace of mind.

411
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:06,339
But peace of mind doesn't
guarantee physical comfort.

412
00:29:08,312 --> 00:29:10,110
I believe that old saying,

413
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:13,823
"A happy hut is better than
a gloomy castle."

414
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:17,265
As long as I have
a brain and two hands,

415
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:19,556
even without the viscount's money,

416
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:22,133
I doubt I'd starve to death.

417
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:27,720
I'll take my leave.

418
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:37,125
My lord?

419
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:40,565
Do you agree

420
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:42,785
that Ms. Malai seems different?

421
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:44,492
Of course.

422
00:29:45,465 --> 00:29:46,805
She suddenly seems determined

423
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,669
like she has a goal

424
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:51,438
or something to hold on to.

425
00:29:51,972 --> 00:29:53,119
Exactly, my lord.

426
00:29:54,312 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm truly curious

427
00:29:56,285 --> 00:29:57,659
what that thing is.

428
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,958
Then you must come
to my room tonight.

429
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:37,733
If you don't,

430
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:40,087
I won't take care of myself.

431
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:42,305
I won't eat or drink.

432
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,160
And if something happens
to this child,

433
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:47,432
you can't blame me.

434
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:16,755
Chaem,

435
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:19,268
sleep in the servant house tonight.

436
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,347
Don't come up here
unless you're called.

437
00:31:21,627 --> 00:31:22,627
Eh?

438
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Uh...

439
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:26,587
Why, ma'am?

440
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,808
Pregnant women
should have someone nearby.

441
00:31:30,174 --> 00:31:32,587
Bitch, just do as you're told!

442
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,713
Don't get too nosy.

443
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,727
Yes, ma'am.

444
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
Get lost!

445
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:41,493
Uh, I'm going, ma'am.

446
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:10,739
Dech!

447
00:32:11,245 --> 00:32:12,245
Fueang!

448
00:32:12,412 --> 00:32:13,472
Where are you going?

449
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,632
You started me.

450
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,427
What were you doing?

451
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:21,571
Answer me first. I asked you first
where you were going.

452
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:26,534
Serving His Lordship again?

453
00:32:28,173 --> 00:32:29,426
You!

454
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:31,946
But he's about to have a baby.

455
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,486
It's none of your business, Fueang.

456
00:32:37,113 --> 00:32:40,639
I understand repaying
His Lordship's kindness, Dech.

457
00:32:40,665 --> 00:32:42,312
What I don't understand is...

458
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:47,425
Why does he send
for you at night again

459
00:32:47,905 --> 00:32:49,409
when his mistress is pregnant?

460
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:51,334
Even if it's to serve him,

461
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,690
I still can't refuse.

462
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:55,357
It's an order.

463
00:32:57,623 --> 00:32:58,746
But don't worry.

464
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:01,769
I don't have to do this for long.

465
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:04,259
What are you talking about?

466
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:06,549
You and I will be free soon.

467
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:08,707
I'll get you out of here.

468
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:10,993
With everything we've been through,

469
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:12,953
I won't abandon you, Fueang.

470
00:33:31,996 --> 00:33:33,116
What the heck?

471
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:43,438
Come in.

472
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:49,855
You've been gone all day
even though I'm pregnant.

473
00:33:55,248 --> 00:33:56,607
Uh, my lord.

474
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,647
I was at the department all day.

475
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,432
How could I stay with you?

476
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,981
You're talking funny.

477
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,610
I'm just happy
you're back, my lord.

478
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:15,516
Dech told me you were sick.

479
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:18,193
I don't see what's wrong with you.

480
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:23,778
Just seeing your face
cured me of my illness.

481
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,736
I'm glad you're okay.

482
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:33,329
No matter what,
nothing can happen to you.

483
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,605
Not until
you give birth to my child.

484
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,139
Yes, my lord.

485
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:42,433
I feel sticky.
I'm gonna wash myself.

486
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:13,404
What the hell are you doing?

487
00:35:16,892 --> 00:35:17,892
Ms. Ramphoei.

488
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,542
I should be asking
what the hell you were thinking.

489
00:35:20,706 --> 00:35:22,393
I don't know
what you're talking about.

490
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:25,679
But if it's about my report
to His Lordship that you were sick,

491
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:27,365
I thought it was the right thing.

492
00:35:27,412 --> 00:35:28,988
You're crossing the line, Dech!

493
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,850
I'm your damn wife!
How could you do that to me?!

494
00:35:31,861 --> 00:35:32,861
Ms. Ramphoei!

495
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:35,441
Stop screaming.
Do you want to die young?

496
00:35:35,595 --> 00:35:36,595
Huh?

497
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:42,308
I screamed to let everyone know
that you were my husband!

498
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,718
How would that kill me?!

499
00:35:44,027 --> 00:35:45,699
Don't play dumb, Ms. Ramphoei.

500
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:49,931
If someone suspects
your child isn't the viscount's

501
00:35:49,953 --> 00:35:51,574
and he loses out on
his inheritance,

502
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,913
you and I will never survive.

503
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:58,595
If you want me quiet,
be nice to me!

504
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:01,483
Why aren't you worried
about me and our child?!

505
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:03,401
I was coerced.

506
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,834
Ever since I gave in
to His Lordship's request,

507
00:36:05,988 --> 00:36:09,507
I made up my mind that the child
in your belly wasn't mine.

508
00:36:11,406 --> 00:36:12,573
You son of a bitch.

509
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:15,333
You dare abandon your own child.

510
00:36:15,979 --> 00:36:18,492
How are you
His Lordship's confidant?

511
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,571
I was foolish to hope

512
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,268
that after I slept with you,
you would care for me.

513
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:26,287
I was wrong.

514
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,624
Your heart's more
beastly than a dog's!

515
00:36:30,851 --> 00:36:33,360
I never thought to care for you.

516
00:36:33,764 --> 00:36:36,454
I never loved or even fancied you.

517
00:36:38,298 --> 00:36:39,298
Therefore,

518
00:36:40,468 --> 00:36:41,970
leave me alone.

519
00:36:51,649 --> 00:36:52,705
Why?

520
00:36:52,716 --> 00:36:54,436
Do you find me so disgusting?

521
00:36:54,935 --> 00:36:56,888
I'm not an ugly woman.

522
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:59,395
You should thank their lucky stars

523
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:02,376
that you got to sleep with me!

524
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:07,609
I would never like someone
so selfish and greedy like you!

525
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,927
Even though you don't fancy me,

526
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:13,107
but I'm your wife.

527
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:15,314
You can't erase that fact.

528
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:20,368
Do you hear me clearly
that I'm your damn wife!

529
00:37:22,725 --> 00:37:24,414
In this life or any life,

530
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:27,254
you would never be my wife.

531
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:31,698
Because someone like you
doesn't love anyone but yourself.

532
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:34,408
And now you air your dirty laundry.

533
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:38,336
One day you will die horribly.

534
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:45,466
Dech, did you just
put a curse on me?!

535
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:48,446
You slave, come back here!
I said come back here!

536
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:50,046
Dech!

537
00:38:01,898 --> 00:38:06,458
In the end, you have to use
a vile woman like me.

538
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:09,044
Because you can't have
children on your own!

00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:20,840
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

541
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,751
Here you go, ma'am.

542
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:34,969
What are you looking at?

543
00:38:35,436 --> 00:38:37,852
Get more. This isn't enough. Go.

544
00:38:38,262 --> 00:38:40,062
But you're pregnant, ma'am.

545
00:38:40,229 --> 00:38:42,217
I think you should stop drinking.

546
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,631
Let me take that.

547
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:46,189
Ms. Ramphoei.

548
00:38:49,891 --> 00:38:51,753
Just do as you're told.

549
00:38:52,611 --> 00:38:54,178
Or do you want to fight me, Chaem?!

550
00:38:54,189 --> 00:38:56,498
Oh, no, ma'am! I won't dare.

551
00:38:56,731 --> 00:38:59,444
I'm just worried about
the baby, Ms. Ramphoei.

552
00:39:00,732 --> 00:39:01,889
None of your business.

553
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,896
I said get more, so get more!

554
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:07,185
- Get me some snacks too!
- Yes, ma'am.

555
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:08,745
- Go! Go! Go!
- I'm going.

556
00:39:20,312 --> 00:39:21,438
I really want to know

557
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,947
how heartless you can be toward me,

558
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:27,331
Dech.

559
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:40,016
You slighted the duke like that,

560
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:42,083
how can you see him in the future?

561
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:45,277
I don't mind not seeing him.

562
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:48,809
Working for the government
these days doesn't pay much.

563
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,505
I won't get rich from it
like our father did.

564
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,043
Even if it doesn't pay much,
you must consider the future.

565
00:39:55,303 --> 00:39:58,476
If he targets you, blocking you
from promotion, what will you do?

566
00:40:00,923 --> 00:40:03,560
It's this kind of thinking
that holds his country back.

567
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,493
Hard work doesn't matter

568
00:40:05,747 --> 00:40:08,240
if our bosses only care
about ranks and titles.

569
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:13,820
It's the nature of government work.

570
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:16,440
It's impossible to get
everything you want.

571
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,043
If that's the case, I'll quit.

572
00:40:19,563 --> 00:40:22,716
If government officials don't think
about their country's benefits,

573
00:40:23,017 --> 00:40:25,064
they should be ashamed and quit.

574
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,570
Come on now,

575
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,517
everyone in our family
has worked for the government.

576
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:32,884
If you quit,
what will you do for a living?

577
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,763
I won't need to do anything.

578
00:40:38,297 --> 00:40:40,036
As soon as I get my inheritance,

579
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:41,650
I'll quit.

580
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:44,077
As for you,

581
00:40:44,523 --> 00:40:48,373
feel free to bow down to fools for
pocket change and become a duke.

582
00:40:48,757 --> 00:40:49,960
I'm not doing it.

583
00:41:09,997 --> 00:41:10,997
My lord.

584
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:14,563
You must be tired. Go relax
at the pavilion by the canal.

585
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:17,124
I arranged everything
for you there.

586
00:41:17,623 --> 00:41:19,643
No. I'd rather wash myself.

587
00:41:19,863 --> 00:41:22,763
My lord, please go relax
at the pavilion by the canal.

588
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,870
The house isn't tidy yet.

589
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:28,243
Give me some time
to take care of it.

590
00:41:28,543 --> 00:41:29,920
I want to relax in the house.

591
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,140
Don't you understand?

592
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:34,880
I've been chastised enough
by selfish people today.

593
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:37,104
Don't make me fight with you too.

594
00:41:37,526 --> 00:41:38,540
Come on, Saeng.

595
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,730
Yes, my lord.

596
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,760
Who the hell are you
to dare block my path?!

597
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:02,367
Ramphoei.

598
00:42:06,763 --> 00:42:09,230
It's bad enough
for a woman to drink,

599
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,316
but you're doing it in broad
daylight like a prostitute.

600
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:13,683
Why are you do thoughtless?

601
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:17,677
So what? What's wrong
with being a prostitute?

602
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:22,790
In the end, you have to use
a vile woman like me.

603
00:42:23,521 --> 00:42:25,448
Because you can't have
children on your own!

604
00:42:31,776 --> 00:42:33,429
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.

605
00:42:33,777 --> 00:42:36,920
But if you say that again,
don't blame me for being mean.

606
00:42:39,197 --> 00:42:40,197
Saeng.

607
00:42:40,217 --> 00:42:42,960
I'm telling the truth!
Can't you accept it?!

608
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:48,830
Ramphoei!

609
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:51,703
Don't insult
His Lordship like that.

610
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,843
I want to. What are you gonna do?

611
00:42:53,957 --> 00:42:54,957
Butt out!

612
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,480
- Go!
- Malai.

613
00:42:57,477 --> 00:42:59,724
My lord, please
don't mind the drunk.

614
00:43:00,183 --> 00:43:02,796
Saeng, take Ramphoei
up to her room!

615
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,200
Don't let me see her walking
around like this again!

616
00:43:05,477 --> 00:43:06,477
Yes, sir.

617
00:43:07,103 --> 00:43:08,103
I'm not going.

618
00:43:08,116 --> 00:43:11,170
I'm not a pet that you can
shoo away. I'm not going!

619
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:12,443
- Don't argue, ma'am.
- Let go!

620
00:43:12,454 --> 00:43:14,480
Saeng, take her away.

621
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:17,120
Get off me! I'm not going!

622
00:43:17,321 --> 00:43:18,990
This is my house!
I can do anything!

623
00:43:19,001 --> 00:43:20,421
Have Chaem watch her!

624
00:43:20,721 --> 00:43:22,840
Don't let her out
until she's sober!

625
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:24,314
- Let go!
- Yes, my lord!

626
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,760
Malai, come with me.

627
00:43:38,823 --> 00:43:41,224
You're the lady of the house!
You have full power!

628
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,956
How could you let this happen?!

629
00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:44,800
What could I do, my lord?

630
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,256
Even since she found out
she was pregnant,

631
00:43:47,267 --> 00:43:48,810
she doesn't listen to anyone.

632
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:52,280
Even I am threatened daily
of being kicked out of the house

633
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,280
as if I was a servant and
not your wife, my lord.

634
00:43:56,557 --> 00:43:58,530
Don't waste time
being sarcastic with me.

635
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,080
I'm not being sarcastic.

636
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,283
But you've spoiled her rotten.

637
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,920
What can I do, my lord?

638
00:44:07,283 --> 00:44:08,623
Get me Dech.

639
00:44:08,997 --> 00:44:10,017
He's not here.

640
00:44:10,383 --> 00:44:13,183
He's out on your errand.
He's not back yet.

641
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,880
Then get me Saeng!

642
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:16,446
Yes, my lord.

643
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,210
I shouldn't have brought in
that low-born woman.

644
00:44:26,823 --> 00:44:28,363
As soon as you gave birth...

645
00:44:43,883 --> 00:44:46,440
Finally you're back.
Go to the main house right now.

646
00:44:46,563 --> 00:44:47,563
Why?

647
00:44:47,909 --> 00:44:49,296
To help Ms. Malai.

648
00:44:49,362 --> 00:44:51,852
Ms. Ramphoei's been on a drunken
rampage since the afternoon.

649
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:53,369
She wouldn't listen to Ms. Malai.

650
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:56,550
And when His Lordship came home,
he did nothing.

651
00:44:56,923 --> 00:44:57,923
Let's go.

652
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,129
Come on.

653
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,723
You should get going, Dech.

654
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:06,564
Before your wife's heart
explodes from the booze.

655
00:45:07,513 --> 00:45:09,896
Huh? What are you
talking about, Saeng?

656
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:12,510
Oh, sorry.

657
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,237
I said it wrong.

658
00:45:14,943 --> 00:45:17,400
I meant his Lordship's wife.

659
00:45:25,817 --> 00:45:26,817
Let's go.

660
00:45:27,063 --> 00:45:28,743
- I'm going. Come on.
- Now.

661
00:45:30,243 --> 00:45:33,560
Didn't His Lordship order Saeng
to watch her until she was sober?

662
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,930
So, why was he just here?

663
00:45:37,497 --> 00:45:38,576
Let's go, Fueang.

664
00:45:38,683 --> 00:45:40,043
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

665
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,050
Let's go.

666
00:45:44,936 --> 00:45:46,696
- Ms. Ramphoei.
- Come here. Come here.

667
00:45:46,707 --> 00:45:48,923
I'm sorry. Please don't hurt me.

668
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Ms. Ramphoei?

669
00:45:51,913 --> 00:45:52,913
Come here!

670
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,673
That's enough, Ramphoei.
Go upstairs.

671
00:45:56,307 --> 00:45:58,280
You'll get scolded again
if he hears you.

672
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:00,683
Hey, let me go. Let me go.

673
00:46:02,553 --> 00:46:03,553
Stop it.

674
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,143
Don't tell me what to do.

675
00:46:05,143 --> 00:46:08,360
Someone like you
can't order me around!

676
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,630
You!

677
00:46:10,056 --> 00:46:11,076
Ms. Ramphoei!

678
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,567
- Finally showed up, hus...?
- Ms. Ramphoei!

679
00:46:17,587 --> 00:46:19,720
She's very drunk.
Get her to her room, Dech.

680
00:46:20,347 --> 00:46:21,347
Yes, Ms. Malai.

681
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,040
Let go!

682
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:25,140
Let go! Let me go!

683
00:46:25,527 --> 00:46:27,167
Let me go right now!
I'm not going!

684
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:28,359
- Let go!
- Ms. Ramphoei.

685
00:46:28,879 --> 00:46:29,900
Fueang, take Chaem.

686
00:46:30,279 --> 00:46:31,279
Yes, ma'am.

687
00:46:38,237 --> 00:46:39,237
Let me go!

688
00:46:41,783 --> 00:46:42,783
Let me go!

689
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,070
Why?

690
00:46:50,343 --> 00:46:53,750
Were you that afraid people would
find out you were my husband?!

691
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,840
I warned you not to do that again.

692
00:46:57,097 --> 00:46:58,364
Why didn't you listen?

693
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,480
Why would I listen?

694
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,080
I'm gonna show you

695
00:47:09,477 --> 00:47:10,920
that you and I

696
00:47:11,513 --> 00:47:12,986
are not equals.

697
00:47:15,403 --> 00:47:18,080
You're not worthy
to be His Lordship's wife.

698
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:19,930
At best you are...

699
00:47:20,937 --> 00:47:22,370
- his lover.
- Malai!

700
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,239
Look at Dech, my lord.

701
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:30,680
