"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 30)

19
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:02,640
My masters are only
the viscount and you, Ms. Malai.

20
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:05,911
You're the only lady
of this house, Ms. Malai.

21
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,230
You ingrate!

22
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:13,240
Admit you wanna be
the master of this house!

23
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:14,710
That's not true, my lord.

24
00:02:15,757 --> 00:02:16,523
My lord!

25
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:17,757
See, Malai?

26
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:19,636
I told you Dech was the murderer.

27
00:02:20,117 --> 00:02:21,440
- Ms. Malai!
- Let Dech go!

28
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:25,664
Ramphoei.

29
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,423
Wait a minute.

30
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,490
Why don't you take Dech with you?

31
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,203
You have a strong
eyewitness statement.

32
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:44,483
Two witnesses
give different accounts.

33
00:02:44,517 --> 00:02:46,617
We could be punished
if we arrest him.

34
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,596
We can't do it unless

35
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,710
there's clear evidence, my lord.

36
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,400
You can't believe the words
of a woman like Ramphoei.

37
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,710
And they both benefit
from his death.

38
00:02:56,103 --> 00:02:58,770
Uan's statement
has more weight, isn't it?

39
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:00,856
It's not that simple, my lord.

40
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:03,640
If there's no clear evidence
that Dech did it,

41
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:05,040
there's nothing we can do.

42
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:08,480
We'll take our leave, my lord.

43
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,570
My lord!

44
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:23,608
My lord!

45
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:25,143
My lord!

46
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:26,483
My lord!

47
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,357
I'm begging you.

48
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:31,836
Please believe me.

49
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:33,350
I really didn't do it.

50
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:34,537
I don't believe you!

51
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,520
You dare have an affair
with my brother's mistress.

52
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,560
You could do worse things.

53
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:42,093
Who knows?

54
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:44,970
You might have always
planned to kill my brother!

55
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,180
But I never planned
to hurt the viscount.

56
00:03:47,513 --> 00:03:48,513
Stop pretending.

57
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:49,827
Someday

58
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,880
I'll rip off your mask, Dech.

59
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,560
People like you
should die in prison!

60
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:55,997
Mark my words!

61
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:57,517
Let's go, Ranchuan.

62
00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:59,440
- Yes, my lord.
- My lord!

63
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:01,897
My lord!

64
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,730
Ms. Malai, I...

65
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:48,923
Ms. Malai!

66
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:17,396
You believe Ms. Ramphoei's words?

67
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:19,557
If I don't believe her,

68
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,560
then Dech's the murderer.

69
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,640
But if I do...

70
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:36,383
I don't wanna believe
anyone anymore, Fueang.

71
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:51,310
I don't wanna believe it either

72
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:54,057
that Dech could kill the viscount.

73
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:55,957
And I don't believe...

74
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,737
that he would cheat on you.

75
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,360
Why don't you give him
another chance?

76
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,283
I don't wanna hear anyone's
excuses anymore, Fueang.

77
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,403
The more I hear them,
the stupider I feel.

78
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:19,003
Go oversee things downstairs.

79
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,270
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:36,683
Dech.

81
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,960
What's going on, Kam, Uan?

82
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,670
Well,

83
00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:44,929
I wanted to apologize
for giving that statement.

84
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:46,590
- But...
- I get it.

85
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:49,320
Do you really?

86
00:07:50,623 --> 00:07:53,010
I don't want you to think
we tried to frame you.

87
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,637
Yes, I really didn't try
to frame you.

88
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,643
We just didn't want
to lie to the police.

89
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:00,763
I know.

90
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:02,360
You're really not mad at us?

91
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,057
Why would I be?

92
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,024
You just told them what you saw.

93
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,000
We're gonna go back to work.

94
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:43,244
Just say what you want, ma'am.

95
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,320
Gee,

96
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,280
you read my mind.

97
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,680
I thought I had to remind you
to repay my kindness.

98
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:55,983
You'd never help me without
expecting something in return.

99
00:08:57,843 --> 00:08:59,843
Tell me how much you want, ma'am.

100
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:03,403
Goodness.

101
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,630
You're so innocent.

102
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:08,917
I went out of my way to help you.

103
00:09:09,397 --> 00:09:10,630
If it weren't for me,

104
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:13,520
you would have been
in jail right now.

105
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:16,177
How can you repay me
with just cash?

106
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,320
Then what do you want, ma'am?

107
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:28,657
I'm not asking much.

108
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,324
I just want to...

109
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,920
Don't cross the line.

110
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:34,280
I can give you some things.

111
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,920
Not everything.

112
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,426
What if I'm telling you...

113
00:09:42,437 --> 00:09:44,600
I want everything?

114
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,483
Then you might get nothing.

115
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:49,520
Not a damn thing.

116
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:56,560
Aren't you a little too sure?

117
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,370
Don't forget.

118
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:01,320
I just prevented
your incarceration.

119
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:31,330
You called me, ma'am?

120
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:34,880
Uan, take Mueang to the wet nurse.

121
00:10:39,957 --> 00:10:41,560
That's Ms. Malai's necklace, ma'am.

122
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,600
Oh.

123
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,563
You don't have
the right to wear it.

124
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:46,903
Give it here.

125
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,680
None of your business.

126
00:10:49,137 --> 00:10:51,403
I'm the viscount's mistress.
Why can't I wear it?

127
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,850
Even so,

128
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,030
no one wears diamonds to funerals.

129
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,950
People will say you...

130
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:58,744
don't know the time and place.

131
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,029
Uan, are you criticizing me?

132
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,440
I'm telling the truth.

133
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:04,457
Ms. Malai wears only pearls.

134
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:06,943
She wouldn't flash diamonds
in people's eyes.

135
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:08,743
Jeez, screw your eyes.

136
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,880
I'm gonna wear it.

137
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:13,800
Take Mueang to the wet nurse
already. He's so annoying.

138
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:15,160
Go away already.

139
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:16,520
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,017
Young Master Mueang,

141
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:20,703
let's go, sir.

142
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,470
Let's go, sir.

143
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,560
Please accept my condolences,
Ms. Malai.

144
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,750
Thank you.

145
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,880
I never thought the viscount
would pass away so young.

146
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,004
Hello.

147
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:56,003
Thank you for coming.

148
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:59,433
- Goodness.
- Tell me if you need anything.

149
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:00,920
At her own husband's funeral.

150
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:03,516
How could she wear
such flashy jewelry?

151
00:12:05,263 --> 00:12:06,310
People's pedigree

152
00:12:06,797 --> 00:12:08,040
cannot be changed.

153
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,960
It must be so hard for you
to share a house

154
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:12,517
with someone like that.

155
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,130
I have to apologize for her.

156
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:17,880
Don't worry, Ms. Malai.

157
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:19,680
I understand.

158
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,960
Uh...

159
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,697
Then make yourself at home.

160
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,603
- Yes.
- Yes.

161
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:28,160
I feel horrible, ma'am.

162
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:40,077
Is it a good idea for you to skip

163
00:12:40,203 --> 00:12:41,236
the viscount's funeral?

164
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:45,564
I know it looks bad, not attending
my own brother's funeral.

165
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:48,744
But I don't want Malai
to receive guests by herself.

166
00:12:49,057 --> 00:12:50,640
I feel for Malai

167
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,650
but I don't want to curse myself
by stepping in that house.

168
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,080
Especially with Dech
and Ramphoei there,

169
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:58,943
we'd surely cause a scene
and become the talk of the town.

170
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,570
It's better I don't go.

171
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,960
Oh, Count. Hello, my lord.

172
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:14,436
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,117
I never thought

174
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,880
the viscount would
pass away so soon.

175
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,520
Our son's still a baby.

176
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,800
My dear Mueang,

177
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,880
he's fatherless

178
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,600
at such a young age.

179
00:13:35,657 --> 00:13:36,960
Oh, milady.

180
00:13:38,623 --> 00:13:39,840
Hello, ma'am.

181
00:13:55,283 --> 00:13:56,640
Even though you're gone,

182
00:13:56,923 --> 00:14:00,030
I'll never let my child
become your heir.

183
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,850
Ever.

184
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:09,360
Why did you say that?

185
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:16,043
No matter how much you hated him,

186
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,600
you shouldn't have said that.

187
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:22,597
I don't want my child

188
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,240
to be tainted by

189
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,960
or get involved in
some inheritance war.

190
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,663
I get that.

191
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:32,384
But if you do that,

192
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:35,310
won't you be taking away
your child's opportunities?

193
00:14:36,783 --> 00:14:38,200
If you announce

194
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:40,257
your child is the viscount's,

195
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:42,090
they'll want for nothing.

196
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,590
Not only your child
will live comfortably,

197
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:46,720
you will as well.

198
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,240
I know, ma'am.

199
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,763
But opportunities from a war that
will turn this house into hell...

200
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,440
I want nothing to do with it.

201
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:08,756
I want you to think it through.

202
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:10,680
For your child's sake.

203
00:15:17,803 --> 00:15:19,283
I've thought it through, ma'am,

204
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:20,996
You of all people should know

205
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:23,440
money can corrupt even good people.

206
00:15:32,743 --> 00:15:34,880
After the viscount's funeral,

207
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:38,920
I'm inviting all of you
to my and Dech's wedding,

208
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:42,043
It's...

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,811

210
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:54,780
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

211
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,987
My dear Lordship,

212
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,794
you shouldn't have left me so soon.

213
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,160
My dear Lordship!

214
00:16:09,037 --> 00:16:10,800
My dear Lordship!

215
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,320
- My Lordship!
- Ms. Ramphoei.

216
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,970
Ms. Ramphoei.

217
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:18,156
Please get up.

218
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:20,730
So the guests can pay
the viscount their respects.

219
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:22,434
Uan, you dare order me?

220
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,447
I'm not ordering you.

221
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:27,320
But it's inappropriate,
Ms. Ramphoei.

222
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:30,270
Don't you see
the guests are waiting?

223
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:31,466
Please get up.

224
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,010
Eh?

225
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,170
What's wrong, ma'am?

226
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:40,964
Did your legs fall asleep?

227
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,790
No.

228
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:46,200
Where are Dech and Malai?

229
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,817
Why don't I see them?

230
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:01,160
Don't go yet, Ms. Malai.

231
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:04,536
We both should get back.

232
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,390
I'm sorry, Ms. Malai,

233
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,140
but I think
you should hear him out.

234
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,640
Please excuse me.

235
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:24,624
What else do you wanna lie to me?

236
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,193
I never thought of lying to you.

237
00:17:31,203 --> 00:17:32,510
I'm not stupid, Dech.

238
00:17:32,797 --> 00:17:34,687
I can't keep lying to me.

239
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:36,237
Ms. Malai.

240
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,834
I'm not lying, ma'am.

241
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,774
Are you saying
you weren't with Ramphoei?

242
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:44,083
Then you're the murderer.

243
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:48,920
Or do you deny it?

244
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,237
You can't?

245
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:55,174
Then what do you want me to hear?

246
00:17:55,523 --> 00:17:57,423
Ms. Malai. Ms. Malai.

247
00:17:58,097 --> 00:17:59,587
Trust me, Ms. Malai.

248
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:01,520
I'd never do such a wicked thing.

249
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,080
- I love...
- You love me.

250
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,960
I've heard it a thousand times.

251
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:13,423
Honestly,

252
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:17,087
I'm not sure if your loving words
mean anything anymore.

253
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,160
Please stop pestering me, Dech.

254
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:24,840
I don't want your words
or even your love.

255
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:27,720
You two lovebirds are hiding here.

256
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:30,600
- Ms. Ramphoei.
- Yeah, it's me!

257
00:18:31,937 --> 00:18:32,937
Goodness gracious,

258
00:18:33,177 --> 00:18:34,454
your husband just died

259
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:36,197
and here you're stealing my man.

260
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,000
Where are you going?

261
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,360
I'm not letting you go.

262
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:43,560
Let me slap you first,
you mistress.

263
00:18:44,697 --> 00:18:45,697
Ms. Ramphoei,

264
00:18:45,737 --> 00:18:47,480
stop calling her a mistress.

265
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,854
She's not anyone's mistress.

266
00:18:48,864 --> 00:18:50,000
Get that straight.

267
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:52,084
Let go.

268
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,124
Why can't I?

269
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,843
Since you're my husband.

270
00:18:56,117 --> 00:18:57,343
My son's father.

271
00:18:57,784 --> 00:19:00,680
She got involved with you
after I did, so she's a mistress.

272
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:03,084
She became my wife before you did.

273
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:10,744
So you've had an affair
with her all along?

274
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:13,545
- Dech!
- Ms. Ramphoei.

275
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:15,123
You bastard! You asshole!

276
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:16,842
How could you do this?!

277
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:19,238
I'm your wife
and your son's mother.

278
00:19:19,263 --> 00:19:20,886
How could you do this, Dech?!

279
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:22,720
Bastard! Asshole!

280
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,840
Ms. Malai! Ms. Malai!

281
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,107
Please don't go!

282
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:27,117
Wait for me!

283
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:29,257
No, I'm not letting you go.

284
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:30,663
You have to come with me!

285
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,249
- Come here!
- Ms. Malai!

286
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:34,063
Come here! Come here!

287
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,403
- Ms. Ramphoei.
- Come here!

288
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,523
Come here. Move.

289
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,022
- Come here.
- Ms. Ramphoei.

290
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:41,736
Come here.

291
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:44,600
Everyone!

292
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,236
I have an announcement to make.

293
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:56,217
Ms. Ramphoei, what are you doing?

294
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,710
Stay still.

295
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,896
After the viscount's funeral,

296
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,473
I'm inviting all of you
to my and Dech's wedding,

297
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,730
Ms. Ramphoei!

298
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,417
It's...

299
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,237
I'm really sorry, Ms. Malai,

300
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,277
that you have to live in a house
with this kind of trouble.

301
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:52,623
Thank you, ma'am, for your concern.

302
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:54,720
Take good care of yourself.

303
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:57,110
I feel so sorry for you, Malai,

304
00:20:57,497 --> 00:20:59,297
for having to share a house

305
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:01,597
with that wretched woman.

306
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,457
Anyway, I'll take my leave.

307
00:21:06,257 --> 00:21:07,257
Thank you, ma'ams.

308
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,160
Ms. Malai, hear me out, please.

309
00:21:16,573 --> 00:21:19,627
- I'm not... I'm not...
- I'm tired. Let's talk later.

310
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:20,933
Ms. Malai!

311
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,333
Ms. Malai!

312
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,410
- Ms. Malai!
- She said she was tired.

313
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,580
Why are you pestering her?

314
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:27,227
Ow.

315
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:28,960
It's all your fault, ma'am.

316
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:30,863
How could you announce that?

317
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,884
The viscount's body's
not even in the casket.

318
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:34,063
Why couldn't I?

319
00:21:34,383 --> 00:21:36,103
Don't forget you owe...

320
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:42,023
Ow, let go.

321
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,270
Ow, let go.

322
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:50,080
What are you gonna do to me?

323
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:53,230
I'm not gonna do anything to you.

324
00:21:53,543 --> 00:21:55,923
But you can't make me do this.

325
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:57,537
It's not what we agreed.

326
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,473
You dare bring up our agreement?

327
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:03,860
I thought you would realize

328
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,587
how big of a debt
you owe me this time.

329
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,933
If you ask me,
you should bow before my feet.

330
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:11,363
- Ms. Ramphoei!
- Why?!

331
00:22:11,843 --> 00:22:14,600
I'm well aware you don't love me.

332
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,149
But I'm gonna marry you. So what?

333
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:21,520
If I weren't for me, you would
have been on death row right now!

334
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,693
Malai can't help you the way I can.

335
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:27,146
But you don't have
the right to force me.

336
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:28,522
With your announcement,

337
00:22:28,577 --> 00:22:31,827
I don't know how widespread
people's curses about us will be!

338
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:34,347
I don't care what those toffs say.

339
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:37,640
The only thing I care about
is getting you to marry me.

340
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:41,255
You!

341
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,170
You...

342
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,840
I'm going to Bu-nga's house.

343
00:23:05,143 --> 00:23:06,167
You can't.

344
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:07,520
Your place is here.

345
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:09,224
You can't go anywhere.

346
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,913
I'm telling you you can't go!

347
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,122
Why won't you listen?!

348
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:14,489

Ow, let go.

353
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:34,030
What are you gonna do to me?

I'm not gonna do anything to you.

355

00:23:54,873 --> 00:23:57,630
I'm well aware you don't love me.

363
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,179
But I'm gonna marry you. So what?

364
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:04,550
If I weren't for me, you would
have been on death row right now!

365
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,723
Malai can't help you the way I can.

366
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:10,176
But you don't have
the right to force me.

367
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:11,552
With your announcement,

368
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:14,857
I don't know how widespread
people's curses about us will be!

369
00:24:14,939 --> 00:24:17,377
I don't care what those toffs say.

370
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:20,670
The only thing I care about
is getting you to marry me.

371
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:24,285
You!

372
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
You...

373
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,960
Are you gonna kill me?

374
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:33,750
Do it, Dech.

375
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,950
Everyone knows now
you've bedded me.

376
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,507
If something happens to me,

377
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:41,883
everyone will suspect you!

378
00:24:43,493 --> 00:24:44,580
Don't force me.

379
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:47,157
I was a homeless kid.

380
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,880
I'm not scared of jail.

381
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:50,126
But...

382
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:52,596
But I'm your son's mother!

383
00:24:52,846 --> 00:24:53,949
A vile mother!

384
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:55,817
Young Master Mueang's
better off without you.

385
00:24:55,973 --> 00:24:58,120
If I'm vile,
you're as vile as I am.

386
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:00,839
I dare you.

387
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Kill me!

388
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:03,497
Kill me now!

389
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:04,659
You!

390
00:25:04,723 --> 00:25:05,763
Ms. Ramphoei.

391
00:25:17,823 --> 00:25:19,146
For the last time,

392
00:25:19,383 --> 00:25:20,727
the only person I love

393
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:22,302
is Ms. Malai.

394
00:25:22,423 --> 00:25:24,140
Don't try to take her away from me.

395
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:25,820
I can do anything.

396
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:27,889
Anything!

397
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:31,330
As long as
it keeps Ms. Malai alive.

398
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:51,828
Don't think
I can't defeat you, Dech.

399
00:26:18,683 --> 00:26:20,820
After the viscount's funeral,

400
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,433
I'm inviting all of you
to attend my and Dech's wedding,

401
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,690
Ms. Ramphoei!

402
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,150
My lord!

403
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,903
My lord. My lord.

404
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:37,186
What now, Ranchuan?

405
00:27:37,276 --> 00:27:38,463
What else, my lord?

406
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,034
The friend's servant
just gave me a message.

407
00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:43,201
My chest almost burst
after I read it.

408
00:27:43,404 --> 00:27:45,454
What would make your chest burst?

409
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,007
It's Ramphoei, my lord.

410
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,396
She announced
at the viscount's funeral

411
00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:50,740
that she was gonna marry Dech.

412
00:27:51,995 --> 00:27:54,418
- What?!
- You heard me correctly.

413
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:56,455
It's all over town

414
00:27:56,654 --> 00:27:58,628
that the viscount's mistress
is so shameless

415
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:00,815
that she'll marry her lover.

416
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:06,118
Vile! Despicable!

417
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:09,440
My family fortune's really
gonna fall into the hands of

418
00:28:09,493 --> 00:28:11,259
that low-life nobody from nowhere?!

419
00:28:11,601 --> 00:28:13,331
What do we do next, my lord?

420
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,567
Find a way

421
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,004
to keep them from taking
my nephew Mueang's fortune.

422
00:28:17,014 --> 00:28:18,014
No matter what,

423
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:21,720
I'll never let the fortune
fall to degenerates like them.

424
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:39,054
Ms. Malai.

425
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,800
Where are you going?

426
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,840
I'm going to Bu-nga's house.

427
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:47,137
You can't.

428
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:48,469
Your place is here.

429
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:50,214
You can't go anywhere.

430
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,072
I'm telling you you can't go!

431
00:28:55,262 --> 00:28:56,461
Why won't you listen?!

432
00:28:56,798 --> 00:28:57,798
Dech.

433
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,560
Let her go, Dech.

434
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:04,987
She's a nothing but a pariah here.

435
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:07,149
Ms. Ramphoei!

436
00:29:07,297 --> 00:29:08,534
Apologize to her right now.

437
00:29:08,803 --> 00:29:10,167
Why should I?

438
00:29:10,543 --> 00:29:12,110
Since I'm telling the truth.

439
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,493
She's nothing but a nursemaid.

440
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,767
Now that the sick here died,

441
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:22,946
she's no longer useful here.

442
00:29:23,682 --> 00:29:27,946
It's better for her to go
take care of other dying vegetable.

443
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:34,907
You can insult me all you want,

444
00:29:35,223 --> 00:29:36,907
but leave Bu-nga alone.

445
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:38,347
I'm telling the truth!

446
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:41,833
If she's not a vegetable,
get her to come slap me. I'm ready!

447
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:44,907
Or you want give her
a slap from me?!

448
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:46,077
- Huh?!
- Enough!

449
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,560
Can't we live peacefully
for one day?!

450
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:50,874
Kick her out!
This place will be peaceful.

451
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:52,966
So my husband and I
can be alone finally!

452
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,390
Leave!

453
00:29:56,437 --> 00:29:57,437
Let's go, Fueang.

454
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,330
Ms. Malai!

455
00:29:59,543 --> 00:30:00,543
Dech!

456
00:30:01,377 --> 00:30:02,377
Well, Dech?

457
00:30:02,857 --> 00:30:05,090
Does the only woman
you love love you?

458
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,990
Fueang.

459
00:30:21,163 --> 00:30:23,383
Leave it there.
I'll take it upstairs myself.

460
00:30:23,483 --> 00:30:24,993
- But...
- It's okay.

461
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,430
Just you seeing me off here
is more than enough.

462
00:30:33,437 --> 00:30:34,727
Thank you very much

463
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:36,567
for everything you've done.

464
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,680
Don't talk like that, ma'am.

465
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:42,216
You talking this way
makes me uncomfortable.

466
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,540
Don't be.

467
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:45,440
You've done so much for me.

468
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,800
You have to take
good care of yourself.

469
00:30:54,057 --> 00:30:55,057
I will.

470
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:56,557
Don't let your guard down.

471
00:30:56,797 --> 00:31:00,260
Don't ever let Ramphoei know
your child is the viscount's.

472
00:31:00,562 --> 00:31:03,200
She'll never let anyone else
claim his fortune.

473
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:04,917
I won't.

474
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,446
I won't forget, ma'am.

475
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:08,900
Take good care of yourself too.

476
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:11,020
You won't have me serving you.

477
00:31:11,344 --> 00:31:13,380
Don't forget to eat on time.

478
00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:15,964
Don't take care of Ms. Bu-nga
and forget the time again.

479
00:31:18,249 --> 00:31:19,249
I won't.

480
00:31:50,223 --> 00:31:51,910
It's late. You haven't gone to bed?

481
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,323
Or are you hiding
from Ms. Ramphoei?

482
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:57,683
It's nothing.

483
00:31:58,957 --> 00:32:01,090
You saw Ms. Malai off. How was it?

484
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:04,623
What can I say?

485
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:06,453
She seemed certain...

486
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:07,880
she wouldn't return.

487
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:13,296
Why must things end up this way?

488
00:32:13,623 --> 00:32:14,720
I never thought

489
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:17,000
things would get
this out of control.

490
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,503
If you didn't kill the viscount,

491
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:23,280
then who did?

492
00:32:25,163 --> 00:32:26,500
I feel for you, Dech.

493
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:29,733
But if I were Ms. Malai,
I would have the same thought

494
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:32,012
because you're suspicious.

495
00:32:33,515 --> 00:32:35,192
You can suspect all you want.

496
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,782
But if you want Ms. Malai
to stop suspecting you,

497
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:39,280
there's only one solution.

498
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:43,912
Run away with her.

499
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:47,033
Because you don't want
the fortune anyway, right?

500
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,369
Or you do?

501
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:53,423
I never wanted even one penny
from the viscount.

502
00:32:53,543 --> 00:32:54,896
I'm doing this because...

503
00:33:00,356 --> 00:33:02,296
You keep saying you don't want it.

504
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,184
But in the end
you want it for your son.

505
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:09,812
Dech,

506
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,820
things that aren't ours

507
00:33:11,996 --> 00:33:13,993
make us unhappy when we get them.

508
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,480
Why are you saying this?

509
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,337
Or do you want
the fortune for your child?

510
00:33:21,443 --> 00:33:22,666
You're doubting me?

511
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,543
Huh?

512
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,920
Then I'll stop meddling
in your business.

513
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:29,980
If you don't prove your innocence,

514
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:33,560
don't expect Ms. Malai
to trust you ever again.

516
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:10,743
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

517
00:34:26,223 --> 00:34:29,746
Ms. Bu-nga is lucky to have
a true friend like you, Ms. Malai.

518
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,600
It's me who's the lucky one

519
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:34,412
that she let me be her friend.

520
00:34:35,221 --> 00:34:37,012
That reminds me of

521
00:34:37,488 --> 00:34:38,880
Ms. Bu-nga in the old days.

522
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,036
Yes.

523
00:34:43,403 --> 00:34:45,193
She's a modern woman.

524
00:34:45,823 --> 00:34:46,823
Strong.

525
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,940
Confident.

526
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,530
Tenacious.

527
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,567
Everything you said
was true, ma'am.

528
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,390
She seemed vicious
but believed in justice.

529
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,453
Calm down, Bu-nga.

530
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,500
Try to talk to them.

531
00:35:07,683 --> 00:35:09,820
Why did you show
your faces at my house?

532
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:14,183
I'm here for my share
of your father's fortune

533
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,160
that I deserve.

534
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:20,925
I already gave you your shares
as stated in my father's will

535
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:22,148
down to the penny.

536
00:35:22,483 --> 00:35:24,039
You're shameless for asking more.

537
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:27,174
How would we know
you didn't rip us off?

538
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:30,200
You handled everything yourself.

539
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:32,073
You could cover up anything.

540
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,410
Right, ladies?

541
00:35:33,421 --> 00:35:34,421
- Yes.
- Yes.

542
00:35:34,657 --> 00:35:35,657
Let me.

543
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,207
If you rip us off even one penny,

544
00:35:40,463 --> 00:35:42,200
I'll report you and humiliate you.

545
00:35:44,382 --> 00:35:46,280
- Bu-nga!
- Since you're reporting me,

546
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:48,667
report me for assaulting you too!

547
00:35:49,029 --> 00:35:50,906
You're just the mistresses

548
00:35:51,135 --> 00:35:53,560
my father supported
when he was alive.

549
00:35:53,743 --> 00:35:55,153
How much did you get?

550
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:56,673
Don't think I don't know.

551
00:35:56,903 --> 00:35:58,120
You're lucky

552
00:35:58,403 --> 00:36:01,633
he was kind enough
to include you in his will.

553
00:36:01,923 --> 00:36:03,460
Let me tell you something.

554
00:36:03,857 --> 00:36:05,600
My father's fortune

555
00:36:05,683 --> 00:36:06,860
is partly my mother's!

556
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:11,226
I'll consider it as a charity
for the animals my father kept!

557
00:36:11,482 --> 00:36:12,482
Bu-nga!

558
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,996
You're crossing the line!

559
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,130
Bu-nga!

560
00:36:30,223 --> 00:36:31,369
You think you're so good?

561
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,816
What are you gonna do
to my master? No way!

562
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:37,203
I always hated you.
I'll slap a lesson into you!

563
00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:39,000
No! No!

564
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,877
- Ms. Malai!
- Malai?

565
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:44,752
You dared hurt my friend?

566
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:45,980
Yeah! So what?!

567
00:36:50,029 --> 00:36:51,029
Let me go.

568
00:36:52,915 --> 00:36:53,975
Bu-nga!

569
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,963
- Stop!
- Bu-nga! No!

570
00:37:02,442 --> 00:37:03,442
Bu-nga!

571
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:13,783
Ms. Bu-nga!

572
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,206
Enough, Bu-nga!

573
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:19,499
Ms. Bu-nga!

574
00:37:20,466 --> 00:37:21,466
Bu-nga!

575
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:22,477
Im, help me!

576
00:37:24,107 --> 00:37:25,570
- Ms. Bu-nga!
- Enough!

577
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:28,287
- Bu-nga! Enough, Bu-nga!
- Ms. Bu-nga!

578
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:33,086
Is there anyone here?!

579
00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:34,760
Drag them out of here!

580
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,697
If you dare, report to the police.

581
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,210
So I can expose you.

582
00:37:46,923 --> 00:37:50,317
You spent my father's money
on pampering another man.

583
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,197
You love gambling.

584
00:37:54,737 --> 00:37:56,397
You have a huge gambling debt.

585
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,397
And you stole my mother's
things and sold them.

586
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,307
If you want to come after me,

587
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:06,417
prepare to be thrown in jail.

588
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,613
I'll take back
all my father's stuff from you!

589
00:38:10,297 --> 00:38:11,297
Do you want that?

590
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:14,403
Leave!

591
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:21,483
Not running your mouth anymore?

592
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:23,636
Come on, Im.

593
00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:26,123
I'm glad they're leaving.

594
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:28,950
They won't dare
come after Bu-nga again.

595
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:32,113
Does it hurt bad, Malai?

596
00:38:32,663 --> 00:38:34,047
You took the slap for me.

597
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:36,148
It's okay.

598
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:38,188
I was shocked more than anything.

599
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:41,280
From now on,
you'll get to live in peace.

600
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:45,019
Let them try come after me again.

601
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,920
I wish we didn't slip up
and let them hurt you, Ms. Malai.

602
00:39:08,383 --> 00:39:09,554
It's okay.

603
00:39:09,716 --> 00:39:10,800
It's nothing.

604
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,830
Bu-nga,

605
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:15,226
were you being too hard on them?

606
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:18,333
That's why I wanted you
to try talking to them.

607
00:39:18,743 --> 00:39:20,640
I'm afraid those wicked women

608
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,493
will come back and hurt Ms. Bu-nga.

609
00:39:23,748 --> 00:39:24,748
I don't care.

610
00:39:24,856 --> 00:39:26,340
When we face bad people,

611
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,493
if we act weak, they'll bully us.

612
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:31,053
We must fight back. It's justice.

613
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,772
You should practice.

614
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,554
I'm not as bold as you are.

615
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,894
I'm scared just watching you.

616
00:39:40,636 --> 00:39:41,636
See?

617
00:39:41,977 --> 00:39:43,114
You're like this.

618
00:39:43,303 --> 00:39:46,047
That's why you're always
taken advantage of.

619
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:50,334
Keep your goodness
for only good people.

620
00:39:50,636 --> 00:39:52,929
Because goodness
can't defeat bad people.

621
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:56,220
If we're nice to them,
they'll think we stupid.

622
00:39:56,836 --> 00:39:57,836
Understood?

623
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,727
That makes me miss her even more.

624
00:40:26,616 --> 00:40:28,616
Hurry and wake up, my dear friend.

625
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,807
I miss you so much.

626
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:33,337
I miss her too, ma'am.

627
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,310
Ms. Malai,

628
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:44,256
someone's here to see you.

629
00:40:45,883 --> 00:40:46,883
Who is it?

630
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,223
A servant called Dech.

631
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:53,440
If you still
don't wanna see anyone,

632
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:55,553
I can deal with him for you.

633
00:40:57,334 --> 00:40:58,334
Uh, yes.

634
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,398
I don't wanna see anyone right now.

635
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:01,409
Please deal with him.

636
00:41:01,735 --> 00:41:02,735
I will.

637
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:06,550
Get another servant
to take Ms. Bu-nga to her room.

638
00:41:06,617 --> 00:41:07,617
I will.

639
00:41:08,703 --> 00:41:10,346
Don't worry, Ms. Malai.

640
00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:12,173
I'll deal with him.

641
00:41:13,462 --> 00:41:14,462
Thanks.

642
00:41:29,097 --> 00:41:30,097
Where's Ms. Malai?

643
00:41:30,397 --> 00:41:32,297
She's unable to receive anyone.

644
00:41:32,797 --> 00:41:34,994
She's taking care of Ms. Bu-nga.

645
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,034
Was she informed
Dech asked to see her?

646
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,190
She was.

647
00:41:38,357 --> 00:41:40,914
She didn't want to see anyone.

648
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,467
May I wait then?

649
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:43,710
You may not.

650
00:41:43,963 --> 00:41:45,554
I'm really sorry.

651
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:48,011
Ms. Malai really
doesn't want to see anyone.

652
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,630
If you're really guilty,

653
00:43:00,097 --> 00:43:01,320
