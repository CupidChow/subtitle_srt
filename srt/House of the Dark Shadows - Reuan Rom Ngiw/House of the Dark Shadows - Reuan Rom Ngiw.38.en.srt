"House of the Dark Shadows"
(Episode 38)

19
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,820
Watch out!

20
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:08,820
Punish Monk Dech.

21
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,695
Do not allow his wickedness

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,047
to defile the yellow robe.

23
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:14,453
Return to the House of the Dark Shadows.

24
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:15,750
Go and seek the truth there,

25
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:17,492
and bring Dech

26
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:19,223
punishment.

27
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:22,093
Ms. Malai showed me

28
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:23,593
everything that happened.

29
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:24,735
She insists that you were

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,916
the one who harmed her.

31
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:27,221
You betrayed me!

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,820
Whoa!

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,140
Whoa!

34
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:43,445
Mueang...

35
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,789
Did you read this telegram?

36
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:11,703
I cannot read and write, sir.

37
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,304
When the venerable monk was away,

38
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,359
I quickly took it and brought it to you

39
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,815
as you instructed.

40
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:18,187
I did not read it myself or

41
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:19,484
have anyone else read it.

42
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:27,414
Thank you, sir.

43
00:03:27,547 --> 00:03:29,039
Keep reporting anything to me.

44
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,078
Yes sir.

45
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:39,766
My Meuang

46
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,383
had little good merit.

47
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,320
At this rate,

48
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:48,734
I probably

49
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,570
do not have to

50
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:55,195
return your assets.

51
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:11,238
Rerai,

52
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:12,926
open the door for me.

53
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,343
Rerai,

54
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:29,765
talk to me first.

55
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:31,281
Rerai!

56
00:04:38,205 --> 00:04:39,455
Why have you returned?

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,603
Didn't I tell you not to contact her?

58
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:43,174
I'm worried about Rerai.

59
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:46,885
No need! She's my daughter,

60
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:48,205
I can take care of her myself.

61
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:49,588
I have something I need to settle,

62
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:51,088
- that's why I returned...
- No need!

63
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:52,970
I told you to get out!

64
00:04:53,362 --> 00:04:54,362
Scram!

65
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:58,446
You're not leaving?

66
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:00,461
Mom!

67
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:02,172
- Mom!
- You're not leaving?

68
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:03,836
Mom, stop,

69
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,422
Mai came with good intentions.

70
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,321
Why send him away?

71
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:07,735
I don't care!

72
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,563
I told you not to contact my daughter!

73
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:11,774
Why don't you get it?

74
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:13,493
- Please listen to me for a bit...
- No!

75
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:14,571
Get out!

76
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:15,736
Scram!

77
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,205
Mom!

78
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:21,549
- Mom!
- Get out!

79
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,346
Why do you have to treat Mai this way?

80
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:28,714
Why do you resent him?

81
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:30,190
What I'm doing is because...

82
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:31,222
You meant well.

83
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:32,878
You've always meant well for me.

84
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:34,573
But you've never once asked me

85
00:05:34,863 --> 00:05:35,971
if I needed it.

86
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:56,315
Ms. Malai showed me

87
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,019
all the events that occurred.

88
00:05:58,393 --> 00:06:00,565
She is convinced that you harmed

89
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:02,515
and killed her.

90
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:04,119
I am not making excuses,

91
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,690
but please think carefully.

92
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,307
What you've perceived,

93
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:09,658
many things Ms. Malai saw came

94
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,838
from her own understanding,

95
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:12,150
it doesn't necessarily mean

96
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:13,565
it's completely true, right?

97
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:14,753
Yes.

98
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,908
I've tried explaining

99
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,393
to Ms. Malai many times

100
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:19,830
that I did not kill her,

101
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,322
but she still insists on

102
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:22,635
that misunderstanding.

103
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,385
If you didn't kill Ms. Malai,

104
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:27,667
then who

105
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
did?

106
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:31,268
I don't know who they are

107
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,893
or why they did it.

108
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:35,916
But I know one thing,

109
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:38,299
before I ordained,

110
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,018
I was often harmed,

111
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:41,760
it was like a warning for me

112
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,377
to stop investigating the past.

113
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:44,596
I was also harmed,

114
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,065
especially when I went back to Ayutthaya

115
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:49,041
to find more clues,

116
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:51,010
it's like

117
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,568
the real culprit knows our every move.

118
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,424
You speak the truth,

119
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:58,275
which means the real killer

120
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:00,752
must be someone close yet distant.

121
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:01,854
Yes,

122
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:04,932
and all these matters

123
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:06,768
are related to the assets of

124
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:08,432
The House of The Dark Shadows.

125
00:07:10,612 --> 00:07:12,541
I think if we use the asset as bait,

126
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:14,268
they may emerge.

127
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,143
It seems you have a plan.

128
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:17,361
Yes,

129
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,385
in any case,

130
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:21,924
I want Ms. Malai to know the truth.

131
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,330
You betrayed me!

132
00:07:48,423 --> 00:07:49,423
Whoa!

133
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:54,423
Whoa!

134
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:57,196
You promised you would make Dech pay,

135
00:07:57,587 --> 00:07:59,641
but you went and cooperated with him!

136
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:02,493
I...

137
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:04,704
I can't only listen to one side...

138
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,462
The venerable monk said he didn't do it,

139
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,196
you want me to believe you

140
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:12,423
but and what you've made me see

141
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,048
comes from your revenge,

142
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:15,485
I didn't see it with my own eyes!

143
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:17,134
The one who killed me was Dech!

144
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,071
I saw it with my own eyes.

145
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:23,540
I'm asking for a chance to investigate,

146
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:25,641
so we can find out what really happened,

147
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:27,071
don't you want to know?

148
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:56,737
Thank you.

149
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:01,526
Oh my goodness!

150
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,940
Oh my goodness!

151
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,267
What?

152
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,658
The owner of The House of

153
00:09:06,683 --> 00:09:08,041
the Dark Shadows has returned!

154
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:09,470
- The House of the Dark Shadows?
- Yes!

155
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,494
The one they say is haunted?

156
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:12,588
Yes indeed!

157
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:13,791
Listen up,

158
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:15,713
I heard they've hired people

159
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:17,370
for a big cleanup!

160
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:18,395
- Really?
- Yes!

161
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,877
No way,

162
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:22,088
the owner has disappeared for ages,

163
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,314
how could they return?

164
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,455
If they didn't return,

165
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:26,049
they've returned now, Fueang!

166
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:27,892
I heard the owner of

167
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:29,595
The House of the Dark Shadows

168
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,572
is actually Viscount Wisan's chlid!

169
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:33,806
Viscount Wisan's child?

170
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:35,814
Do you happen to know their name?

171
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,635
I do,

172
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,213
they said his name is Mueang.

173
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:40,088
How did he return?

174
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:40,908
Yes, right?

175
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,619
- I know, right?
- It is haunted, too.

176
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,556
You're right, so scary!

177
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,509
Mr. Mueang, do you intend to live here?

178
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,353
Yes.

179
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:53,775
Just clean up the inside

180
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,733
as much as possible, Aunties.

181
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,509
And what about the burnt side,

182
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:58,736
the one that requires repairs?

183
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,986
Leave it as it is for now,

184
00:10:00,002 --> 00:10:01,564
I'll call some repairmen later.

185
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:02,752
Cleaning it up enough

186
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,845
to be livable is enough.

187
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,228
If you say so, Mr. Mueang.

188
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:08,455
You all heard him, get to work.

189
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,503
Let's get to work.

190
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:19,827
I heard people talking

191
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:20,913
and turns out

192
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,908
it's you, Mai.

193
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:29,827
I didn't think the news

194
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:31,101
would spread this fast.

195
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:33,881
Villagers don't miss anything like this,

196
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,811
Mai, oh.

197
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:37,764
No. I should call you Mueang, right?

198
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:40,069
Whatever is more convenient, Countess.

199
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:41,264
I'm still the same person.

200
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:43,264
Either way he's our nephew, Ranchaun.

201
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:44,663
That's true.

202
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,256
But

203
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,069
why did you hide

204
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:49,774
your identity initially?

205
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:50,913
I didn't hide it,

206
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:52,194
I only recently found out

207
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,490
who I am myself.

208
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,085
This is a letter my parents

209
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,241
wrote to confirm my true identity.

210
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:03,577
I just found it when I returned home

211
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:05,186
to Ayutthaya a few days ago.

212
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:13,444
(Adoption letter)

213
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,420
(Sign)

214
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:18,545
As for who my parents were

215
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,350
and how I know about these things,

216
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:21,592
it's a long story.

217
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:23,913
I still need to find more details

218
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:25,030
to be certain.

219
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:27,943
I'll explain after I've dealt with

220
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:29,701
the House of the Dark Shadows.

221
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,866
No problem,

222
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,795
tell me whenever you're ready.

223
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:35,256
This letter is detailed enough,

224
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,702
I believe you didn't lie.

225
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:39,835
With this evidence,

226
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:41,233
I have no more doubt.

227
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:43,717
Welcome back home, my new nephew.

228
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,842
Thank you very much.

229
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,936
I'll have a discussion

230
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,069
with Mueang alone.

231
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:52,038
Rat,

232
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:53,764
bring Ranchaun to rest for now.

233
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:54,813
Yes, Father.

234
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:07,690
Is there something you want to discuss?

235
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:13,573
Stop acting, young man.

236
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,185
You are not Mueang, my nephew.

237
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:24,429
This letter from them is also fake.

238
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,867
The letter is too new,

239
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:35,820
the content isn't concrete,

240
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:37,897
anyone can write it.

241
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:39,593
There's no proof your parents

242
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:40,898
actually wrote it.

243
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:43,031
The details in the letter, you could

244
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,875
have hired someone to investigate.

245
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:47,585
Ranchaun is simply gullible,

246
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:50,328
and you wanted to return the assets.

247
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,742
So she believed your tricks.

248
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:56,554
But you also accuse me without basis.

249
00:13:09,273 --> 00:13:10,546
I doubt you'll deny

250
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:12,251
sending this telegram.

251
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:14,156
But I don't want to

252
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:15,351
take drastic measures.

253
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,430
Consider helping each other,

254
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:20,031
sell me The House of Dark Shadows,

255
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:21,727
then leave this place.

256
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:27,522
That telegram was truly sent

257
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:28,514
to Venerable Monk Dech.

258
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:29,780
But I won't ask

259
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:31,553
how you obtained it.

260
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:33,256
At the time I sent that telegram,

261
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:34,333
I did not yet know

262
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:35,834
the truth about my identity.

263
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:37,740
I sent it out of misunderstanding.

264
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:40,037
The truth is, I am Mueang.

265
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:45,116
Aren't you being too shameless?

266
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,515
Do you know just this telegram

267
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,999
is enough for me to nullify your

268
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:51,069
possession of

269
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:52,725
The House of the Dark Shadows?

270
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,796
I understand.

271
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:55,554
But if you wanted to sue,

272
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:57,936
you wouldn't have acted earlier

273
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,171
and now threaten me secretly.

274
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:01,421
Correct?

275
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:04,632
That's because lawsuits

276
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,296
take a long time.

277
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:08,124
The foreigner wanting to

278
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:09,389
buy The House of Dark Shadows

279
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:10,647
may change their mind.

280
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:11,850
You might pass away

281
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,975
before you get to use the money.

282
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:15,437
You dare curse me?

283
00:14:15,462 --> 00:14:17,101
I'm speaking as the circumstances allow.

284
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:18,258
Currently the land title

285
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,453
is under my name.

286
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:21,281
To prove who is right or wrong

287
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:23,001
will take

288
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:24,447
a long time.

289
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:26,211
Clever,

290
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:27,665
cleverer than I thought.

291
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,118
But I will not let the assets

292
00:14:31,142 --> 00:14:33,075
of my family fall to another.

293
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:46,689
You are not welcome here!

294
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:48,244
A ghost!

295
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:49,752
Leave!

296
00:14:55,614 --> 00:15:00,535
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

297
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:05,535
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

298
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:44,937
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

299
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,805
What are you so scared for?

300
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:48,969
Don't forget, we've already

301
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,149
received the money!

302
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:52,829
Go!

303
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:09,996
What is that?

304
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:16,633
Blood!

305
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:25,403
You are not welcome here!

306
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:26,715
A ghost!

307
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:31,535
Leave!

308
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:43,948
Hey, where are you lot going?

309
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:44,956
Come back!

310
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:55,128
I'm not afraid of you, you crazy ghost.

311
00:16:57,714 --> 00:16:59,112
You met your match with me.

312
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,526
Crazy ghost, are you satisfied now?

313
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,908
You still haven't let me go.

314
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:17,855
Leave!

315
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:26,657
I told you to get out!

316
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:47,444
I'm leaving!

317
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:49,827
I'm leaving!

318
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,099
Marquis Phichit!

319
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:28,419
I told you to go kill him,

320
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,559
why did you run around like a stray dog?

321
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,630
Ask that stupid holy thread of yours,

322
00:19:36,162 --> 00:19:37,966
it couldn't do anything to that ghost.

323
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,552
Fortunately, she didn't break my neck.

324
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,833
That damn Malai.

325
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:44,724
I don't want to do this anymore.

326
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:46,255
Fighting people is one thing

327
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:47,708
but ghosts?

328
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:49,427
What can I use to fight them?

329
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:50,583
But you have to fight.

330
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:52,724
Have you forgotten

331
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:54,810
who bailed you out and

332
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,638
gave you money to spend?

333
00:20:06,345 --> 00:20:07,977
So what do you want me to do?

334
00:20:09,423 --> 00:20:11,032
I'm sure you didn't bail me out

335
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,789
because you're merciful.

336
00:20:28,063 --> 00:20:29,117
If you get a chance,

337
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,484
kill that young man Mai.

338
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:33,078
That Mai who keeps courting Rerai?

339
00:20:33,203 --> 00:20:34,445
What did he do to you, sir?

340
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:35,601
You need not know.

341
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,007
Just do what you're told.

342
00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:40,304
I'm sending another group.

343
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,679
If they succeed, good.

344
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:45,023
If not,

345
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:47,828
you clean up after them.

346
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:49,265
Don't leave any evidence

347
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,281
leading back to me.

348
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:53,453
Don't worry, sir.

349
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:55,546
With this much money,

350
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:57,250
anything can be done.

351
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:03,695
I've done as you asked,

352
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:05,679
What more do you want?

353
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,578
Did you get into trouble at all?

354
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:09,507
But this is a ghost.

355
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:11,140
What do you want me to do?

356
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:13,351
What if I find a way for you to get her,

357
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:15,476
will you be able to kill Mai then?

358
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:16,765
Not just kill,

359
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:18,898
if that ghost is out of the way,

360
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:21,156
I'll burn that house down for you.

361
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:00,759
Get out!

362
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:02,102
I won't leave!

363
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:05,040
Hold her down!

364
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:06,883
You...

365
00:22:07,985 --> 00:22:09,946
Let go!

366
00:22:10,384 --> 00:22:11,985
I will banish this ogre myself!

367
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:15,516
Let go!

368
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:23,989
Let go!

369
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:26,903
Die!

370
00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:34,044
Is that all a petty ogre

371
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:35,926
like you can do?

372
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:56,327
- How are you?
- Are you alright?

373
00:22:57,452 --> 00:22:59,780
Look, she's regained consciousness.

374
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:02,037
Are you alright?

375
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:03,740
How are you?

376
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,522
The ogre

377
00:23:05,694 --> 00:23:07,214
has left your body.

378
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:11,608
It's finally over.

379
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:19,217
And are you aware that

380
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:20,530
he's claiming to be "Mr. Mueang"?

381
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:22,139
It's all in the pursuit of truth.

382
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,203
It is fate.

(House of the Dark Shadows

385
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:45,742
Venerable Monk.

386
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:49,547
Do you have some business?

387
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:51,594
Mai has been here for many days now.

388
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,860
I'm aware.

389
00:23:52,985 --> 00:23:54,391
And are you aware that

390
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:56,227
he's claiming to be "Mr. Mueang"?

391
00:23:56,258 --> 00:23:57,094
I'm aware.

392
00:23:57,118 --> 00:23:58,125
You are aware?

393
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:00,414
Then why didn't you stop him?

394
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,320
- Even though...
- It's all in the pursuit of truth.

395
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:03,656
Truth?

396
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:06,409
What truth again?

397
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:07,727
You know well

398
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:09,195
I've been trying to find

399
00:24:09,204 --> 00:24:10,586
this truth for a long time,

400
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:12,203
of who killed Ms. Malai.

401
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,352
Are you still dreaming empty dreams?

402
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:17,680
Honestly, are you still

403
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:18,750
hoping for the assets?

404
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:19,878
Just admit it.

405
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:22,961
I've never hoped for any assets.

406
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,469
I hope that's true.

407
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,781
I don't feel like arguing.

408
00:24:26,985 --> 00:24:28,617
You can lie in your yellow robes

409
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:29,666
if you want,

410
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:31,266
but I only ask one thing,

411
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:32,797
don't let Kam and Uan's child

412
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:34,102
mess with mine.

413
00:24:34,915 --> 00:24:36,797
If he's cooperating with you,

414
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:39,226
you should warn him.

415
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:41,413
Fueang,

416
00:24:41,585 --> 00:24:42,882
no one can

417
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:44,632
forbid destiny.

418
00:24:44,937 --> 00:24:46,655
People have shared meritorious deeds.

419
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,515
I don't care about merits or demerits.

420
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:50,100
I don't want my child to be involved

421
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:51,421
with this bloody asset.

422
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:54,382
Truth is eternal, Fueang.

423
00:24:54,718 --> 00:24:55,968
You know well who truly

424
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:57,202
deserves that assets.

425
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,054
If it returns to the rightful hands

426
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,483
through this means,

427
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:04,031
It is fate.

428
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,835
Fate?

429
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,936
I'll defy fate.

430
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:10,983
My kid will never be

431
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:12,711
stained by that asset again.

432
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:16,791
Just you wait.

433
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,890
Kla,

434
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,429
I get scared every time.

435
00:25:39,843 --> 00:25:41,412
I come back here.

436
00:25:41,437 --> 00:25:42,749
What's there to be afraid of?

437
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:44,706
The Marquis specially gave us amulets,

438
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:46,929
we have nothing to fear from ghosts.

439
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:50,929
Done and done, brother.

440
00:26:00,678 --> 00:26:01,798
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

441
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:03,608
Kla!

442
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,123
I think it's strange.

443
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:06,310
It's not strange,

444
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:07,779
it's just the wind.

445
00:26:08,905 --> 00:26:10,459
What's there to be so scared of?

446
00:26:11,608 --> 00:26:12,608
Hand it to me.

447
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,398
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

448
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:24,918
Leave!

449
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:29,496
I'm not afraid of you!

450
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:32,702
Come stop us yourself if you really can.

451
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:53,605
Did you become powerless this time?

452
00:26:53,754 --> 00:26:56,035
I really hit the jackpot this time,

453
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,129
it wasn't as easy as last time!

454
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:00,379
Do it!

455
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:01,973
Yes!

456
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:26,051
Ms. Malai!

457
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,870
Let go!

458
00:27:55,245 --> 00:27:56,245
Don't do it!

459
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:57,276
No!

460
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:18,206
Die!

461
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:35,852
Hey!

462
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:46,379
Whoa!

463
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:49,988
No, brother!

464
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:06,879
Ms. Malai!

465
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,839
We can't let the house burn!

466
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:18,277
You...

467
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,660
You...

468
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,175
It's time for your death!

469
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:48,869
Come here!

470
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:54,505
Malai! Come to me!

471
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:01,756
Ms. Malai!

472
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:04,232
You cannot escape me, Mai!

473
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:05,896
Die!

474
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:19,216
You're finally here, you evil spirit!

475
00:30:23,408 --> 00:30:24,408
Take that!

476
00:30:29,268 --> 00:30:30,322
I will imprison you so

477
00:30:30,338 --> 00:30:31,712
you cannot escape or be reborn.

478
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:34,040
I will torture you to the extreme.

479
00:31:04,221 --> 00:31:05,221
Help!

480
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,690
Help!

481
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:14,503
Anyone, help me please!

482
00:31:14,862 --> 00:31:15,862
Anyone...

483
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,010
Anyone!

484
00:31:19,737 --> 00:31:22,393
Help!

485
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,690
Let go!

486
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:34,698
Don't do it!

487
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:45,900
Kla, why are you doing this?

488
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:47,463
Were you hired by someone?

489
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:48,651
Shut up!

490
00:31:48,901 --> 00:31:50,166
Who ordered you?

491
00:31:50,393 --> 00:31:51,408
Tell me, I promise

492
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:52,924
I won't tell the police.

493
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:55,213
I'd have to be a fool to believe you!

494
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:01,323
Die...

495
00:32:12,218 --> 00:32:13,218
Kla!

496
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:16,523
Kla!

497
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:21,859
Kla!

498
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:25,695
Kla!

499
00:32:30,668 --> 00:32:31,668
Kla!

500
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,331
Who?

501
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:41,208
Who are you?

502
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,394
I came to exterminate

503
00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:43,581
the ghost completely.

504
00:32:44,355 --> 00:32:46,605
Why the heck are you protecting it?

505
00:32:48,027 --> 00:32:49,878
I cannot let you do that.

506
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:52,980
This doesn't concern you.

507
00:32:53,668 --> 00:32:54,831
Please leave.

508
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,830
Don't do it,

509
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:28,392
please don't kill anyone else.

510
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:46,397
You don't have to help me!

511
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:47,592
I don't want it.

512
00:34:08,787 --> 00:34:10,388
This is my true form.

513
00:34:11,154 --> 00:34:12,810
My real body is at the temple.

514
00:34:15,404 --> 00:34:17,185
Then why appear in this form?

515
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:19,044
Or are you

516
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:21,341
ashamed

517
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:23,904
to wear the yellow robe?

518
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:25,427
No, it's not like that.

519
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:29,708
I just wanted to talk to you

520
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,997
using the form of when we first met.

521
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:37,654
Ms. Malai,

522
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:40,083
please stop making sins,

523
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:42,849
for your own benefit and merit.

524
00:34:43,356 --> 00:34:44,357
Someone like you

525
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:45,739
has no right to teach me.

526
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,013
I became like this

527
00:34:47,857 --> 00:34:49,217
because of you!

528
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:50,762
It's because of you alone, Dech!

529
00:34:50,787 --> 00:34:51,935
But I did not do it.

530
00:34:52,107 --> 00:34:53,661
No matter how many years pass,

531
00:34:53,685 --> 00:34:54,755
I will maintain

532
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,599
that I had no way to harm you.

533
00:34:57,826 --> 00:34:58,943
I don't believe you!

534
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:00,909
You killed me!

535
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,568
I will never ever forgive you,

536
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,325
even if you help me,

537
00:35:06,654 --> 00:35:08,388
I will never have a soft heart

538
00:35:09,076 --> 00:35:11,240
to believe people like you again, Dech.

539
00:35:11,724 --> 00:35:13,115
I cautioned you only because

540
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:14,771
I don't want you to commit more sins.

541
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:16,185
I don't want you to be bound

542
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,411
to the point where you cannot be reborn.

543
00:35:42,447 --> 00:35:43,759
How did you manage to survive

544
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:44,767
from the house fire back then

545
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,118
when you're like this?

547
00:35:56,676 --> 00:36:01,597
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

548
00:36:02,613 --> 00:36:03,824
And then the locals

549
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:05,199
helped put out the fire.

550
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:06,785
Kla brought people to

551
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:08,011
burn down this house,

552
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,316
but he got burnt and died.

553
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:10,652
He wanted to kill me,

554
00:36:10,965 --> 00:36:12,511
so I acted in self-defense.

555
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,464
He swayed into the fire.

556
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:15,566
I tried to save him.

557
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:17,605
But the fire was too strong.

558
00:36:19,027 --> 00:36:20,472
You! Mai!

559
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:23,481
Mai!

560
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:25,573
Are you alright?

561
00:36:26,426 --> 00:36:28,129
I heard the house was burnt down.

562
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,192
I'm not hurt,

563
00:36:29,238 --> 00:36:30,660
only Kla's gang got harmed.

564
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:33,863
Still joking around,

565
00:36:34,488 --> 00:36:35,972
what would you do if you died?

566
00:36:36,043 --> 00:36:37,347
I'm not dead yet,

567
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,129
worried about me?

568
00:36:39,715 --> 00:36:41,214
If I knew you'd be like this,

569
00:36:41,707 --> 00:36:43,214
I wouldn't have wasted time worrying.

570
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,621
Sorry, Lieutenant Rat.

571
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:52,964
Did I interupt you?

572
00:36:53,465 --> 00:36:54,585
No, it's fine.

573
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:56,496
The questioning is over anyway.

574
00:36:56,762 --> 00:36:58,668
If I have any other questions.

575
00:36:58,996 --> 00:37:00,793
I'll ask you to come to the station.

576
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:02,074
Yes, Lieutenant.

577
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:03,339
Then I'll take my leave.

578
00:37:04,629 --> 00:37:05,691
I'll leave it to you.

579
00:37:05,988 --> 00:37:06,988
Yes, sir.

580
00:37:10,637 --> 00:37:12,004
Is that all you came for?

581
00:37:12,348 --> 00:37:14,348
Yes, what else would there be?

582
00:37:15,215 --> 00:37:16,613
You told me to be careful,

583
00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:18,238
and look at you

584
00:37:18,434 --> 00:37:20,324
almost getting killed in that house.

585
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:21,941
I can take care of myself.

586
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,090
Yeah, sure.

587
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:25,286
A deserted house,

588
00:37:25,582 --> 00:37:26,910
how could you live alone?

589
00:37:27,574 --> 00:37:29,144
I really don't understand you.

590
00:37:31,856 --> 00:37:33,394
Fortunately, you're not hurt.

591
00:37:33,957 --> 00:37:36,011
I'll be on my way to other errands then.

592
00:37:36,363 --> 00:37:37,363
What errand?

593
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:39,535
Well...

594
00:37:39,606 --> 00:37:41,183
I'm going to visit Ms. Bu-nga.

595
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,941
Then I'll come along too.

596
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,440
Taking a stroll in the market,

597
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:52,331
Ms. Bu-nga seems to be in a good mood.

598
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:54,729
And how is her condition so far?

599
00:37:55,221 --> 00:37:56,331
Same as usual,

600
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,714
neither better nor worse.

601
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:00,737
Desserts!

602
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:02,144
Desserts!

603
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:03,547
Are you hungry?

604
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,104
I'll go get some for you.

605
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:07,026
You can get my desserts.

606
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:08,870
I made a lot today.

607
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:10,816
Wonderful.

608
00:38:11,292 --> 00:38:12,292
Mai,

609
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,792
take good care of Ms. Bu-nga, okay?

610
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:14,862
No need to worry.

611
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,276
I'll assist you then.

612
00:38:17,316 --> 00:38:18,316
Alright.

613
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:24,447
Ms. Bu-nga,

614
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:26,455
let us sit there for a moment.

615
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,228
Let us have desserts.

616
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:34,915
Let us sit here, Ms. Bu-nga.

617
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:53,119
How did you manage to survive

618
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:54,378
from the house fire back then

619
00:38:54,403 --> 00:38:55,822
when you're like this?

620
00:39:06,127 --> 00:39:07,807
Because I had Im with me.

621
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:19,830
When you say that,

622
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:22,548
does it mean you know who's behind this?

623
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,330
After Im helped me escape.

624
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,423
Ms. Bu-nga!

625
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:33,486
Ms. Bu-nga, hurry up, help Ms. Bu-nga!

626
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:34,689
Hurry up!

627
00:39:38,432 --> 00:39:40,330
Ms. Bu-nga!

628
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:03,525
You were the one who kill me.

629
00:40:03,557 --> 00:40:04,939
- I didn't...
- Get out!

630
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:06,290
I told you to get out!

631
00:40:10,557 --> 00:40:11,634
Fueang didn't want you to

632
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,955
know about your origin,

633
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:14,517
about your father.

634
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:16,087
Rerai was abducted to

635
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:17,150
the House of the Dark Shadows.

636
00:40:17,174 --> 00:40:18,454
From the situation,

637
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:20,524
the culprit is the Marquis Phichit.

638
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:22,017
Fueang.

639
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,248
Venerable Monk!

640
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:27,149
You finally came, you scum!

641
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,103
You will never be able to help anyone.

642
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:31,345
The one you love

643
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:33,041
will have a brutal death.

644
00:40:33,158 --> 00:40:34,158
