My parents were killed
in that house.

19
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,680
I'm looking for their murderer.

20
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:07,990
Do you want to know now
who killed me?

21
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:09,937
I didn't do anything wrong.

22
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:11,503
It's not the truth!

23
00:02:11,553 --> 00:02:12,553
Rerai!

24
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:14,236
Where's Malai's body?

25
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,043
I buried her body
under your house in Hua Hin.

26
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,543
That was thoughtful.

27
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,640
I promise I will stay
with you for eternity.

28
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:26,157
Your duty to Dech
ended a long time ago.

29
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:28,764
If I insist, what are you gonna do?

30
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:32,790
Things must go as we planned.

31
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:35,377
Help!

32
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,303
-Tell me or else!
-A guy called Saeng

33
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:38,436
hired me, my lord.

34
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,449
Saeng!

35
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:51,523
The money to start over.

36
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:53,160
You have no excuse now.

37
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:55,456
So you can get out of my sight.

38
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,720
How much love and loyalty
I have for you,

39
00:03:01,197 --> 00:03:02,517
you know full well.

40
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:05,203
But today

41
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:08,150
after I helped you get
Malai out of your way,

42
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,770
you're kicking me out
like an unwanted pet?

43
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:37,039
You think this small
amount of money

44
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:41,069
can buy my silence about
all the vile acts you committed?!

45
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:43,403
Saeng!

46
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,770
My lord!

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,960
Will you take the money

48
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,943
and leave this house peacefully

49
00:03:54,223 --> 00:03:56,333
or do you wish to die
and become a house ghost?

50
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,920
May I ask you
one question, my lord?

51
00:04:01,302 --> 00:04:02,509
After all these years,

52
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,510
have you ever loved me?

53
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,690
Does that hurt?

54
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:40,903
Thanks a lot.

55
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,360
I never thought

56
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,803
Saeng would do something so stupid.

57
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,960
We lived together for years.

58
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:52,950
Ends up getting kicked out
because of his own jealousy.

59
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
I'm glad he's gone.

60
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:00,400
You've seen him harass me daily.

61
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:03,937
That's true.

62
00:06:04,517 --> 00:06:05,557
Does it hurt?

63
00:06:06,103 --> 00:06:08,000
-Of course.
-Let me see the other side.

64
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:15,277
You can leave.

65
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,677
I'll take care of him.

66
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:53,200
Do your wounds still hurt?

67
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,443
They hurt
when the medicine wears off.

68
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,160
I don't think
I can serve you tonight.

69
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,307
Forgive me.

70
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,953
It's okay, Dech.

71
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,440
I just came by
to make sure you were okay.

72
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:12,747
Get some rest.

73
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,432
I thought you went to your room.

74
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:34,080
Are you blocking my way?

75
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:39,857
I didn't want to dirty my eyes
by looking at a pervert.

76
00:08:40,257 --> 00:08:41,257
Slap me.

77
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,600
So I'll scream.

78
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:48,564
So Dech can hear that you hurt me.

79
00:08:56,137 --> 00:08:57,280
You don't dare do it.

80
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,577
Because if you dare,

81
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:04,510
you probably already told Dech
what vile things you did to me.

82
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:05,957
Fueang.

83
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:12,280
I was absolutely right.

84
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:15,760
I was right to think
you were a coward.

85
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,440
Afraid of angering Dech
more than anything.

86
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:50,350
Ms. Malai, it's me.

87
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:54,680
You startled me, Dech

88
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:56,850
Don't be scared.

89
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,680
And did the viscount know
you went out at night like this?

90
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,930
He didn't.

91
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:08,057
Oh.

92
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,850
What did you do?

93
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,930
How did you hurt your head?

94
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,710
Let me look.

95
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:15,063
Are you hurt?

96
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:20,329
Seeing you worried about me

97
00:10:20,423 --> 00:10:22,056
has healed me completely.

98
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:26,657
Oh, Ms. Malai,

99
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:28,800
I've brought good news.

100
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:32,150
Saeng can't hurt me anymore.

101
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:34,317
He got kicked out of the house.

102
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,800
That was the reason
you got hurt, wasn't it?

103
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,710
I'd take more pain if I had to.

104
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,857
At least the plan
for us to be together

105
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,400
is about to succeed.

106
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:56,397
Please be patient,

107
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:58,343
my dearest Ms. Malai.

108
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:02,603
I'll wait.

109
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,943
I'll wait for our days together.

110
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,320
I have an idea where to hide.

111
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,200
The viscount
will never figure it out.

112
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:28,520
I'm gonna stay here for a while.

113
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:32,477
I'll help take care of Bu-nga
in the meantime.

114
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:36,443
Please keep this a secret.

115
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:37,757
Here.

116
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,037
-Keep it.
-Thank you, ma'am.

117
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:41,123
Sure.

118
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:53,270
Stop making a worried face.

119
00:11:55,783 --> 00:12:00,000
The servants promised to keep
my staying here a secret.

120
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,040
Are you sure you can trust
the servants of this house?

121
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:05,920
They all know
I'm Bu-nga's best friend.

122
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,383
And I paid for my room and board.

123
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,000
Most importantly,

124
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:14,583
I promised to take care
of Bu-nga while I was here.

125
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,317
So they have another
trustworthy person to help out.

126
00:12:22,953 --> 00:12:24,290
Please be patient.

127
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,524
In the meantime,
if I have a chance,

128
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:28,064
I'll secretly visit you.

129
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:30,575
I understand.

130
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:32,968
Uh...

131
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:34,388
What are you gonna do

132
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:36,596
to get out of the viscount's life

133
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,757
without being harassed again?

134
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:41,336
As long as he thinks you're dead,

135
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,083
and my Ms. Malai is safe and sound,

136
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,160
that's more than enough.

137
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,236
And other things will take time.

138
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,343
I'll wait until
he's completely convinced

139
00:12:54,354 --> 00:12:56,116
and find an opportunity
to escape again.

140
00:13:02,103 --> 00:13:04,170
I have to plan carefully this time

141
00:13:04,377 --> 00:13:06,210
so he can't use other people

142
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,083
like when he took
Kam's son hostage.

143
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,280
Whatever you do,

144
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:30,800
I know you do it for me.

145
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,856
I wish you...

146
00:13:36,043 --> 00:13:38,163
success in your plan.

147
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,040
I wish you luck.

148
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:46,040
I'll wait for the days
we can  be together.

149
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:50,697
Yes, Ms. Malai.

150
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,410
Hey, Dech.

151
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:07,897
You think His Lordship
will readily believe our words?

152
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,310
No.

153
00:14:11,343 --> 00:14:13,680
The viscount doesn't
trust anyone easily.

154
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:15,158
Most importantly,

155
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:17,840
he knows I would never
let anyone hurt Ms. Malai.

156
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,120
Then how could you give Ms. Malai
that kind of assurance?

157
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:23,320
I said all that to comfort her.

158
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,840
You're well aware she's too
virtuous to know the truth.

159
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,080
What do you mean?

160
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,360
Let me ask you something.

161
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:39,163
Do you want to stop
serving the viscount

162
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:41,063
and have money to live comfortably

163
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:43,360
with your family
for the rest of your life?

164
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,270
Why?

165
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:48,577
What's your plan?

166
00:14:51,703 --> 00:14:52,950
Help me

167
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:54,320
get rid of the viscount

168
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,880
and take all his fortune.

169
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,410
Dech.

170
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,632
Where have you been?

171
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,997
Did you know I was worried?

172
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:25,344
I went out to buy medicine.

173
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:28,190
I already gave you
western medicine.

174
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,312
I'm taking both Thai
and western medicine,

175
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,840
so I'll get better and be able
to serve you sooner.

176
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:36,277
Next time tell someone
where you're going.

177
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,280
Did you know I told Kam
to have people look for you?

178
00:15:42,283 --> 00:15:43,920
I'm not a child anymore.

179
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,984
I just went to a medicine shop
in Bang Lamphu.

180
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:48,297
You can't do that.

181
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,917
Especially with Saeng hating you.

182
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,683
He just got kicked out.

183
00:15:51,997 --> 00:15:54,750
Who knows if he plans
to hurt you again.

184
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:58,920
Thank you for your concern.

185
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:00,824
I'll be careful.

186
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,440
You're gonna be late for work.

187
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,117
I'll get your things ready.

188
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,757
Thanks a lot.

189
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:09,483
Yes, sir.

190
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,850
I'll take the bandage off for you.

191
00:16:58,043 --> 00:16:59,763
Is there something wrong, my lord?

192
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:02,563
Why are you looking
at me like that?

193
00:17:04,117 --> 00:17:05,117
Nothing.

194
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,277
I'm just happy you're back with me.

195
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:11,657
Without you,

196
00:17:13,977 --> 00:17:16,200
I don't know how my life would be.

197
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,600
I'm sorry for everything I did

198
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,920
that troubled you.

199
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,480
If you didn't foster me and Fueang,

200
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,960
I would have had no education

201
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:36,840
and stayed a beggar.

202
00:17:39,197 --> 00:17:41,744
I was wrong to betray you.

203
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,390
Dech.

204
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:51,360
I admit

205
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:54,683
I might have been offended
and upset by what you did.

206
00:17:56,103 --> 00:17:57,223
But in the end,

207
00:17:57,537 --> 00:17:59,040
I was able to forgive you

208
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,080
because of my love for you.

209
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:04,663
My lord.

210
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:06,880
I love you so much.

211
00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:08,977
Always have.

212
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:15,716
-Hey!
-My lord.

213
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,756
Saeng!

214
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:18,514
It was your plan, wasn't it?

215
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:19,840
You framed me!

216
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:22,600
The one who planned everything
was the viscount.

217
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:23,754
Not me.

219
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:35,252
(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

220
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:37,195
I love you so much.

221
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:41,432
Always have.

222
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,677
You're really good at everything.

223
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:54,003
No, my lord.

224
00:18:54,096 --> 00:18:55,876
I boxed for money
when I was little.

225
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:57,556
I still remember some of it.

226
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,163
If I didn't run into you,

227
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:02,400
I would have still been illiterate.

228
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:03,737
I don't think so.

229
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:05,960
You're smart
and want to get better.

230
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:07,717
Other servants don't care.

231
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:13,697
So why do you suddenly
take boxing lessons?

232
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:16,757
It's my father.

233
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:18,783
He said as a man,

234
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,216
I should have boxing skills.

235
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:21,880
I'm a baron.

236
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:24,216
Whom am I going to fight?

237
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,240
The marquis probably meant well.

238
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,200
Wanted you to learn boxing.

239
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,017
Shall we go, my lord?

240
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:35,917
Let's go.

241
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:41,743
Thepphanom!

242
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,130
Jot Muay!

243
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,083
Left forward punch!

244
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,130
Left knee strike!

245
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:03,616
Right knee strike!

246
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,153
Left parallel kick!

247
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,320
Focus! Focus!

248
00:20:23,197 --> 00:20:24,197
Dech!

249
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:25,520
Take this seriously!

250
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:34,363
Yes, sir.

251
00:20:57,963 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm sorry, my lord.

252
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:00,536
I didn't mean to.

253
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:03,103
Are you okay?

254
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,550
I'm okay.

255
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:06,603
Hey!

256
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:08,200
Why are you shocked?!

257
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,730
Are you slacking off?!

258
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:11,480
Go back to practice!

259
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:25,360
Does it hurt a lot?

260
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,760
Don't make that face.

261
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,440
Just a small bruise.

262
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:39,037
I'm sorry
for offending you, my lord.

263
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,830
Don't worry.

264
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:42,280
I'm not mad at you.

265
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,890
Thank you, my lord.

266
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:50,760
But if you really feel guilty

267
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:53,316
and want to make amends.

268
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:56,440
there's something
you can do for me.

269
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,160
Really, my lord?

270
00:21:59,663 --> 00:22:01,160
You can tell me.

271
00:22:01,543 --> 00:22:03,600
I'll do everything.

272
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,490
Give me a massage every night.

273
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,424
Do it until I fall asleep.

274
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
Can you do that?

275
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
Yes, my lord.

276
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
That's nothing.

277
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,920
Trust me, my lord.

278
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:23,463
Then let's try.

279
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,440
May I?

280
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,697
Does that feel nice?

281
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,840
I wish I could stop this moment

282
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,200
and be with you
like this forever.

283
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:00,543
It's late.

284
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,096
You should go to work.
I'll accompany you today.

285
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:10,723
Really?

286
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,080
But you're not healed yet.

287
00:24:14,597 --> 00:24:15,920
Why are you going out again?

288
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,680
I ordered more medicine.

289
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,163
The shopkeeper said
it'd arrive late morning.

290
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,480
Since I'm going out anyway,
I'll see you to your office.

291
00:24:25,303 --> 00:24:26,903
Please let me change.

292
00:24:27,937 --> 00:24:28,937
Of course.

293
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:53,680
What a beautiful day.

294
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,990
Yes, my lord.

295
00:24:56,723 --> 00:24:58,163
You want something to eat?

296
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,303
No, I don't wanna get fat.

297
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:01,303
My lord!

298
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:02,749
-Hey!
-My lord.

299
00:25:02,923 --> 00:25:04,560
Saeng, let go of me!

300
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:06,177
Saeng!

301
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,000
Please don't do this to me.

302
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:12,360
Please forgive me.

303
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,650
-Saeng, let go.
-Saeng.

304
00:25:14,773 --> 00:25:16,540
-Saeng, let go of him.
-Let go.

305
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,633
People are looking. Don't you see?

306
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,040
Don't pretend to be nice.

307
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:23,003
You don't love him like I do.

308
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:24,527
You wouldn't understand me.

309
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Saeng.

310
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:28,640
-Saeng!
-Saeng!

311
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
My lord.

312
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:31,939
Please let me go back
to your house.

313
00:25:32,106 --> 00:25:33,960
I promise I'll be better.

314
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:36,760
I love you, my lord.

315
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,640
Saeng! Let me go right now!

316
00:25:40,963 --> 00:25:42,417
You talk nonsense
when you're drunk!

317
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,490
I'm not letting you go.
I love you, my lord.

318
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,037
I'm telling the truth.

319
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:48,396
I've been serving you
for so many years.

320
00:25:49,263 --> 00:25:51,760
won't you show a little care
for me, my lord?

321
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,766
His Lordship and I realize now

322
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:58,680
how loyal you are to him.

323
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,610
But he has to go to work now.

324
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,440
Let's talk about this
at his house later. Understand?

325
00:26:04,903 --> 00:26:06,343
Hey, Saeng.

326
00:26:10,663 --> 00:26:12,143
Don't pretend to be nice.

327
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,760
You framed me!

328
00:26:14,377 --> 00:26:16,590
Got me kicked out
like an unwanted pet.

329
00:26:17,557 --> 00:26:19,520
It was your plan, wasn't it?

330
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,750
You bastard!

331
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:32,640
Go to work, my lord.
I'll deal with him.

332
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:34,157
Thanks, Dech.

333
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,083
Get off me.

334
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,310
My lord.

335
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:39,337
My lord!

336
00:26:39,823 --> 00:26:41,243
-Get off me.
-Get going, Saeng.

337
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,617
You talk nonsense
when you're drunk.

338
00:26:43,628 --> 00:26:45,892
You never learn, no matter
how many times you're punished.

339
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:46,903
Move!

340
00:26:46,928 --> 00:26:47,828
Let go.

341
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:48,872
-Let go, Dech.
-Move!

342
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:50,288
Get off me!

343
00:26:51,281 --> 00:26:52,281
Let go, Dech.

344
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,797
I said let go.

345
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
Let go!

346
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,830
Fight me in the open if you dare.

347
00:27:05,117 --> 00:27:06,350
You ambushed me.

348
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,280
You're talking
about yourself, right?

349
00:27:13,037 --> 00:27:15,377
How does it feel
being the victim for once?

350
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:19,590
I expected you
to be smarter, Saeng.

351
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,890
What do you mean?

352
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:27,676
What you did earlier
proves you're a fool.

353
00:27:28,157 --> 00:27:30,040
You made him hate you even more.

354
00:27:30,323 --> 00:27:32,505
Especially after behaving
like that in public,

355
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,120
you expect His Lordship
to let you come back?

356
00:27:36,903 --> 00:27:38,430
Don't be a smartass.

357
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,490
I got kicked out
all because of you!

358
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:46,400
I'll let you in on something.

359
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:48,550
The one who planned everything

360
00:27:49,257 --> 00:27:50,400
was the viscount,

361
00:27:51,097 --> 00:27:52,097
not me.

362
00:27:57,617 --> 00:27:58,617
No way.

363
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:00,437
You're lying.

364
00:28:01,607 --> 00:28:03,760
Everyone gets tired of old things.

365
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,033
Except for when
it's someone he loves

366
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,620
like me.

367
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,830
What do you mean?

368
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,120
He kicked you out

369
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,810
because he wanted a younger boytoy

370
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:22,400
to replace you, you idiot.

371
00:28:25,377 --> 00:28:26,720
Now that you know,

372
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:29,083
don't show your face
at his house again.

373
00:28:58,523 --> 00:29:00,645
Why would you keep someone
who doesn't love you?

374
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,720
Won't it be better to take revenge
and live off his money?!

(House of the Dark Shadows
novel: Phakhinai, screenplay: Wannason)

377
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:22,057
Ms. Ramphoei!

378
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,957
Hey, I have something
amazing to report.

379
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:27,557
Say it. Don't stall. It's annoying.

380
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,262
People at the market
were talking about

381
00:29:30,273 --> 00:29:33,040
how Saeng was draping himself
all over the viscount.

382
00:29:33,427 --> 00:29:35,434
Like a lover begging
to get back together.

383
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:39,920
My word, that's so satisfying.

384
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:42,087
Eh?

385
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:45,160
You don't feel upset
about what I just said?

386
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:47,593
And what's so funny about this?

387
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Jeez!

388
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,816
Don't ask questions.

389
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:53,603
It's good you're sharing
what I send you to find out.

390
00:29:54,563 --> 00:29:55,763
You can go now.

391
00:30:00,977 --> 00:30:02,840
I said go!

392
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,440
Jeez, I'm going.

393
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,320
Poor thing.

394
00:30:27,997 --> 00:30:29,440
You're in a horrible state.

395
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:31,130
How I pity you.

396
00:30:31,937 --> 00:30:33,680
You never could compete with Dech.

397
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:36,040
And now you're in this state.

398
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:38,160
You'll never get
the viscount's attention.

399
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:41,183
You...

400
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:44,263
Hey.

401
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:47,480
What are you gonna do
to my sister?!

402
00:30:49,117 --> 00:30:50,977
Why did you upset him
with your taunts?

403
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:53,543
We're all in the same boat.

404
00:30:54,257 --> 00:30:56,404
I said all that
so you'd get it together.

405
00:30:56,443 --> 00:30:58,677
Why would you keep someone
who doesn't love you?

406
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:02,600
Won't it be better to take revenge
and live off his money?!

407
00:31:20,603 --> 00:31:22,116
Why are you giving me money?

408
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,150
I'm hiring you

409
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,070
to kill the person
who broke your heart.

410
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,760
And if you succeed

411
00:31:40,036 --> 00:31:42,480
and I get all the fortunes
of the Dark Shadow House,

412
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:44,950
you'll be set for life too.

413
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:46,760
Think it through.

414
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,520
Very smart, sister.

415
00:31:54,797 --> 00:31:55,797
Saeng,

416
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
make a decision.

417
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,587
An easy job
that gets you both money

418
00:32:00,257 --> 00:32:03,880
and revenge on the person who
ousted you like an unwanted pet.

419
00:32:08,307 --> 00:32:11,187
The viscount is meeting up
with Duke Siharat tomorrow.

420
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:13,602
You served him for a long time.

421
00:32:13,613 --> 00:32:15,800
You probably know where the duke...

422
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,460
lives.

423
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,470
Are you sure...

424
00:32:43,357 --> 00:32:44,760
your plan will work?

425
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:48,120
Phoem, we've got this far.

426
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:51,072
You didn't want
to commit another crime,

427
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,250
so I found someone
to do it for you.

428
00:32:53,297 --> 00:32:54,643
Why are you still worried?

429
00:32:55,317 --> 00:32:56,720
But is Saeng...

430
00:32:58,163 --> 00:32:59,163
trustworthy?

431
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,640
Who said I trusted him?

432
00:33:02,123 --> 00:33:03,123
What do you mean?

433
00:33:04,237 --> 00:33:06,280
After he killed the viscount,

434
00:33:06,437 --> 00:33:08,640
you kill him. It's not that hard.

435
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:10,950
Killing two birds with one stone.

436
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:20,160
You're really are my sister.

437
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,983
It's true the viscount's fortune
is considerable.

438
00:33:23,143 --> 00:33:25,200
But with a squanderer like you,

439
00:33:25,883 --> 00:33:27,680
it'd all be gone in a few years.

440
00:33:28,437 --> 00:33:31,877
Brother, don't you
insult this Ramphoei.

441
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,557
Despite my lack of education,

442
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:38,957
I know who I should put in charge
of the viscount's fortune.

443
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,920
Let me feel a little more assured.

444
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:45,040
Both of us will be set for life.

445
00:33:54,857 --> 00:33:56,377
These beautiful flowers

446
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:59,720
are a thousand more times
beautiful when they're with you.

447
00:34:03,157 --> 00:34:07,440
It's hard to believe that
you can be such a sweet talker.

448
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,040
I never said
these things to anyone.

449
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,877
There's only you

450
00:34:18,243 --> 00:34:19,696
who makes me feel this way.

451
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,840
How's Ms. Bu-nga's condition?

452
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:35,523
Same.

453
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,583
I feel sorry for her.

454
00:34:41,643 --> 00:34:44,360
I want her to be her old self soon.

455
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,530
I want Bu-nga

456
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:51,383
to be my confidant
like she used to be.

457
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:57,440
You seem to love Ms. Bu-nga a lot.

458
00:34:57,837 --> 00:34:58,837
Yes.

459
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:00,680
I have no relatives.

460
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:05,097
She was the only one
who truly loved and cared for me.

461
00:35:05,443 --> 00:35:07,490
Have you forgotten someone?

462
00:35:11,637 --> 00:35:12,840
I'm talking about me

463
00:35:13,643 --> 00:35:15,643
who loves and cares
for you with my life

464
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,000
as much as Ms. Bu-nga.

465
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,640
Thanks a lot
for walking me to the pier.

466
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:56,323
Yes, my lord.

467
00:35:57,617 --> 00:35:58,760
Wait, my lord.

468
00:36:01,483 --> 00:36:02,483
What?

469
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:04,930
Your button is undone.

470
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:06,629
Oh.

471
00:36:06,643 --> 00:36:07,960
I'll do it for you.

472
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:15,437
All done.

473
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,910
Did you know

474
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,080
ever since you came back,

475
00:36:22,983 --> 00:36:24,263
you're a lot more loving?

476
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,440
I hope you stay this way forever.

477
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:30,893
Yes, my lord.

478
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,110
Phaen, wait for me around here.

479
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,463
It shouldn't take long.

480
00:36:55,576 --> 00:36:56,596
Yes, my lord.

481
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,950
My lord.

482
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:14,560
I think I'm early.

483
00:37:14,937 --> 00:37:17,137
Why did the duke
send a servant to get me?

484
00:37:17,137 --> 00:37:20,760
The duke sent me to tell you
he had an urgent official matter.

485
00:37:22,097 --> 00:37:24,440
Why didn't he send a messenger
to my house earlier?

486
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,800
Why did he waste my time?

487
00:37:26,817 --> 00:37:27,966
Apologies, my lord.

488
00:37:28,183 --> 00:37:30,883
The duke has just left, my lord.

489
00:37:32,563 --> 00:37:35,050
He left you a letter, my lord.

490
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,070
(Viscount, I have an urgent
official matter that requires me

491
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,110
to travel up north without telling
you. Please accept my apology.)

492
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,080
I understand now.

493
00:37:53,597 --> 00:37:55,030
Let the duke know

494
00:37:55,563 --> 00:37:56,896
I've got his letter.

495
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,730
Yes, my lord.

496
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,563
I'll let you in on something.

497
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,333
The one who planned everything

498
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:14,916
was the viscount,

499
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:16,546
not me.

500
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,843
Everyone gets tired of old things.

501
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:20,782
Except for when
it's someone he loves

502
00:38:21,322 --> 00:38:22,322
like me.

503
00:38:22,797 --> 00:38:24,397
He kicked you out

504
00:38:24,493 --> 00:38:26,613
because he wanted a younger boytoy

505
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:29,230
to replace you, you idiot.

508
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,610
Saeng!

509
00:39:17,197 --> 00:39:20,160
I hope you won't see your face
in this house tomorrow!

510
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,640
Get him out of here!

511
00:39:36,437 --> 00:39:38,721
May I ask you
one question, my lord?

512
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:40,296
After all these years,

513
00:39:40,604 --> 00:39:42,284
have you ever loved me?

514
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,550
Will you take the money

515
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,580
and leave this house peacefully

516
00:39:56,646 --> 00:39:58,520
or will you die
and become a house ghost?

517
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,610
Damn it.

518
00:40:25,237 --> 00:40:27,000
How dare you refuse this client?!

519
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:30,080
Do you know how rich he is?!

520
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:33,390
It's true they're rich,
but they're filthy.

521
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:36,276
They don't wash,
stinking to high heaven.

522
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:41,644
You're just a whore.
You can't pick and choose.

523
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,272
If you want their money so much,
do it yourself!

524
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:45,404
You have a smart mouth!

525
00:40:45,437 --> 00:40:46,437
Kick his ass!

526
00:40:49,753 --> 00:40:51,347
Are you gonna do it? Huh?

527
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:52,846
You think you're so good?

528
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:11,023
Please, sir.

529
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:43,523
What's wrong?

530
00:41:43,923 --> 00:41:45,280
Why can't you look at me?

531
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:48,896
I've never met anyone rich...

532
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:52,144
as good-looking as you, sir.

533
00:41:57,477 --> 00:41:58,920
How do you know I'm  rich?

534
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,120
What I'm wearing

535
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:03,200
doesn't look that good.

536
00:42:03,403 --> 00:42:05,240
No matter how you're dressed,

537
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,440
it can't hide your true nobility.

538
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:14,220
Bring your face closer.

539
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,657
What happened to your face?

540
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,797
Beaten up, were you?

541
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:35,463
Yes, my lord.

542
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:55,950
I hope it heals quickly.

543
00:43:00,817 --> 00:43:01,817
Yes, my lord.

544
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,270
Tonight,

545
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:08,280
let me take care of you, my lord.

546
00:43:42,897 --> 00:43:44,376
You're quite wicked, Dech.

547
00:43:44,463 --> 00:43:48,120
You look innocent, but you know
how to embezzle money.

548
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,440
Then why did you
bed a servant like me, my lord?

549
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,743
Now that we shared a bed,

550
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,560
we should be able
to talk about everything.

551
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,067
If you weren't close to Dech,

00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:04,640
I would have already
kicked you out long ago!

553
00:44:06,107 --> 00:44:07,986

00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:08,960
No!

555
00:44:08,993 --> 00:44:11,440

Why is it so deadly?
