(A Plot Within A Plot, A Spy Within A Spy)

3
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,200
Mrs. Lu.

4
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,920
You're so anxious to find me.

5
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:57,960
What is it?

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,479
Could it be
that what happened back then

7
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,640
has been discovered?

8
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,679
When you delivered my baby,

9
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,000
besides the jade pendant,

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,560
was there anything else
to prove her identity?

11
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:08,799
Ah.

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,480
Yes.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,480
I remember she has a birthmark

14
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,920
on her shoulder.

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,159
A plum blossom birthmark.

16
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:18,920
Who's there?

17
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,239
Is this the birthmark

18
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:25,719
you

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,680
were talking about?

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,760
Yes.

21
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,239
It's the same plum blossom mark.

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,640
Exactly the same.

23
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,680
Why

24
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,239
is that pendant with Chuning?

25
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,920
You mean my peace amulet?

26
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,439
I gave it to Chuning.

27
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,359
Chuning never told me about this.

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,519
You reunited because of that amulet?

29
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,879
You're my real daughter.

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,040
Mother.

31
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,319
Congratulations, Mrs. Lu.

32
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,840
(She seems indecisive and timid.)

33
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,520
(Probably won't cause trouble.)

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,520
(Might as well accept her)

35
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,599
(and drive Lin Chuning away first)

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,240
(before handling the rest.)

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,280
Kneel.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,120
I said, kneel.

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,800
I did nothing wrong.

40
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,000
Why should I kneel?

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,680
You're pretending to be my daughter,

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,160
and you say you did nothing wrong?

43
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,439
Chuning.

44
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,240
I've already reunited
with Father and Mother.

45
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,159
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Silly girl.

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,560
You've done nothing wrong.

48
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,280
She's the one who wronged you.

49
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:49,640
You're

50
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,000
just too kind.

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,039
Lin Chuning.

52
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,039
I really thought you were my daughter.

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,039
I tried my best to make it up to you.

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,919
I would even give you my heart.

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,680
How could you be so cruel

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,360
to hurt a mother

57
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,919
who lost her daughter

58
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,680
and lives in regret every day?

59
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,319
Regret?

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,400
When you pushed me into the river,

61
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,080
when you kept shouting

62
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,159
that you'd kill your own daughter,

63
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,919
I didn't see even a trace of regret.

64
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:25,720
Xiaorou.

65
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,680
Are you not scared?

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,280
The next person she kills

67
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
could be you.

68
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,560
Mother.

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,920
I already knew you weren't my daughter.

70
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,919
I was momentarily furious

71
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,200
that I pushed you into the lake.

72
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,319
How could I

73
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,280
ever hurt my birth daughter?

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,400
Someone, come.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,840
Beat her to death

76
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,960
and dump her in the pond.

77
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,599
Lu Siyan.

78
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,000
Get lost.

79
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,759
Are you rebelling?

80
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,439
Siyan.

81
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,639
She's not your sister. Sober up.

82
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,800
I wish she weren't my sister.

83
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,040
Mother.

84
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,959
Have you forgotten

85
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,759
that I told you

86
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,160
to protect her for me?

87
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,920
Don't let anyone hurt her.

88
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,480
Just because I said nothing

89
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,439
doesn't mean
I don't know what you've done.

90
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,160
Alright.

91
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,120
In that case,

92
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,000
let me tell you all.

93
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,040
Lin Chuning is with me.

94
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,519
If you want to kill her, kill me first.

95
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,839
I won't allow you
to lay a finger on her.

96
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:51,920
Siyan.

97
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,040
You'd choose her

98
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,319
over your parents?

99
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't want to choose.

100
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,040
You forced me to.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,879
It's my life.

102
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,000
What I do with it

103
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,480
and who I spend it with

104
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,680
is my choice.

105
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,800
It's none of your business!

106
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,720
How insolent!

107
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,079
Fine.

108
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,000
Very well.

109
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,040
Lin Chuning.

110
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,600
This is all your fault!

111
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,639
How much more damage
must you do to our family

112
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,880
before you're satisfied?

113
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,519
You're right.

114
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,199
I admit

115
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,639
I failed Xiaorou.

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,480
But I never wronged

117
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,360
the Lu family.

118
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,079
Lu Department Stores

119
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,440
has only prospered lately

120
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,879
because of me.

121
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,519
Mr. Lu.

122
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,360
If you kill me,

123
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,480
people will talk.

124
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,079
I ask you

125
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,480
to think twice before you act.

126
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,879
Father.

127
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,560
Mother.

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,639
Chuning grew up all alone.

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,439
She only took my place
to get family love.

130
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,839
I beg you to spare her.

131
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,480
I can let you go,

132
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,439
but leaving the Lu family

133
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,639
won't be easy.

134
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,160
I'll let you leave.

135
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,839
But whether you live

136
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,680
depends on your fate.

137
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,480
I hope

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,959
you'll keep your word.

139
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,920
(Want to walk away untouched?)

140
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,519
(In your dreams.)

141
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,480
(I'll have you kicked out like a dog.)

142
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,879
(You'll suffer even if you live.)

143
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,319
You must pay the price

144
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,120
for your wrongdoings.

145
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,279
Lu Siyan.

146
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,199
I've been lenient.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,879
But if I don't set an example today,

148
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
everyone will bully the Lu family.

149
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:01,560
Let's go.

150
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,439
I can do this.

151
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,399
Let this matter

152
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,759
end once and for all.

153
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's leave together.

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,519
Siyan!

155
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,439
No.

156
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,319
Siyan!

157
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,560

What do you want?

395
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,440
You're Siyan's mother.

396
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:15,960
That's why I've tolerated you.

397
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,519
But that doesn't mean I'm a pushover.

398
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,880
I've never thought you were a pushover.

399
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,279
It's alright
that you pretended to be my daughter,

400
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,480
but you even seduced my son.

401
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,240
Have you looked at yourself?

402
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,720
A wild orphan

403
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,880
is worse than a courtesan.

404
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,079
How dare you dream
of marrying into nobility?

405
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,920
You've got my son so bewitched
that he won't even come home.

406
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,119
Mrs. Lu,

407
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,559
you'd better be careful.

408
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,640
Don't let your son

409
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,720
be so bewitched

410
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,599
by a wild orphan like me

411
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,839
that you blame someone else's daughter.

412
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,799
You're still unrepentant
at death's door.

413
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,079
Beautiful woman brings trouble.

414
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,799
Looks like I can't let you stay.

415
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,839
Since Mr. Lu said
to spare your pitiful life,

416
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,880
I won't kill you.

417
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,359
But you must leave.

418
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:11,920
Whether I die

419
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,480
or run away,

420
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,039
Siyan will hate you.

421
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,240
Let him hate me then.

422
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,960
I'm his birth mother.

423
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,160
He won't love you forever,

424
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,680
nor will he hate me forever.

425
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:42,988
Safe travels.

426
00:20:44,594 --> 00:20:46,417
Write me when you arrive.

427
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:47,359
Need help?

428
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,480
No need.

429
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,000
This is my wife.
She has trouble walking.

430
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,799
She takes medication
and gets sleepy easily.

431
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,680
I'm home.

432
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:03,520
Why are you here?

433
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,440
Where's Chuning?

434
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:08,519
Siyan.

435
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,851
I asked you where Lin Chuning is.

436
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,680
You like Sister.

437
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:13,880
I'm your sister too.

438
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:15,680
What did you do to her?

439
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:17,080
I didn't do anything to her.

440
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:19,360
It's Mother who wants her dead.

441
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,279
You'll never see her again.

442
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:24,040
The train is about to leave.

443
00:21:27,297 --> 00:21:28,680
Your love will only get her killed!

444
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,422
- Careful.
- Don't worry, it'll be fine.

445
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:43,137
Don't worry. Go back.

446
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,279
Chuning.

447
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,668
Don't forget to bring...

448
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:49,960
Chuning.

449
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,039
It's me.

450
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,720
Help me.

451
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:57,680
Chuning.

452
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,759
I'm here.

453
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,559
Mochen.

454
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,160
Why are you here?

455
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,400
Xiaorou said

456
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,640
they were sending you away.

457
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,079
That's why I came.

458
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,920
Are you alright?

459
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:11,680
I'm fine now.

460
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,440
Thank god you got here in time.

461
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,480
I've found somewhere very safe.

462
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,960
They won't get a chance

463
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:21,320
to hurt you again.

464
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,480
Alright?

465
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,559
Mochen.

466
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,839
I thought I made myself

467
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,440
very clear last time.

468
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,000
But Lu Siyan

469
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,720
can't protect you.

470
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,880
Mrs. Lu won't let this go.

471
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,160
Even if you flee to another city,

472
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,079
how can a meek woman like you survive

473
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,359
without me or Lu Siyan?

474
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,440
Why must I rely on either of you

475
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,960
to survive?

476
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,720
Chuning!

477
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,200
Chuning!

478
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,000
Lu Siyan.

479
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,349
Chu...

480
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:02,720
Siyan!

481
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,559
Someone got stabbed.

482
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:04,720
Siyan!

483
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:16,680
Siyan.

484
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:17,839
Siyan.

485
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,119
Siyan.

486
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,319
Siyan, wake up.

487
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:22,920
Siyan!

488
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:25,720
Help!

489
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:26,920
Help!

490
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:28,880
Siyan!

491
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:30,519
Siyan!

492
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,119
Siyan!

493
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,519
Help!

494
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,480
Someone, help me!

495
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,519
Siyan!

496
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,160
Siyan!
