Will you

marry me?

5
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,319
No, I won't.

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,680
When we came here,

7
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,719
I already knew
you were going to propose.

8
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,280
I planned to say that

9
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,079
to punish you
for the way you hurt me before.

I like

what you just said.

14
00:01:33,464 --> 00:01:34,472
I'm shallow.

15
00:01:35,616 --> 00:01:36,800
I want you

00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,200
to spend your whole life

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,120

Ms. Lin Chuning.

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,328
Will you marry Mr. Lu Siyan?

00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:53,384

I came here today

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,040
to tell you

53
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,319
to break off our engagement.

54
00:04:13,224 --> 00:04:14,208
I disagree.

55
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,864
Chuning.

56
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,568
You have to know

57
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,279
that I liked you first.

58
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,319
There's no such thing
as who came first in love.

59
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:23,720
Chuning.

60
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,840
What's so great about Lu Siyan?

61
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:30,448
Without the Lu family,

62
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,112
he's nothing.

63
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:34,888
How is he better than me?

64
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,472
Chuning.

65
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:38,352
You should know

66
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,176
that I saved you

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,424
when Mr. Gao tried to kill you.

68
00:04:41,872 --> 00:04:42,640
Besides,

69
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:45,528
everyone calls me a hero.

70
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,519
But you

71
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,199
still

72
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,519
won't accept me.

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,519
Why is that?

74
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:56,920
Mochen.

75
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,439
Did you really want to kill Mr. Gao

76
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,920
or save me?

77
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,528
You know the answer yourself.

78
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,576
Mochen.

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,079
Suit yourself.

80
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:09,800
Chuning.

81
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:11,256
Chuning!

82
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,000
Chuning!

83
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:22,480
(Chuning.)

84
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,064
(You'll regret it.)

85
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,040
Tell me.

86
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,399
In our next life,

87
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,488
could I use this birthmark

88
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,872
to find you and fall for you again?

89
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,319
You'd better protect it well then.

90
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,072
If it's gone,

91
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:50,096
I won't recognize you.

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,800
Just wait and see.

93
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:53,576
I'll get it tattooed.

94
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,920
This way, you can't escape.

95
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,560
No need to go that far.

96
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,839
What's on your mind?

97
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,240
I'm thinking

98
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,839
where on earth
did Shen Mochen hide those girls?

99
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:14,792
Oh, right.

100
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,744
Caiyi invited the three of us
to Foundling Home tomorrow.

101
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,279
It's the perfect chance to test her.

102
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,968
Sure.

103
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:23,816
Ah.

104
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,072
You smudged it.

105
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:25,896
It's fine.

106
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:27,376
You can always draw it again.

107
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,072
You think I'm not tired?

108
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,464
I'll go get a tattoo then.

109
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,720
Done.

110
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,504
Alright.

111
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:38,536
Give me a hug.

112
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,959
It'll be hot.

113
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,432
Why isn't Chuning here yet?

114
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,160
She

115
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:53,120
should be here soon.

116
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,240
Just wait a little longer.

117
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:56,224
Mr. Siyan.

118
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,712
Let me toast to you first.

119
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,320
If it weren't for you, Chuning,

120
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:00,648
and Chief Shen,

121
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,560
we might never

122
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,639
have escaped Mr. Gao.

123
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,519
Thank you.

124
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,800
And thank you all
for having the courage to stand up.

125
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,319
Mr. Siyan.

126
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,680
When I first saw you

127
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,136
at Wenrou Lounge,

128
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,864
I fell for you.

129
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:34,104
You gave me freedom.

130
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:36,400
If you don't mind,

131
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm willing to give myself to you

132
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,439
to repay your great kindness.

133
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,256
Don't you know
Chuning is the one I love?

134
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,600
I don't mind being your concubine.

135
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:49,280
If that's what you came here to say,

136
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:52,512
there's no point
in continuing this meal.

137
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,976
You saw everything.

138
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,880
You had me test

139
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:13,256
Mr. Siyan's feelings for Chuning.

140
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:15,144
Now you can rest assured.

141
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,879
Mr. Siyan

142
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,519
is completely loyal and devoted

143
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,199
to Chuning.

144
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,840
But

145
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,839
why did you have me drug him?

146
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:30,576
Caiyi.

147
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:32,720
You want to know

148
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,679
why I had you drug him?

149
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,480
Yes.

150
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,840
Let me tell you.

151
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,759
Lin Chuning.

152
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,679
Even if Lu Siyan dies,

153
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,480
you'll still love him.

154
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:09,160
I'll make sure you hate him then.

155
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:16,896
The police received reports lately

156
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:18,936
that multiple ladies have gone missing.

157
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:20,072
Chuning.

158
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:22,064
You must be careful when going out.

159
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,000
Isn't Mr. Gao already dead?

160
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:25,904
Why are ladies still disappearing?

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,320
There's more than one bad person

162
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:28,936
besides Mr. Gao.

163
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,592
Any leads on the culprit?

164
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:31,624
Don't worry.

165
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,920
I've mobilized
the entire police force to investigate.

166
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,256
Siyan.

167
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,856
Mochen.

168
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,824
I want to see Siyan.

169
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,736
There must be some misunderstanding.

170
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,536
I need to ask him myself.

171
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,624
Listen to me.

172
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,640
Chuning.

173
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,240
You trust Lu Siyan too much.

174
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,000
Men are all the same.

175
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,120
Once they have you,

176
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,480
they stop cherishing you.

177
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,920
Other ladies
always seem more attractive.

178
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,392
Caiyi was a brave woman
who exposed Mr. Gao.

179
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,039
Lu Siyan tried to rape her but failed,

180
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
so he killed her.

181
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,080
If he isn't executed,

182
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,080
the public won't be satisfied.

183
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:18,520
I want to see Caiyi.

184
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,159
Let me see her off.

185
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:22,152
Alright.

186
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:23,880
I'll take you there.

187
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:48,912
Caiyi.

188
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:07,304
Rest in peace.

189
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:26,320
He had money

190
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,416
and looks.

191
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:28,992
He could have any woman,

192
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:30,360
yet he did such a thing.

193
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:31,880
It's not surprising.

194
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,752
(Police Station)
He has always been a playboy.

195
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:36,159
I heard
he was a regular at Wenrou Lounge.

196
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,792
I'll carry out

197
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,919
today's execution myself.

198
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,272
People like him

199
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:43,568
deserve to die.

200
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,559
Yes.

201
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,448
Leave Lin Chuning to me.

202
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:49,392
You can rest in peace now.

203
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,360
Wait!

204
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,279
Who's this?

205
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:58,096
What's going on?

206
00:11:58,288 --> 00:12:00,016
- What's happening?
- Yeah, what is it?

207
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:04,600
I have evidence.

208
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,008
The killer

209
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:09,384
is someone else.

210
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:12,968
Right before Caiyi died,

211
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,032
she tore a button
from the killer's coat.

212
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:16,848
The pattern on this button

213
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:18,240
is unique to police uniforms.

214
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,600
Each uniform

215
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
is recorded on file.

216
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,392
As long as we find the officer

217
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,064
missing one button,

218
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,112
we'll know

219
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,040
who the killer is.

220
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,039
Chief Shen.

221
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,824
The killer

222
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,640
is among you.

223
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:36,200
Really?

224
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,392
So the culprit really isn't Lu Siyan.

225
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,312
Chief Shen.

226
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,520
I hope you'll remain impartial.

227
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,752
Don't protect the criminal.

228
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,040
What a loving couple.

229
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,399
One might think
you were husband and wife.

230
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,720
Lin Chuning.

231
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,808
Who knows
if you're shielding your brother

232
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:13,568
and slandering others

233
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:14,616
to cover up for him?

234
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:16,280
She's harboring him.

235
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:18,240
Before Lin Chuning
returned to the Lu family,

236
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,320
they were quite close.

237
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:21,784
This Lin Chuning

238
00:13:21,824 --> 00:13:22,480
is a slut.

239
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,920
She should be drowned in a pig cage.

240
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,080
How shameless.

241
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,392
Adulterers.

242
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:27,304
Smash them!

243
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:28,800
Shameless scum.

244
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:31,744
- Adulterers!
- Adulterers!

245
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:34,120
- Smash her!
- Smash her!

246
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,520
- She's not my sister!
- Adulterers!

247
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,720
Enough shouting!

248
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,104
Stop!

249
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,080
They're not siblings.

250
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:42,592
He's actually

251
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:43,864
Mr. Gao's son,

252
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:44,896
Gao Siyan.

253
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,480
- Mr. Gao?
- Mr. Gao?

254
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,776
Shen Mochen?

255
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,904
Mr. Gao?

256
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,680
The man who built Wenrou Lounge

257
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,679
and ruined countless innocent girls.

258
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,896
Like father, like son.

259
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:56,384
A rat's son knows how to dig.

260
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,360
My daughter disappeared days ago.

261
00:13:58,456 --> 00:13:59,112
Gao Siyan.

262
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:00,264
Was it you?

263
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,680
Give me back my daughter!

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,224
Chief Shen,
you must bring justice for the people!

265
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:13,336
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

266
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,600
- What's going on?
- Where is it?

267
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,984
- Run!
- Hurry!

268
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,192
Hurry.

269
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,144
- Go!
- Move!

270
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,960
Someone's
trying to break the prisoner out.

271
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,112
Everyone, on alert!

272
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,480
Siyan isn't my son.

273
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,496
I found out through the newspapers.

274
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,220
If not for this incident,

275
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,060
how long were you planning to lie to me?

276
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,940
That scum Gao Yunfeng

277
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,660
raped my maid
and made her pregnant.

278
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,900
When I failed to bear a son,

279
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,100
I feared you'd cast me aside,

280
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,820
so...

281
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,380
Mochen.

282
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,060
Why have you brought
so many people over?

283
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,300
Are you afraid we'll hide a fugitive?

284
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,100
Of course not.

285
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,992
Now,

286
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,380
Lu Siyan's identity is exposed.

287
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
He's become a public enemy.

288
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,220
I'm just worried

289
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,860
he might harm you.

290
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,500
I'm protecting the Lu family.

291
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,860
24 hours

292
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,020
security.

293
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,900
If you spot Lu Siyan,
kill him on the spot.

294
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,040
- Yes!
- Yes!

295
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,496
(Lu Ancestral Shrine)

296
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,340
Unbelievable.

297
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,060
He's even crueler than Mr. Gao.

298
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,220
He's using every means to frame Siyan.

299
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,540
Only by rescuing the missing girls

300
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,620
can we clear Siyan's name

301
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,900
and restore peace.

302
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,580
Don't worry.

303
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,700
I've almost gained his trust.

304
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:24,900
Thank you.

305
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,780
(Lu Residence)

306
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,340
Father.

307
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:37,860
Mother.

308
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,220
I'm a disappointment.

309
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,700
Siyan.

310
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,300
What on earth is going on?

311
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,220
I didn't kill anyone

312
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,940
nor did I traffic girls.

313
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,780
I believe you.

314
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,980
Of course I do.

315
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,660
Father.

316
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,660
I don't know

317
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,140
if you'll still accept me.

318
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,060
But right now, the residence
is filled with Shen Mochen's spies.

319
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,580
To keep you safe,

320
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,440
I must pretend to cut ties for now.

321
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,740
Someone's here.

322
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,660
Siyan, go.

323
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,400
I have no son like you!

324
00:17:20,784 --> 00:17:21,488
From now on,

325
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:23,368
we're no longer father and son!

326
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,580
Mr. Shen.

327
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,180
He's in Mr. and Mrs. Lu's room.

328
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,584
Stay here.

329
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,420
I'll go check.

330
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,580
(Siyan, you've called me father
for over 20 years.)

331
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,580
(To me, you're my son.)

332
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:56,248
Where's Lu Siyan?

333
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,580
Father-in-law.

334
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,128
(Siyan.)

335
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,460
(Stay safe.)

336
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,740
(I'll protect the Lu family)

337
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,540
(and everything we've built.)

338
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,300
Chuning.

339
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,540
Mochen.

340
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,140
What happened?

341
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,500
Chuning.

342
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,380
My condolences.

343
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,940
It was already like this when I came in.

344
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,580
Father.

345
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,900
Father.

346
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:51,900
Father.

347
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,340
Wake up, Father.

348
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:54,820
Father.

349
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:56,144
Father.

350
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,140
Mother.

351
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,620
Mother.

352
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,088
Mother.

353
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,760
Chuning.

354
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,900
How could this happen?

355
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,340
Chuning.

356
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,496
Mother.

357
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,376
Mother.

358
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,000
I haven't forgiven you yet.

359
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,440
Why...

360
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,584
Why are you abandoning me again?

361
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,380
Chuning.

362
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,760
Why leave me?

363
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,260
Why did this happen?

364
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,856
Why did this happen?

365
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,940
How did this happen?

366
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,980
Who killed them?

367
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,580
Who killed them?

368
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,660
Judging from the wounds,

369
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,060
the killer was a knife expert.

370
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,700
They were killed with a single strike.

371
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,980
A knife...

372
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,140
Repeat what you saw.

373
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:39,740
Mr. Siyan and Mr. Lu
seemed to be arguing.

374
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,060
Master said he wanted...

375
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,220
He wanted to cut ties with him.

376
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,380
What did you say?

377
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,100
It was Siyan?

378
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,180
Siyan?

379
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,900
Chuning.

380
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,180
No way.

381
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,980
Lu Siyan must've been enraged with shame

382
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,980
that he killed your parents

383
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,500
in a fit of anger.

384
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,700
Impossible.

385
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,740
Impossible.

386
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,260
Siyan would never do that.

387
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,100
It can't be him.

388
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,420
It can't be Siyan.

389
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,140
He even used his own father as a shield.

390
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,020
Let alone adoptive parents.

391
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,900
Chuning.

392
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,900
I told you before

393
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,260
that Lu Siyan isn't a good man.

394
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,140
Girls have gone missing recently.

395
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
After my investigation,

396
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,140
I found out Lu Siyan
is Wenrou Lounge's real mastermind.

397
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,940
Mr. Gao

398
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,460
was just the scapegoat he found.

399
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,740
Impossible.

400
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,420
That's impossible.

401
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,700
There's no way he'll do such a thing.

402
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,860
There's no way he'll do such a thing.

403
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,540
His dream was to protect the people.

404
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,140
There's no way he'll do such a thing.

405
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,180
I don't believe it.

406
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,980
It was all an act, Chuning.

407
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,460
Think about it.

408
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,580
If

409
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,660
he was really on the plane
and it crashed,

410
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,900
how could he be unharmed?

411
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,700
That was just his trick to escape.

412
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,500
He then orchestrated everything
in secret.

413
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,500
Chuning.

414
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,540
If he could do this,

415
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,140
what would he do to you?

416
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,260
I feel sorry for you.

417
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,980
Do you know that?

418
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,940
Impossible.

419
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,740
He wouldn't kill them.

420
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,660
He wouldn't kill them.

421
00:21:43,624 --> 00:21:45,432
The ledger he gave you was fake.

422
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,060
This is the real one.

423
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,460
He wanted to mislead us

424
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,100
and play you like a fool.

425
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,500
I truly feel sorry for you.

426
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,620
Lu Siyan.

427
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,620
Lu Siyan.

428
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,740
(Lu Residence)

429
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,620
Miss.

430
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,500
A gentleman
asked me to give this to you.

431
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,820
(I'll wait for you at the abandoned
dock warehouse. Don't be late.)

432
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,620
Chuning.

433
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,460
I knew you'd come see me.

434
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,820
Don't come any closer.

435
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,500
Chuning.

436
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,820
What's wrong?

437
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
Lu Siyan.

438
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,700
How dare you kill my parents?

439
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,020
What did you say?

440
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,900
Still pretending?
