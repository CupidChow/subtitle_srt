1
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,340
=Stealing Heart=

2
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,020
=Episode 4=
(His Heart is All Over the Place)

3
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:50,880
Who's out there?

4
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,870
Show yourself.

5
00:00:58,331 --> 00:00:59,750
It's me.

6
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,150
Chuning,

7
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:02,430
should I kill him?

8
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:04,310
Mr. Gao is Lu Siyan's uncle.

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,919
He must have complicated connections
to the Wenrou Lounge.

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,119
If he tells Lu Siyan,

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,670
we're done for.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,319
I'm not his uncle.

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,599
Back then, your great-grandfather brought me into
the family just to ward off bad luck.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,679
But not long after,

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,279
your father was born.

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,110
I didn't even change my surname.
I'm still Gao.

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,870
To Lu Siyan,

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,630
the three of us are the same.

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,990
We are outsiders.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,110
Mochen,

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,990
Mr. Gao has been supporting

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,790
the Foundling Home all these years.

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,630
I don't wish to be ungrateful.

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,790
But just in case,

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,230
we should tie him up.

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,079
Mr. Gao,

27
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,439
you'll have to stay here for a few days.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,270
We'll figure out what to do with you

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,590
once we're done with Lu Siyan.

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,910
(Lu Siyan,)

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,430
(it's time to settle the score)

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,519
(between us.)

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,250
(Lu Residence)

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,470
Siyan,

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,430
do you know Wenrou Lounge?

36
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,799
(Mochen,)

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,599
(lure Lu Siyan out of the city
with Wenrou Lounge.)

38
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,319
(To keep his secret there,
he'll definitely show up.)

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,359
Chuning found out the secret
in Wenrou Lounge.

40
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,639
She arranged to meet the owner

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,679
at an abandoned warehouse
in the western suburbs.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,919
She left this morning

43
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,079
and hasn't come back.

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,550
I think something's happened to her.

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,030
I'll go with you.

46
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,439
(Lu Siyan is skilled.)

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,950
(Make sure you get him in one strike.)

48
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,190
(Don't kill him.)

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,950
(I want him captured alive.)

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,470
(What he owed Xiaorou,)

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,279
(I'll make him pay)

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,430
(one by one.)

53
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,790
Lu Siyan.

54
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:09,190
Like I said,

55
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,190
I'll make you suffer

56
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,430
until you die in agony.

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,870
(For the rest of your life,)

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,950
(you'll be trapped in a dark dungeon,)

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,990
(tortured and humiliated by me.)

60
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,727
Lin Chuning.

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,390
Lin Chuning.

62
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,919
Stop.

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,110
Or I'll kill her.

64
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,519
You're threatening me with him?

65
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,030
It won't work.

66
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,439
You won't know

67
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,719
until you try.

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,390
You think I care about her?

69
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,870
Kneel.

70
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,430
I said kneel!

71
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,195
I said kneel!

72
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,559
Lu Siyan,

73
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,270
I'll kill you.

74
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,270
You want to kill me?

75
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,110
You're awake.

76
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,390
Lu Siyan.

77
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,981
This whole setup

78
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:00,830
was meant for me, right?

79
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,990
What were you planning to do to me?

80
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,830
Whatever you're thinking of doing now

81
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,679
is what I wanted to do.

82
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,230
I wanted to save you,

83
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:16,910
but you wanted to kill me.

84
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,510
Drop your act.

85
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,630
Tell me.

86
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,879
Why was my pocket watch

87
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,910
with you?

88
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,599
You...

89
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,590
Just now...

90
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:34,635
Yes.

91
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,030
I'm asking you

92
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,110
why you had my pocket watch.

93
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,390
You know why.

94
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:45,350
What do you mean?

95
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,790
Lu Siyan,

96
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,710
you're a scumbag.

97
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,350
Xiaorou and I

98
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,839
won't let you off,

99
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,279
even if we go to hell.

100
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,630
Xiaorou?

101
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:59,070
You gave her this pocket watch,

102
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,110
and you don't remember her name?

103
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,150
I only lost this a while ago.

104
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,710
The Xiaorou you're talking about

105
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,310
is...

106
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,790
Don't come near me.

107
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,790
Don't.

108
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,350
Scream.

109
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,950
You screamed a lot.

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,399
Why aren't you screaming now?

111
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,679
Go on and scream.

112
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,719
Come on.

113
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,030
I said scream.

114
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,319
Don't touch me.

115
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,390
Please.

116
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,079
I'll be good.

117
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,639
I beg of you.

118
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,590
Ah!

119
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,799
Wretched woman.

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,230
Let's see what I'll do to you.

121
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,390
Help!

122
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,590
Who are you?

123
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,310
She's mine.

124
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,470
Thank you.

125
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,830
You're here, Mr. Lu.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,070
Mr. Siyan,

127
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:24,670
this is your second time here.

128
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,950
You always sit and drink.

129
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,910
Are you not happy with me?

130
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,390
No, that's not it.

131
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,190
Come sit.

132
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,670
I didn't do anything to her.

133
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:06,030
I was afraid she'd misunderstand me,

134
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,710
so I paid the bartender regularly.

135
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:10,870
I never saw her again.

136
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,230
(Wait.)

137
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,679
(Xiaorou always wore her lucky charm.)

138
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,510
(If Lu Siyan really slept with her,)

139
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,599
(there's no way he wouldn't
have noticed.)

140
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,239
(Could I have misunderstood him?)

141
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,639
(Was the child Xiaorou carried)

142
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,470
(someone else's?)

143
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,559
(But if she didn't sleep with him,)

144
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,870
(why would she be so sure it was his?)

145
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,830
What are you looking at?

146
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,030
I wasn't looking at you.

147
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:36,870
So,

148
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:38,550
you went to Wenrou Lounge

149
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:39,990
to look for Xiaorou?

150
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:44,830
Why did you go there?

151
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,430
I want to find the one behind it all

152
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,630
and stop more innocents
from getting hurt.

153
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,630
Have you found them?

154
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,430
Do you remember

155
00:09:57,137 --> 00:10:00,070
the ylang-ylang plant
outside the study at Wenrou Lounge?

156
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:01,950
Yes.

157
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,799
That flower

158
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,839
is hard to care for,

159
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,350
which makes it rare.

160
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,959
One day,

161
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,319
I smelled ylang-ylang

162
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,319
on my uncle,

163
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,070
so I followed him.

164
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,061
Then,

165
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:17,030
I ended up outside the study
at Wenrou Lounge.

166
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,630
Mr. Gao?

167
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,270
At first,

168
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,470
I thought this was dangerous.

169
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:26,030
But now I feel like you have to know.

170
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,350
If not,

171
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,630
who knows you might come after me?

172
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:33,390
Hey.

173
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:36,092
Let's make peace here.

174
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,750
(No.)

175
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:40,710
(I can't trust anyone's word anymore.)

176
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,479
Then

177
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,750
why did you save me?

178
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,270
Aren't you my sister?

179
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,550
Why didn't you kill me?

180
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,950
You're my sister.

181
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,670
Didn't you say you don't want me

182
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,830
to be your sister?

183
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,510
Let me introduce myself again. Lu Siyan.

184
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,750
Lu Chuning.

185
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,110
Chief.

186
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,599
What have you done?

187
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,000
Tell me.

188
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,999
(Sanshun, Shen Mochen's subordinate)
Chief, it's too late. Let's leave.

189
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,190
Wait here.

190
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,910
I'll deal with you later.

191
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,919
Chief,

192
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,479
the fire inside is too strong.

193
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,030
Let the Lu siblings kill each other.

194
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,559
You just need to marry Ms. Jing

195
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,359
and enjoy everything that comes with it.

196
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,959
Chuning!

197
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,990
Chief.

198
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,870
Let go of me.

199
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:57,879
Chief,

200
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,590
there's something I need to report.

201
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:05,359
Sanshun,

202
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,950
how long have you worked for me?

203
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:09,470
Five years now.

204
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,230
Five years?

205
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,390
Yes, sir.

206
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,630
Five years!

207
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,310
Chief.

208
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,950
Do you know

209
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,630
what it means to go beyond your role?

210
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,879
Do you know what it means to overstep?

211
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,270
Do you know what it means
to follow orders?

212
00:12:33,914 --> 00:12:35,150
Why

213
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,110
did you do that?

214
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:39,070
Chief...

215
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,119
I did that for your own goodness.

216
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,190
But are you aware
that this could've gotten Chuning killed?

217
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,630
I...

218
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,750
Enough.

219
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,070
Don't explain.

220
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,270
Get out.

221
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:56,675
Yes, sir.

222
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:21,310
Mr. Gao.

223
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,759
Why was Xiaorou's pocket watch

224
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,430
with you?

225
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,590
You...

226
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,070
What are you talking about?

227
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,790
I've never seen this watch before.

228
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,550
But

229
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:37,270
it was found in your room.

230
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:40,550
Your room at Wenrou Lounge.

231
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,230
Mr. Siyan,

232
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,070
is that you?

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,630
Mr. Siyan,

234
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,350
please don't leave me.

235
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,910
Mr. Siyan.

236
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,470
Mr. Siyan.

237
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,950
Mr. Siyan.

238
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,550
Mr. Siyan.

239
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:15,310
Chuning,

240
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,538
you really are a Lu through and through.

241
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,630
Just like your father
and great-grandfather,

242
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,879
smart

243
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,110
and cunning.

244
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,590
So you admit it?

245
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,950
I do.

246
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,190
But

247
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,790
what are you going to do about it?

248
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,510
You burned

249
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,670
the knockout incense, right?

250
00:15:37,022 --> 00:15:38,710
You're trying to kill me?

251
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,710
Yes.

252
00:15:40,554 --> 00:15:42,110
I want to kill you.

253
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:51,590
Are you feeling

254
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,510
itchy

255
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,190
and numb?

256
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,270
You...

257
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,776
What's this happening?

258
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:02,710
This isn't knockout incense.

259
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,492
This is the Ylang-ylang incense.

260
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,230
The same incense

261
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,150
I used on Xiaorou.

262
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,830
You good friends

263
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,270
should share the same pleasure.

264
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,119
Oh,

265
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,110
right.

266
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,110
One more thing.

267
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,879
This incense

268
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,990
is my unique formula.

269
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,430
Xiaorou died because of you.

270
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,430
I'm going to kill you!

271
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,350
Kill me?

272
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,839
Let me tell you something.

273
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,510
What Xiaorou went through

274
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,390
wasn't on me.

275
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,079
She just wasn't smart enough

276
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,790
and thought she could latch onto
someone powerful.

277
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,110
Chuning,

278
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,350
don't be like her.

279
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,270
Be obedient,

280
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,190
and

281
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,510
I'll treat you well.

282
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,919
Gao Yunfeng,

283
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,119
you rot in hell!

284
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,590
Go to hell!

285
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,430
I like it when you're being so naughty.

286
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:25,079
- What are you trying to do?
- Siyan. It's me.

287
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,919
I'm your uncle.

288
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,599
Siyan,

289
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,159
it's my fault.

290
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,199
I won't do it again.

291
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,150
Siyan.

292
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,959
Si...

293
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,959
Siyan, look.

294
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,030
Look at her.

295
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,110
You!

296
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,319
Lin Chuning,

297
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,119
are you all right?

298
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,030
So hot.

00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:54,790

Chuning.

301
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:12,190
Wake up.

302
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,270
Siyan.

303
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,150
I know you're not feeling well.

304
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,699

As far as I'm concerned,

357
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,870
the person backing him
in the police station

358
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,630
is Shen Mochen.

359
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,070
What makes you say so?

360
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,879
Shen Mochen

361
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,639
is shrewd

362
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,950
and ambitious.

363
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,750
He's been wanting

364
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,159
to latch onto my sister

365
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,190
and get a comfortable life.

366
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,630
My father bought him

367
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,110
this position as a chief.

368
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,313
You look down on him, don't you?

369
00:23:10,314 --> 00:23:12,119
No, not just me.

370
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,972
No one does.

371
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,590
So,

372
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,719
that day when I lured you
out of the city

373
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,159
using Wenrou Lounge as an excuse,

374
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,430
you weren't afraid the plan might fail.

375
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,990
You were worried about me?

376
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:31,710
So, my sister,

377
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,430
did you really mean to kill me

378
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:36,590
because of Xiaorou?

379
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,410
(Xianli Capital)

380
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,710
(Lu Siyan can't be trusted.)

381
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,870
(Nor can Shen Mochen.)

382
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,470
(The only person I can trust)

383
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,430
(is myself,)

384
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,399
(Caiyi, Wenrou Lounge dancer)

385
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,599
Lin Chuning?

386
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,890
(Caiyi, Wenrou Lounge dancer)

387
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,498
Why'd you order her last time
and not me?

388
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,167
Come on. Open this.

389
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:57,824
You're so generous.

390
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,475
How generous.

391
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,710
Stand right there.

392
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,150
Are you new here?

393
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,599
Didn't I tell you to stay with me?

394
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,790
What are you doing here?

395
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,199
Mister,

396
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,190
this place is too crowded. I got lost.

397
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,550
I'll stay with you tonight.

398
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,230
Why are you here?

399
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,950
Why are you here?

400
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,710
Why are you acting on your own again?

401
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,190
Childish.

402
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,799
Mr. Gao killed Xiaorou.

403
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,310
There's no way I'm letting him go.

404
00:25:57,594 --> 00:25:59,519
You're the matron of the Foundling Home.

405
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,910
If something happens to you,
how would you face the other girls?

406
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,830
Don't worry.

407
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,710
I'll take good care of them.

408
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,270
Mr. Gao

409
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,630
must die.

410
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,030
Come on, baby.

411
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,132
I'll make sure you have a good night
tonight.
