(Lover or Enemy?)

3
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
Siyan.

4
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,359
Are you saying

5
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,799
that you found Lu Siyan by the river,

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
and he forgot everything
when he woke up?

7
00:01:14,982 --> 00:01:17,120
That means his mind
is a blank sheet now.

8
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,159
We can draw him into

9
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,239
whatever we want him to be.

10
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:26,160
Siyan.

11
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,439
Siyan.

12
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,560
Siyan.

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,959
Siyan.

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,959
Who are you?

15
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,799
Siyan,

16
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,200
don't you remember?

17
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,000
Your surname is Gao.

18
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,359
You're Gao Siyan.

19
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,920
You're my son.

20
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,079
I'm your wife,

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,719
Xiaorou.

22
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,120
We've been married for two years.

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,599
You were hurt

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
because of the Lu family.

25
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,359
The Lu family

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,359
has always been our enemies.

27
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,400
They've had their eyes on us
all these years.

28
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,079
It was Lu Chuning who ruined you.

29
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,760
She kept pestering you

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,000
and drove you to this.

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,760
Lu Chuning

32
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,319
not only stole our assets,

33
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,719
but she also

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,919
orchestrated your car accident.

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,439
If it hadn't been for your luck,

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,960
I would've lost you by now.

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,199
She won't let us off so easily.

38
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,080
Siyan,

39
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,280
remember.

40
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,080
We're your real family.

41
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,520
Family?

42
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,439
Siyan,

43
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,000
focus on recovering for now.

44
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:33,759
Say,

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
I've already taken over Xianli Capital.

46
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,319
We'll reopen in a few days.

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,080
Let's build it

48
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,199
back up together.

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Xiaorou,

50
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,840
Siyan just woke up.

51
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,719
Prepare some food for him.

52
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,439
Let's go.

53
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:03,800
Everything is within my grasp.

54
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:23,980
(Lu Department Store)

55
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,120
(Lu Chuning,)

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,919
(the game barely started.)

57
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:38,160
(I'll tear your whole family apart)

58
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,879
(and pay blood with blood.)

59
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:53,140
(Lu Department Store)

60
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:55,938
(Xianli Capital)

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,039
Right.

62
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,319
Mr. Gao,

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,400
you're amazing.

64
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,759
Until now,

65
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,960
no one knows you're the real boss
behind Xianli Capital.

66
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,479
Chief Shen,

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,946
you flatter me.

68
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,319
I'm only here

69
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,400
thanks to you

70
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,599
for finding me a scapegoat.

71
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,959
Speaking of which, Mr. Gao, how our plan

72
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,360
plays out next

73
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,839
is up to you.

74
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,199
Don't worry.

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,639
You can count on me.

76
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,439
Who do you think you are?

77
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,759
You actually dream of
climbing into my son's bed?

78
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,199
You think you're worthy?

79
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:05,200
A man only cares for his home
after he has one.

80
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,120
Only he has a wife

81
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,160
does he learn to be soft.

82
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,839
I'm trying to help you
keep your son in check.

83
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,160
You have a death wish?

84
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,040
Go ahead and slap me.

85
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,600
Worst case,
I'll tell Lu Siyan everything.

86
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,480
Come on.

87
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,160
You'd better stop this madness.

88
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,639
Lin Chuning,

89
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,959
so what if you're the daughter
of the Lu family?

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,360
Fate is still on my side.

91
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:30,160
Dear old and new friends,

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,720
today's the grand reopening
of Xianli Capital.

93
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,120
Thank you so much for coming.

94
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,480
Well,

95
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,079
the previous Xianli Capital

96
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,399
had some unpleasant past,

97
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,959
but the former boss has already
been arrested.

98
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,079
As of now,

99
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:49,800
I am

100
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,040
the new owner of Xianli Capital.

101
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,600
I promise you two things.

102
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,240
First,

103
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,680
everything we do is legal.

104
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,279
Second,

105
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,079
we'll be even better

106
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,680
than before.

107
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:07,920
Today's

108
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,240
our opening day.

109
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:10,920
Please

110
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,839
eat and drink your fill

111
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,800
and enjoy your great time here.

112
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,120
Everything today

113
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,079
is on me.

114
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,079
Come on, friends.

115
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,160
Let's

116
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,480
raise our glasses.

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,560
- Sure.
- Sure.

118
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,780
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

119
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,500
Ms. Chuning,

120
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:33,466
bad news.

121
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,160
Cong, you know what?

122
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,560
I saw Siyan yesterday.

123
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
I saw him.

124
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,400
Ms. Chuning,

125
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,080
have you been thinking about him so much
that you're seeing things?

126
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,160
No, you...

127
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,959
Ms. Chuning,

128
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,399
our goods have been intercepted.

129
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,600
What?

130
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,360
We pay protection fees

131
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,879
on land and water every year.

132
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,480
But these bandits came out of nowhere

133
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,959
and took everything.

134
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,800
They're completely shameless.

135
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:55,640
Ms. Chuning,

136
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,360
maybe...

137
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,639
Maybe I should explain to the clients
and ask them to give us a few more days?

138
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
That's not a good idea.

139
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,000
Many greedy eyes are on us right now.

140
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,399
They're all waiting to devour us
like juicy meat.

141
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,160
If they find out

142
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,519
we couldn't even protect our goods,

143
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:10,273
they'll think we're easy prey.

144
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,839
Here's what we'll do.

145
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,840
Check nearby

146
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,839
and see if there's anything
we can purchase.

147
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,560
No matter what price they ask,

148
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,399
we take it.

149
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,319
We must deliver on time.

150
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,040
Let us in.

151
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:22,960
Give us our goods!

152
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
- Exactly!
- That's right.

153
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
- Where are our goods?
- Something bad has happened.

154
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,720
Hand them over now!
Don't tell me you can't!

155
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,080
Hurry up.

156
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,040
Let us in.

157
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,800
Ms. Lu,

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,399
we heard your goods were robbed.

159
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
I've got a lot of orders waiting.

160
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,080
My clients are all rushing me for tea.

161
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,799
How am I going to explain to them?

162
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,480
These goods are meant as gifts.

163
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,320
If something goes wrong,
can you afford to pay?

164
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,000
Mr. Siyan,

165
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,200
Master reminded you

166
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,720
that you've made too many enemies.

167
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,320
You must stay in disguise
when going out,

168
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,480
or someone might recognize you
and come for revenge.

169
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,050
- Got it.
- Pay up!

170
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
- Pay up!
- Pay up!

171
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
- Pay up!
- Pay up!

172
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,582
- Quiet down, everyone.
- Pay up!

173
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,982
- Quiet down, everyone.
- Pay up!

174
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,879
- Pay up!
- Pay up!

175
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,120
You shouldn't make a scene here.

176
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,399
Arrest those who started this.

177
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,240
They must be punished severely.

178
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,840
No wonder you can't hand over the goods.

179
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
You're not afraid at all.

180
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,600
Because you've got the cops backing you.

181
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,679
Crooked merchant!

182
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:16,799
- Crooked merchant!
- Crooked merchant!

183
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,720
Ms. Lu,

184
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,080
my young master sent you this.

185
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:27,182
Yeah.

186
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,262
They gave us their word before.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,919
(The goods are with me.
Pay ten times the price.)

188
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,679
Siyan.

189
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,919
Chuning.

190
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,159
You're mistaken.

191
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,399
No.

192
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,600
I'm not.

193
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:12,960
It's him.

194
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,400
(I have the goods. Pay 10 times the price.)
Only the thief knows what we're lacking.

195
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,720
I'm sure they hijacked our goods.

196
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,679
They took our goods, and now want to
sell them back at an outrageous price.

197
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,759
They're pulling a petty trick on us.

198
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,360
Bah!

199
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,759
Shameless.

200
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,559
It's him.

201
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,919
It has to be him.

202
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,919
Chuning,

203
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,039
it's just that you miss Siyan too much.

204
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,920
That's why everyone starts
to look like him

205
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,639
to you.

206
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,159
No.

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,080
I know it's him.

208
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,279
I recognize his handwriting.

209
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,480
It's broad daylight.

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
Were you seeing things or what?

211
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
Don't you think

212
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,360
this straightforward way of doing things

213
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,480
is exactly like your young master?

214
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,559
It really is.

215
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,879
Could it be

216
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,159
that Mr. Siyan

217
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,639
fell from the sky

218
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,919
and hit his head?

219
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,000
Cong,

220
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,519
spread the word.

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,279
The second batch of goods
will arrive at the dock tonight.

222
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,720
I'll supervise the operation myself.

223
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,559
Yes, Ms. Chuning.

224
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,279
(I think)

225
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,440
(I've forgotten something important.)

226
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,960
Siyan.

227
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,519
I made chicken broth for you.

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,159
Drink it while it's warm.

229
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,879
You're pregnant now.

230
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,600
Don't overexert yourself.

231
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:43,640
Let the maids handle these

232
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,799
and get some proper rest, all right?

233
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,759
I'm not tired.

234
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,360

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,759
All right.

236
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,080
I'll drink it later.

237
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,600
No need to wait up tonight.

238
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,120
The second batch of the Lu Group's goods
is arriving at the dock.

239
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,960
I need to be there.

240
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,240
Siyan, you must take care of yourself.

241
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:02,840
I will.

242
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,360
If you see Lu Chuning,

243
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,759
don't believe everything she says.

244
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
She's cunning.

245
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,000
Don't worry.

246
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,559

there's no one at the dock.

00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:49,080
(Don't show any mercy on her.)

379
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,839
Xiaorou.

380
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,920
Xiaorou, are you all right?

381
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Siyan,

382
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,960
our baby's gone.

383
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,200
We can have another baby.

384
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,880
As long as you're safe,
that's what matters.

385
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,960
Please step aside, mister.
The patient needs to rest.

386
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,359
Rest well, all right?

387
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,519
Move aside.

388
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,920
Siyan,

389
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,279
you must avenge me.

390
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,799
Siyan.

391
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,079
The Lus are indeed vicious.

392
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:21,920
Especially you,

393
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,519
ruthless.

394
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,680
You didn't even spare a baby.

395
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,599
I want you

396
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,799
to confess your crime to everyone.

397
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,200
If not, I'll make you pay
with your life.

398
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:35,880
Lu Siyan,

399
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,279
I never imagined

400
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,160
you'd become such a fool
after losing your memory.

401
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,119
You believe whatever people tell you.

402
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,880
If you had just checked,

403
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,519
you wouldn't have been fooled so badly.

404
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,160
You're still denying it?

405
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,400
Even if nothing has been confirmed,

406
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,799
I saw you push Xiaorou

407
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,920
with my own eyes.

408
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,799
You're even denying that?

409
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,160
The grudge is between us.

410
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,119
Take it out on me.

411
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,720
Why did you have to go after a baby?

412
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,640
Why?

413
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,920
If I really wanted to harm her,

414
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,799
a single bottle of poison
would've been enough.

415
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,680
Why would I go through all this trouble?

416
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,160
Wouldn't killing both mother and child
at once be easier?

417
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:09,559
Besides,

418
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,200
why would I even harm

419
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,640
an unborn child?

420
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,240
So you would pity her more

421
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,279
and hate me enough to kill me?

422
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,680
You're admitting it now.

423
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,079
You finally admit you wanted
them both dead.

424
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,880
You wanted to kill them.

425
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,279
Then why don't you confess?

426
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,599
Why won't you confess?

427
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,440
Why do you insist I confess?

428
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,880
You just want someone
to pin your hatred on.

429
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,759
But you're afraid you've hated
the wrong person,

430
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
so you picked me.

431
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,359
Lu Siyan,

432
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,039
you're a coward.

433
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:39,680
A coward who's too scared
to face your own heart.

434
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:40,920
Fine.

435
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,960
Since you've decided it was me,

436
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,440
avenge your wife and child, then.

437
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,039
Go ahead and kill me.

438
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,480
You think I dare not?

439
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,559
I'll torture you all I want.

440
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,160
What did you make me drink?

441
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,839
So you do get scared.

442
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,960
Saffron.

443
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,119
You killed Xiaorou's child.

444
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,240
I won't let you off.

445
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,000
Lu Siyan,

446
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,359
are you insane?

447
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,000
Why won't you trust me?

448
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,680
I gave you a chance.

449
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,519
As long as you admit your fault

450
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,091
and beg me,

451
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
I won't kill you.

452
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:41,839
Beg me.

453
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:47,000
I said beg me.

454
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,079
Beg me.

455
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,079
Why won't you trust me?

456
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,480
Beg me.

457
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,160
Kill me, then.

458
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,480
Siyan,

459
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,440
don't kill her.

460
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,160
You'll have to pay for it.

461
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,319
It's not worth dying over her.

462
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,640
