(I Came to Take My Wife Away)

3
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,320
Lu Siyan. I was such a fool to love you
and trust you.

4
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,359
What did you do in return?

5
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,719
You actually dared to kill my parents!

6
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,039
What are you talking about?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
Still playing dumb?

8
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,719
Have you lost your mind?

9
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,640
What are you doing?

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,080
Calm down.

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,840
Put the gun down.

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,520
Lu Siyan.

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,760
Today,

14
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:13,680
you're going to join them in death!

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,959
Fine.

16
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,040
Chuning.

17
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,200
Are you okay?

18
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:31,560
(Siyan.)

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,159
(Get as far away as you can.)

20
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,239
(Don't ever come back.)

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,560
(As for Shen Mochen,)

22
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:38,520
(I'll kill him myself)

23
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,599
(and avenge my parents.)

24
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:43,880
Chuning.

25
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,719
I will catch Lu Siyan.

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,159
He won't get away with this.

27
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,159
Chief.

28
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,400
The whole city

29
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,480
is in an uproar

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,640
over the Lu Siyan murder case.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,000
Crowds are gathering out there.

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,600
So I've already deployed more officers.

33
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,680
Chuning.

34
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,319
Now everyone believes
the Lu family's harboring a criminal.

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,840
So they've started boycotting
Lu Department Store.

36
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,800
The power lies with the people.

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,800
At this rate,
Lu Group is bound to go bankrupt.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
All his life,

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,759
my father gave Lu Group

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,919
everything he had.

41
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,280
Thus, I have to protect his legacy.

42
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,759
Chuning.

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,360
Marry me.

44
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,120
Once you become my wife,

45
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,520
all the rumors will go away.

46
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,439
You might think
I'm taking advantage of you.

47
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,879
But I truly

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,360
care about you.

49
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,319
I, Shen Mochen, swear

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,199
I will kill Lu Siyan

51
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,240
and protect the Lu family.

52
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,280
Sure.

53
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,240
I'll marry you.

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,780
(Lu Ancestral Shrine)

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,560
(Late Mr. Lu's Memorial Tablet)
Chuning.

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,720
(Late Mrs. Lu's Memorial Tablet)
What are you doing?

57
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,360
A wedding is a big deal.

58
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,639
Of course my parents should be here.

59
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,719
Unless

60
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,080
you feel guilty

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,560
and dare not face them.

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,199
Of course not.

63
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,159
With your parents as witnesses,

64
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:39,880
our marriage

65
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,039
will be even more blessed.

66
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,439
Has news of our wedding gotten out?

67
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,879
Yes, sir.

68
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,400
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,376
Second bow to the parents.

70
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,079
Husband and wife bow to each other.

71
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,279
(Shen Mochen.)

72
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,959
(You're the one
who destroyed my family.)

73
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,319
(You will meet your demise)

74
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,279
(in this wedding hall.)

75
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:08,416
Shen Mochen!

76
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:11,600
I'm here to send you to hell.

77
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,399
Lu Siyan.

78
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,680
How did you know
you'd meet your demise today?

79
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,680
You even put on those mourning clothes.

80
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,079
I'm wearing these for my parents

81
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,079
and you.

82
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,199
For me?

83
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,279
Lu Siyan.

84
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,680
Why are you here?

85
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:04,680
Leave now

86
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,920
or I'll kill you!

87
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,079
Chuning.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,879
Drop the act already.

89
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm not planning on leaving today.

90
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,439
You asked Chuning for her hand

91
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,160
just to force me to show up.

92
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,839
Well,

93
00:06:18,424 --> 00:06:19,312
I'm here.

94
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,680
You should let her go.

95
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,199
You never really believed
Lu Siyan trafficked girls

96
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:50,840
or killed your parents.

97
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,680
You've suspected me all this while.

98
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,480
So you've been playing along

99
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,279
to avenge your parents.

100
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,720
That took you long enough.

101
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,480
Did you really think
I wanted to marry you?

102
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:05,160
I wish I could tear you to pieces!

103
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,439
But what you didn't expect
was that Lu Siyan would risk everything

104
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,279
to walk straight
into the lion's den for you?

105
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,360
I really envy what you two have.

106
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,040
But you're my woman.

107
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,319
You can't do this!

108
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,519
Sanshun.

109
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,000
Take him away!

110
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,439
Siyan...

111
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,839
I won't let either of you go.

112
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,480
Yet I won't kill you yet.

113
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:29,640
I'll keep you alive

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,920
and torture you slowly.

115
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,199
You'll never see each other again

116
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,399
and completely lose hope!

117
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,200
Move!

118
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,759
Let go of me!

119
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,360
From the young master of the Lu family

120
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,839
to a wanted criminal hated by everyone,

121
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,319
how does that feel,

122
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,560
huh?

123
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,079
My parents treated you well.

124
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,480
Why did you kill them?

125
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,519
Treated me well?

126
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,240
In your parents' eyes,

127
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,920
I was nothing

128
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,480
but a guard dog

129
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,959
who was protecting your household.

130
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,519
They ended up like this

131
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,919
because they had it coming.

132
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,919
They deserved to die!

133
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,840
You're just an ungrateful traitor.

134
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,279
Chuning!

135
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:56,879
Siyan.

136
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,520
Siyan...

137
00:08:59,016 --> 00:08:59,688
Siyan...

138
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,816
Siyan...

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,720
Lin Chuning.

140
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,399
Lin Chuning.

141
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,000
You're mine.

142
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,680
And you're cuddling with another man?

143
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,360
What do you take me for?

144
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
What do you take me for?

145
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,000
Siyan.

146
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,840
Grab her!

147
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,080
Let go of me!

148
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,000
Fine.

149
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,559
Since you like him that much,

150
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,240
watch this.

151
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:35,960
Siyan...

152
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,639
Siyan!

153
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,159
No!

154
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:43,000
No!

155
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,360
I'm begging you!

156
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,240
Please!

157
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,320
I beg of you!

158
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,440
Please!

159
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,240
Chuning.

160
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,080
Stop begging him.

161
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,440
Chuning.

162
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,919
What's that supposed to mean?

163
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,080
Huh?

164
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,440
You're kneeling
and begging me for his sake?

165
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,120
Fine.

166
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:12,960
No...

167
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,679
No!

168
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,639
Let go.

169
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:15,519
No!

170
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,279
Since you can't let go of him,

171
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,120
watch this, then.

172
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,919
The reason he's in so much pain

173
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,080
is all because of you!

174
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:27,879
No!

175
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,480
No...

176
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,519
No.

177
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,320
Tonight's our wedding night.

178
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,440
Can we not waste our time

179
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,960
on him?

180
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,200
Let go.

181
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,799
Chuning.

182
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,080
Thank you for the reminder.

183
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,440
Tonight is our wedding night.

184
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,160
The night is short,
so we should cherish it.

185
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,120
I'll let you go for now.

186
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,200
I'll continue torturing you after this.

187
00:10:57,864 --> 00:10:59,072
Don't touch her...

188
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,759
No!

189

♪The tender dusk, unknowing♪

190
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Don't touch her...

191
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,120
Don't touch her! No!

192
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:19,240
No!

193
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,440

Tell me.

In what way I'm less than him?

242
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,320
You're nothing compared to him.

If we don't try,

247
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,240
how could we know she's not faking it?

248
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,919
What are you doing?

249
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,320
Don't you forget

250
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,879
how masterful she's always been
in putting up an act.

251
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,759
Let's do so to confirm it.

252
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,399
That won't be necessary.

253
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,720
She ended up this way because of you.

254
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,960
So, why act affectionate here?

255
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,600
Say that again.

256
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,919
Did you know?

257
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,120
I have no patience

258
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,480

259
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:17,720
Bear this in mind.

You're no more than a servant

261
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,679

262
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,120
Take good care of her

263
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,240
or I'll show you no mercy.

264
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,087
(There must be clues here
about Shen Mochen's deals)

265
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:19,360
(with the traffickers.)

266
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,112
Mister.

267
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,039
Turn around.

268
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,599
I forgot a file.

269
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:05,240
Mochen.

270
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,880
You're back.

271
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,680
I just tidied up your study.

272
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,559
(I have to strike first.)

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,839
(Only then will he truly believe
you're not going to come around.)

274
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,408
What are you doing?

275
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,296
Chuning.

276
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,279
Chuning, it's me.

277
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:24,480
Xiaorou.

278
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:26,880
Chuning.

279
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,400
Let me get you out of here first.

280
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:29,880
Just leave the rest to me.

281
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,160
Xiaorou.

282
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,039
I can't leave just yet.

283
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:34,759
Moreover,

284
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,920
Lu Siyan's name hasn't been cleared.

285
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,800
If we escape
without proving his innocence,

286
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,799
we'll just end up
being in a trickier situation.

287
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,359
Besides,
those girls are still in his hands.

288
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,920
We can't just sit by and do nothing.

289
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:46,720
Fine.

290
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,359
I'll help you.

291
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,160
Just stay safe.

292
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,880
Thank you, Xiaorou.

293
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,000
It's nothing.

294
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,119
Chuning, Shen Mochen is here.

295
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:04,400
Go now.

296
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,640
Okay.

297
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,720
Get out of my study.

298
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:13,720
Scram!

299
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,400
Out!

300
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,359
Good work.

301
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,680
You may go.

302
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,799
It's me, Young Master.

303
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,920
As long as you give me the money,

304
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,400
(Trafficker)
you can have as many girls

305
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,039
as you want.

306
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,519
Rest assured, Chief Shen.

307
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,240
Tomorrow at eight.

308
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,519
I'll give you the money

309
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,720
to have the girls.

310
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,359
Chuning.

311
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,440
Xiaorou.

312
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,799
How did it go?

313
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,480
Don't worry.

314
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,839
I found out
the key is in his coat pocket.

315
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,279
And Lu Siyan has been taken to safety.

316
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,160
That's great.

317
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,000
Thank you, Xiaorou.

318
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,440
You're welcome.

319
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,000
Chuning.

320
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,839
You're my Chuning.

321
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,760
Don't worry, Chuning.

322
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,759
I will make you well again.

323
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,400
I have money now.

324
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,839
I'm even more loaded than Lu Siyan.

325
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,880
I'll take you to the best doctor

326
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,079
and get you cured.

327
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,160
Chuning.

329
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,119
