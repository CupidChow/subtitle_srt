(With his skills,

(He did it on purpose to show Mr. Gao.)

00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:57,420
I brought you a cat.

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,359
Cats are clingy.

00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,399

Yes.

00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,760
Just a pet.

Lu Chuning.

You never did this before.

00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,159
Well.

you locked me up here

00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,120
look around.

00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,319

00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,600

77
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,360
why are you still alive?

78
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,920
Are you surprised?

79
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,519
You villain are not dead yet,

80
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,360
why would I be?

81
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,360
It can't be.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,160
I trusted you so much.

83
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,079
I can't believe

84
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,759
you still see yourself as a Lu.

85
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,000
Father,

86
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,959
I'm only doing what needs to be done.

87
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,879
Nothing more.

88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,920
Gao Yunfeng,

89
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,160
you're sanctimonious

90
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,079
and ruthless.

91
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,000
You pretended to be helping baby girls
for the Foundling Home.

92
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,040
In fact, you sold them to Wenrou Lounge

93
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,600
when they grew up.

94
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,120
Even now,

95
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,600
you won't stop

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,360
your evil act.

97
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,920
You're still trying to traffic girls.

98
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,079
Have you no shame?

99
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,959
That's slander!

100
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,720
Yes, I made mistakes.

101
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:17,920
But they're the same mistakes
all the men make.

102
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,279
I just

103
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,639
went to Wenrou Lounge

104
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,040
for pleasure.

105
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,959
But that doesn't make me the boss
of this place.

106
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,040
You're still denying it?

107
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,079
Very well.

108
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,199
I'll expose your true colors
through and through.

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,360
Siyan.

110
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,279
Siyan, don't...

111
00:06:37,312 --> 00:06:37,600
You!

112
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,759
(Where are they?)

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,600
(Why did they all turn into porcelain?)

114
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,400
Found anything, eh?

115
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,879
Lin Chuning,

116
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,120
as everyone knows,

117
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,639
I like

118
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,199
collecting things.

119
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,968
Chuning,

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,120
just tell me directly if you like these.

121
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,360
I can give you one.

122
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,720
Gao Yunfeng,

123
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,640
you're so sinful.

124
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,160
Don't think you can get away with this.

125
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,079
You keep saying I'm sinful.

126
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,600
Where's your proof?

127
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,439
Fine.

128
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,399
You ask for proof?

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,959
I'm the proof.

130
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,279
I, Lu Chuning,

131
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,519
accuse Gao Yunfeng of attempting rape

132
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,560
and of trying to abduct me
to Wenrou Lounge.

133
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,240
But who would

134
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,920
believe you?

135
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,560
All your accusations

136
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,639
are nothing but an excuse
to take over the Lu Group.

137
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
First you drove me out,

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,480
and now you're pinning
these charges on me.

139
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,199
You want me dead.

140
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,399
Chuning, I'm telling you.

141
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,879
Even if...

142
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,399
Even if I were the owner
of Wenrou Lounge,

143
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,959
who could prove it?

144
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,879
I can prove it.

145
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,480
I can prove he's the owner.

146
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,959
I can.

147
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,920
- We can prove it.
- I can prove it, too.

148
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,160
Father,

149
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,600
I can prove

150
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,120
you're the owner.

151
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,879
You're not getting away this time.

152
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,120
You...

153
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,720
You...

154
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,240
You ingrates!

155
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,480
Get away?

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,360
Why should I get away?

157
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
There are no outsiders here.

158
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,879
Fine, I admit it.

159
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,799
I own Wenrou Lounge.

160
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,519
So what can you do about it?

161
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,879
Men and women seeking pleasure here

162
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,320
is a natural thing to do.

163
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,840
What I built

164
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,759
isn't Wenrou Lounge.

165
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,919
It's paradise.

166
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,960
They're to blame instead.

167
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,840
They don't know how to enjoy it.

168
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,879
They're being so dramatic.

169
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,240
I created a paradise for them,

170
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,960
but they want to send me to hell.

171
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,879
Who do you think

172
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,799
is the real sinner here?

173
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,320
Fellow reporters,

174
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,679
did you all hear that?

175
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,799
You...

176
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,919
How did you all get in here?

177
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,879
Get out.

178
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,320
It's you.

179
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,679
You're welcome.

180
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,000
You ungrateful son!

181
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,279
Gao Yunfeng,

182
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
I know you've got people
inside the police force.

183
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,480
If you give me names,

184
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,879
I'll consider

185
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,480
asking for mitigation.

186
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,559
Mr. Gao.

187
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,759
Chief Shen.

188
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,799
Repent yourself at the court.

189
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Hold Lin Chuning hostage.

190
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,679
Lu Siyan won't dare to take risks.

191
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:01,416
Maybe

192
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,480
you still have a chance.

193
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,120
Go.

194
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,240
Go to hell!

195
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,440
Don't move.

196
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:09,720
Drop the gun.

197
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,399
Lin Chuning,

198
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,960
you ruined me.

199
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:17,280
I'm going to kill you.

200
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
And you, unfilial son!

201
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,840
After I kill her,

202
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,279
I'll kill you.

203
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:24,520
Die!

204
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,880
Drop it.

205
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,000
Reporters.

206
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,639
Reporters.

207
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,279
Reporters.

208
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,519
Mr. Gao committed a lot of crimes,
and he's beyond redemption.

209
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,080
As the Chief of Police,

210
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,919
I have a duty to protect every citizen.

211
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,840
Given the severity of his crimes,
he should be held accountable.

212
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,600
Hence, I shot him.

213
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,519
Thank you, everyone.

214
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,799
So, the one backing Wenrou Lounge
is Shen Mochen,

215
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,879
that's why he was desperate
to silence him.

216
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,480
Gao Yunfeng deserved to die.

217
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
But still,

218
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,600
he's your father.

219
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,840
He gave me life, but never raised me.

220
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,360
To me,

221
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,360
he was an evil man.

222
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,320
Your wound.

223
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,360
Does it still hurt?

224
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,759
It does.

225
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,879
From now on,

226
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,080
you'll always be in my heart.

227
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,440
Tell me now.

228
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,600
When did your memory come back?

229
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,240
Honestly, I still don't remember a lot.

230
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,799
But one thing I know for sure is

231
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,799
I love you.

232
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,120
Mercifully, you're still alive.

233
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,720
From now on, just stay by my side.

234
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,080
Don't go anywhere.

235
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,679
I won't ask you to be rich

236
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,159
or successful.

237
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,240
I just want you to be safe

238
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,320
and healthy.

239
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:10,760
Father,

240
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,240
Mother,

241
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,848
I have to report back
to the flight academy tomorrow.

242
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,712
The accident last time

243
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,960
was because our aircraft

244
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,600
and technology weren't advanced enough.

245
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,879
If we want to defeat the enemy,

246
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,759
we need to have the spirit

247
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,960
of not fearing sacrifice or death.

248
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:25,960
Father, Mother,

249
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,720
I hope you both can support me.

250
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,919
No, Siyan.

251
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,399
It's dangerous.

252
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,519
Master,

253
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
say something.

254
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,960
Back then,

255
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,519
I used to think going to flight school
was a waste of time.

256
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,399
But now I understand

257
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,679
they're doing

258
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,279
something great.

259
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,919
They protect the country.

260
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,279
It's an honor.

261
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,600
I support you.

262
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,879
Thank you, Father.

263
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,120
Be honest with me.

264
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,920
Are you afraid I'll get into
another accident again?

265
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
Don't ever say that again.

266
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Instead of

267
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,039
breaking your wings,

268
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:10,679
I'd rather

269
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:12,520
give you a hand

270
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,840
and see you soar in the sky.

271
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,159
I envy you, really,

272
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,440
you have a dream.

273
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,120
I used to

274
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,159
have no idea

275
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,600
what I really wanted.

276
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,960
But now I do.

277
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,559
I hope

278
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,360
I can do everything in my power

279
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,879
to help women stand on their own feet.

280
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,440
I hope, one day, there'll
no longer be places like Foundling Home.

281
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,639
It will happen.

282
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,159
Because

283
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,480
you're the unstoppable

284
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,799
Lin Chuning.

285
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,240
Let's go.

286
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,519
Let's go.

287
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,480
I prepared dinner all by myself.

288
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,799
I doubt they're edible.

289
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,159
Might not suit your palate.

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,480
Father.

291
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,279
Mother.

292
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,559
I don't have much appetite.

293
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,799
Please enjoy dinner.

294
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,080
I don't feel like eating either.

295
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:31,920
Please enjoy the food.

296
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,279
Though Siyan survived the plane crash,

297
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,000
I somehow feel that

298
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,559
the two of them

299
00:14:46,648 --> 00:14:48,280
are not getting along well.

300
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,240
What's on your mind?

301
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,360
I'm thinking about

302
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:01,480
when I should tell Father everything.

303
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,632
If this keeps dragging on,

304
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,600
when will it ever end?

305
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,960
Aren't you afraid

306
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,360
he'll kick you out of the house

307
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,320
once you tell him?

308
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:13,919
Then what?

309
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,039
If I end up homeless,

310
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:18,256
please take me in.

311
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,320
Wouldn't that be expensive?

312
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,759
I have to think about it.

313
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,480
No at all. I'm easy to feed.

314
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:27,840
Really?

315
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,840
Yeah.

316
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:35,280
Mother.

317
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,320
I know it's my fault

318
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,639
that you can't date openly.

319
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:44,559
But please

320
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,039
give me a little more time.

321
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,039
I'll confess to Master.

322
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,879
I understand, Mother.

323
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,440
Siyan,

324
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
will you

325
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,440
still accept me as your mother?

326
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,200
You'll always be my mother.

327
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,000
Chuning.

328
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,480
Mrs. Lu.

329
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,440
I'm sorry.

330
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,540
(Punish Evil, Uphold Justice)

331
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,200
Congratulations, Chief Shen.

332
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,759
You've become

333
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,600
a hero of justice to the people.

334
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:37,919
Out with it.

335
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,039
What did you come here for?

336
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,440
I want you to kill Lu Siyan.

337
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,360
Mr. Gao is dead,

338
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,039
and Lu Siyan abandoned you.

339
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,440
Do you think

340
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,639
you're useful

341
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,159
to me now?

342
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,039
You used me and hung me out to dry?

343
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,440
I'm discarding

344
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,159
a worthless pawn.

345
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,839
You bribed the mechanic
in the flight academy

346
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,680
to tamper with the aircraft
Lu Siyan was in, didn't you?

347
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,960
Also, you made me take the blame
for that sachet.

348
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,359
Go on.

349
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,559
Keep talking.

350
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,200
The boxes Mr. Gao had

351
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,960
didn't contain porcelain.

352
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,880
You swapped the girls out beforehand

353
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,039
to scheme against Lin Chuning
and Lu Siyan.

354
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,440
Poor Mr. Gao,

355
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,880
he died without even knowing

356
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
he was your scapegoat.

(Account Book)

358
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,359
What is this?

359
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,519
I'm pledging my loyalty to you.

360
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,039
This is Mr. Gao's account book.

361
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,920
If you wish to build
your own Wenrou Lounge,

362
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,000
you'll need this.

363
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,599
I'm just a poor, helpless woman

364
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,240
who's trying to look for someone
to cling to.

365
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,240
Well.

366
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,119
Please take pity on me, Chief Shen.

367
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,200
This dress...

368
00:18:59,039 --> 00:18:59,640
Do you like it?

369
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,640
I had it made for you.

370
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,720
I like anything you pick.

371
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,200
I'll take you somewhere.

372
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,599
Where?

373
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:32,720
You'll see.

374
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,559
All right.

375
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,200
Here. Feet up.

376
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,400
Careful.

377
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,759
Take it slow.

378
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,776
All right.

379
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,744
Here we are.

380
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,799
Okay.

381
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,799
Hold this.

382
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:44,519
Chuning,
there's something I want to say.

383
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,640
I fell for you at first sight.

384
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,240
But I didn't know

385
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,440
what love was.

386
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,519
So after going through ups and downs,

387
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,599
and when I realized
I had truly loved you,

388
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,480
I found out you were my sister.

389
00:20:58,032 --> 00:20:59,848
I don't think anything could be worse

390
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,400
than that.

391
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,039
That's when I knew

392
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,799
my feelings for you

393
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,039
run so deep.

394
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,000
Otherwise, even after losing

395
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,160
all my memories,

396
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,319
I wouldn't have remembered
that I love you.

397
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,519
After everything we went through,

398
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,319
I'm going to be brave once again.

399
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,279
Chuning.

400
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,160
Will you

401
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:40,960
marry me?

402
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,519
No, I won't.
