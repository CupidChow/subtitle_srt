1
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,000
Sister.

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,799
Where are you going?

3
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,079
(I never thought I was a good person,)

4
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:02,440
(but I never imagined)

5
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,319
(that one day)

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,319
(I'd meet someone far worse than me.)

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,439
(Our connection)

8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,840
(began with a misguided act of revenge.)

9
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,400
(He's my younger brother)

10
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,319
(and also my lover.)

11
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,640
(We made solemn vows.)

12
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,319
(We swore eternal love.)

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,000
(But now,)

14
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,799
(all I want is to run from him.)

15
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:47,520
Sister.

16
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:50,440
Got you.

17
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,460
=Stealing Heart=

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,140
=Episode 1=
(The Truth Behind the Lies)

19
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,380
(Six Months Ago)

20
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,914
Tonight

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,520
is Lu Department Stores' annual show.

22
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:47,120
All the city's elites will attend.

23
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,599
Girls, get all dolled up.

24
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,920
If you want to rise in status,
tonight is your chance.

25
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,320
(Lu Siyan, Heir of the Lu Family)

26
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,360
Siyan.

27
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,840
(Tang Pingjun, Hostess)
You officially take over Lu Group today,

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,320
fulfilling Father's wish.

29
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,639
(Shen Mochen, Police Chief)
I brought Mochen with me today

30
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,920
(Lu Yijing, The Lu Family's Heiress)
to congratulate you.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Siyan, congratulations.

32
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,159
A toast to you.

33
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,560
Siyan.

34
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,120
I truly admire you.

35
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,400
You're always surrounded
by beautiful women.

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,960
Each is more stunning than the other.

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
You're indeed a womanizer,

38
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,240
an expert.

39
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:31,960
I'm no match for you.

40
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,400
Just please my sister,

41
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,280
and you'll live
a life of wealth and luxury.

42
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,600
You didn't need to do anything.

43
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,000
Hey.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,520
Mochen, look!

45
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,830
(Xiaotao, Lu Department Stores' Staff)
I picked her myself.

46
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,040
She's the model
Lu Group is heavily promoting this year.

47
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,719
How gorgeous.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,159
Could she be

49
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,560
the surprise finale tonight?

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,480
She's definitely the next supermodel.

51
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,540
(Lin Chuning,
Lu Department Stores Staff)

52
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,794
I can't believe Lu Department Stores

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,879
has such a breathtaking beauty.

54
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:45,040
(Humph, a supermodel?)

55
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,040
(I'll see how you get off that stage.)

56
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,160
This looks nice.

57
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,040
If you like it,

58
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,680
please head to the VIP room

59
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,079
for us to take your measurements.

60
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,319
No need for that.

61
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,839
I want the one you're wearing.

62
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,959
I'll wrap it up right away.

63
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,360
I want it now.

64
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,240
Ms. Lu.

65
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,480
Did I

66
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,000
do a mistake?

67
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,079
Mochen.

68
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,114
I want it right now.

69
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,200
Yijing asked you to give it to her,

70
00:05:32,302 --> 00:05:33,720
so you must do so.

71
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,680
Who do you think you are?

72
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't you know whose place this is?

73
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:56,977
Mochen.

74
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,839
You're not even officially family yet.

75
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,280
Already overstepping?

76
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:03,640
Aren't you too eager?

77
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,839
Siyan!

78
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,319
Put the gun away.

79
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,399
You can live off a woman,

80
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,319
but act humble outside.

81
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't let yourself choke on it.

82
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:16,200
Listen up.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,319
In Lu Department Stores,

84
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:20,400
my rule

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,600
is that I don't allow anyone to bully

86
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:25,400
beautiful women.

87
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:45,394
Go!

88
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,000
I heard

89
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,399
you refused an arranged marriage,

90
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,399
so your father scolded you for days.

91
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,120
Why not

92
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,920
stay at my place tonight?

93
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,399
I'll help you blow off steam.

94
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,639
You're too greedy,

95
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,279
I spent the day with you,

96
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,480
so of course
I'll spend the night with others.

97
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,320
I have plans.

98
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,519
Go.

99
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,480
Get in.

100
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,920
Be good.

101
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Let me go.

102
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't come closer.

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,720
Don't move.

104
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,399
Don't come closer.

105
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,399
Or I'll shoot.

106
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,079
Lu Siyan has countless women.

107
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,319
You think he'll remember you?

108
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,959
Who do you think gave me this gun?

109
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,519
Mr. Siyan gave it to me.

110
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,480
If you don't want to offend him,

111
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,519
let me go.

112
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,720
Even a sweet girl can bite.

113
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,639
Interesting.

114
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,759
Get her!

115
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,839
I'll show her

116
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,399
offending me for Lu Siyan

117
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,879
has its price.

118
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,639
Stop!

119
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,285
Run.

120
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,519
Stay back!

121
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,840
Weren't you tough just now?

122
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,720
Follow me back to the police station.

123
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,560
Don't be stupid.

124
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,440
- Stay back.
- Come on!

125
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,639
Wait!

126
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,360
Try touching her.

127
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,879

I was late.

Mr. Siyan.

164
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,080
My sister said

165
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:58,160
all men are trash.

166
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,120

170
00:12:09,914 --> 00:12:10,920
I...

171
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,519
Don't move.

Mr. Siyan.

Can I

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,799
stay by your side?

175
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:40,560
I'm afraid Chief Shen

176
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,440
will give me trouble.

177
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,759
Sure.

178
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:54,000
It must be exhausting to pretend.

179
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,600
You're too rough.

180
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,280
I don't like it.

181
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,600
If we don't make it convincing,

182
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,559
how will he believe it?

183
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,759
Chuning.

184
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,399
This is far too dangerous.

185
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,000
Lu Siyan isn't what he seems.

186
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,559
He's a spoiled and reckless heir.

187
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,360
Getting close to him

188
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,080
isn't the only way
to take Lu Group from him.

189
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:37,720
I'm not trying to get close to him.

190
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,679
I want to kill him.

191
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,480
He must pay the price

192
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,240
for Xiaorou's death.

193
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,000
But you saw it yourself.

194
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:48,920
Lu Siyan didn't take the bait.

195
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,840
No.

196
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:52,000
He already did.

197
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,679
A spoiled heir like Lu Siyan

198
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,080
is used
to women throwing themselves at him.

199
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,399
He suddenly met someone different.

200
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
He won't let go that easily.

201
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,559
Stubborn and clever sweet girl.

202
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,400
Good acting.

203
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,799
But

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,720
how did you
get Shen Mochen to play along?

205
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:25,440
He's busy climbing the ranks.

206
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:28,680
Unless you knew each other
and colluded with each other

207
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:30,920
to set me up.

208
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,600
Am I right?

209
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,399
I was just wondering

210
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,399
when it would be interesting
to get exposed?

211
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,320
Feeling pity for me

212
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,720
is just a temporary novelty.

213
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,879
Being hard to get

214
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,399
and impossible to read

215
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,159
is what

216
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,440
drives a person crazy.

217
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,799
Isn't it?

218
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,600
You're clever.

219
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,879
I like clever women.

220
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,399
Mr. Siyan.

221
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,120
What do you want a clever woman like me

222
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,320
to do?

223
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:30,640
Marry me.

224
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:33,390
(Lu Group)

225
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,679
Why bring me to try on clothes?

226
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,645
- I plan to announce our engagement
- Change.

227
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,320
- at my birthday banquet tonight.
- Change.

228
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,039
So I need you to stun the crowd.

229
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:40,720
Change again.

230
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,920
Again.

231
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,879
What do you think?

232
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:13,080
After marrying into the Lu family,

233
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,879
do you know what to do?

234
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,320
Be a gentle and virtuous wife,

235
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:27,640
a filial and sensible daughter-in-law,

236
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,360
a mistress who handles the house,

237
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:34,497
so that my husband can indulge outside

238
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,160
with peace of mind.

239
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:38,600
Bang.

240
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,399
Wrong.

241
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,080
You need to show your true self.

242
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:49,400
Make them hate you.

243
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,748
Make marrying you a disgrace.

244
00:16:52,422 --> 00:16:55,171
The best case is to make them
kick me out of the family.

245
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,799
Got it?

246
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,680
In that case...

247
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:05,680
Sure.

248
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,560
(This looks like a matching piece)

249
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,680
(to the peace amulet
Xiaorou has worn since childhood.)

250
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,680
Do you wear this all the time?

251
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,119
Sometimes.

252
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,160
It's from my mother.

253
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,279
You like it?

254
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,519
(If they're really a pair,)

255
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,640
(could Xiaorou)

256
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,920
(be a daughter of the Lu family?)

257
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:35,668
Tonight,

258
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:40,880
I'll announce the good news to everyone.

259
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:43,480
Darling.

260
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,680
Sure.

261
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,519
(In that case,)

262
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,160
- (tonight's birthday banquet)
- (Tonight's birthday banquet)

263
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,640
- (will be exciting.)
- (will be exciting.)

264
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,860
(Lu Residence)

265
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,759
You worked hard to prepare this banquet.

266
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,000
It's nothing.

267
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,400
Siyan.

268
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,200
- Here.
- Here.

269
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,680
Happy birthday.

270
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,559
Thank you, Father.

271
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,200
Whose daughter is that?

272
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,799
I've never seen her before.

273
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,519
Isn't she that mermaid girl

274
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,400
from the fashion show?

275
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,839
Yes.

276
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,640
She was invited to Mr. Siyan's party.

277
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
No wonder

278
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,280
she was the finale.

279
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,200
(Mr. Lu, Lu Siyan's Father)
She outshone everyone.

280
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,360
(Mr. Lu, Lu Siyan's Father)
Mr. Siyan even defended her.

281
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,599
Seems like their relationship

282
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,759
isn't simple.

283
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,319
You're right,

284
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:10,519
but

285
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,240
she's really beautiful.

286
00:19:13,222 --> 00:19:13,880
Sorry,

287
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,360
I'm late.

288
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:16,880
It's alright.

289
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,119
At least you stole the spotlight.

290
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,559
You remember what to do?

291
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,759
Of course.

292
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,119
Very good.

293
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,697
Everyone,

294
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,331
thank you for coming.

295
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,571
Today,

296
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,805
I want to announce something important.

297
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Her appearance

298
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,200
is a gift from the heaven.

299
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:38,280
She

300
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,079
will soon become my...

301
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,279
I did

302
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:46,640
want to use you
to marry into the Lu family

303
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,640
and enjoy endless wealth and status.

304
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,000
But now I realize

305
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,000
I can still have it all

306
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,559
without you.

307
00:19:58,234 --> 00:19:58,897
Stop.

308
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,720
Good evening, everyone.

309
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,000
Actually,

310
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,480
today isn't just Mr. Lu's birthday.

311
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,160
It's mine too.

312
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,188
Let me introduce myself.

313
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,039
I'm Lu Siyan's

314
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,720
twin sister.

315
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,839
(Mrs. Lu, Lu Siyan's Mother)

316
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,119
We were born on the same day,

317
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,200
month, and year.

318
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,440
Lu

319
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,319
Chu

320
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,240
