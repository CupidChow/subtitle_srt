(Intoxicated)

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,310
This is fine deer blood wine.

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,109
That would be enough for you.

5
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,229
Mrs. Lu.

6
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,270
Mrs. Lu

7
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,550
actually chose

8
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:15,030
Lu Siyan's office.

9
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:20,229
What a gift.

10
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,910
How can I let you down?

11
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,830
(Aphrodisiac incense?)

12
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,120
Madam, you have two plans ready.

13
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,509
Not only did you prepare deer blood wine
for Chief Shen,

14
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:36,750
but you also prepared
aphrodisiac incense for Ms. Chuning.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,109
I believe both of them
will enjoy a wonderful time.

16
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,590
Come on.

17
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,989
Let's invite the Master for a show.

18
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:43,949
Yes, Madam.

19
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,710
Siyan.

20
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:53,438
Lin Chuning,

21
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,470
don't come near me.

22
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,359
Get out.

23
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,150
Siyan,

24
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,989
did you ask for me?

25
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,198
I didn't.

26
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,310
Leave now.

27
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,190
No.

28
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,949
It's aphrodisiac incense.

29
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,959
Siyan,

30
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,789
are you okay?

31
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,816
I said get out. Go.

32
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:14,470
Just go.

33
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,789
Are you okay?

34
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,869
Lin Chuning,

35
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:34,719
I told you to leave.

36
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,869
Siyan.

37
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,150
Let go of me.

38
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,950
I saw Gao Yunfeng drag Chuning
into the office.

39
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,958
I'm afraid he might hurt her

40
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,150
out of spite.

41
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,278
Where's Siyan?

42
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,869
I've sent someone to look for him.

43
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,398
Are you insane?

44
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,549
Yes, I am.

45
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,799
Lin Chuning.

46
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,359
You...

47
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,518
Let go of me.

48
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,270
I can't control myself.

49
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,549
I can't.

50
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,150

Lu Siyan.

55
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,549
They want to witness an affair,
don't they?

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,159
Then let them.

57
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,749
That way,

58
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,350
you'll never be with anyone else.

Father,

85
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,950
we got some client feedback

00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,719

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,749
maybe we should add
another refinement step.

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,989

isn't necessary.

I'll let her off this time.

193
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,149
You're such a sweetheart.

194
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,398
I'll sleep with you tonight.

195
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,710
Let's have a nice chat.

196
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,590
Mother,

197
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:53,270
I hope

198
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:54,990
you'll protect Chuning

199
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,296
and don't let anyone hurt her.

200
00:12:57,297 --> 00:12:58,430
All right?

201
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,910
Cong,

202
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,638
stay outside

203
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,398
Ms. Chuning's room tonight.

204
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,950
If anything happens, just shoot.

205
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,550
Yes.

206
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,670
Anyone out there?

207
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,749
Open the door.

208
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,909
Mochen,

209
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,470
you're finally here.

210
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,070
Jing,

211
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,190
are you all right?

212
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,350
I've knocked out the people
who locked you up.

213
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,269
You don't have to go to the girls' school.
Stay at my place, and don't worry.

214
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,190
But...

215
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,830
If Mother finds out I'm not there

216
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,710
and traces it back to you,
you'll be in trouble.

217
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,229
Don't worry.

218
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,830
Just to be safe,

219
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,670
write a few letters to your family.

220
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,560
I'll have someone send them
to the Lu Residence from time to time.

221
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,269
That way, your parents won't worry.

222
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,509
All right.

223
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,790
You're always so kind to me.

224
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,950
Chuning,

225
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,470
all the girls in the town are here.

226
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,959
Help me take a look.

227
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,109
See which girl is a good match.

228
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,470
Mother,

229
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,869
what is this for?

230
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,430
I'm finding your brother a wife.

231
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,790
Ms. Li is good.

232
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,070
She's from a studious family,
and she's good looking, too.

233
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,638
Ms. Zhang is also a good choice.

234
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,470
She's gentle. She must fit your brother.

235
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,989
Anyone you choose

236
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,109
must be the best.

237
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,149
You're already engaged yourself,

238
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,950
your brother should settle down, too.

239
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,950
As your mother, all I wish to see
is my children have their own families.

240
