(For Ideals, For You)

3
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:51,960
Shen Mochen!

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,719
You scoundrel!

5
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,920
You dare raise your hand against me?

6
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,799
You said you would marry me
if I helped you rebuild Wenrou Lounge.

7
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,280
And now you're doing this,
to a woman as good as dead?

8
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,400
You played me!

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,959
I played you?

10
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,640
And why shouldn't I?

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,120
Who do you think you are?

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,359
Letting you serve Chuning

13
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,040
was already doing you a favor.

14
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:18,719
You're

15
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:21,040
always throwing fits.

16
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,239
I would've killed you a long time ago

17
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,439
if you weren't useful to me.

18
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,640
You want me to marry you?

19
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,400
In your dreams.

20
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,400
Mochen,

21
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,239
you love me, don't you?

22
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:37,680
Get out!

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,079
You said you loved me.

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,439
Put your clothes on and get out.

25
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,759
(Did Shen Mochen figure it out?)

26
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,520
Chuning.

27
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,759
Is this what you're looking for?

28
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,640
I'm hurt.

29
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,080
I can't believe you'd do this to me.

30
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,639
Shen Mochen,

31
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,560
you disgust me.

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,719
Let go of me!

33
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,599
I disgust you?

34
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,919
You're my lawfully wedded wife.

35
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,120
I'm your husband.

36
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,319
I'm only exercising my rights
as your husband.

37
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,920
Don't touch me!

38
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,632
Get away from me!

39
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:27,784
Shen Mochen!

40
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,344
Chuning!

41
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,480
Chuning!

42
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:42,752
Chuning!

43
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,576
No!

44
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:52,736
Siyan!

45
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,616
Siyan!

46
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,279
Chuning!

47
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,319
Chuning!

48
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Let me go!

49
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,519
Chuning.

50
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,128
Chuning!

51
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:10,959
Chuning!

52
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,040
Chuning! Chuning!

53
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,480
You're too late.

54
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,376
(As long as you give me the money,)

55
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,079
(you can have as many girls as you want.)

56
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,439
(Rest assured, Chief Shen.)

57
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,560
(Tomorrow at eight.)

58
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,720
(I'll give you the money)

59
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,759
(to have the girls.)

60
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,680
Go.

61
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:05,560
They grew up with you.

62
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,040
You were practically sisters.

63
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,120
But what did you do?

64
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,720
You used their trust

65
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,199
to trick them into Wenrou Lounge.

66
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,680
Do they not haunt you

67
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,759
in your dreams?

68
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,680
Lin Chuning,

69
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,720
that trick might scare Mr. Gao,

70
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,000
but it doesn't scare me.

71
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,519
They are pitiful,

72
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,519
but am I not?

73
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,879
Do I deserve this wretched life?

74
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,319
I'll make sure all of them

75
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,560
suffer with me.

76
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Mr. Gao is the one
who put you through this misery,

77
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,920
but you refuse to see the truth.

78
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,439
You're caged by your own obsession.

79
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,800
The Xiaorou I knew died long ago.

80
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,680
She's lying right here.

81
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,000
She was gentle,

82
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,120
kind,

83
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,720
and wouldn't even step on an ant.

84
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,879
But look at you now.

85
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,000
If she saw what she became,

86
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,639
would she hate herself?

87
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,399
Shen Mochen made a deal
with the traffickers.

88
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,439
They're planning to smuggle girls.

89
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,519
Xiaorou.

90
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,839
Don't worry.

91
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm close to gaining his trust.

92
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,279
Good work.

93
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:29,959
Chuning,

94
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,600
I'll get you out first.

95
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,808
I'll help you with the rest.

96
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,480
Stop acting like
you're barely hanging on.

97
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,399
I haven't actually done anything to you.

98
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,360
Shen Mochen,

99
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,120
I'll kill you!

100
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,159
Chuning, let go!

101
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,480
Let go of me!

102
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,399
I'll kill you!

103
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,159
Chuning,

104
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,408
it's okay now.

105
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're all right.

106
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,080
Let's get out of here.

107
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,279
Let's go.

108
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,759
Wench!

109
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,480
You wench!

110
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,399
You betrayed me!

111
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,919
Well, I'm certainly not the first.

112
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,519
Trust means nothing

113
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,440
for people

114
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,960
like us.

115
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
You're asking for it!

116
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:25,919
Stop!

117
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,679
Damaged goods

118
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,080
won't fetch much.

119
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:42,632
Where are the others?

120
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,440
Stop!

121
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,776
Stop right there!

122
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Help!

123
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,919
Help me!

124
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,096
Please help me!

125
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,656
Shen Mochen!

126
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,360
I can't believe you're still alive.

127
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,600
This time,

128
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,440
there won't be a second chance.

129
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,399
A chance?

130
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,312
You gave me a chance?

131
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,304
And what about her?

132
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,120
Shen Mochen,

133
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,519
justice may take its time,
but it always hits its mark.

134
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,519
You can't run from this.

135
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,000
Give yourself up.

136
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,159
But you don't have

137
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,936
any backup.

138
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,080
Cong!

139
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,336
Cong!

140
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,799
- Cong!
- I'll shoot you!

141
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,039
Do it!

142
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,399
You shoot,

143
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,360
and she dies too.

144
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,000
Siyan,

145
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,080
do it!

146
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,200
Shen Mochen.

147
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,440
Stop refusing to see the truth.

148
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,960
The truth?

149
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,392
You think I'm the one
who refuses to see the truth?

150
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,080
You're wrong.

151
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,128
I'm the only one who's seeing clearly.

152
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,112
You and I are the same.

153
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,496
Both of us were born in the gutter.

154
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,039
The only difference is,

155
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,799
fate favored you.

156
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,200
You wanted a noble background,

157
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,080
and fate took someone else's life
to give it to you.

158
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
Even the woman I loved

159
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,312
ended up loving you.

160
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,759
I had to fight for everything by myself.

161
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,720
Fight fate.

162
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,120
Fight you.

163
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,200
Fight every injustice

164
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,120
I ever faced!

165
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,840
Someone else's gain

166
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,200
is not your loss.

167
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,600
Stop making excuses
for the harm you have done.

168
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,120
He ruined your life,

169
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:24,032
yet you still love him.

170
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:26,960
I hate both of you.

171
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,919
Neither of you gave me
the respect I deserve!

172
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,480
So both of you

173
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,799
must die!

174
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,320
Okay.

175
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,840
All right.

176
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,080
Calm down.

177
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,200
Die!

178
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,639
Xiaorou...

179
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,919
Xiaorou!

180
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,168
Chief!

181
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,399
Sanshun!

182
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,840
Sanshun!

183
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,919
I don't think I'll make it to heaven.

184
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,879
If you see the old Xiaorou,

185
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,480
tell her

186
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,320
I'm sorry.

187
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,039
No.

188
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,960
You're going to be all right.

189
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,919
It's over now.

190
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,080
We still have

191
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,559
a whole life ahead of us.

192
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,720
We'll go back to how things used to be.

193
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,519
The girls...

194
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,200
The girls are in the crates...

195
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,960
Hurry...

196
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,480
Save them...

197
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,480
Xiaorou!

198
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,519
Xiaorou!

199
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,120
Xiaorou, stay with me!

200
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:49,560
Xiaorou!

201
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,984
♪You and I lean on the same dream♪

202
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,248
Xiaorou...

203
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:00,928
Xiaorou...

204
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,039
There's nowhere else for you to go.

205
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,880
Chuning,

206
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,920
do you know

207
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,960
just how much I love you?

208
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,359
In the beginning,

209
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,440
I only wanted to stick close to you.

210
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,680
Then you became

211
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,920
the Matron of the Foundling Home.

212
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,079
I figured I wasn't good enough

213
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,599
for you.

214
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:30,839
So

215
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,559
I approached Lu Yijing

216
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,200
and became police chief.

217
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,480
Yet, you never saw me as your equal.

218
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,960
You mean

219
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,519
all you've become

220
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,480
is because of me?

221
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,704
No.

222
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,680
That's not true.

223
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
That would be

224
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,920
too hypocritical of me.

225
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,440
I know

226
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,839
once people get

227
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,720
a taste of power,

228
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,079
they always want more.

229
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,480
And I was swept up in all of it.

230
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:21,599
Everything

231
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,480
I ever did

232
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,079
was because I loved you.

233
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,079
I love you!

234
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,559
I'll give you a proper burial.

235
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,119
Thank you...

236
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,119
He's dead.

237
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,759
Don't go near him.

238
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,119
I can't just leave him

239
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:12,519
like that.

240
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,119
Shen Mochen!

241
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,039
Come any closer, and I'll kill her!

242
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,759
Let her go!

243
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,599
I'll let her go.

244
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,440
I won't hurt her.

245
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:37,720
But

246
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,359
I want you dead!

247
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:42,720
Let her go.

248
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,640
Take me instead.

249
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:46,480
No!

250
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,000
Siyan, are you out of your mind?

251
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:49,920
Put the gun

252
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,096
to your own head.

253
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,848
I want you

254
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,696
to kill yourself

255
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:57,768
right here,

256
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,400
in front of the both of us!

257
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,200
No!

258
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:02,288
Siyan!

259
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,696
Don't do it!

260
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,976
Do it!

261
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,840
Do it!

262
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,760
Do it!

263
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,776
No!

264
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,359
Do it now!

265
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,960
Siyan, no!

266
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,480
Don't do it!

267
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,039
Siyan!

268
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,279
Siyan, no!

269
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,559
You must live on.

270
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,640
Siyan!

271
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,928
I love you.
