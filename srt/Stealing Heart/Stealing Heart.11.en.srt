(May I Know What Love Is?)

3
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,699
Mr. Siyan.

4
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:53,678
We've searched through Foundling Home,

5
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,398
but Ms. Lin is nowhere to be seen.

6
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,429
And we've checked
all possible places she'd go.

7
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,279
And she wasn't
at the Lu Department Stores.

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,478
Where else could she be?

9
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,590
Keep searching.

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,270
Even if

11
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,119
we have to turn
the whole city upside down,

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,309
we're going to find her.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,679
Yes, sir.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,158
(You gave up the Foundling Home
for Shen Mochen.)

15
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,190

I came today to apologize in person.

And I invited a top Yue opera troupe

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,350
to perform here.

50
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,830
That's thoughtful of you.

51
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,789
Chuning.

52
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,510
Rest assured.

53
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,590
I'll make it up to you
with a grand engagement ceremony.

54
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,549
Let's call off the engagement.

55
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,510
What did you say?

56
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,599
This engagement between us

57
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,950
was never pure to begin with.

58
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,229
You used Mr. Gao to trap me.

59
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,789
And I used you to get back at Mr. Gao.

60
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,510
We're even now.

61
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,950
It was my fault.

62
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,080
I shouldn't have teamed up with Mr. Gao
to set you up.

63
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,510
But I truly did want to marry you.

64
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,789
We used and schemed against one another.

65
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,789
So we didn't do each other wrong.

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,229
Alright.

67
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,749
Then I'll take it as you've forgiven me.

68
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,229
From today onward,

69
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,350
I'll pursue you openly and honestly.

70
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:38,684
Since ancient times,

71
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:40,830
the third wheel never ends well.

72
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,030
Take Ma Wencai as an example.

73
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:45,864
He forced Liang Shanbo
and Zhu Yingtai apart.

74
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,789
In the end, he didn't get the lady,

75
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,830
and he earned himself
a bad reputation in history.

76
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,470
But did you know?

77
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:56,510
Their marriage was arranged by their parents
and suggested by a matchmaker.

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,030
The real perfect match
was Ma Wencai and Zhu Yingtai.

79
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,910
Liang Shanbo forced himself in.

80
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,549
If he hadn't been so stubborn,

81
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,989
Yingtai wouldn't have died with him.

82
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,549
Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai
weren't afraid of tradition.

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,078
They bravely pursued true love.

84
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,078
Even if they turned into butterflies
in the end,

85
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,749
I think they were free.

86
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,549
That's better than being caged for life.

87
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,229
People call it
"butterflies riding the wind."

88
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,119
But to me,
they were just moths drawn to the flame.

89
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,398
Who are you calling a moth?

90
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,629
- You...
- That's enough.

91
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,919
Am I here to watch you two argue

92
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,229
or to watch the opera?

93
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,950
You should go home.

94
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,950
Let go of me.

95
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:01,070
Why did you give me up to Xiaorou?

96
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:02,719
I'm not Zhu Yingtai,

97
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,904
so I won't give up everything for love.

98
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:08,004

I'm begging you, please.

140

Please cut ties with Siyan.

And I never will.

144
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,918
You stole my identity

145
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,909
and the man I love most.

146
00:09:53,982 --> 00:09:56,030
But you won't give anything back?

If that's how it is,

149
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,310
I'd rather die in Wenrou Lounge!

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,149
Xiaorou...

152
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,350
I'd rather die...

153
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,029
than watch you and Lu Siyan
get all lovey-dovey.

154
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,430
I got close to Lu Siyan to save you.

155
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,670
I entered the Lu Residence to save you.

156
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,430
But now

157
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,389
you're free.

158
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:27,590
So I can finally excuse myself.

159
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:30,150
I know you don't want to see me again.

160
00:10:30,342 --> 00:10:32,590
I'll return your identity
as soon as I can.

161
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,909
This is outrageous!

162
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,790
One second you're engaged to Shen Mochen,

163
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,439
the next you're breaking it off.

164
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,070
Do you think marriage
is some kind of child's play?

165
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,359
Father.

166
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,629
To tell you the truth,

167
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:07,590
the only reason
I got engaged to Shen Mochen

168
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,909
was because

169
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:10,918
someone in the residence

170
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,509
wanted me dead.

171
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,389
What did you say?

172
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,350
I only did it to protect myself.

173
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,869
I came up with that idea

174
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,790
because I wanted a quiet life.

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,389
Who would dare try to kill my daughter?

176
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,430
Well,

177
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,070
I have no idea.

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,790
But I'm not afraid anymore.

179
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,430
Because I've found someone

180
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,629
who'll protect me for life.

181
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,830
With him by my side,

182
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,359
no one

183
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,670
can hurt me.

184
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,790
Don't tell me you've pledged yourself
to someone again.

185
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:48,510
Dear.

186
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,229
Our daughter's grown up.

187
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,869
It's normal for her
to want companionship.

188
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,989
Let's stay out of it.

189
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,269
Mother.

190
00:11:57,331 --> 00:11:59,350
Do you even hear yourself?

191
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:01,630
I was talking about

192
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,550
Siyan.

193
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,749
Father.

194
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,909
Siyan and I
share a strong bond as siblings.

195
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,758
Having a brother like him

196
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,310
is better than a thousand suitors.

197
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,839
I'm pleased by the fact

198
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,430
that you're close.

199
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,350
But you'll both
have your own families one day.

200
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,749
Be more mindful.

201
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,550
Don't stir up gossip.

202
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,350
Yes, Father.

203
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,430
Siyan knows his boundaries.

204
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,550
Just rest assured, dear.

205
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,830
Do you think this will work?

206
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,710
Mochen.

207
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,638
I thought long and hard,

208
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,070
and I still felt
I had to tell you and Mother.

209
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,239
I saw Lin Chuning and my brother

210
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,269
being close and intimate.

211
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,629
After all,

212
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,710
you're about to get engaged
to Lin Chuning.

213
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,869
You knew

214
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,229
that I'm going to get engaged to her.

215
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,590
Yet you tried to sabotage my plan
by spreading the news.

216
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,509
You're the heiress of the Lu family,

217
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,989
yet you're so cheap.

218
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,310
Mochen...

219
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,190
So you're in on it with her?

220
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,830
That's right.

221
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,389
No...

222
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:38,190
Lin Chuning must've
put you up to this, didn't she?

223
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,398
You just want
to marry the Lu family heiress, no?

224
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,950
I'm the real Lu family heiress...

225
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,310
Listen here.

226
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,959
I'm marrying Lin Chuning

227
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,590
not because she's the Lu family heiress.

228
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,109
But you're different.

229
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,038
If you weren't the Lu family heiress,

230
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,950
I wouldn't even glance at you.

231
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,029
I don't believe it.

232
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,278
It must be...

233
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,190
It must be Lin Chuning who seduced you.

234
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,590
Mochen.

235
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,199
Look.

236
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,430
This was the first gift you gave me.

237
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,558
You said I was like this hairpin,

238
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,790
pure and flawless.

239
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,070
You said you'd cherish me.

240
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,830
You actually believed
a man's sweet talk?

241
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,989
You're laughably dumb.

242
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,119
No!

243
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,149
Don't step on it!

244
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:44,869
Get out of my way!

245
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,239
Why?

246
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,470
Why?

247
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,190
Did you ever

248
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,590
love me?

249
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,389
Not at all.

250
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,590
Jing wrote home
and said she's come to her senses.

251
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,269
I'd like to thank you on her behalf

252
00:15:32,313 --> 00:15:34,343
for not telling your father

253
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,869
that she tried to kill you.

254
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,509
If anyone bullies you again,

255
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,350
you must tell me.

256
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,869
I'll stand up for you.

257
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,710
I never dared to dream

258
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,719
that I'd one day have a family.

259
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,430
That I'd be loved by my parents.

260
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,038
You're my child.

261
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,149
I should

262
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,670
love you, no?

263
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,590
You should love me.

264
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,389
That's only right.

265
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,350
But Mother...

266
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,389
Why did you send someone to kill me?

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,989
That servant
who tried to kill me said so.

268
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,070
But I don't believe him.

269
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,629
Someone must've bought him off

270
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,229
to sow discord between us.

271
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,869
That's what I thought too.

272
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,830
But thank you, Mother,

273
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,350
for giving me such a wonderful brother.

274
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,830
Siyan

275
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,470
is nothing but nice.

276
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,869
Chuning.

277
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,450
You shouldn't have come back.

278
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:10,310
You shouldn't have disrupted my peace.

279
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,840
You've already lived 20 more years
than you were supposed to.

280
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,189
That's Heaven's gift to you.

281
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,830
So you should accept your fate.

282
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,869
Mrs. Lu.

283
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,469
You've fallen for Chuning's trap.

284
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,078
She deliberately stirred things up

285
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,429
just to provoke you into acting.

286
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,550
She already asked Mr. Lu to come here.

287
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,510
He's been watching from over there.

288
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,550
Well,

289
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,790
you'd better figure something out.

290
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,070
Otherwise,

291
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,350
Mr. Lu might come after you.

292
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,270
(Looks like)

293
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,909
(I'll have to come up with a new plan.)

294
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,429
The ones who needed to leave is gone.

295
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,270
The ones who needed to see have seen.

296
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,510
Does that even matter?

297
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,949
You almost got killed just now, you know.

298
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,919
I'm not stupid.

299
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,270
I can swim.

300
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,709
Here's fresh laundry. Get changed now.

301
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:49,758
Wait,

302
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,429
why do you have women's clothes?

303
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,790
I can't go back to my room just yet

304
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,669
because I don't want your mother
to bump into me.

305
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,669

as long as she helps me
leave the Lu Residence safely,

329
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,199
I'll tell your father

330
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,709
I fell into the water by accident.

331
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,149
I know

332
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,909
your mother just wanted to keep me here.
