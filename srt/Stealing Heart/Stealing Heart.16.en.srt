(Separation by Death)

3
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,280
Miss,

4
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,600
I shouldn't have stolen your purse.

5
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,600
Please have it back.

6
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,159
(Siyan,)

7
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,359
(I know)

8
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,280
(the one who has been by my side)

9
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,200
(silently protecting me is you.)

10
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,439
(Didn't we promise to go separate ways?)

11
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,239
(How am I supposed to let go like this?)

12
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,959
I checked with the academy
in Hong Kong, China.

13
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,719
Lu Siyan never studied there.

14
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,719
In fact, he's in the first batch
of flight cadets.

15
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,519
He's now a major in Air Force.

16
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,000
No wonder I always feel that there's
a secret he and Lin Chuning hiding.

17
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,400
Even though they both live
in the same place now,

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,519
their identities as siblings

19
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,480
are an unbreakable wall.

20
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,400
But that's okay.

21
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,680
They can't be together,
even though they miss each other.

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,640
It's more torturous

23
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,200
than never seeing each other again.

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,719
What if they're not real siblings?

25
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,560
What do you mean?

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,199
Back then, Mrs. Lu swapped her child
with a fake one

27
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,960
to secure her position.

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,960
Lu Siyan isn't the son of the Lu family.

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,960
He and Lin Chuning
aren't related by blood.

30
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,599
You'd better act fast

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,520
and make her yours.

32
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,240
Have children with her

33
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,000
and use them to tie her down.

34
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,360
Otherwise,

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,759
once they find out the truth,

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,439
you'll be completely out of the picture.

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,719
(Lu Siyan,)

38
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,840
(finally, I got something on you.)

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,560
(Once I find out
whose child you really are,)

40
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,960
(I'll make sure you and Lin Chuning
are both ruined.)

41
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,879
You may go.

42
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,879
I want to

43
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
walk around alone.

44
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,759
I can't leave you.

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,840
Before Mr. Siyan left,
he told me again and again

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,520
to keep you safe.

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,400
If not, I'll be in trouble.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Don't worry.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,919
I won't tell him.

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,039
Go on.

51
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:28,800
(Lin Chuning,)

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,639
(you wretched woman.)

53
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,400
(I lost everything because of you.)

54
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,840
(Now that Lu Siyan's away,)

55
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,479
(no one will protect you.)

56
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,080
Siyan.

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,479
Why are you here?

58
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,199
Didn't I warn you to stay away
from Lin Chuning?

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,800
She may be soft-hearted,

60
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,000
but I'm not.

61
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,759
I'll kill you.

62
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,159
I'm your father, Siyan.

63
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,199
Don't.

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,039
Uncle,

65
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,319
even if my father were here,

66
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,479
he couldn't save you.

67
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,879
Siyan,

68
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,599
I'm your father.

69
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,560
Let me explain.

70
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,360
The woman you call mother
isn't your birth mother.

71
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,680
Your real mother was her maid.

72
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,879
We had an affair,
and that's how you were born.

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,199
Your mother killed your birth mother
and took you for her own

74
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,440
in order to secure her position.

75
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,120
If you don't believe me,
ask her yourself.

76
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,920
Do you think I'll buy it?

77
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,480
Siyan.

78
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,959
Siyan.

79
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,120
No wonder people say we look alike.

80
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,199
I just found out about this.

81
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,800
We're father and son.

82
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,319
The Lu family killed your real mother.

83
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,439
Siyan,

84
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,800
we were kept in the dark for so long.

85
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,519
You must avenge her

86
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,879
and let them taste the pain

87
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,800
of losing family.

88
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,120
You don't deserve to be a human.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,639
Let alone a father.

90
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,959
Want me to turn on the Lu family?

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,079
That'll never happen.

92
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,480

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,040

Chuning,

114
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,160
keep up the good work

115
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,600
and protect the family business
for your brother.

116
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,399
When you marry,

117
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,519
I'll prepare a generous dowry.

00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
let's not talk about working
while eating.

120
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,920
Chuning has lost weight lately.

121
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,000
Siyan said you like chestnuts.

122
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Try this.

123
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,920
I made this chestnut cake myself.

124
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,600
Thank you, Mother.

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,279
Father,

126
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,639
have there been any news about Siyan?

127
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,839
No.

128
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,920
He sent a letter back yesterday,

129
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,279
saying he's doing fine
and will be back by the end of the year.

130
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,800
Speaking of which,

131
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,720
this is the first Chinese New Year
that the four of us celebrate together.

132
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,240
Ms. Chuning,

133
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,800
someone's here to see you.
Says he's Mr. Siyan's classmate.

134
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,199
Air Force Major Lu Siyan

135
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,639
was killed

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,639
What major?

140
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,680
What test flight?

141
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,240

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,879
Ms. Lin,

145
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,240
our aircraft went
from nothing to something,

146
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,200
from weak to strong.

147
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,519
Every test flight

148
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,720
carries the risk of death.

149
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,759
But to test its limits,

150
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,039
we must do it without hesitation.

151
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,840
We'd rather see it crash
on the test field

152
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,559
than be shot down by the enemy
at the battlefield.

153
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,519
No.

154
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,399
He can't be dead.

155
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
It can't be.

156
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,279
The aircraft exploded mid-air.

157
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,440
The intense heat melted him.

158
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,799
What did you say?

159
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,679
Our rescue team will do everything
they can to recover Siyan's remains.

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840

(Don't be upset.)

187
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,200
(I've simply become one with my dream.)

188
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,759
(Though life is short,)

189
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,120
(because of you,)

190
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,279
(it was brilliant like fireworks.)

191
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,200
(Even if we could only be siblings,)

192
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,840
(please meet me again)

193
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,399
(in the next life.)

194
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,480
(Forget it.)

195
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,720
(As long as you're happy.)

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,919
(I like it when you smile.)

197
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,879
(Sorry.)

198
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,080
(For the past,)

199
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,360
(the present,)

200
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
(and the future.)

201
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,799
(If possible,)

202
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,840
(I'd love you)

203
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,360
(for before,)

204
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:28,480
(now,)

205
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,519
(and always.)

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
I miss you so much.

207
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,679
Had I known this would happen,

208
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,840
I wouldn't have brought you back.

209
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,200
At least then,

210
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,519
you might've lived a peaceful life.

211
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,960
Chuning,

212
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,519
actually, I only gave birth to you.

213
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,720
Siyan was my maid's son.

214
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,480
At that time,

215
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,519
your father had just taken a concubine.

216
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,279
If I hadn't given him a son,

217
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,279
I wouldn't be the main wife
of the Lu family.

218
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,360
Madam,

219
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,759
it's

220
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,639
a girl.

221
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,320
Take her away.

222
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,279
Master only wants a son,

223
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,399
but it's a girl.

224
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,159
What about the others next door?

225
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,240
Madam.

226
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,960
What about them?

227
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,240
Boys or girls?

228
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,519
Some are still under term.

229
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,559
It won't be so fast.

230
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,200
Give them labor-inducing medicine

231
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,360
until they give birth to a son.

232
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,960
I'm afraid

233
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,679
that could kill them.

234
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,799
I'm not afraid.

235
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,680
They're just lowly maids.

236
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,600
What is there to fear?

237
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,399
With Master away
relocating the ancestral tomb,

238
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,840
this is my best chance.

239
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,559
Tell them.

240
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,840
If they give me a son,

241
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,559
I'll make sure
they live a comfortable life forever.

242
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,320
If not,

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,039
Master will definitely repudiate me.

244
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,679
Madam said,

245
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,679
as long as you give birth to a son,

246
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,240
she'll make sure you live
a comfortable life forever.

247
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,720
Drink the medicine.

248
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,759
Go in.

249
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,600
Congratulations, Madam. It's a son.

250
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,440
Give her this.

251
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,559
Maybe the family who find her
will treat her well.

252
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,000
Send them away.

253
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,840
Far away.

254
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,639
And those women next door,

255
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,399
remember to deal with them.

256
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,840
I don't want to hear a single rumor
about my son.

257
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,519
Yes, Madam.

258
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
What did you say?

259
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
So,

260
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
when I was born,

261
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
you abandoned me

262
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,759
to protect your own status.

263
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,440
And when I returned to the Lu family,

264
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,639
you were afraid
your scandal would be exposed,

265
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,440
so you tried to kill me again and again.

266
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,759
I'm sorry.

267
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,320
Don't touch me.

268
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,279
Do you know,

269
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,600
because of you,

270
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,559
Siyan's and my lives are ruined.

271
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,919
Siyan,

272
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:51,360
we could've been together forever.

273
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,159
Come back.

274
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,320
Please come back.

What do you think?

323
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,000
Chief Shen,

324
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,319
I recreated Wenrou Lounge

325
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:07,160
exactly how it used to be.

326
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,119
Are you satisfied?

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,960
Mr. Gao,

328
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
why are you saying that?

329
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,039
You're the real boss
behind Wenrou Lounge, though.

330
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,160
No matter how much profit it makes,

331
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,519
it has nothing

332
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,960
to do with me.

333
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,400
Chief Shen,

334
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,880
you can't be serious.

335
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,752
Everything I have today

336
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,039
is all given by you.

337
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,359
I don't quite understand

338
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,952
what you're talking about.

339
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,519
Oh.

340
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,839
Chief Shen,

341
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,759
please do me a favor

342
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,640
and keep this deed.

343
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,079
Mr. Gao,

344
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,119
don't worry.

345
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,039
Wenrou Lounge's fate

346
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,440
is tied to mine.

347
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,240
We'll rise and fall together.

348
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,880
Wise, Chief Shen.

349
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,160
I knew Gao Yunfeng is still alive.

350
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,279
He disappeared

351
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,960
after Wenrou Lounge was destroyed.

352
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,000
This time,

353
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,920
he can't stay hidden anymore.

354
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:11,640
Wonder

355
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,279
what he's up to this time.

356
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,119
But this time,

357
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,720
we won't let him get away easily.

358
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,119
- Ms. Lu.
- Ms. Lu.

359
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,079
Lu Chuning,

360
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,319
we're family.

361
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,039
Isn't it too much

362
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,799
that you took my goods?

363
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,640
You took advantage of Siyan's death

364
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,920
to drive my father sick

365
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,799
and try to bring down the Lu Group,
hoping to take over our place.

366
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,079
And you try to reason with me here?

367
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,559
You think you deserve that?

368
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:06,119
You're just a woman.

369
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,559
What gives you the right
to run the Lu family?

370
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,400
The Lu Group

371
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,960
will fall into my hands sooner or later.

372
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,440
You want the Lu Group that badly, huh?

373
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,960
I'll burn it and send it to you,
is that okay?

374
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,440
That's scary, Ms. Lu.

375
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,000
Now, put your gun down.

376
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,880
Gun down.

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,279
Siyan.

Siyan.

00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,039

00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,839
I'm Chuning.

382
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,279
Who are you?

383
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,839
You're indeed a good actress, Ms. Lu.

384
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,760
It's fine, anyway.

385
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,240
