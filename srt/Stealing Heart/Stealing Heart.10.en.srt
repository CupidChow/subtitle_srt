(Ruined and Broken)

00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,540
Alright.

4
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,519
We're safe now.

5
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,190
Let's go.

6
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,229
Mr. Siyan!

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,550
The fire's raging inside.
Going in is suicide.

8
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,309
Even if it costs my life,

9
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,470
I want to die with her.

10
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,429
Mr. Siyan!

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,990
Mr. Siyan!

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,509
(If I can't have him,)

13
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,309
(no one else can.)

14
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:25,870
You two can die as lovers, then.

15
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,149
Xiaorou.

16
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:44,710
Chuning.

17
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,709
Chuning!

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,710
Chuning!

19
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,630
Chuning.

20
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,390
Chuning.

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,429
Chuning!

22
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,390
It's okay.

23
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,390
I'm here to get you home.

24
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,709
Come on.

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,030
Let's go.

26
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,470
I'll put you down first.

27
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,781
This door can't be opened.

28
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,590
Are we going to die here?

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,590
Don't worry.

30
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,070
We'll definitely be fine.

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,870
Gao Yunfeng wouldn't leave himself
without a way out.

32
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:46,910
Follow the airflow

33
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,949
and we'll get to the exit.

34
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:53,790
Just hang in there. We'll make it out.

35
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:56,430
This should be it.

Let me down.

46
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,150
Do you care a lot about Shen Mochen?

47
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,509
I wouldn't want them to gossip about us.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,150
I'll get you home.

54
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,790

I was wrong!

60
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,549
You wench.

61
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,719
You think
you get to ride Lin Chuning's coattails

62
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,109
just because she became
the Lu family's heiress?

63
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,830
No, I don't.

64
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,470
Listen up.

65
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,429
All of this is just wishful thinking.

66
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,989
It's wishful thinking!

67
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,229
I...

68
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,429
Well,

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,549
what if I told Chuning

70
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,109
that to please me,

71
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,470
you lured those girls
from the Foundling Home

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,270
into the Wenrou Lounge?

73
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,710
Would she still think of you
as her best friend?

74
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,030
I never wanted to leave you.

75
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,229
I only stole the ledger for your sake.

76
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,150
The ledger wasn't burned?
Lin Chuning has it?

77
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,470
Exactly.

78
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,838
Chuning burned your Wenrou Lounge down.

79
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,669
Don't you want revenge?

80
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,869
If I stay close to her,

81
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,150
I can avenge you.

82
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,229
I'd even kill her for you.

83
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,669
You better not be lying to me.

84
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,749
Otherwise,

85
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,039
I'll plaster these photos of yours

86
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,030
all over the streets.

87
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,830
Gao Yunfeng!

88
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,470
You'll die a horrible death!

89
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,869
Perfect.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,390
With this ledger,

91
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,270
I can send Mr. Gao straight to prison.

92
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,479
He's got a long life ahead,

93
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,590
but it sure won't be a happy one.

94
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,679
Ms. Lin,

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,390
someone asked me to pass this to you.

96
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,869
(Bring the ledger to Garden Café
to exchange for Xiaorou.)

97
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,590
What's the matter?

98
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,539
Nothing.

99
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,130
(Bring the ledger to Garden Café
to exchange for Xiaorou.)

100
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,390
Kill Lin Chuning for me

101
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,830
and I'll give you what she offered you.

102
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,950
I want her dead even more than you do.

103
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,429
Chuning.

104
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,789
Xiaorou.

105
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,789
Give me the ledger.

106
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,789
You can't run
from the long arm of the law.

107
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,838
Even if you escape this time,

108
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,390
next time will be worse.

109
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,438
Cut the crap and hand over the ledger.
Or I'll kill her!

110
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,799
Chuning, don't give it to him!

111
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,150
Shut up!

112
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,930
(Ledger)

113
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,549
Get up.

114
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,270
Chuning...

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,679
Chuning...

116
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,629
Let her go!

117
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,359
Chuning!

118
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,629
Lin Chuning!

119
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,719
You ruined my Wenrou Lounge.

120
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,304
You ruined everything!

121
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,229
Today,

122
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,189
I'll send you to hell.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,950
Mr. Siyan!

124
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,950
You came.

125
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:15,989
Sister.

126
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,309
It's okay now.

127
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,629
"Sister"?

128
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,189
Actually,

129
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,830
you're the real heiress
of the Lu family.

130
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,989
That makes you

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,590
Siyan's biological sister.

132
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,749
After all that suffering

133
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,310
and everything I've been through,

134
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,670
now you're telling me
I'm the Lu family heiress?

135
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,149
That I'm Mr. Siyan's biological sister?

136
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,109
Well, what was all that pain for?

137
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,149
Xiaorou.

138
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,869
It's all in the past now.

139
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,479
From here on out,

140
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,389
you'll have a good life.

141
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,869
Easy for you to say.

142
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,670
You took my place.

143
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,798
You're in love with my brother.
How could you ever understand me?

144
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,590
Sister.

145
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,749
Don't say that.

146
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,790
Everything Chuning did
was for your sake.

147
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,590
Whether it was her initial plan
to avenge you

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,029
or her attempt to save you,

149
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,359
she did all this for you.

150
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,509
So you can't criticize her.

151
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,950
For my sake?

152
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,869
My life is all ruined and broken.

153
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,909
What's the use of her saving me?

154
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,070
I'm barely living.

155
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,269
Siyan.

156
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,950
Could you excuse yourself?

157
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,430
I need to have a word with Chuning.

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,710
Why can't I hear it too?

159
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,550
Siyan.

160
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,629
You should head back first.

161
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:52,270
Sure.

162
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,350
Take your time, then.

163
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,698
Xiaorou.

164
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,719
Don't worry.

165
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,070
As long as I'm here,

166
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,070
you won't be bullied after this.

167
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,269
Chuning.

168
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,710
Can you promise me one thing?

169
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,190
I'll try my best to help you

170
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,109
within my capability.

171
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,269
Can you

172
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,830
leave Lu Siyan forever?

173
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,229
And you call yourself my best friend?

174
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:51,590
I didn't even blame you
for taking over my identity.

175
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,830
Yet you can't even do me
this small favor.

176
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,950
Lin Chuning.

177
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,269
You're aware what I've been through.

178
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,430
And now Siyan's my brother.

179
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,470
My life's already miserable enough.

180
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,909
Chuning.

181
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,909
Could you make my life easier?

182
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,389
Please, Chuning.

183
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,790
Xiaorou.

184
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,509
Let's go home first.

185
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,109
We'll talk about this later.

186
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,430
(Soon,)

187
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,869
(all of this will be mine.)

188
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,999
(Lin Chuning.
It's time to pay what you owe me)

189
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,430
(with your life.)

190
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,149
Xiaorou.

191
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,550
Careful.

192
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,430
Chuning.

193
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,479
I accidentally broke your photo frame.

194
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,269
Chuning.

195
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,989
I have myself to blame.
I hurt my hand saving you.

196
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,590
Now I can't even hold a frame steady.

197
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,710
It doesn't matter.

198
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:23,629
By the way,

199
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,310
I told Mr. and Mrs. Lu

200
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,319
that your house caught fire,

201
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,029
so you're staying here for now.

202
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,109
Someone tried to kill me before.

203
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,398
I suspect

204
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,869
it was due to my identity
as the Lu family heiress.

205
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,190
Once I'm sure the danger's passed,
I'll return your identity to you.

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,830
Chuning.

207
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:48,509
Aren't you curious what I went through?

208
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,830
Xiaorou.

209
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,109
That's a painful memory for you.

210
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,518
If you're reluctant
to tell me about it, then...

211
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,670
I want to do so.

212
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,749
I want you to know
just how miserable I was.

213
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,749
Back then,

214
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,310
I wanted to buy you a birthday gift,

215
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,790
but I got tricked by Mr. Gao
into the Wenrou Lounge.

216
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,149
That's where I met Lu Siyan.

217
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,710
I thought we just had one night together.

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,670
I then got pregnant.

219
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,950
So I ran for my life.

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,470
I went to Foundling Home to find you.

221
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,070
But I didn't expect Mr. Gao
to follow me there.

222
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,389
Chuning!

223
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,109
Chuning!

224
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,869
Chuning, where are you?

225
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,749
Xiaorou.

226
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:40,390
I knew you'd come here.

227
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,269
- Trying to run again?
- Let me go!

228
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:48,638
Let me go!

229
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,149
You think
you can marry into the Lu family

230
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:53,990
just because
you're carrying Lu Siyan's child?

231
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,670
He was just toying with you.
That's all.

232
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,869
This is for abortion.

233
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,029
Lu Siyan made it for you himself.

234
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,109
Don't take that one-night stand
too seriously.

235
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,950
What a shame.

236
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,310
Xiaorou.

237
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,670
I'm actually trying to help you.

238
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,749
Lu Siyan told me to do all this.

239
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,149
Just blame him for it.

240
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,590
Xiaorou.

241
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,029
Xiaorou!

242
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,869
Xiaorou.

243
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,319
What's happened, Xiaorou?

244
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,710
You're scaring me!

245
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,950
Lu Siyan didn't want our child.

246
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,029
I was such a fool.

247
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,749
Avenge me.

248
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:58,909
Xiaorou.

249
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,590
Xiaorou!

250
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,719
Xiaorou!

251
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,070
Xiaorou!

252
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,389
- Xiaorou!
- Chuning.

253
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,799
Chuning.

254
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,075
Xiaorou.

255
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,950
Xiaorou.

256
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,670
What's the matter with her?

257
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,950
I have no idea.

258
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,509
It was all my fault.

259
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:18,070
I failed to protect her.

260
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,950
No, wait a second.

261
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,590
It was Lu Siyan.

262
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,670
Lu Siyan did this to her.

263
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,869
He did all this to Xiaorou!

264
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,670
It was all his fault.

265
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,790
Poor girl.

266
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,749
Chuning.

267
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,310
I watched both you and Xiaorou grow up.

268
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,670
So I'm basically your guardian.

269
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,149
Let me handle

270
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,070
Xiaorou's funeral arrangements.

271
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,830
Take care of the other girls.

272
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,190
Don't let them find out.
They're still so young.

273
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,439
They couldn't take such a heavy blow.

274
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,950
Don't tell them anything.

275
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,749
Xiaorou...

276
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,790
Xiaorou...

277
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,510
Lu Siyan.

278
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:12,750
I will kill you.

279
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,030
I'll avenge Xiaorou.

280
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,310
You thought

281
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,350
you were dead?

282
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,109
Too bad.

283
00:17:51,497 --> 00:17:53,270
You're still alive.

284
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,790
You devil.

285
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,149
Only disobedient ones
find this place hellish.

286
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,189
From now on, you'll only stay here.

287
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,990
Well,

288
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,350
you really should thank our child.

289
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,990
He died in your place.

290
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,278
Our child? What do you mean?

291
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,790
Since it's come to this point,

292
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:31,110
there's no need to keep lying to you.

293
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,350
That night,

294
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,479
the one you were with

295
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,510
wasn't Lu Siyan at all.

296
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,350
Lu Siyan never even touched you.

297
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:44,030
Well...

298
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,999
I was with you on that night.

299
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,670
And I was way better

300
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,030
than Lu Siyan.

301
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:02,030
Since our child died
to protect your pathetic life,

302
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,869
you'll stay with me from now on.

303
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,389
Considering how lucky you've been,

304
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,310
you'd bring me fortune.

305
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,790
I'm going to find Chuning.

306
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,990
Where is she?

307
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,047
Idiot.

308
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,389
Think about why you're even here.

309
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,798
It was your precious best friend

310
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,469
who handed you over to me.

311
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,790
It's been all my fault.

312
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,270
From now on, I'll listen to you.

313
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,310
Whatever you want you to do,

314
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,070
I will do it.

315
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,869
That's more like it.

316
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,389
Actually, I survived it.

317
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,189
Mr. Gao tricked you into burying me,

318
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,669
but he secretly brought me
back to Wenrou Lounge.

319
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,469
I had to suck up to him

320
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,230
and grovel like a slave.

321
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,270
I ended up becoming his toy.

322
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,698
Chuning.

323
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,479
You and Lu Siyan ruined my life

324
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,270
completely.

325
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,869
So, how could you still be together?

326
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,270
(Xiaorou's been through so much.)

327
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,949
(She can't take any more shocks.)

328
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,310
(For now,)

329
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,350
(I'll leave the Lu family.)

330
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,389
Chuning?

331
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,590
Chuning!

332
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,109
Siyan.

333
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,078
Lin Chuning is gone.

334
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,149
What do you mean?

335
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,429
She told me everything last night.

336
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,230
She only came to the Lu family
to get close to you so she could save me.

337
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,798
Now that I'm back,

338
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,310
she can finally run off with Mochen.

339
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,189
She would never say that.

340
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,758
She and Shen Mochen
had an arranged marriage from childhood.

341
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,109
Didn't you know?

342
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,318
Stop looking for her.

343
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,030
Even if you do, you won't find her.

344
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,230
I'll find her no matter what.

345
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,070
