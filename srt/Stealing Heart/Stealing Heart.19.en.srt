(Take Care, Sister)

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,359
What are you doing?

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,640
Shen Mochen,
don't you know you're trespassing?

5
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,959
Chuning,

6
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,200
step back.

7
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,280
He has smallpox.

8
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,879
Well? Don't just stand there!

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Take him into quarantine!

10
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,200
You know it was fake.

11
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,959
It was fake, but not anymore.

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,400
Thanks to you, Xiaorou.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,439
Do you know that the scented pouch came

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,359
from a corpse infected with smallpox?

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
Shen Mochen, you tricked me again.

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,480
Wait.

17
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,599
Mochen,

18
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,159
check your pocket.

19
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,599
Is the pouch there?

20
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,000
Mochen, I suggest you set an example

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,519
and go into isolation.

22
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,280
That pouch was a gift
from me to the Chief.

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,400
It didn't come from any corpse.

24
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,359
It looks like there was a mistake.

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,599
Withdraw your men.

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,920
Mistake?

27
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,640
If I said Gao Siyan has smallpox,

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,120
so he does!

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,280
He's beyond saving.

30
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,560
As Chief, I must protect the city.

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,800
He'll be executed by fire,
and anyone who comes in contact with him

32
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,240
will be burned too.

33
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,800
I didn't touch him.

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,719
I reported him

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,280
the moment I found out.

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,680
I never laid a hand on him.

37
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:28,920
Xiaorou,
doing this to protect yourself, huh?

38
00:02:29,386 --> 00:02:30,966
You went back to her

39
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,946
and expect me to die with you?

40
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,000
Chief Shen,

41
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,599
arrest these two adulterers.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,319
Shoot Gao Siyan

43
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,599
and burn the body!

44
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,000
Chuning.

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,199
Mochen,

46
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,120
don't bet on your life.

47
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,240
You know

48
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,759
I'll do anything

49
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,080
for Siyan.

50
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,400
I dare you to shoot.

51
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,560
Leave.

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,639
No, we'll leave together.

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,840
He won't let you off easy.

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,240
Go now.

55
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,840
Chuning.

56
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,639
Don't shoot.

57
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,599
Chuning,

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,599
do you still remember
the last time you held me hostage?

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,800
That time,

60
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,680
you wanted Lu Siyan dead.

61
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,400
This time,

62
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,560
you did it to save him.

63
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,879
What were you thinking?

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,120
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,719
You know that's not
what I wanted to hear.

66
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,286
Clearly, my words never mattered to you.

67
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,879
But that is all

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,560
I can say to you.

69
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,479
Chuning,

70
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,360
why do you like Lu Siyan that much?

71
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,199
You love him sincerely.

72
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,319
But what about him?

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,720
He abandoned you without hesitation.

74
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,199
He's the same as Xiaorou.

75
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,160
He knows you won't hurt me.

76
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,000
You're so stubborn.

77
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,879
As long as it involves Lu Siyan,

78
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,519
you lie to yourself every time.

79
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you really love him that much?

80
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:39,480
Let's go!

81
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,000
Even if you run to the ends
of the earth,

82
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,199
you'll never escape my grasp.

83
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,399
Are you okay?

84
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,040
This will hurt. Hang on.

85
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:19,640
It won't be safe here much longer.

86
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,319
Go.

87
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,839
I'm not leaving you again.

88
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:26,506
I've lost you once.

89
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,680
Even if it kills me, I'll stay.

90
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,040
Wait here. I'll go find medicine.

91
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,199
Lu Siyan!

92
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:03,920
Lu Siyan,

93
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:04,920
get up.

94
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,759
Are you okay?

95
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,120
Siyan.

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,519
How are you feeling?

97
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,593
I'll help you up.

98
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,666
Leave me.

99
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:16,040
How can I leave you?

100
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,360
Just leave.

101
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,759
I'm not leaving you here.

102
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,399

Mr. Gao,

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,319
it was a joyous occasion
for you to find your son.

125
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Yet, you kept it from me.

126
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,079
Why?

127
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,160
Are you afraid
I'd harm your precious son?

128
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,319
Chief Shen,

129
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,600
that's a bit unfair to say.

130
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,279
You see,

131
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,159
you're Lin Chuning's fiancé.

132
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,759
I didn't want you

133
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,080
to tell Mrs. Lu about it.

134
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,519
So, what now?

135
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,240
Mr. Gao,

136
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
I thought you no longer needed me

137
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,480
now that you've found your son.

138
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,320
Siyan may be capable.

139
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,759
But I still need to depend on you.

140
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,080
Chief Shen, I'm sure you're aware.

141
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,360
My lifelong dream

142
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,600
has been to turn Wenrou Lounge
into a paradise.

143
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,440
The renovations at Wenrou Lounge
are complete

144
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,039
and ready to open.

145
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,600
Siyan

146
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,440
did get

147
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,080
some money

148
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,000
from the Lu family.

149
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
But that's far from enough.

150
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,519
Now, Lin Chuning is protecting
the Foundling Home.

151
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,920
I have no money and no workers.

152
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,799
I'm in a bind.

153
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,120
I might have a solution.

154
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,240
Chief Shen,

155
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,639
then

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,080
I'm counting on you.

157
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,440
After your plane crash,

158
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,320
my parents were devastated.

159
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,639
You were everything to them.

160
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,799
Blood doesn't run deeper than love.

161
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,879
Mr. Gao is a criminal.

162
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,960
He built the Wenrou Lounge,

163
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,799
and we tore it down together.

164
00:10:12,506 --> 00:10:13,440
If you don't believe me,

165
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,400
you can check the old newspapers
for verification.

166
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,480
Everything is published.

167
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,399
Wait here.

168
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,639
Why did you follow me?

169
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,679
Lu Chuning!

170
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:19,560
Siyan,

171
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,200
this woman has repeatedly sabotaged us.

172
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,519
If she's not dealt with,

173
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,679
she'll ruin us all.

174
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:30,720
Father,

175
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,000
let me do it.

176
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,039
Siyan.

177
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,000
Siyan, are you out of your mind?

178
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
Come to your senses.

179
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,840
Kill her

180
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,080
to avenge your unborn son!

181
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,200
Lu Siyan,

182
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,559
calm down.

183
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,679
At least look at this before you decide.

184
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,519
Don't listen to her!

185
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,279
Siyan,

186
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,279
do you still remember this?

187
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,720
You gave it to me.

188
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,480
If you don't kill her now,

189
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,840
she'll come for you one day.

190
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,200

00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,360
So what?

227
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,720
Lin Chuning is already dead.

228
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,600
There's no going back for him.

229
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,960
Father.

230
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:35,973
Siyan,

231
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,406
I'll leave you two to talk.

232
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,559
I'll excuse myself.

233
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,879
It's my old condition again.

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,240
Is Lu Chuning

237
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,480
taken care of?

238
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,360
Yeah.

239
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,679
Everything's cleaned up.

Tomorrow,

241
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,200

242
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:06,640
With Lu Chuning gone,

243
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,840
we can claim the Lu family's business.

244
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,759

00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,799
What exactly is in that trunk of yours?

248
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,879
Oh, nothing.

249
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,759
Just old stuff

250
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,600
from Xianli Capital's renovation.

251
00:15:34,953 --> 00:15:35,520
Father,

252
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:38,240
you don't have to hide anything from me.

253
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,520
If I'm going to cover for you,

254
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,120
I need to know what's in it.

255
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,686
Right?

256
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,679
Fine, I'll stop asking.

257
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,640
I'll be going.

258
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,279
Siyan.

259
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,280
Siyan,

260
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,480
are you still mad about what happened?

261
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,440
I only did it because I was upset

262
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,240
you chose Lin Chuning.

263
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,279
I was worried about you.

264
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,559
Worried?

265
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,759
You reported me to the police
before anything happened.

266
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,360
I said that because...

267
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,879
It doesn't matter anymore.

268
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,639
Then what does?

269
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,480
Lu Chuning?

270
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,080
But you already killed her.

271
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,639
You killed the one person
who loved you the most

272
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
and the one you loved the most.

273
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,759
There was no baby.

274
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,640
That was a lie.

275
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,759
We were never married.

276
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,880
You never loved me.

277
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,200
It was always Lin Chuning.

278
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
It's too bad

279
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,079
I didn't get to watch you kill her
with my own eyes.

280
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,160
But it's fine.

281
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,599
Seeing you in pain

282
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,200
is enough for me.

283
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:31,846
You're mad.

284
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:33,040
What?

285
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,680
Do you want to hit me?

286
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,960
Lin Chuning is gone.

287
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,759
I am all you have now.

288
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,240
Siyan,

289
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,319
let's start over,

290
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,839
okay?

291
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
I love you, Siyan.

292
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:53,000
You're disgusting.

293
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,080
I never want to see you again.

294
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,273
So stay away from me.

295
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:00,440

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,620

297
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,040
(I pulled the trigger on the person
I loved most.)

298
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:24,640
(How can I ever face her again?)

299
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,559
You saw it.

300
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,640
I shot you.

301
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,440
I'm not the man I used to be.

I'm Gao Siyan now.

303
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,240
I was the fool.

304
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,359
I thought I could bring you back.

305
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,160
