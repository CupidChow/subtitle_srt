(I Will Always Fall For You)

3
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,520
I want you to see with your own eyes
that I sleep with

4
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,520
the man you love most.

5
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,159
You want some?

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,000
Lin Chuning.

7
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,879
Do you feel humiliated
kneeling at my feet?

8
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,760
Don't worry.

9
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,319
I'll make sure
you relive this humiliation every day.

10
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,239
Siyan.

11
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,439
You're here.

12
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,439
Have one.

13
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,680
No.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,840
Just have one.

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,400
I said no.

16
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,040
Fine.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,640
My feet are sore.

18
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,879
Massage them for me.

19
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,960
That's enough. I'll massage for you.

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,879
Chuning.

21
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,319
Shen Mochen.

22
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,879
Chuning, are you alright?

23
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,920
You know him?

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,159
Of course.

25
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,639
Whether at the dock
or at Lu Department Stores,

26
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,360
it was all you.

27
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,840
Why do this?

28
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,120
You love playing hero, huh?

29
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,680
Siyan.

30
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,960
This is Chief Shen.

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,919
He's also Chuning's fiancé.

32
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,000
Since Chief Shen is here,

33
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,960
let's do him a favor.

34
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,159
Sure.

35
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,400
Please keep your fiancée in check.

36
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Mrs. Lu.

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,280
Please keep your husband in check.

38
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,000
Siyan, what's wrong?

39
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:05,879
Siyan.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,560
Don't go.

41
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,199
Siyan.

42
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,400
Sister.

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,800
Siyan.

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,680
Is it you?

45
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,800
It's me.

46
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,280
Don't come closer.

47
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,039
Don't come closer.

48
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,719
You're not the Siyan I used to know.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,759
I'm still Siyan, Sister.

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,719
No matter what I said

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,039
or did,

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,240
it wasn't my intention.

53
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,599
I didn't want it to be like this.

54
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,360
Sister.

55
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,599
Only you can save me.

56
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,319
Come save me.

57
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:09,560
Pull me back.

58
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,800
Alright?

59
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:12,760
I want to go home.

60
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,199
I want to be with you again.

61
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,439
Alright?

62
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,000
Siyan.

63
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,319
Siyan.

64
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,560
Siyan!

65
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,680
Siyan.

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,120
Siyan!

67
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,560
Siyan.

68
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,360
Chuning.

69
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,959
Chuning.

70
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,079
You're already this unwell.

71
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,759
Why are you still thinking of him?

72
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,439
He lost his memory.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,439
He didn't mean to do this either.

74
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,439
Can you stop lying to yourself?

75
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,480
You're no longer

76
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,600
the Chuning I used to know.

77
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,439
She dared to love and hate.

78
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,079
She's decisive.

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,639
Look at you now.

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,360
You hurt yourself

81
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,040
for a man.

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,959
Do you really love him that much?

83
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,240
You're physically fine.

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Just a bit anemic.

85
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,279
You can be discharged
after two days of observation.

86
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:20,920
Thank you.

87
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:22,400
By the way,

88
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,160
I was forced fed saffron.

89
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,480
Is my body okay?

90
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,120
Are you sure?

91
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,920
You did ingest saffron,

92
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,399
but saffron
not only improves circulation,

93
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,920
it also calms the nerves.

94
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,680
That can't be.

95
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:36,880
I remember my stomach hurting badly.

96
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,720
You were on your period.

97
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
You probably have been feeling down

98
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,480
and haven't had a good rest lately.

99
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,680
The stomach pain
is probably due to menstruation.

100
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,560
(Since you wanted me dead,)

101
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,279
(why save me?)

102
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,000
(What should I do?)

103
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,040
(If he never remembers,)

104
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,240
- (Does that mean)
- Miss, would you like a bouquet?

105
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,319
(we are going to torment
each other forever?)

106
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,680
Sir, would you like a bouquet?

107
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,279
Miss, a bouquet?

108
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:25,600
Here.

109
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:27,800
I'll take all of these flowers.

110
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,759
Thank you, Miss.

111
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,439
(I've repeatedly abandoned you,)

112
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,439
(but you've always stayed loyal.)

113
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,279
(This time,)

114
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,920
(it's my turn to protect our love.)

115
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,519
(Siyan.)

116
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,000
(I won't give up on you.)

117
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,360
(Absolutely not.)

118
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,060
(Xianli Capital)

119
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,920
Ms. Lu.

120
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,680
My young master said

121
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,920
your relationship with him

122
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,319
is a life-and-death struggle.

123
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,480
If you meet again,

124
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,759
it will be in the business world.

125
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,519
I want to hear it from him.

126
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,279
(Why?)

127
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,600
(I hurt you,)

128
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
(yet you still come looking for me.)

129
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,839
(Could it
really be like what Xiaorou said?)

130
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,480
(You're just being unreasonable?)

131
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,079
Chuning.

132
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,000
You're really foolish.

133
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,319
Let's go.

134
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,639
I'm not leaving.

135
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,639
I want him to say it to my face.

136
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,279
Siyan.

137
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,040
You really do come and go
at my beck and call.

138
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:45,160
Shen Mochen.

139
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,240
See?

140
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,800
This is your woman.

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,360
With just a lift of my finger,

142
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,120
she comes running to me.

143
00:07:56,086 --> 00:07:56,880
Does it hurt?

144
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,199
I successfully got your attention,
didn't I?

145
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,199
Lu Siyan.

146
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,040
Even if you lost your memory,

147
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,959
human nature doesn't change.

148
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,280
In the end,

149
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,680
you still fall for the same trick.

150
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,720
Fool.

151
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,519
Yes.

152
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,079
I'm a fool.

153
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,839
And I'll stay that way to the end.

154
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,720
If Siyan hadn't been so kind,

155
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,360
you think I'd bother with you now?

156
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,639
Let me tell you.

157
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,079
I'll make you regain your memory.

158
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll bring the old Lu Siyan back.

159
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,560
He's not coming back.

160
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,200
He's completely gone.
He's never returning.

161
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,440
Sure.

162
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,799
Let's make a bet then.

163
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,120
Alright.

164
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,919
You're bound to lose.

165
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,120
Don't worry.

166
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,759
There's no way I'll lose.

167
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,879
Lu Siyan won't let me lose.

168
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,399
He'll come back.

169
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,080
Sure.

170
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,759
Let's wait and see.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,399
Chuning.

172
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,879
You still love him, don't you?

173
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,679
Even after all I've done for you,

174
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,039
he's still the only one you love.

175
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,440
Mochen.

176
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,799
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,360
Chuning.

178
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,120
I think I'm the one

179
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,360
at your beck and call.

180
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,799
You wanted to kill Lu Siyan,

181
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,440
so I helped you plan it.

182
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,200
You wanted him to give up,

183
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,759
so I played along with you.

184
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,800
You're my fiancée,

185
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,480
but you're getting tangled
with another man

186
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,159
in front of me.

187
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,960
Have you ever considered my feelings?

188
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,679
Even

189
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
just a little?

190
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,919
From now on,

191
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,200
I won't put you first anymore.

378
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,880
Two hours.

379
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,039
It's been too long.

380
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,559
He'll definitely become suspicious.

381
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,559
Take this back with you.

382
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,359
Tell him you went to
the temple to pray for him.

383
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,359
Siyan!

384
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,640
Siyan.

385
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,240
Siyan.

386
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,279
I begged every doctor in the city.

387
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,400
They rejected
when they heard it was smallpox.

388
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,799
I got you some medicine.

389
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,039
And this

390
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,720
is a sachet I asked for you.

391
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,200
Keep it close to you.

392
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,359
It will keep you safe.

393
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,000
Thank you.

394
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,000
Siyan.

395
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,359
Are you alright?

396
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,440
(Isn't it fake?)

397
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,119
(Why is he coughing up blood?)

398
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,640
Siyan.

399
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,960
I'll go brew your medicine.

400
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,960
Give me a moment.

401
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:37,599
Wait.

402
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,680
Xiaorou.

403
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,960
You saw everything.

404
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,000
Your wife doesn't love you that much.

405
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,319
She's keeping far away from you.

406
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,319
Enough.

407
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,079
She just went to brew the medicine.

408
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,799
How about this?

409
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,240
Give me the sachet.

410
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,799
I'll help you test her again.
