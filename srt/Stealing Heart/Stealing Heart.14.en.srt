(Love Finds Its Way)

3
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,420
Mother!

4
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,109
Mother?

5
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,990
A lowborn wretch
like you dares call me that?

6
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,390
I remember

7
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,309
she had a plum blossom-shaped birthmark

8
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,390
on her shoulder.

9
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,149
Do it!

10
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,430
Mother,

11
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,518
what is this?

12
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,080
Is this some kind of private punishment?

13
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,598
Siyan,

14
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,309
help me.

15
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,229
Xiaorou,

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,069
did you tamper with my car?

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,399
You wretched thing.

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,199
Siyan,

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,229
- she's not...
- Mother,

20
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,158
I saw what happened at the hospital.

21
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,869
Do you really want me to say it?

22
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,110
All done.

23
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,750
Thank you, Siyan.

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,279
Mother, what's all this about?

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,149
It's just a bit of blood.

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,309
Still, it's a strain on the body.

27
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,518
Once we're home,

28
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,630
I'll prepare something nourishing
for you.

29
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,470
Sure thing.

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,549
Take it.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,799
Miss,

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,870
please hold on to this.

33
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,310
All right.

34
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,069
What?

35
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,229
Siyan,

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,910
why don't you go rest in your room?

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,630
Mother,

38
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,509
is there something
I'm not allowed to hear?

39
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,949
Nothing.

40
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,150
It's just between the two of us.

41
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,030
Go on now.

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,829
All right then.

43
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,870
I'll leave you to it.

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,789
Everyone, leave us.

45
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,649
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

46
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,279
So that's why the midwife took
the secret to the grave.

47
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,038
It turns out to be such a secret.

48
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,119
Madam,

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,119
to secure your position
as lady of the house,

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,359
you fooled everyone

51
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,949
and swapped the truth.

52
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,710
I'm not your daughter.

53
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,590
And Lu Siyan is not your son either.

54
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,718
You swapped the blood at the hospital

55
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,030
to keep Lu Siyan's identity a secret,
didn't you?

56
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,549
Siyan is my son.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,318
I raised him for twenty years.

58
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,069
He is my son.

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,999
Since you're so protective of your son,

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,069
you should treat me better too.

61
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,630
From now on, I am your daughter.

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,470
If the truth about me were to get out,

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,269
Lu Siyan's identity
would be revealed as well.

64
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:44,598
Dead men tell no tales.

65
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,350
I'd like to see you try.

66
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,559
I already sent a letter to Mr. Lin
in advance.

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,030
If I die,

68
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,079
he will send the letter to the press.

69
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,119
Within four hours,

70
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,430
the whole city will know.

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,030
So

72
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,198
you'd better act like it.

73
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,109
You'd better show the world
we have a loving relationship.

74
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:08,669
Otherwise, if I go down,
I'm taking you with me.

75
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,550
Chuning.

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,270
Do you like it?

77
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,669
I planted these roses myself.

78
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,270
It's for you.

79
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,039
Do you feel better after seeing it?

80
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,590
Of course.

81
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,830
Let's reconcile.

82
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:55,950
All right.

83
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,989
What is it?

84
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,470
Miss Lin,

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,030
Miss Xiaorou asked me
to pass this to you.

86
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,198
(Chuning, meet me at the warehouse
on the west outskirts.)

87
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,518
(Let's put an end to this.)

88
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,758
(Otherwise, you'll never see)

89
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,999
(your little friends
from the Foundling Home again.)

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,109
What does she want?

91
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,910
Oh, nothing.

92
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,070
She just wished me a speedy recovery.

93
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,510
You finally came.

94
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,799
Did you come alone?

95
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,309
Where are the children?

96
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,229
Them?

97
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,950
I handed them over to Mr. Gao.

98
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,950
That slap

99
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,270
was for them.

100
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,510
And this one

101
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,150
is to settle the score between us.

102
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,549
Had enough?

103
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,470
Then it's my turn.

104
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,390
What are you all staring at?

105
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,989
Back off!

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,789
Did you think I'm stupid enough

107
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,350
to come here alone?

108
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,950
Did you really think I'd believe that?

109
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,479
She told me to meet her at the warehouse

110
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,559
on the west outskirts.

111
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,789
I'll go instead.

112
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,109
Don't go.

113
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,830
How about this?

114
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,239
You'll wait outside.

115
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,878
If I'm not out in ten minutes,

116
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,309
you can come and get me.

117
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,429
You only have five minutes.

118
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,470
Okay.

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,919
Of course, I know you're not stupid.

120
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,429
I've got people lying in wait too.

121
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,830
Chuning,

122
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,629
how did we end up like this?

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,710
I never wanted this.

124
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,999
I was trampled by many,

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,198
but why do you get to stand tall?

126
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,950
I just want you to fall with me.

127
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,030
Then we'll all be equal again.

128
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,398
In a while,

129
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,799
don't resist

130
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,030
or fight back.

131
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,749
It'll end soon.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,150
Very quickly.

133
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,599
Stay back!

134
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,669
Go away!

135
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,638
Don't come closer

136
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,278
or I'll kill her!

137
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,830
Then kill me.

138
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,719
If I die, I'll take you down with me.

139
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,350
Don't worry about me. Get her!

140
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,429
Back off!

141
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,390
Let me go!

142
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,950
Come on.

143
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,670
Let me go!

144
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,319
No!

145
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,570
Let's have fun.

146
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,670
Stop!

147
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,389
Siyan.

148
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,790
Siyan!

149
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,149
Siyan.

150
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,629
I'm... I'm your sister.

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,830
You should count yourself lucky
that you are.

152
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,710
If you weren't,
I'd have killed you right here.

153
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,670
I already sent Si to get those girls.

154
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,510
Does it hurt?

155
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,869
I'm fine.

156
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,509
I never thought

157
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,239
she would go this far.

158
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,950
She's still alive only
because she's my sister.

159
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,599
It's all right now.

160
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,269
You're not hurt, are you?

161
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,278
Of course not.

162
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,670
They're not my match.

163
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,509
I didn't know you had it in you, Siyan.

164
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,518
Then I should do something too

165
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,319
to make the Lu family accept me sooner.

166
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,149
I'll work hard
to build our future together.

167
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,470
I don't care what you do.

168
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,199
Just promise me
you won't get hurt again.

169
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,109
I'll protect you from now on.

170
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,350
With you by my side,
how could I ever get hurt?

171
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,109
I'll marry you.

172
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,909
I'll wait for that day to come.

173
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,730
(Lu Residence)

174
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,830
I already told you two
that you are not to be together!

175
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,359
Mother,

176
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,719
we're not asking for permission.

177
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,719
We're here to tell you

178
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,389
that we're already together.

179
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,350
Siyan,

180
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,550
do you want to drive me to my grave?

181
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,479
That's not what I want.

182
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,550
You don't get to decide my career

183
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,350
or who I'm with.

184
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,558
It's different this time.

185
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,509
There's a reason I can't speak of.

186
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,909
Mrs. Lu,

187
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,319
I've never once tried
to steal Siyan from you.

188
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,470
You don't have to see me as a threat.

189
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,749
I'll love him

190
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,398
just like you do.

191
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,518
No! You can't love him.

192
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,550
Why not? Because...

193
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,038
Because...

194
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:12,599
Because you're siblings. By blood.

195
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,710
Mrs. Lu,

196
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,239
you'd rather lie
about that just to stop me...

197
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,909
Chuning,

198
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,149
you are my daughter.

199
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,638
Mother,

200
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,319
how can you just make up a lie
like that to split us up?

201
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,999
You already made one mistake.

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,550
Xiaorou is my sister.

203
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,839
Yes,

204
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,678
Xiaorou.

205
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,278
You can ask Xiaorou.

206
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,479
I acknowledged her

207
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,839
because she faked Chuning's birthmark.

208
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,749
Chuning,

209
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,229
is there a plum-blossom-shaped birthmark
on your shoulder?

210
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,670
It's not too late to walk away
from this.

211
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,029
Don't make one mistake after another.

212
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,350
Chuning, tell me it's not true.

213
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,638
They were wrong the last time.

214
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,869
It could be wrong again this time.
Am I right?

215
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,229
You can't be my sister.

216
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,989
The birthmark is fake.

217
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,079
This birthmark

218
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,719
is painted on, right?

219
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,439
You painted it, right?

220
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,119
Say something!

221
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,869
You're not my sister.

222
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,758
You're not my sister, right?

223
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,199
Tell me you're not my sister!

224
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,158
You're not her.

225
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,599
You can't be my sister!

226
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,389
You're not my sister!

227
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,550
Answer me.

228
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,310
Siyan.

229
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,269
Tell me you're not.

230
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,950
Just tell me that you're not my sister!

231
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,830
Say it!

232
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,310
I never believed

233
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,430
in fate.

234
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,989
But now, maybe I do.

235
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,359
All this time,

236
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,190
I kept saying I was your sister.

237
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,310
Now,

238
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,670
I've truly become her.

239
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,389
Maybe this is the price I have to pay.

240
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,229
Retribution.

241
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,678
If...

242
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,149
If there is such a thing,

243
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,029
then I deserve it.

244
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,590
Chuning.

245
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:06,950
Siyan.

246
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,869
Chuning,

247
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,350
do you know

248
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,269
I really thought...

249
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,470
I believed we had a future.

250
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,629
Then why did I have to lose you?

251
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,359
This isn't what I wanted.

252
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,910
- I never wanted this.
- Siyan,

253
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,430
pretend I'm not your sister

254
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,509
just for today.

255
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,629
Let's just...

256
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,869
It's you?

257
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,399
Go away!

258
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,518
Lu Siyan,

259
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,790
I love you.

260
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,798
You have no idea how happy I was

261
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,199
when I found out we weren't siblings.

262
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,158
Siyan,

263
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,389
I don't care
about being the Lu family heiress.

264
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,359
I'd rather live on the streets
than lose you.

265
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,190
Please, Siyan.

266
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,558
Please

267
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,670
be with me, Siyan.

268
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,119
But you're my sister.

269
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,989
Don't call me that.

270
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,229
Lin Chuning is your real sister.

271
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,790
Siyan,

272
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,399
the two of you can never be together.

273
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,078
Not in this lifetime.

274
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,230
Shut up.

275
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,770
Just shut up!

276
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,949
Siyan,

277
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,949
I'll do anything for you.

278
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,030
Just stay with me.

279
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,750
Siyan.

280
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,790
Help! Miss Chuning is dead!

281
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,189
You should have
just let me have Lu Siyan.

282
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,270
So you always knew

283
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,469
Si Yan and I

284
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,510
are related by blood?

285
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,310
Yeah.

286
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,669
I want to see both of you suffer,

287
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,510
crushed by despair,

288
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,149
and live a fate worse than death.

289
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,070
Xiaorou,

290
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,909
how did you become like this?

291
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,790
You're asking me why?

292
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,909
Lin Chuning,

293
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,669
you knew I had feelings for Lu Siyan.

294
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,669
But you still went after him.

295
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,189
Gao Yunfeng couldn't have you,

296
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,790
so he came after me and violated me.

297
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:58,358
While I was drowning in misery
at Wenrou Lounge,

298
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,070
what were you doing?

299
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,750
You were whispering sweet nothings
to Lu Siyan.

300
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,109
So, don't I have every right
to hate you?

301
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,429
Your tragedy

302
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,030
was never my doing.

303
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,070
We were both victims. You know that.

304
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,629
I was punishing the one
who started all this.

305
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,949
But you?

306
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,909
You made yourself the villain

307
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,598
just so you could feel better.

308
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,310
Yet, you turned around
and blamed me for everything

309
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,909
and act like the whole world owes you.

310
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,510
Xiaorou,

311
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,310
no one owes you anything.

312
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,469
You're paying for your own choices.

313
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,709
No need to get so worked up.

314
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,030
Are you starting to feel
your whole body go numb?

315
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,078
I know your senses are sharp.

316
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,879
That's why I added a colorless,
tasteless poison.

317
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,629
It won't kill you.

318
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,709
But it'll paralyze you.

319
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,270
Do you think
you can turn your life around if I die?

320
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,189
Of course.

321
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:34,469
Once you're gone, I'll take your place,

322
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,278
your man, and

323
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:36,959
your status.

324
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,030
Everything you had will all be mine.

325
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,270
Everything will start over.

326
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,429
Stop struggling.

327
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,869
The more you fight it,

328
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,230
the worse it gets.

329
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,030
They'll think

330
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,278
you took your life

331
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:12,070
over forbidden love.

332
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,909
No one will suspect me.
