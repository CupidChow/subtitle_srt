(Separation)

3
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,150
Chuning.

4
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,950
You've been asleep for days.

5
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,509
Wake up soon.

6
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,029
Chuning.

7
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,270
It's alright.

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,110
If you don't wake up,

9
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,910
I'll come find you.

10
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:13,150
Wake up, okay?

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,030
Siyan.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,190
You haven't eaten or drunk for days.

13
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,750
If she knew,

14
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,270
she would be heartbroken.

15
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,318
(Lu Residence)

16
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,839
Siyan, I was wrong.

17
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,079
I was just confused for a moment.

18
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,430
I did all this because I love you.

19
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,470
Wretched wench.

20
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,870
How dare you harm my daughter?

21
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,989
Siyan, send her to the police.

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,710
Mrs. Lu.

23
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,229
You're abandoning me too?

24
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,750
You really want to
send me to the police?

25
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,669
Please don't send me there.

26
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,269
Siyan.

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,910
You tricked Lin Chuning into that car.

28
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,679
Who told you
to tamper with Lu Siyan's car?

29
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,910
Or she
wouldn't have gotten into the car.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,989
We agreed to cooperate.

31
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,350
But if you hurt the person I love,

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,549
I'll return it double.

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,549
Your job
is to find Chuning's whereabouts.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,878
Mochen.

35
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,190
You'll get Chuning,
and I'll get Lu Siyan.

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,989
After taking over
the Lu family's fortune,

37
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,030
we'll be the biggest winners.

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,430
(Xiaorou is already in cahoots
with Shen Mochen.)

39
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,758
(With him around,)

40
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,069
(Xiaorou will show up sooner or later.)

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,150
(Then she'll hurt Chuning even more.)

42
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,870
Chuning.

43
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,438
I'm begging you.

44
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,318
For the sake of our sisterhood,

45
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,989
you won't abandon me.

46
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,069
Chuning.

47
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,598
I admit everything was my fault.

48
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,590
Chuning.

49
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,350
You're real siblings.

50
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,310
Help me talk to Siyan.

51
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,430
Chuning.

52
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,590
Have you said enough?

53
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,430
(If I don't play along with her,)

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,669
(this wretched wench
will expose that Siyan isn't my son.)

55
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,959
Siyan.

56
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,630
Didn't I say

57
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,229
I'd kill you if you touched her again?

58
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,878
Kill me.

59
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,310
You won't dare.

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,190
You won't send me to the police either.

61
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,030
Once I'm out,

62
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,270
what will happen to Chuning?

63
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,599
Siyan.

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,159
It's okay if you don't love me.

65
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,150
Just let me stay by your side.

66
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,429
You're siblings. I'm helping you.

67
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,629
Siyan.

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,229
Siyan.

69
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,950
I only want to help you.

70
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,789
Just be with me,

71
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,189
and I won't touch Chuning again.

72
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,109
I'm happy
as long as I can stay with you.

73
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,438
Siyan.

74
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,669
You two can never be together.

75
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,390
Chuning.

76
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,910
Mochen.

77
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,878
Don't worry.

78
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,510
I'm not here to take you away.

79
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,150
Xiaorou told me everything.

80
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,789
You must be hurting.

81
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,910
Since when are you two so close?

82
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,910
We both have unreciprocated love.

83
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,549
I guess we sympathize with each other.

84
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,270
Chuning.

85
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,599
The best way

86
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,270
to forget a relationship

87
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,910
is to start a new one.

88
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,030
Marry me.

89
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,030
But I don't love you.

90
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,070
That's alright.

91
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,549
Feelings can be developed over time.

92
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,799
Mochen.

93
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,470
I used to think love didn't matter.

94
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,078
Then, I met Siyan

95
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,910
and realized

96
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,270
love is the purest thing in life.

97
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,470
It shouldn't be tainted by impurities.

98
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,229
It's alright.

99
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,869
I don't mind you using me.

100
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,830
Thank you.

101
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,549
Chuning.

102
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,109
We've got time ahead of us.

103
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,309
I'll go now.

104
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,030
Chuning.

105
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,470
Siyan has accepted me.

106
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,070
Impossible.

107
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,910
Stop sowing discord.

108
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,390
Siyan told me

109
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,950
that you're his birth sister.

110
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,789
You two can't be together.

111
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,229
Chuning.

112
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,629
I just want to help you both.

113
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,789
I don't want to see you two miserable.

114
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,638
So

115
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,869
I marrying Siyan is the best solution.

116
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,150
But maybe it's better this way.

117
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,789
You're his sister,

118
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,679
so you're my sister too.

119
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,989
Didn't you always want that?

120
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,229
Get lost.

121
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,919
I hate being called "sister".

122
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,869
Look at me now.

123
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,309
Are you happy?

124
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,950
Are you satisfied?

125
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,989
Siyan.

126
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,510
Siyan.

127
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,150
I just saw Chief Shen find Chuning.

128
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,278
The chef here is French.

129
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,158
Their steak is the most authentic.

130
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,509
I've long wanted to bring you here.

131
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,350
This way, sir.

132
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:03,302
What we ordered last time was good.

133
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,699
We'll order this then.

134
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,830
Wow, what a coincidence.

135
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,430
Mind if we join you?

136
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,070
Please enjoy.

137
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,558
Chuning.

138
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,319
Now that I'm with Siyan,

139
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,518
I hope

140
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,389
you'll let go of the past.

141
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,830
Chuning can't drink much.

142
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,790
I'll drink for her.

143
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,710
Chief Shen and Chuning are so in love.

144
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,350
We should be able
to drink at your wedding soon.

145
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,199
He's just a fiancé.

146
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,599
Whether it lasts

147
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,310
is unknown.

148
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,710
Chuning already said yes.

149
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,590
We'll be married very soon.

150
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,310
Chuning.

151
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,070
Congratulations.

152
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,909
I'm not worthy

153
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,350
of your congratulations.

154
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,550
Do you want me to congratulate you?

155
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,670
Do you want to?

156
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,029
I don't want to.

157
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,590
Who are you to say no?

158
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,350
I'm talking to my sister.

159
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,629
Stay out of it.

160
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,229
It's a rare happy occasion.

161
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,350
Cheer up.

162
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,029
Let's eat.

163
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,918
Now you understand

164
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,878
why

165
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,149
I couldn't wait to get rid of you

166
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,319
since you entered

167
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,190
the Lu family.

168
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,310
I saw how Siyan looked at you

169
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,550
at the birthday party.

170
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,389
I feared he'd fall for you.

171
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,149
I feared this would happen.

172
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,710
That's why

173
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,149
I could accept Xiaorou as my daughter,

174
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,670
but I had to destroy you.

175
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,350
So,

176
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,590
was it because I was stillborn

177
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,909
or because

178
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,350
I was a girl

179
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,029
when you abandoned me?

180
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,839
I understand now.

181
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,470
Chuning, just leave.

182
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,989
You're abandoning me again?

183
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,918
I'm not abandoning you.

184
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,830
I'm sending you to school.

185
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,199
It's better

186
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,239
than you two
suffering like this all day.

187
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,839
I'm afraid you'll end up

188
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,710
making a huge mistake if this goes on.

189
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,389
How is that not abandonment?

190
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,149
Every single time,
