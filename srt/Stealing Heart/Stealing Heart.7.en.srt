(Happy Birthday)

3
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,890
(Xiaorou's birth date matches
mine exactly.)

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,230
(And Lin Chuning hid the record
under our family's ancestral tablets.)

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,910
(There's definitely
something suspicious.)

6
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,199
Mr. Siyan, I've asked around the whole city.

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,118
Only this shopkeeper

8
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,870
has seen a pendant like this.

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,709
This way, please.

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,149
Mister,

11
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:12,039
can you take a closer look?

12
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,150
Is this the same pendant you saw?

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,999
A young lady did come in

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,509
with something very similar to this one

15
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:25,430
to pawn it.

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,309
She left before we could agree
on a price.

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,378
Could you look again?

18
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,190
Was it her?

19
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:41,598
Yes,

20
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,750
that's her.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,470
Can you take a closer look again if it's her

22
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,789
who tried to pawn this kind of pendant?

23
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,069
Yes.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,270
Thank you.

25
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,509
This way, please.

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,430
You're here.

27
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,999
Xiaorou is still alive.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,750
But I can't make any reckless moves yet.

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,910
It's not easy for either of us
to get into Wenrou Lounge again.

30
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,669
We'll need to plan carefully.

31
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,350
As for Xiaorou,

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,470
I'll definitely save her.

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,350
If my uncle wants the family fortune,
I'll give it to him.

34
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,710
After all,

35
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,310
Xiaorou is my birth sister.

36
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,918
When did you find out?

37
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,910
I hate that I found out too late.

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,949
Why did you lie to me?

39
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:56,799
Do you know how much pain

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,630
this sibling relationship caused me?

41
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:00,710
Every second has been torment.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,470
Why didn't you tell me the truth? Why?

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,999
Lu Siyan.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,109
To be honest,

45
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,478
whether it's me

46
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,710
or Xiaorou,

47
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,438
having another sister in your life

48
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,870
doesn't have to be a bad thing.

49
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,710
But have you ever considered

50
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,829
that you and Lu Yijing are siblings too?

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,470
Isn't Lu Yijing getting along
with you just fine too?

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,870
Lin Chuning,

53
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,918
do you even understand what I'm saying?

54
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,430
Of course I do.

55
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,710
But right now, I have to save Xiaorou.

56
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,598
Once she's safe,

57
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,229
I'll return her rightful place to her

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,389
and will disappear from your sight.

59
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,389
She's my sister.

60
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,310
I'll save her myself.

61
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,269
He sure has quite the temper.

62
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:50,610
(Lu Residence)

63
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,590
Beat him!

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,389
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu!

65
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:56,079
(Lu Siyan always means what he says.)

66
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,310
(If he promised to save Xiaorou,
he'll do it.)

67
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,799
(Then I'll go talk to Mr. and Mrs. Lu)

68
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,959
(to come clean)

69
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,269
- (and leave.)
- Drag him out!

70
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,549
I hate being lied to!

71
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,839
(It looks like)

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,350
(it is still not the right time.)

73
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,150
Stop right there.

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,989
Where are you going?

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,629
So, are you skipping work
at the department store

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,830
to have fun somewhere again?

77
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,318
You spend all day chasing pleasure
instead of doing anything productive.

78
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,219
Someone swapped things out right
under your nose, and you didn't even notice.

79
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:37,350
Pulling a fast one?

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,287
Who?

81
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,470
Father,

82
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,599
I made an appointment
with a tea farmer this afternoon.

83
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,999
But I'm worried I won't be able

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,350
to handle things alone.

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,390
I'd like Siyan to come with me.

86
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,590
What are you waiting for?
Go with your sister!

87
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,590
My pleasure, Chuning.

88
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,830
Let's go, Siyan.

89
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,656
Siyan

90
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:15,510
is one of our school's top students.

91
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,549
Test flights

92
00:05:16,697 --> 00:05:17,950
are part of the job.

93
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,510
Miss Lin, please wait just a bit longer.

94
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:22,830
Okay.

95
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,390

you can keep flying forever.)

who are you waiting for?

113
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,669

we should return together too.

118
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,318
If our parents get suspicious,

119
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,549
I'm not taking the blame.

120
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,030
Walk with me, then.

121
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:56,870
Then keep me company as I train.

122
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,510
You saw how strict your father is.

123
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,710
Hey.

124
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,958
Lu Siyan,

125
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,309
I'm talking to you.

126
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,270
Fine.

127
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,919
If you ignore me again,

128
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,270
I'll go rat you out.

129
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,590
Are you threatening me?

130
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,590
Did it work?

131
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,070
Fine.

132
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,470
Then go ahead and tell my father

133
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,749
I'm studying aviation.

134
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,669
I doubt he'd do anything to me.

135
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,549
But you?

136
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:37,030
If he finds out

137
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,229
you've been pretending
to be his daughter,

138
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,070
what do you think he'll do?

139
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,630
Instead of threatening me,

140
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:48,981
why not figure out

141
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:50,150
how to please me?

142
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,039
What a coincidence.

143
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,398
I was just thinking the same thing.

144
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,309
Smart people know when to adapt.

145
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:01,030
Now,

146
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,830
why don't you start
by calling me "brother?"

147
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,470
Brother.

148
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:14,870
Good girl.

149
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,070
Wait for me outside.

150
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,549
I want to get changed.

151
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,429
Need help?

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,189
No need.

153
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,229
I'm thirsty.

154
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,710
Get me a glass of water.

155
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,270
Okay.

156
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,749
Here's your water.

157
00:08:56,725 --> 00:08:58,315
Get me a towel too.

158
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,630
Go.

159
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,670
Okay.

160
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:06,630
What...

161
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:11,812
What's with that attitude?

162
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,909
Wipe.

163
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:26,687
I said, wipe.

164
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,258
What, not happy?

165
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,618
Is it not that obvious?

166
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:36,675
Is that how you treat your brother?

167
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,561
My shoulders are sore.

168
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,790
Give me a massage.

169
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,670
I've had it. Go ahead. Tell your father.

170
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,909
I'd rather your father beat me to death
than get worked to death by you.

171
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,509
You said it, not me.

172
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,350
Okay.

173
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:00,550
- Oh, don't be petty. I'll do it.
- This side.

174
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,790
Put more pressure on it.

175
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,350
More pressure.

176
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,944
- How about this?
- You...
