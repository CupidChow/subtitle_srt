Siyan!

00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,616
Siyan, no!

5
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:56,984
You must live on.

6
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,008
Siyan!

7
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:04,920
I love you.

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,840
Chuning...

00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,752
Chuning!

Chuning!

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,359
Chuning!

00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,904
Chuning!

13
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,064
Chuning!

14
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,440
Chuning!

15
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,688
Chuning, don't do this to me!

16
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:56,720
You can't do this to me!

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,480
We'll get you to the hospital right now.

18
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,360
Chuning...

19
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,359
Chuning!

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,760
Chuning, you can't leave me...

21
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:02,904
Please...

22
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,040
Chuning...

23
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,759

Chuning...

25
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
Chuning, no...

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,120
Siyan...

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,719
I'm afraid...

28
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:25,528
I'll have

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,879
to break our promise...

30
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,759
I can't stay with you anymore...

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,720
- No...
- I can't stay with you

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,240
- No...
- for the rest of our lives...

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,680
- But it's okay...
- No...

34
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,960
Remember my birthmark.

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,040
We'll get you to a doctor...

36
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,840
- Find me again.
- I'll find you a doctor...

37
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,360
Didn't...

38
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,360
Didn't see that coming, did you,

39
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,639
Lu Siyan?

Is it a boy or a girl?

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,040
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

80
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,624
It's a girl.

81
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,216
Let me hold her.

82
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,072
Look at her tiny nose.

Look at how bright her eyes are.

85
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,759
She looks just like you.

00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,040

96
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,839
Sit down.

97
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,688
Father. Mother.

98
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,880
What's the surprise?

99
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,040
What's with all the mystery?

100
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,800
When I count to three,
you can open your eyes.

00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:14,879
Two.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,480

104
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,480
- Happy birthday

- to my dearest daughter!

109
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:31,879
Mother.

110
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,279
Today,

111
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,360
my dear daughter turns 20.

112
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,519
Such a special day

113
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,160
deserves a proper celebration.

114
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:38,959
That's right.

115
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,040
Well, Father,

116
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,520
the wish I just made was for you

117
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,879
to hand over Lu Department Stores to me
as soon as possible.

118
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,839
As a matter of fact,

119
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,199
that actually is

120
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,759
your surprise gift.

121
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,240
You take over

122
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,079
tomorrow.

123
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,960
I knew it!

124
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,439
I have the best parents in the world.

125
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,439
Don't worry, Father.

126
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,439
I'll turn Lu Department Stores

127
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,399
into

128
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,399
the biggest and best
department store in the world.

129
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,560
I believe in you.

130
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,720
Girls are

131
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,959
just as good as boys.

132
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,199
My daughter is

133
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,312
a modern-day Mulan!

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,720
That's right.

135
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,544
Our daughter is the best.

136
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:17,080
Of course.

137
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,399
Let's eat the cake.

138
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:18,920
All right.

139
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,160
Let's cut the cake.

140
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,180
(Lu Group)

141
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,680
Take down those red curtains.

142
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm hosting a fashion show,

143
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
not a wedding.

144
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,399
The guest menu is final.
No more changes.

145
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,799
Tell the restaurant

146
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,639
the food must arrive at 7:15 sharp.

147
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,720
Double check with the florist.

148
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,879
The flowers must be
freshly picked that day.

149
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,992
- Mr. Siyan, what about this watch?
- I want morning dew on every flower.

150
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:50,856
They have a good collection.

151
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,240
The performers

152
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,920
must all be around 168cm.

153
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
- They carry good products here.
- Tell Chief Shen

154
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,400
- Is there anything else we need?
- the entire city will show up.

155
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,800
Mr. Siyan?

156
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,160
He should send more officers
if he doesn't want a stampede.

157
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,559
Have the accountant
at the Foundling Home

158
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,759
disburse this month's living expenses.

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,120
I'll just take that one.

160
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,560
Oh, come on.

161
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,120
As if you're really here for the watch.

162
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,832
I'll have them send it over later.

163
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,720
That should be all for now.

164
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:15,736
Get busy.

165
00:09:15,864 --> 00:09:16,600
All right.

166
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,152
Stop staring.

167
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,264
Ms. Lu's engaged.

168
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:44,840
Engaged?

169
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:45,919
To who?

170
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,872
No idea.

171
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:53,400
But it's not you for sure.

172
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:10,919
Chief,

173
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,799
we were already off duty,
but they put us back on patrol.

174
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,440
It's fine.

175
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,960
If you want to rise above the rest,

176
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,639
you have to work harder
than everyone else.

177
00:10:19,696 --> 00:10:21,200
Do you know who I am?

178
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,559
Don't touch me!

179
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,176
Come have a drink with us.

180
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,240
Don't touch me! Let go!

181
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,720
- This lady said to let go.
- The police are here.

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,840
Did you not hear her?

183
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,600
Stay out of this!

184
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,400
That's right.

185
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,279
I'm getting involved,

186
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,536
whether you like it or not.

187
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,736
Police.

188
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,640
Beat it.

189
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,624
Let's get out of here!

190
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,559
Are you all right, Miss?

191
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,720
I'm fine.

192
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,912
Thanks for what you did today.

193
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,560
If there's nothing else,
I'll be on my way.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,639
At least tell me your name.

195
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,039
It's Shen Mochen.

196
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,120
Shen Mochen.

197
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,000
Ms. Lu.

198
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,559
Hi.

199
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,968
I'm Gao Siyan.

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,792
Hi.

201
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,968
Ah!

202
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,039
Be careful.

203
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,120
You're quite skilled.

204
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,840
Toned muscles too.

205
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,608
I just happen to need a bodyguard.

206
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,000
Would you like the job?

207
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,039
I'm sorry.

208
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,920
I'm a pilot.

209
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,440
I'm afraid I can't take you up on that.

210
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,039
You're turning me down?

211
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,639
Fine.

212
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,576
I'll remember you.

213
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,919
Take this, Xiaorou.

214
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,360
I can't accept this.

215
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
We haven't even used up
your last donation.

216
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,528
Don't refuse me.

217
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,400
The children are still growing.

218
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,279
Besides,

219
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,120
you're the matron of Foundling Home.

220
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,840
You have to take care of them.

221
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,559
And you have
to take care of yourself too.

222
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,320
If you wear yourself out,

223
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,639
I'll be very upset.

224
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,320
Thanks to you,

225
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,680
the Foundling Home has made it
through all these years.

226
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,648
I'm going to work hard,
earn a lot of money,

227
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:48,936
and look out for every girl
who needs help.

228
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,968
How does that sound?

229
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,679
I thank you on behalf of all the kids.

230
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,559
Don't mention it.

231
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,440
Xiaorou...

232
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,720
What's the matter?

233
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,960
I think

234
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,399
I've fallen in love.

235
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,360
With who?

236
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:09,720
Do I know him?

237
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,800
I don't even know his name yet.

238
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,024
You don't even know who he is
and you're already in love?

239
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,639
Love at first sight?

240
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,200
Don't tease me.

241
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,080
I don't know how to explain it.

242
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,759
It just feels like

243
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,519
I knew him

244
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,799
in another life.

245
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,960
But aren't you already engaged?

246
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,639
Oh, this?

247
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,600
My parents arranged this marriage
when I was a child.

248
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,039
I've never even met the guy.

249
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,919
It doesn't count.

250
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,360
Still, it was decided by your parents

251
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,080
and a matchmaker.

252
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,759
You're right.

253
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,879
I'll find the matchmaker tomorrow

254
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,480
and arrange to meet that guy.

255
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,919
You're going to marry him?

256
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,520
No.

257
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,080
I'm going to break off the engagement.

258
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:07,360
I'm sorry, Miss.

259
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,000
I already have someone else in my heart,

260
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,360
so...

261
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,640
Who's the woman in your heart?

262
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,480
You're my fiancée?

263
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,312
You haven't answered my question.

264
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,759
Who's the woman you love?

265
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,680
She's...

266
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,799
Never mind.

267
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,159
I don't care who you held
in your heart before.

268
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,480
From now on,

269
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:35,879
your heart is only for me.

270
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:38,800
You're so overbearing.

271
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That's exactly who I am.

272
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,000
In fact, I initially came here

273
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,080
to break off the engagement.

274
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,320
And now?

275
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,919
Now,

276
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,520
I'm starting to think

277
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,919
I can maybe agree, reluctantly.

278
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,208
Reluctantly?

279
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,368
I don't want a reluctant yes.

280
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,488
I want a clear, confident yes.

281
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:01,840
Gao Siyan.

282
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,320
Feelings can't be forced.

283
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,759
Let me ask you one thing.

284
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,000
Do you like me?

285
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,120
That's rather forward of you.

286
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:15,600
I...

287
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,416
I...

288
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,420
(Pilot Handbook)

289
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,920
That was before...

290
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,888
I...

291
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,928
And you said you don't like me?

292
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,256
You even hid a photo of me.

293
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,992
Trying to play hard to get?

294
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,032
You can play games all you want,

295
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
but I like
to keep things straightforward.

296
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,519
Besides,

297
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,040
we're already engaged.

298
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,200
There's no escape for you.

♪Boasting how painful
their love once was♪

300
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,680
Go ahead, keep running.

301
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,320
Stay back!

302
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,840
Weren't you acting all tough just now?

303
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,152
Get up!

304
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,279
Get him!

(Lu Department Stores)

306
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,840
Thanks for helping me just now.

307
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:49,960
No problem.

308
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,360
It'll happen again.

309
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,600
What do you mean?

310
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,759
Will I run into danger again?

311
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,400
I mean,

312
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,080
I'll protect you again next time.

313
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Like I said, I like you.

314
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,160
Even if you don't like me now, you will.

315
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,480
You're really pushy.

316
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,240
Look.

317
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
That's a beautiful dress.

318
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,519
You'd look amazing

319
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:13,720
in it.

320
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:18,920
You're such a smooth talker.

321
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,079
That shop looks nice.
Let's check it out.

322
00:18:21,144 --> 00:18:21,560
Sure.

323
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,880
Aren't they beautiful?

324
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,039
Easy there.

325
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,640
Carry me.

326
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,000
Hop on.

327
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,680
Hold on tight.

328
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,240
How about I carry you

329
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:41,960
around the entire city?

330
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:43,880
Giddy-up!

331
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,304
Mother.

332
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,400
Look at how much fun they're having.

333
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:51,960
Yes.

334
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,440
That little girl looks just like you
when you were younger.

335
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,960
- Hello, Miss.
- Hello, Miss.

336
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

337
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,680
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

338
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,920
Mother,

339
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,519
thank you and Siyan

340
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,119
- Come catch me!
- for making me so happy.

341
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
- Slow down!
- Silly girl.

342
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,360
- Wait for me!
- It's only right that I treat you well.

343
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,880
I hope every child in the world

344
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,359
can be as happy

345
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,160
as you.

346
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,599
(Please bless me)

347
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,016
(with love)

348
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,568
(and a lifelong happy marriage)

349
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:46,760
(with the one I love.)

350
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,039
Aren't you going to make a wish?

351
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,039
Of course, I am.

352
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,880
I wish

353
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,200
I could win over Gao Siyan soon

354
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,079
and make things official between us.

355
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,352
Shh!

356
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,480
It won't come true
if you say it out loud.

357
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,759
So that means

358
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,960
you want my wish to come true too?

359
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,440
Yes.

360
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,920
What did you say?

361
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,208
I said, of course.

362
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,464
But I don't want us

363
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,520
to get married
just because of the engagement.

364
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,559
What do you mean?

365
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,720
We can break off the engagement first.

366
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Then the two of us...

367
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,559
Gao Siyan!

368
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,000
Are you even a man?

369
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,359
I...

370
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,079
Fine.

371
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,359
You want to break the engagement?

372
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,039
Then I'll just marry someone else.

373
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,559
(I'll have Shen Mochen deal with you.)

374
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,519
Ms. Lu Chuning,

375
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,720
will you...

376
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:05,680
She will not!

377
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,519
I won't let you marry someone else.

378
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,279
I know.

379
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,759
I'm a pilot.

380
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,799
I can't always be by your side.

381
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,119
I don't need a playmate.

382
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,640
My missions

383
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,480
might be dangerous.

384
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,400
I'm stronger

385
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,559
than you think.

386
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,319
I'm not good

387
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,119
with sweet talk.

388
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:48,720
Too bad.

389
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,319
You'll have to learn.

390
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,720
I like hearing it.

391
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,640
I haven't made it rich yet.

392
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,480
That's okay.

393
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,264
I'm rich.

394
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,720
Gao Siyan,

395
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,279
do you love me?

396
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,079
Of course, I do.

397
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,928
Then will you marry me?

398
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,240
Of course, I will.

399
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,200
What are we waiting for then?

400
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:37,519
Gao Siyan,

401
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,296
are you crashing this wedding?

402
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,192
What if I am?

403
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,392
Gao Siyan.

404
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,780
(Engagement Certificate)

405
00:22:58,616 --> 00:22:59,288
Please.

406
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:02,584
What's the meaning of this?

407
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,440
I...

408
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:05,319
In that case,

409
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,599
your wedding ceremony
will officially begin now.

410

your lawfully wedded wife?

414
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,200
I do.

415
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,480
Ms. Lu Chuning,

419
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,344
I do.
