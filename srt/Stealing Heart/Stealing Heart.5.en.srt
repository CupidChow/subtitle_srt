00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,870
you posed as Lu Siyan

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,910
to make Lin Chuning hate him.

73
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,359
But not only did she spare him,

74
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,430
she exposed Wenrou Lounge.

75
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,319

00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:02,790
I...

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,150
Let me tell you.

79
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,830
I want to kill Lu Siyan

80
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,319
so that Lin Chuning

81
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,439
loses hope.

82
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,639
Bringing her here

83
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,670
was to be with her forever.

84
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,830
But you

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,630
were driven by lust

86
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,990
and tried to rape her.

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,270
Didn't you?

88
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,510
I admit.

89
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,470
But now

90
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,790
isn't the time to pin the blame.

91
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:24,270
We...

92
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,959
One Lu Siyan

93
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,359
is trouble enough.

94
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,959
Now there's

95
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,199
Lin Chuning.

96
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,350
We

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,039
should be thinking about how to
stop them from teaming up.

98
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,310
Think

99
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,110
about how to take them down.

100
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,950

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,390

104
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,790
No.

105
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,270
No.

106
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,030
Remember this pain.

107
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,350
This is all from Lin Chuning.

108
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,910
Your best friend, Lin Chuning,

109
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,479
has now become

110
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,910
the Lu family's heiress.

111
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,270
She could've easily buy your freedom,

112
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,910
but she didn't.

113
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,710
Why is that?

114
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:46,559
It's because

115
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,630
she thinks you're filthy.

116
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,530
She's afraid you'd seduce her brother,

117
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:53,150
Lu Siyan.

118
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,479
So,

119
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,190
now you know

120
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,639
who truly cares about you

121
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,830
and who you should hate.

122
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:06,790
Yes.

123
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,959
I've already asked the boatman

124
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,550
to send word to Lu Residence.

125
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,150

126
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,670

128
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,292
stop causing trouble.

129
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,510

Don't get hurt.

I'm not hurt.

137
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,319

But now I've changed my mind.

153
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,870
I want

154
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,830

If the names match, that one dies.

159
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,630
If not,

160
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,510
both of you die.

161

162
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,510

163
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,679

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,200
How would Father know
that he killed you?

165
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,619
- Two.
- If you want to keep a secret,

166
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:19,750
don't create one.

167
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,999
Think the police won't catch him?

168
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:22,599
This may be out of Mochen's hands.

169
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,359
One.

170
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,350
Uncle, wait.

171
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,670
I choose you.

172
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,830
I ran into Mr. Gao
on my way to tip off the Lu family.

173
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,110
I lied that you two are severely hurt
and tricked him onto the boat alone.

174
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,270
Thank you.

175
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,439
But we still need you to find a way
to send us back to Lu Residence.

176
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,510
I'll reward you handsomely.

177
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,470
Sure.

178
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,639
Even though we're not related by blood,

179
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,230
he's still my uncle.

180
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,664
He actually wanted to kill me.

181
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,027
When facing profit,

182
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:54,670
family means nothing.

183
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:57,630
If you and I both died

184
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,190
and Jing got married,

185
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,350
Lu Group's fortune

186
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,150
would eventually be his.

187
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,559
But

188
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,830
confronting head-on like this
won't work.

189
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,310
How will we know if we don't try?

190
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,590
Don't rush.

191
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,070
I have a good idea.

192
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,310
This is your idea?

193
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,670
We're surrounded by Mr. Gao's men.

194
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,550
Do we

195
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,670
have another choice?

196
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,470
Fine.

197
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,470
I'll work with you.

198
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:06,753
Hey, Mr. Gao.

199
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:08,630
Coming. No rush.

200
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,110
As long as Mr. Gao lives,

201
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,910
the kids at Foundling Home

202
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,510
will never be safe.

203
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,910
To you,

204
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,310
you're all those kids' sisters,

205
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,470
not just mine.

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,190
Will you help me?

207
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,590
Focus on playing.

208
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,970
(Lu Residence)

209
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,350
I only kept you for Father's sake.

210
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,039
How dare you try to kill my heir?

211
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,910
I'm innocent!

212
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,990
Siyan.

213
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,719
I've always treated you well.

214
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,399
You can't falsely accuse

215
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,630
and slander me!

216
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,310
Father.

217
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,590
You can decide.

218
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,550
Someone, come.

219
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,510
Father.

220
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,870
Siyan and I met thugs last night.

221
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,350
Uncle saved us.

222
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,919
We haven't had a chance

223
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,550
to thank him properly.

224
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,670
Exactly.

225
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,599
Siyan must have mistaken me for a thug.

226
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,190
Well...

227
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,630
I meant well, but it backfired.

228
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,110
Father.

229
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,679
We can't let a misunderstanding

230
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,390
let Uncle down.

231
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,030
Chuning.

232
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,239
Are you claiming your brother
falsely accused your uncle?

233
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,590
Of course not.

234
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,790
I think it was too dark last night

235
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,630
that Siyan saw it wrong.

236
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,470
Yes.

237
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,470
It was too dark.

238
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,350
I saw it wrong.

239
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:04,047
Happy now?

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,119
Yunfeng.

241
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,787
Stop doing things
that cause misunderstanding.

242
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:17,750
Chuning.

243
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,430
Untie your uncle.

244
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,030
Thanks for perceiving the truth.

245
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,030
You suffered.

246
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,070
Chuning.

247
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,110
This

248
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,990
is all thanks to you.

249
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,550
You got me justice.

250
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:44,350
Don't mention it.

251
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,279
Oh.

252
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,830
I was truly wronged.

253
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,030
(If it weren't for what almost happened
to Lu Siyan today,)

254
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:31,270
(Mr. Lu and Mrs. Lu would never fall out
with Mr. Gao for me.)

255
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,190
(Let alone for Xiaorou,
whom they've never met.)

256
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,990
(Now,)

257
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,270
(I have no choice
but to involve Lu Siyan.)

258
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,519
- One.
- One.

259
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,319
- Two.
- Two.

260
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,279
- Three.
- Three.

261
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,296
- Not joining?
- Four.

262
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:50,273
Five.

263
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:52,870
- Come on.
- Come on.

264
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,230
- Take it off.
- Come on.

265
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,819
- Come on.
- Take it off.

266
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:57,859
(Gu Xiangming, Lu Siyan's classmate)
Everyone's doing it. You must too.

267
00:14:57,859 --> 00:14:59,061
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

268
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:00,647
Come on.

269
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,950
Oh.

270
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,110
Come on.

271
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,839
- Come on.
- Come on.

272
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,519
One.

273
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,159
- Two.

276
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,079
- Five.
- Five.

277
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,639
- Six.
- Six.

278
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,239
- Seven.
- Seven.

279
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,999
- Eight.
- Eight.

280
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,861
- Nine.
- Nine.

281
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:13,719
- Ten.
- Ten.

282
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,427
- 11.
- 11.

283
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:15,359
- 12.
- 12.

284
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,039
- 13.
- 13.

285
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,741
- 14.
- 14.

286
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:17,679
- 15.
- 15.

287
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,519
- 16.
- 16.

288
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,630
- 17.
- 17.

289
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,418
Why stop counting?

290
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,430
Ahem.

291
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,319
I didn't mean to follow you.

292
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,999
I just wanted to explain

293
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,830
why I switched sides this afternoon.

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,172
Don't look.

295
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:00,990
I want to look.

296
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,790
Why can't I look?

297
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,830
Oh, I really didn't expect

298
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,524
Mr. Siyan went out late at night

299
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:14,590
just to do something like this.

300
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,630
We're just doing physical training.

301
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,919
That's what I meant too.

302
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,870
What?

303
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,270
What did you think I meant?

304
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,350
Nothing.

305
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,710
I'll stop messing around.

306
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,870
This is a flight academy.

307
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,550
You want to be a pilot?

308
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,230
Yes.

309
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,790
So

310
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,270
you never cared for business.

311
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:40,390
You've acted like a spoiled heir

312
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,350
just to disappoint Father and Mother.

313
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,270
You wanted to marry me

314
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,879
just to annoy them

315
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,070
so that they'd kick you
out of the Lu family.

316
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,959
Then,

317
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,279
you could focus on learning to fly.

318
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,258
Is that so?

319
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:55,110
Yes.

320
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,910
Kid.

321
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,750
It's a pity you're not an actor.

322
00:17:01,891 --> 00:17:03,487
Now you know everything.

323
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,950
Can you keep my secret?

324
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,519
Call me Sister.

325
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,990
And I'll think about it.

326
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,550
Lin Chuning, is that necessary?

327
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,190
I'll tell Father and Mother then.

328
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,359
Later,

329
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,919
if they lock you in your room,

330
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,656
don't go begging me.

331
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:25,799
♪Waiting endlessly♪

332
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,204
♪You're the moon above the treetops♪

333
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:29,058
Sister.

334
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,750
Mm.

335
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,670
Good boy.

336
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,835
Keep it a secret.

337
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,364
I said I'll think about it.

338
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:38,599
♪My longing haunts my heart♪

339
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,239
Lin Chuning, you're cheating.

340
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,190
I'm not.

341
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,919
Lin Chuning.

342
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,199
Call me Sister.

343
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,176
Lin Chuning.

344
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:46,770
(Lu Residence)

345
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,990
Have you thought it through?

346
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,630
Come down and talk.

347
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:19,870
Speak.

348
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,390
That's your attitude?

349
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:25,667
So have you decided?

350
00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:26,710
Sister.

351
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,710
I'll keep your secret

352
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,510
if you promise me something.

353
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,510
What is it?

354
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,119
Xiaorou was forced to have an abortion

355
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,910
and died in my arms.

356
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,599
Mr. Gao once promised

357
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,110
to give her a proper burial.

358
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,519
I went to see it,

359
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,399
but the grave

360
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,630
was completely empty.

361
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,110
Xiaorou

362
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,390
is alive.

363
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,750
You guessed right.

364
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,879
So I need your help rescuing Xiaorou

365
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,670
and bringing Mr. Gao to justice.

366
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,390
Deal.

367
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,470
Nice.

368
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,150
Pinky swear.

369
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,279
You're aware of danger,

370
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,510
but your reflexes need work.

371
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,959
What are you doing?

372
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,870
Lu Residence is full of danger.

373
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:42,473
I can't always be by your side.

374
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,658
You need self-defense skills.

375
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,950
Sure.

376
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:49,132
Sure? Break free.

377
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,479
See?

378
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,990
Men are far stronger.

379
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,030
When you lack strength,

380
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,470
try something else.

381
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,292
Come on.

382
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,070
Same move.

383
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,081
Grab me.

384
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,470
If someone grabs your hands from behind,

385
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,750
try using your head to hit him first.

386
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:11,510
When he feels pain,

387
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:13,338
twist the wrist

388
00:20:13,674 --> 00:20:15,035
and turn around.

389
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,990
Ms. Chuning.

390
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:28,460
Master asked me to inform you

391
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,559
that tomorrow is perfect
for acknowledging your ancestry.

392
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,430
Got it.

393
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,039
(Lu Ancestral Shrine)

394
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,359
Today, Lu's daughter

395
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,830
returns to her bloodline.

396
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,639
Strong fire banishes disaster,

397
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,510
and fortune shall follow.

398
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,110
Step forward.

399
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:19,761
(Lu Siyan.)

400
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:21,790
(From this day on,)

401
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:25,150
(she can only be your older sister.)

402
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:48,498
Why did the doors close?

403
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,030
Mr. Lu, this isn't a good omen.

404
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,830
Today may not be the right day.

405
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,590
Let's postpone it.

406
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,830
I think it's a good omen.

407
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,679
Our ancestors

408
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,330
must have seen Sister's return,

409
00:22:08,331 --> 00:22:10,439
so they shut
the ancestral shrine's doors

410
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,470
to keep our descendants
from drifting far from home.

411
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,110
It's a blessing.

412
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,830
Continue.

413
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,150
Kneel.

414
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,950
First kowtow.

415
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,790
Second kowtow.

416
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,270
Third kowtow.

417
00:22:52,794 --> 00:22:54,390
Offer the incense.
