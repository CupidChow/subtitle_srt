(You Owe Me An Explanation)

4
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,200
Chuning.

5
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,920
You lied to me.

6
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,000
You approached Lu Siyan back then

7
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,040
for the Lu family's wealth.

8
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,240
But now you've fallen for him.

9
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,560
He's your biological brother.

10
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,400
Getting intimate with your own brother?

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,320
Don't you find that disgusting?

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,640
I was just putting on an act with him.

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,600
Lu Siyan

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,760
is still a useful pawn.

15
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,600
Chuning.

16
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,497
For you,

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,680
I'd go up against the whole world.

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:42,880
Chuning.

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,360
Don't ever betray me.

20
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:07,440
I bought this for you.

21
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,200
Thanks.

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,240
I've handed
all the dividends to Mr. Gao.

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,520
He's quite pleased.

24
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,200
He probably won't
mistreat Xiaorou for a while.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,960
Your father already said

26
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,760
he'll host a banquet
at the end of the month

27
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,520
to announce my identity.

28
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,960
I plan to go to Wenrou Lounge

29
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
that day

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,680
to rescue Xiaorou.

31
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,120
But

32
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
before that,

33
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,240
I need to drive Mr. Gao

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,040
out of the Lu Residence first.

35
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:38,948
Okay.

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,240
Let's go.

37
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,560
Father-in-law,

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I brought this book back

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,240
for you from abroad.

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,080
Have a read.

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,320
Sure.

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,280
Father. Mother.

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,000
Siyan. Chuning.

44
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,160
Your brother-in-law and I

45
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,240
were discussing the engagement.

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,560
We'll all be family soon,

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,520
visit each other more often.

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,640
Father-in-law,

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,360
I'll get straight to the point.

50
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
I want to marry Chuning.

51
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
You already have Jing.
Is that not enough?

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,720
What now?

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,080
You want

54
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,640
both daughters
of the Lu family to serve one man?

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Father-in-law,

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,800
what you promised me was
the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

57
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,960
The current eldest daughter

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,240
is Lu Chuning.

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,640
Father-in-law,

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,680
you're a well-known businessman,

61
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,251
and I now hold

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,800
the position of Chief of Police.

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
If we fall out,

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,280
it will get ugly.

65
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,960
Don't try to pull rank on me here.

66
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,240
Don't forget how you

67
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,280
even became the Chief.

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,480
Welcome, Chief Shen!

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,160
- Welcome, Chief Shen!
- Welcome, Chief Shen!

70
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:16,760
If I could get you that title,

71
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,662
I can take it away.

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,960
Father-in-law,

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,320
your son leans
on his identity as the Lu heir,

74
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,280
yet he's worthless.

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,600
But me?

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,880
I'm different.

77
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,960
I take my duties seriously.

78
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
With my current standing,

79
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,840
going against me

80
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,640
might not

81
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,640
be the wisest choice.

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,400
You...

83
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,920
Let's go.

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,080
You can't marry her.

85
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,920
You're already engaged to Jing.

86
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,680
Everyone in town knows about it.

87
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,360
For a woman,

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,080
reputation is everything.

89
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,440
Both daughters
of the Lu family are cherished gems.

90
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,320
You want them
to become fodder for street gossip?

91
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,440
Uncle, it's rare for you
to sound reasonable.

92
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,920
It's actually quite unsettling.

93
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,680
Chuning!

94
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,200
Show some respect to your uncle!

95
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,960
What kind of uncle am I?

96
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,520
I share no blood with the Lu family.

97
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,120
To be honest,

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,160
Chuning and I

99
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,760
have already been

100
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,920
physically intimate.

101
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:18,788
That's nonsense!

102
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,640
I should've shot you back then.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,440
Wait.

104
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,120
Say that again. What did you just say?

105
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,080
What did you say?

106
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,400
Brother...

107
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,360
If you're angry, then take it out on me.

108
00:05:33,794 --> 00:05:34,640
Back then,

109
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,720
when Chuning confessed
her feelings to me,

110
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:38,520
I couldn't help myself.

111
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,560
But at the time,

112
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,520
I honestly didn't know
she was your daughter.

113
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,040
So it just happened before I knew it.

114
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,480
But don't worry.

115
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,640
For the rest of Chuning's life,

116
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,560
I'll take care of her.

117
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,440
I'll support her.

118
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:52,880
Chuning...

119
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,040
What's going on here?

120
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,000
Father...

121
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,440
Do you believe him?

122
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,720
Master.

123
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,560
Back home, we have a method

124
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,400
to test whether a woman's still pure.

125
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,680
But I'm afraid

126
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,120
it may wrong Ms. Lin.

127
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,680
Asking an innocent girl
to prove her innocence?

128
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,600
You have no right to demand that.

129
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,120
After what she's done,

130
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,600
what is there to be ashamed of?

131
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,640
Siyan,

132
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,080
this concerns your sister's reputation.

133
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,040
If you care about her,

134
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,480
you shouldn't stop us.

135
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,080
Alright.

136
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,000
Father,

137
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,720
I'll go with them.

138
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,440
Ms. Lin,

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll need a drop of your blood.

140
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,800
Siyan,

141
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,920
come with me.

142
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,400
This way, Ms. Lin.

143
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:41,828
Brother.

144
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:43,091
Let me explain.

145
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,000
Please don't blame me.

146
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,080
You know me.

147
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,040
This is just how I am.

148
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,360
I really didn't know
she was your daughter.

149
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,360
So I just...

150
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,680
Shut up!

151
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,520
This is Ms. Lin's blood.

152
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,880
We drop it on a budding yellow flower.

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,840
If the flower stays fresh,
she's still pure.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,160
If it wilts,

155
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,320
then she's lost her chastity.

156
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,960
Father...

157
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,080
Don't call me that!

158
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,040
I have no daughter as shameless as you.

159
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,960
Father-in-law,

160
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,160
I'm willing to marry Chuning.

161
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,840
Are you serious?

162
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,200
You don't mind her past?

163
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:45,360
I, Shen Mochen, swear here and now,

164
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,200
that I will marry her with full honor,

165
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
with full bridal attire,

166
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,600
with drums and gongs,

167
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,480
and bring Chuning home.

168
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,760
Still not saying anything?

169
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,320
If you stay silent now,

170
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,160
your future might be decided.

171
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,120
Uncle...

172
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,040
You said

173
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
you've been intimate with me.

174
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,040
Then tell me,

175
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
is the birthmark on my waist

176
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,680
on the left

177
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,640
or the right?

178
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,120
Birthmark?

179
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,720
It's

180
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,120
on the left.

181
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,200
Wrong.

182
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,560
It's on the right.

183
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,320
Madam Wang saw it just now
when she drew blood.

184
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,040
Didn't you?

185
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,280
Tell them.

186
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,120
That's right.

187
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:24,240
It's on the right.

188
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:25,880
Wrong again.

189
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,320
I don't have a birthmark
on my waist at all.

190
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,920
Why did you lie?

191
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,800
Just now...

192
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,680
I...

193
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,520
I didn't notice while drawing the blood.

194
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,560
Chuning.

195
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,400
Even if your uncle
didn't take your chastity,

196
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,040
you're still not pure.

197
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,320
That is clear.

198
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,960
A woman must respect herself.

199
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,520
From now on,
live a good life with Mochen.

200
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,400
Don't ever degrade yourself again.

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,120
Well said, Mother.

202
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,280
A girl must respect and love herself.

203
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
But that blood just now was mine.

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,960
I may be a flirt,

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
but I'm still untouched.

206
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,280
Father,

207
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,240
you must stand up for me.

208
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,000
I feared someone
would tamper with things,

209
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,440
so I switched the syringe.

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,360
But look at the flower.

211
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
It still wilted.

212
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,480
This proves

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
someone is deliberately

214
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,840
trying to frame me for losing my purity

215
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,120
to ruin my reputation!

216
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,480
That's unforgivable, Father.

217
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,760
Madam Wang,

218
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,320
what really happened?

219
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,040
Speak.

220
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:27,862
Master...

221
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,560
It was me.

222
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,000
I lost my judgment.

223
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:30,840
Yes.

224
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,880
I took

225
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,120
a bribe from Mr. Gao.

226
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:33,920
You...

227
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,960
That's nonsense!

228
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,440
When did I ever bribe you?

229
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,240
Brother, hear me out.

230
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,800
Shut up!

231
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Don't call me brother.

232
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,880
From this day forward,

233
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,000
you are no longer part of the Lu family.

234
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,600
Get out!

235
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,720
And you too!

236
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,880
Both of you, leave the Lu residence!

237
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,520
Out!

238
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,320
Don't you think

239
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,320
the air in the Lu Residence

240
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,200
feels clearer
ever since Mr. Gao was thrown out?

241
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
To me,

242
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,520
the air here

243
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,640
has been different for a while.

244
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,040
(From the moment
you stepped into this house,)

245
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,400
(my life has felt alive again.)

246
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,720
Thank you.

247
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,080
No need.

248
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:45,400
That's what I'm here for

249
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
anyway.

250
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,080
You heard that?

251
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,200
Heard what?

252
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,800
Then, explain it.

253
00:10:57,514 --> 00:10:58,040
Forget it.

254
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,840
There's nothing to explain.

255
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,400
Either way,

256
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,400
I'm still going to marry Shen Mochen.

257
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:08,440
What if I say I object?

258
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,651
And what position

259
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,560
are you in to disapprove?

260
00:11:15,497 --> 00:11:16,720
I just don't want to.

261
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,480
You...

262
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,240
Shh.

263
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,280
Do you really mean to be

264
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,200
so cold and heartless?

265
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,440
Do you really enjoy

266
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,960
being two-faced

267
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,240
in front of everyone?

268
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,960
That's how

269
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,280
you fooled Shen Mochen, right?

270
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,640
Fine, I admit it.

271
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,760
I did fall for you.

272
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,440
But so what?

273
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,200
I need to save Xiaorou.

274
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,840
I need to run the Foundling Home.

275
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,200
I still have to stay alert
around your parents.

276
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,960
Love is a luxury to me.

277
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,560
I don't have the time

278
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,360
or the heart for it.

(Lin Chuning,)

295
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,240
(I won't let you marry another man.)

296
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,080
Lin Chuning,

297
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,280
what's the meaning of this money?

298
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,720
You're apologizing?

299
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,480
You had the nerve
to kick me out of the family.

300
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,960
Don't come trying
to make peace with cash now!

301
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,560
Do you think

302
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,880
I'd even talk to you

303
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,480
if it weren't to save Xiaorou?

304
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,440
You should be thanking me on your knees

305
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,200
for the fact that I didn't end you.

306
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,400
Back to business.

307
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,000
Kicking you out of the Lu family

308
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,360
was just a cover

309
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,080
for secretly moving assets.

310
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,720
During this time,

311
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,080
you'd better take good care of Xiaorou.

312
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,320
Otherwise,

313
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,520
I won't let you off easy.

314
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,320
As long as you cooperate,

315
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,520
this cage you're in

316
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,160
will be replaced
with a golden one soon enough.

317
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,760
Which looks better?

318
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,840
Both.

319
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,400
Wrap up everything
my fiancée picked out.

320
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,080
Ms. Lin.

321
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,640
The young master gave orders.

322
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,600
If you or Chief Shen come to shop for
wedding gifts or dowries, we won't sell.

323
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,080
It's alright.

324
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,760
Let's look elsewhere.

325
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,640
This one's nice.

326
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,400
Take it out so I can have a look.

327
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,200
No need.

328
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,480
Wrap that up for me.

329
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,360
The young master said

330
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,320
as long as it's you,

331
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,148
we're not selling.

332
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,560
It's fine.

333
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,720
Let's look elsewhere.

334
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,160
Not for sale?

335
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,120
I'll pay myself.

336
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,280
The young master instructed.

337
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,560
If you're shopping with Chief Shen,

338
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,280
we're not selling, period.

339
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:11,880
Chuning.

340
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:12,920
It's okay.

341
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,840
The Lu Department Stores
aren't the only ones in town.

342
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,800
We'll go somewhere else.

343
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,051
There are plenty of department stores.

344
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,880
But there's only one Lin Chuning.

345
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,080
He's not good enough for you.

346
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,200
Everything in Lu Department Stores

347
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,440
belongs to her.

348
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,160
From now on, whatever she wants,

349
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,880
send it straight to her room.

350
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,520
Brother,

351
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,160
I'm about to marry your sister.

352
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,800
She really dotes on you.

353
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,600
So for today,

354
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,440
I'll let it slide.

355
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,240
What happens between me and my sister

356
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
is none of your business.

357
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,920
You haven't married her yet.

358
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,880
Stay out of our relationship.

359
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Well, well, Mr. Siyan.

360
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,360
Where have you been lately?

361
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,360
You haven't come looking for me.

362
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,240
I missed you so much.

363
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,560
Can't you see I'm talking?

364
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,760
Take it back.

365
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,840
I don't need this.

366
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,920
Chuning.

367
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,360
Mochen,

368
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,520
let's go.

369
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,160
Excuse us.

370
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,240
Thank you.

371
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,760
Mr. Siyan...

372
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,160
Get lost.

373
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,160
Leave!

374
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,200
Chuning.

375
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,480
What happened that day

376
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,600
was not on purpose.

377
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,320
But I never expected

378
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,880
you'd still agree to get engaged to me.

379
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,280
Mochen,

380
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,680
you and Mr. Gao

381
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,360
were in on it together,

382
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,240
weren't you?

383
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Jing is my father's precious daughter.

384
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,120
If you broke off the engagement,

385
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,160
if it were me,

386
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,960
my father would never agree.

387
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,240
But if I lost my purity,

388
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,680
and it was with Mr. Gao,

389
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,440
then to save face,

390
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,640
my father would have to give me up.

391
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,720
So in the end,

392
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,560
you three abandoned me

393
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,120
all over again.

394
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,040
Chuning,

395
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,600
I would never abandon you.

396
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,960
I'm the only one who won't leave you.

397
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,640
The Lu family,

398
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,600
and even Lu Siyan,

399
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,840
can't be trusted.

400
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,680
But I am different.

401
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,240
No matter what you have done,

402
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,520
or what you want to do,

403
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,320
I will always

404
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,560
stand by you.

405
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,160
It's getting dark.

406
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,560
Prepare for the engagement banquet.

407
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:35,960
Alright.

408
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,760
I'm really looking forward to that day.

409
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,200
You like eavesdropping that much?

410
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,680
Seems to me

411
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:56,840
you don't trust him all that much.

412
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,280
I don't trust him.

413
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,040
I don't trust you either.

414
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,548
I don't think you really doubt me.

415
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,360
At first,

416
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,640
you planned to use the banquet
as cover to rescue Xiaorou.

417
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,200
But after the drama
with Shen Mochen and your uncle,

418
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,360
the banquet got canceled.

419
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,000
So you just went along with the change

420
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,280
and asked Shen Mochen
for an engagement party.

421
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,280
Am I right?

422
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,520
Correct.

423
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,440
But that doesn't mean

424
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,040
I will marry you.

425
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,280
Before this,

426
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,800
you wanted to use my lowly status

427
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,320
to rebel against your parents.

428
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,160
You always knew

429
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,760
there was never any future

430
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,320
for the two of us.

431
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:38,960
Whether there's a future or not

432
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,040
has nothing to do with status.

433
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,160
It all comes down to feelings.

434
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,000
I didn't love you before.

435
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,320
But now I do.

436
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:49,800
So it doesn't matter

437
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,920
who you are.

438
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,737
Even if Mr. Gao didn't succeed,

439
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,480
I still...

440
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:57,840
You are in no mood
to talk about love right now.

441
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,600
I just want to secure my place first.

442
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,640
Once you're done with everything,

443
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,760
I'll be waiting.

444
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:05,874
For the life ahead of you,

445
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,640

(Lu Residence)

470
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,720
Jing threw a fit when she heard
you're getting engaged

471
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,840
to Chuning.

472
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,880
They are both my daughters.

473
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,360
As their mother,

474
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,920
this puts me in a tough spot.

475
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,760
All of this is my fault.

476
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,640
I caused both of you trouble.

477
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,440
Nothing wrong with loving someone.

478
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,200
Chuning grew up away from home.

479
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,360
She's suffered so much.

480
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,280

00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,600
I'm counting on you

482
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,560
to take good care of her for us.

483
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,600
Don't worry.

484
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,360
I feel exactly the same way as you do.

Alright.

00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,360
She is waiting at the workshop.

489
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,280

Tell Ms. Lin to go to the workshop.
