=Episode 2=
(Are You Admitting Defeat Willingly or Not?)

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,920
(Lu Residence)

4
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,479
The matron said

5
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:54,640
this lucky charm was on me

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,679
when I was found.

7
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,000
I guess

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,799
it must've been from my birth parents.

9
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,159
Until that day,

10
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,600
I noticed Mr. Lu was wearing

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,959
a pendant that looked like
it matched mine.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,719
I asked around at many stores.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,840
They all told me
this jade is one of a kind.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,400
They were originally one whole.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,519
That's why

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,400
I found the courage to come to you.

17
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,160
Siyan, where's your jade pendant?

18
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,000
This is my daughter's jade pendant.

19
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,519
You really are my daughter.

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,920
Master,

21
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,879
I was actually pregnant with twins.

22
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,400
But the girl died
right after she was born.

23
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,120
I didn't want you to be upset,

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,919
so I had the midwife secretly bury her.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,080
All these years, I treated Jing
like my own daughter

26
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,759
because I could never let go
of our lost daughter.

27
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,599
Heaven has shown us mercy.

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,240
You're still alive after all.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,639
Mother.

30
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,280
Chuning, life must've been hard on you.

31
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,360
We'll pick an auspicious day

32
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,188
to officially welcome you back
into the family.

33
00:02:29,377 --> 00:02:30,200
Thank you, Father.

34
00:02:30,937 --> 00:02:32,994
Mother, you abandoned her easily.

35
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,199
Now, you're claiming her just as easily.

36
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,080
Siyan,

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
I didn't abandon your elder sister.

38
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:40,508
She's not my sister.

39
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:41,800
It's just a pendant.

40
00:02:41,822 --> 00:02:43,560
Who knows how she got her hands on it?

41
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,719
Brat,

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,680
she's your sister.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,560
If you don't wish the Lu family

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,199
to become the laughingstock of the city,

45
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,280
you'd better get rid

46
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,800
of all those ridiculous ideas.

47
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,639
Chuning,

48
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,280
my poor girl.

49
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,960
Mother,

50
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,400
as long as I can reunite
with you and Father,

51
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,759
everything is worth it.

52
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,759
Ms. Chuning,

53
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,319
your room is ready.

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,479
Please get some rest.

55
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,719
(This is so unfair.)

56
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,280
(How could a scumbag like Lu Siyan)

57
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,800
(get to enjoy such a luxurious life?)

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,080
(Xiaorou,)

59
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:58,280
(I'll take back everything
that should've been yours.)

60
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,800
So this is how you got into
the Lu family?

61
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:04,680
Lu Siyan,

62
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,680
I'm your sister.

63
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,759
Sister?

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,080
What kind of sister are you?

65
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,719
What sister

66
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,600
treats her brother like this?

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,439
What sister

68
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,600
would set up her own brother

69
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,834
just to serve her own ends?

70
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:24,280
Hmm?

71
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,720
I think

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,628
there's a misunderstanding between us.

73
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,959
Misunderstanding?

74
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:35,760
Do you have feelings for me?

75
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,240
Or

76
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:39,920
are you after something else?

77
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,160
Hmm?

78
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,560
Does it even matter now?

79
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,160
Of course it does.

80
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,040
It helps me decide

81
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:52,520
whether, once your cover is blown,

82
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,879
you die

83
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,639
or live to suffer.

84
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:15,720
Be a good boy.

85
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,560
Chuning,

86
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,079
are you asleep?

87
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:25,760
Lu Siyan,

88
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,399
let go of me.

89
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,920
Do you think that

90
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,399
if my father finds out

91
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,800
you set me up,

92
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,319
will he still acknowledge you
as his daughter?

93
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:40,640
Beg me.

94
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:43,040
Chuning,

95
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,120
are you asleep?

96
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,480
Lest you're too blind
to see the obvious,

97
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,319
dear sister.

98
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,560
Chuning.

99
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,240
Father.

100
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,720
It's the middle of the night.

101
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,519
Why are you in your sister's room?

102
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,188
She asked me

103
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,759
to help her tidy up.

104
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,959
Chuning,

105
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:11,680
your mother and I owed you so much.

106
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,759
I asked around.

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,720
Surprisingly, my daughter

108
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,680
is the top salesperson
at Lu Department Store.

109
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,240
So I've decided

110
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,600
to promote you to Sales Section Chief.

111
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,279
Consider it a small way to make up
for what you went through.

112
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Thank you, Father.

113
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,279
Brat,

114
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,480
go back to your room.

115
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,160
Congrats.

116
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,839
Mr. Siyan,

117
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,279
what's your plan?

118
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,199
My parents are easily fooled.

119
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,040
I'm not.

120
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,160
(Cong, Lu Siyan's sidekick)
Run a background check on her.

121
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,439
Don't let the impostor in.

122
00:06:58,908 --> 00:06:59,520
Yes.

123
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:00,680
I heard

124
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,839
Ms. Chuning's colleagues
often bully her.

125
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,280
Should I give them a warning?

126
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,279
I believe she must
have some tricks up her sleeve

127
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,959
to be the Young Lady Lu.

128
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,560
Besides,

129
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,480
do you really think
they could bully her?

130
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:23,340
(Lu Group)

131
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:27,200
Well, well.

132
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,600
Isn't this the fragile lady who flirted
with both Mr. Siyan and Chief Shen,

133
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,160
to fight over you?

134
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,051
Why aren't you living it up
in their cage,

135
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,120
instead of coming here
to steal our jobs?

136
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,040
Or maybe,

137
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,240
you've been used

138
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,439
and tossed aside

139
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,480
like this rag?

140
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:55,960
Lin Chuning!

141
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:56,800
What's going on?

142
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,240
You shameless tramp.

143
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,399
I'll kill you.

144
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,120
Do not be rude.

145
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,660
(Supervisor of the Lu Department Store)
She's the young lady of the Lu family

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,639
and the most distinguished person

147
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,120
in the entire Lu Department Store
next to Master Lu and Mr. Siyan.

148
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,199
I profusely apologize, Ms. Chuning.

149
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,920
It's fine.

150
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,879
But if I were you,

151
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:24,840
I'd resign.

152
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,200
I'm vindictive, after all.

153
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,142
From now on,

154
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:31,000
keep this in mind.

155
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,920
Always watch your back.

156
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:33,960
Just in case

157
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,560
someone hits you,

158
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,799
and no one's there to save you.

159
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,919
Starting from today,

160
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,759
Lu Department Store
will not tolerate misconduct.

161
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,480
Anyone who mistreats an employee

162
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,114
will be punished.

163
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,280
- Yes, Ms. Chuning.
- Yes, Ms. Chuning.

164
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,919
What a pleasure you have enjoyed
as the young master.

165
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,480
Only showing up

166
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,840
after the store's closed.

167
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:03,960
It's your first day of your appointment.

168
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,960
I didn't want to steal your thunder.

169
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,600
I'll take you somewhere.

170
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:11,560
Scared?

171
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,120
Let's go.

172
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,759
Wait.

173
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,600
Put this on.

174
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,159
Why do I feel like

175
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm floating?

176
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,360
Scared?

177
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,720
Well?

178
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,960
Isn't it beautiful?

179
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,702
We're in a hot air balloon.

180
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,360
The sunset is stunning.

181
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,080
In such a beautiful place,

182
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,679
it's the perfect time to tell the truth.

183
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,840
Instead of being paranoid,

184
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,480
why not enjoy the view?

185
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,320
You really should appreciate

186
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,159
such a beautiful view

187
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,519
while you still can.

188
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,080
Take a few more looks.

189
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,679
Could be the very last.

190
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,080
You're going to kill me?

191
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,240
We're a thousand meters above ground.

192
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,720
The perfect place to dump a body.

193
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,679
Let's play a game.

194
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:19,720
Let's see how lucky you are.

195
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:22,760
If you're lucky,

196
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,000
all I can say is

197
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,759
that you might just survive.

198
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,399
What's your real reason
for coming into the Lu family?

199
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,840
Say it.

200
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,039
What do you want me to say?

201
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:39,760
Five.

202
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:46,200
Four.

203
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,840
I'm the daughter of the Lu family.

204
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,519
I just want to go back to my family.

205
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:00,080
Three.

206
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,679
I'm telling the truth.

207
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,320
What exactly do you want me to say?

208
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,919
You have one last chance.

209
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Say it.

210
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,480
(I can only take the risk now.)

211
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,759
I just want to know.

212
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,720
Why did my parents abandon me?

213
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,120
Why did they let me suffer so much

214
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,639
and never come back for me?

215
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,440
I just want to live.

216
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:34,360
Your chance is up.

217
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,480
There's no bullet in here.

218
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,480
Are you insane?

219
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,039
If I ever find out you lied to me,

220
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:00,920
I'll be even more insane.

221
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,120
This.

222
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,759
A gift for you.

223
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,320
Treasure it.

224
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,919
(Lu Siyan,)

225
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,320
(you'll find out soon enough that)

226
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,799
(your sister is even crazier than you.)

227
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,799
(Lin Chuning,)

228
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,720
(I'd like to see
what other tricks you can pull.)

229
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,580
(Lu Residence)

230
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,760
Mochen,

231
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,560
what are you doing here?

232
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,639
I brought breakfast for Jing.

233
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Do you want to try some?

234
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:58,520
Thanks.

235
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,399
Why are you suddenly the young lady
of the Lu family?

236
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,759
It doesn't affect our plan.

237
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,120
Lu Siyan messed up
the marriage alliance.

238
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,159
Mr. Lu is already furious now.

239
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,560
Let's add some fuel to the fire.

240
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,360
Trick him into taking out
a high-interest loan.

241
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,440
Now that you've been accepted
as Lu's daughter,

242
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,200
Li Siyan is your blood brother.

243
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,240
Can you really bear

244
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,919
to see him ruined?

245
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,679
Rou may be his blood sister,

246
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,799
but she'd struggled her whole life.

247
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,840
And him?

248
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,679
Born with a silver spoon in his mouth.

249
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:32,268
It's time to let him taste hardship.

250
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:34,097
(Lu Siyan,)

251
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,799
(the first gift)

252
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,720
(is on its way.)

253
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,685
Flying

254
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:44,160
is a dangerous yet enchanting sport.

255
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:46,840
Just like what you're about to do.

256
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,948
Up in the boundless skies,

257
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,074
you must not only soar high...

258
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,200
(How lucky I am)

259
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,840
(to be a pilot.)

260
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,360
(Right now, the beautiful homeland)

261
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,840
(is ravaged by war.)

262
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,622
(I hope my wings)

263
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,040
(could bring peace to our home.)

264
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:06,750
I'm heading off.

265
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,159
Okay.

266
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,000
Mr. Siyan,

267
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:13,400
now that Ms. Lin is your sister,

268
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:15,240
your previous plan won't work anymore.

269
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,080
What are you going to do?

270
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,640
Since Lin Chuning is so desperate
to come back to the family,

271
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,559
let her take over all that mess.

272
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,039
I'll play the son who makes trouble
and wastes money.

273
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:27,280
Father won't stand by

274
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,799
while I drain the family fortune.

275
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,120
I don't think
you actually dislike Ms. Lin.

276
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,725
In fact, you seem to admire her.

277
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,519
Do you like her?

278
00:14:38,302 --> 00:14:40,360
You've grown a pair, huh?

279
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,120
I have my own plans.

280
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:43,600
(Lu Group)

281
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,200
Lu Siyan is an unworthy general manager!

282
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,765
Give me back my hard-earned money!

283
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:53,559
- Pay up!
- Pay up!

284
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,720
- The doors are open. Rush in!
- Pay up!

285
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:56,879
Go!

286
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:57,880
Don't touch me.

287
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,960
I don't care who you are,

288
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:00,840
you have to pay what you owe!

289
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,360
Or I'll jump.

290
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,600
All right, all right. Calm down.

291
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,879
Let's talk nicely.

292
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,039
You!

293
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,159
Don't come closer.

294
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,759
One step closer, and I'm jumping.

295
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,919
Why haven't you jumped yet?

296
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,879
Mr. Siyan owes me wages.

297
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,679
That money is important to me.

298
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,000
Owe?

299
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:25,028
It's for the cash flow issue.

300
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,120
I'll pay you back.

301
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,160
Why made a fuss over it?

302
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:31,148
The bigger the scene, the better.

303
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,759
I want my dad to know.

304
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:33,760
Don't worry.

305
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,759
I won't take even
a single dime of your money.

306
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:37,520
You won't lose your jobs, either.

307
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,919
Okay.

308
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,720
(Lin Chuning,)

309
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,759
(let's see)

310
00:15:44,131 --> 00:15:47,000
(once the old man finds out
you tricked me into taking out a loan,)

311
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,120
(will he still let you stay
in the Lu Group?)

312
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,600
(Well,)

313
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,617
(you're getting kicked out with me.)

314
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,600
(As if.)

315
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,799
Didn't you say you were going to jump?

316
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:58,759
Go on.

317
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,399
What?

318
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,400
Scared now?

319
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,360
Still hesitating?

320
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,039
Dying like this isn't satisfying.

321
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,080
How about I give you a hand?

322
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,200
Mr. Siyan.

323
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,879
What are you doing?

324
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,919
I'm helping him out.

325
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,320
Life's hard.

326
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,559
Wouldn't it be better to
be born rich like you

327
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,600
in his next life?

328
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,440
Stop wasting your time.

329
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,440
Let me help you out.

330
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,519
I'm not jumping.

331
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,519
(Looks like the loan trick
isn't going to work on Lu Siyan.)

332
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:37,228
(I'll have to use myself as bait)

333
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,879
(to drive him out of the Lu family.)

334
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:43,759
Enough with your acting?

335
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,845
Do you people in power

336
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
really love controlling others?

337
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:50,519
Yeah.

338
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,080
We do. So what?

339
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,679
Why is it that you make the mistakes,

340
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,559
and we're the ones who have to die?

341
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:59,160
I'll keep on living.

342
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,559
I'll trample on all of you.

343
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,839
I'll make the world

344
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,440
afraid of me.

345
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,828
What a dumb.

346
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,982
♪Even if this was an inescapable fate♪

347
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,799
Lu Siyan,

348
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,880
you love pushing people

349
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,680
into the abyss, don't you?

350
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,108
♪Burning♪

351
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,119
What are you trying to do?

352
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,000
You've lost.

353
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,960
Why did your sister fall down?

354
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,240
Luckily, there was
a rescue cushion below.

355
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,839
If your sister hadn't been there,

356
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,599
the Lu family's century-old reputation
would've been ruined by you.

357
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Don't think I don't think
what you're thinking.

358
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,200
You'd better give up that idea now.

359
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,440
As long as I'm alive,

360
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,599
I'll never let you go to
that ridiculous flight academy.

361
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,559
(Flight academy?)

362
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,440
(He wants to join the army?)

363
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,760
Father, please don't be angry.

364
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,960
It's my fault for not
keeping him in line.

365
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,440
That's how he became like this.

366
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,640
You've just returned.

367
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,760
Your mother and I have
spoiled him too much.

368
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,839
You don't need to return
to the department store now.

369
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:30,040
Chuning,

370
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,279
you'll temporarily take over
as general manager.

371
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:33,759
Father,

372
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,240
isn't that a bit inappropriate?

373
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,800
There's nothing inappropriate about it.

374
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,119
He's never serious about his job.

375
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,799
He can only have it back
once he realizes his mistakes.

376
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,440
It is all

377
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,000
in vain.

378
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,039
You!

379
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,720
Still have the nerve to talk like that?

380
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,039
Go to your room and reflect on yourself.

381
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,839
Without my permission,

382
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,880
you're not leaving your room.

383
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:01,960
Get lost.

384
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,920
(This little punishment isn't enough.)

385
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,519
(Lu Siyan,)

386
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:11,120
(the second gift is ready.)

387
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,600
This mung bean cake is really good.

388
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,039
I never let myself buy it before.

389
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Try it.

390
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:33,640
How nice of you.

391
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:35,600
But how do I know

392
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:37,840
you're not trying to poison me?

393
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,359
Is this

394
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,920
some carrot-and-stick trick?

395
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:52,519
Right?

396
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,759
Of course

397
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
I want to poison you.

398
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,960
Just kidding.

399
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,519
You're being serious.

400
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,319
I've always had the feeling
that compared to the family fortune,

401
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,559
what you're after is my life.

402
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,279
Actually, I have a sister.

403
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,319
We grew up together
at the Foundling Home.

404
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:30,120
We aren't related by blood,

405
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,000
but we're closer than family.

406
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,519
She is with me

407
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,640
through all the hardest times.

408
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:39,360
So pretty.

409
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,000
Xiaorou.

410
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,100
(Xiaorou, Lin Chuning's best friend)
We were born in the same year and same day.

411
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,640
So we're real sisters from now on.

412
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,400
Chuning.

413
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,759
Xiaorou.

414
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,720
What's going on? You look so happy.

415
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,720
I have a crush on a guy.

416
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,119
Really?

417
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,279
Who is he?

418
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,519
It's Young Master Lu Siyan.

419
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,559
And then?

420
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,559
Where is she now?

421
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,240
(She died because of you.)

422
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,079
Xiaorou!

423
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,640
Xiaorou!

424
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,160
What happened to you, Xiaorou?

425
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,759
Don't scare me.

426
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,960
Lu Siyan didn't want our baby.

427
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,519
I was too silly.

428
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,839
Avenge me.

429
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,759
You'll be seeing her soon.

430
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,600
Why would I want to see her?

431
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,039
(Because)

432
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,359
(scumbags go to hell.)

433
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:06,720
Chuning.

434
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:11,240
Chuning,

435
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,680
you killed him?
