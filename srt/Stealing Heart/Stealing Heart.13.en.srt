=Episode 13=
(No Matter the Cost)

3
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:52,079
Mr. Siyan is badly injured
and has caught a chill.

4
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,520
Whether he can make it through

5
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,799
depends on tonight.

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,960
Mother.

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,759
Siyan.

8
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,280
Siyan.

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,399
It's all my fault.

10
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,879
I'll do anything you want
as long as you wake up.

11
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,680
Heavens,

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,359
please

13
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,680
punish me if you must.

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,040
But don't take my son.

15
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,359
Shen Mochen...

16
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,640
Those useless fools.

17
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:19,599
Why haven't they found out
who did this to my son?

18
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,519
Siyan,

19
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,200
please open your eyes.

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,159
Siyan, you're awake.

21
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,599
How are you feeling?

22
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,319
Does it hurt?

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,239
You're back.

24
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:10,960
I

25
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,719
could feel

26
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,520
you were crying.

27
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,960
That's why I woke up.

28
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,080
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,520
I got you hurt again.

30
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,680
It's not your fault.

31
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,520
As long as you're safe,

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,360
I don't care what happens to me.

33
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,719
Don't ever get hurt again, silly.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,960
Also,

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,360
don't ever risk your life
for anyone else after this.

36
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,560
You're not anyone else.

37
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,280
You're the person I love most.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Siyan.

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,280
Siyan, you're awake?

40
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,639
Are you okay?

41
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,039
Quick!

42
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,520
Tell Mother at the ancestral hall.

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,680
Yes, miss.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,919
Siyan, are you okay?

45
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,439
Miss Lin,

46
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,960
let me get you out of here.

47
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
If we wait until the others arrive,

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,439
you won't be able to leave.

49
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:56,020
(Lu Ancestral Shrine)

50
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,319
Ancestors,

51
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,240
please bless my son.

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,400
Keep him safe
and bring him back to health.

53
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,919
Mrs. Lu,

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,839
you still have the nerve to pray
to the ancestors

55
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,519
after everything you've done
to betray the Lu family?

56
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,399
Aren't you afraid
they'll come after you in your sleep?

57
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,050
You should be worried about yourself.

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,079
I've sent you away once,

59
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:35,399
and I can do it again.

60
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,360
Mrs. Lu,

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,240
was that a threat?

62
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,879
So what if it is?

63
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,319
Mother.

64
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,040
Mother,

65
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,480
what are you doing?

66
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,160
Untie her!

67
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,879
Yes, Mr. Siyan.

68
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,240
Siyan.

69
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,160
I told you

70
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,040
not to hurt her again.

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,760
Do you really want to push me
over the edge?

72
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,639
Siyan,

73
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,120
how's your injury?

74
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:03,879
Are you all right?

75
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,760
Are you hurt?

76
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,639
No, I'm not.

77
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,399
Mother.

78
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,839
You should be resting.

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,600
Stop coming after her!

80
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Siyan.

81
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,270
Xiaorou?

82
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,000
What are you doing here?

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,680
Chuning?

84
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,519
Didn't Father tell you

85
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,480
that this position is mine now?

86
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,759
Oh, I forgot.

87
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,040
He doesn't even want

88
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,720
to see you anymore.

89
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,839
Siyan gave you this paper kite,
didn't he?

90
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,319
Give it to me.

91
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,879
Lin Chuning,

92
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,519
you'll end up being crushed

93
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,240
under my feet like this kite.

94
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
Xiaorou, have you lost your mind?

95
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,519
Do you even hear yourself?

96
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,800
Of course I do.

97
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,319
How did you become like this?

98
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,279
This is who I've always been.

99
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,839
You just didn't know it.

100
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,000
Seeing you now,

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I regret it.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,680
Regret saving me?

103
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,560
So you could go on pretending

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,120
to be me?

105
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,759
I would save anyone
from the Foundling Home.

106
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,160
What I regret is thinking
we were best friends,

107
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,480
but it was all fake.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,839
I even thought we were the same.

109
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,240
The same?

110
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,519
We were never the same.

111
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,800
I'm the real heiress.

112
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,759
You're just a stray.

113
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,000
Xiaorou,

114
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,839
you'd better remember
what you said today.

115
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,120
Lin Chuning, this place is mine now.

116
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:37,020
(Lu Department Stores)

117
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,800
Well, well.

118
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
Isn't this
the prestigious Lu family heiress?

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,120
What a fall from grace.

120
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,079
I thought you were some noble lady.

121
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,560
It turns out you're just a commoner.

122
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,399
Did you just slap me?

123
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,680
What?

124
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
Is one slap not enough?

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,040
Do you want another one?

126
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,759
Stop!

127
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,839
This is the Lu Department Store,

128
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,480
not the Foundling Home.

129
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,439
Did I say you could leave?

130
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,519
I lost something.

131
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,399
Then go look for it.

132
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,040
But you were the only one
in my office just now.

133
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,800
Is this the best trick
the Lu family has?

134
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,959
Hold her

135
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,399
and search her.

136
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,399
Don't you dare touch me!

137
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,279
Let me go!

138
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,720
We didn't find anything.

139
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,759
If I say you stole it, then you did.

140
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,000
How dare you try to deny it?

141
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,320
Everyone, listen up.

142
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
I am the true heiress of the Lu family!

143
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,399
Anyone who crosses me

144
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:03,759
crosses the entire Lu family!

145
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,600
You can quit

146
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,480
or even fight back.

147
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,639
But I guarantee you.

148
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,720
If you do either one,

149
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,080
no other department store
in the city will hire you.

150
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,919
Tonight, the Lu family is holding
a charity auction here.

151
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,360
Lin Chuning,

152
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,799
I want this whole place spotless

153
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,080
in four hours.

154
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,480
No one is allowed to help her.

155
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,080
What are you smiling about?

156
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,840
I was just wondering

157
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,840
what it's like

158
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,320
to kiss someone?

159
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,919
I saw a couple kissing
on the street today.

160
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,919
They just did it without hesitation.

161
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,679
My, my, Xiaorou.

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,559
Then turn around.

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,159
How does that feel?

164
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,320
What are you doing?

165
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,560
Didn't you say

166
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,040
you were curious how kissing feels?

167
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,600
So, how did you feel?

168
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,039
I'm not telling you.

169
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,240
Thank you all for being here today.

170
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,519
Thank you, Xiaorou.

171
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,120
For what?

172
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,000
If you hadn't completely cast aside

173
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,120
our friendship,

174
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,200
I wouldn't have seen things so clearly.

175
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,680
This will be sent to the front lines.

176
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,320
And now, our first auction item

177
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:17,559
will be a treasured piece donated
by the Lu family.

178
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,399
My daughter will present
the stunning feathered gown.

179
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,120
Ladies and gentlemen,

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,519
this gown was handcrafted

181
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,039
by a renowned artisan over three months.

182
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:43,879
Are they trying to fool us
with some tattered gown?

183
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,159
Don't tell me everything here is fake.

184
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,279
Calm down, ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,879
This was deliberately planned

186
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,480
by Mr. Lu.

187
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:14,759
Lin Chuning.

188
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,360
Like this gown,

189
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,960
no matter how fine

190
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,360
or exquisite,

191
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,600
without care,

192
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,840
it will fall apart.

193
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,200
My father asked me to repair it,
not to hide its flaws,

194
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,480
but to show the truth.

195
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,000
Our homeland

196
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,679
is in turmoil.

197
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,159
Only by staying united

198
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,840
and working as one

199
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,919
can we bring back its former glory.

200
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,639
It's easy to give when times are good,

201
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,159
but much harder in hardship.

202
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,879
We hope for your generosity tonight.

203
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,600
Now this is
the real Lu family's daughter.

204
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,679
I've told you
that the model wasn't the daughter.

205
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,000
You can see it in her bearing.

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,280
Even in royal robes,
a pretender can't fake nobility.

207
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,799
Exactly.

208
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,560
Mr. Lu said

209
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,679
his daughter would present

210
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,600
the gown.

211
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,279
He didn't say she would be wearing it.

212
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,120
Now,

213
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,919
let the bidding begin.

214
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,399
The starting price

215
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,760
is ten thousand yuan.

216
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,240
I'll offer ten thousand and one.

217
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,120
Twelve thousand.

218
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,559
Lu Siyan,

219
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,720
you may have escaped death once.

220
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,840
Let's see if you're lucky this time.

221
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,600
Why is he getting out of Siyan's car?

222
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,000
It's inconvenient for my father to walk.

223
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,440
Drive the car up to the alley.

224
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,840
Yes, I'm on it.

225
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,320
Father,

226
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,360
your car is having issues.

227
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,440
Siyan offered to use his car.

228
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,200
All right.

229
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,759
Chuning,

230
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,159
come with me.

231
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,919
I'd like a word.

232
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:28,799
Of course.

233
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,720
Father, careful now.

234
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,759
Chuning,

235
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,559
I'm leaving my father in your hands.

236
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,799
Don't worry.

237
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,960
I know how to take better care of him

238
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,600
than you do.

239
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,120
Drive safely.

240
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,039
Yes, miss.

241
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,799
Lin Chuning,

242
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,000
make sure to look after him

243
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,879
when you are in the afterlife too.

244
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,039
Where's my car?

245
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,120
Mr. Siyan,

246
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,000
I just saw Miss Lin take your car home.

247
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,799
My car?

248
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,840
Yes.

249
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,039
I've already chased you out
of the Lu family.

250
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,879
Why are you still helping us today?

251
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,879
Because I'll rise

252
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,159
from where I fell.

253
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,799
All of you looked down on me.

254
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,120
So I'll prove I never needed

255
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,919
the Lu family name to stand tall.

256
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,200
I'll announce

257
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,240
that Xiaorou has been sick
and in seclusion since childhood.

258
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,159
You're the goddaughter I adopted

259
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,759
to bring her good luck.

260
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,919
You can keep working
at the Lu Department Stores.

261
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,360
Thank you,

262
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,080
Mr. Lu.

263
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,440
Don't let me down.

264
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,720
Lu Siyan,

265
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,480
only when you're dead

266
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,080
will I finally get everything I want.

267
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,240
That includes Chuning

268
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,519
and the Lu family.

269
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,799
So you must die right here.

270
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,559
Over there.

271
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,960
Father! Chuning!

272
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,160
Father! Chuning!

273
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,560
- Mr. Lu!
- Are you hurt?

274
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,160
Leave me.

275
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,400
Quick, go help your father.

276
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:42,559
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,960
It's my fault

278
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,599
I couldn't protect Mr. Lu.

279
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,079
I should be the one to apologize.

280
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,200
It was I

281
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
who failed to protect both of you.

282
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,039
My dear!

283
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:55,799
My dear...

284
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,440
My dear.

285
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,640
Lin Chuning,

286
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,720
if it weren't for a jinx like you,

287
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,440
my husband wouldn't be hurt!

288
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,000
Mother,

289
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,200
do not speak to her like that.

290
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,599
She's already hurting more than anyone.

291
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,839
So please calm down.

292
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,680
The patient urgently needs
a blood transfusion.

293
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,840
But our supply is running low.

294
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,680
Could the family step forward
for a blood test?

295
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,120
I'll do it.

296
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,160
Siyan.

297
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,680
It's okay. I'll be right back.

298
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:35,960
Does it hurt?

299
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:38,599
I'm fine.

300
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,000
I thought you were gone back there.

301
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,559
If anything were

302
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,960
to happen to you,

303
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,160
I wouldn't want to live either.

304
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,559
Don't say such foolish things.

305
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,599
I'm right here, am I not?

306
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,640
Oh,

307
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,320
how is Mr. Lu's condition?

308
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,680
I've just finished the transfusion.

309
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,759
He should be out of danger now.

310
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,319
That's a relief.

311
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,240
My mother can be harsh with her words.

312
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,519
Even I can't stand it either.

313
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,480
Just ignore whatever she says
from now on.

314
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,839
Mrs. Lu is only worried
about her husband.

315
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,039
If someone I love gets hurt,

316
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,720
I might've said something even worse.

317
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,240
Come.

318
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,240
What's this?

319
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,640
It's my birthmark.

320
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,839
I covered it with foundation powder

321
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,000
to impersonate Xiaorou.

322
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,440
(Could she be my daughter?)

323
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,240
Mother?

324
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:34,880
Mrs. Lu.

325
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,000
Mother!

326
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,039
I told you to stay away from her!

327
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,759
It's a mistake.

328
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,160
This whole thing is a mistake!

329
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,319
What is it now?

330
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,280
Just

331
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,039
how far have things gone
between you two?

332
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,359
I'll be honest.

333
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,280
I'll marry no one

334
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,920
but her.

335
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,039
Absolutely not!

336
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,079
Unless I'm dead,

337
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,920
you will never

338
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,920
be together!

339
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,920
Mrs. Lu.

340
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,160
What do you want from us?

341
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Everything turns in time, Lin Chuning.

342
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,119
What this world owes me

343
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,559
and what you owe me,

344
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,119
I'll take everything back.

345
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,880
Chuning,

346
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,080
your birthmark's so unique.

347
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,480
If you like,

348
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,880
I can draw one just like it for you.

349
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,920
You drew that on?

350
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,119
Mine has been there since I was born.

351
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,120
But my mother

352
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,280
didn't want me.

353
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,000
That's not true.

354
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,480
She gave you that mark on purpose.

355
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,359
So you can go back to her.

356
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,540
(Lu Residence)

357
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,160
