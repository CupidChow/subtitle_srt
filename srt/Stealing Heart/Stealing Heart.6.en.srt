(Worse Than Beasts)

3
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,560
(Lu Yunfei's Memorial Tablet)

4
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,709
Mr. Lu. Mrs. Lu.

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,149
The memorial tablet...

6
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,910
The memorial tablet is bleeding!

7
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,479
I heard a woman born in February
is unlucky.

8
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,789
When Ms. Lin was born,
she was a stillbirth.

9
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,607
Today, there have been many situations.

10
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,359
I'm afraid the ancestors
are not going to recognize Ms. Lin.

11
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,279
Otherwise,
there will be trouble for the Lu family.

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,050
How absurd.

13
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:21,369
I was also born in February.

14
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,789
Why am I not called unlucky?

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,584
Is it because she's a woman?

16
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,110
Women are the creators of things.

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,589
If women were born to be unlucky,

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,239
wouldn't the whole world

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,030
be a huge curse?

20
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:39,710
If being unlucky is wandering out there
yet still standing strong,

21
00:01:40,777 --> 00:01:43,790
aren't I more unlucky since I was born
living a comfortable life

22
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,798
yet I was still being unambitious?

23
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,639
Siyan,

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,030
don't speak nonsense.

25
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,270
I have a way.

26
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,429
Someone,

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,589
bring it here.

28
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,190
Yes.

29
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,509
(I asked the servant
to prepare a red dye beforehand.)

30
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,919
(Trying to return to the family?)

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,999
(Today,)

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,110
(I'll make you
embarrass yourself in public.)

33
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,310
Lin Chuning, I'll kill you!

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,870
Arguing inside the ancestral hall.
How ridiculous!

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,389
Calm down.

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,310
I am doing this
to ward off the misfortune on you.

37
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,190
What happened today

38
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,269
wasn't because I was unlucky

39
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,190
but because

40
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:50,190
you were lied to.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,261
Although you grew up
under Mother's care,

42
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:54,590
it's obvious

43
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:57,350
that you are still too naive.

44
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,052
Stop pretending!

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,350
Me?

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,069
The words on the memorial tablet

47
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,350
were written with lard dyed red.

48
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,549
Lard melts at a high temperature

49
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,109
so it created an illusion
that the memorial tablet was bleeding.

50
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,590
Lu Yijing.

51
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,630
You actually thought of

52
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,030
such a stupid method

53
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:28,800
and caused a mess at the ancestral hall.

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,925
Now that you've turned
the ancestral hall into this mess.

55
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:33,389
Can you shoulder the burden
if the ancestors were to punish you?

56
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,878
Lu Yijing.

57
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,870
Father!

58
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,190
Darn you!

59
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,399
How dare you

60
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,918
touch the ancestors' memorial tablet!

61
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,870
Father, I was wrong.

62
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,069
I was wrong.

63
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,949
From now on,

64
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,430
you are no longer allowed
in the ancestral hall.

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,158
Go back to your room

66
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,399
and copy the sutra 1,000 times

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,829
to apologize to the ancestors.

68
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,030
Madam Wang.

69
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,898
Father!

70
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,069
Mother!

71
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,269
I was wrong. I didn't do it on purpose!

72
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,310
Miss, let's go.

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,070
Chuning.

74
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,150
You started the incident.

75
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,549
Clean the memorial tablet

76
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,229
to show your filial piety.

77
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,950
Then, you'll return to the family.

78
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,989
Thank you, Father.

79
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,749
Siyan.

80
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,429
Your sister has returned.

81
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,198
You must work hard after this

82
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,150
to support the Lu family's business.

83
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,229
Father.

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,350
Since she has returned,

85
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,590
why don't you use this opportunity

86
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:52,278
to hand
Lu Department Stores over to her?

87
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,510
Siyan.

88
00:04:54,902 --> 00:04:57,590
I, Lu Siyan, will never
inherit the family business.

89
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,789
Nonsense!

90
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,189
Turn around.

91
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,510
Kneel.

92
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,189
Kneel!

93
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,109
I want you to kneel!

94
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,549
Repent before our ancestors.

95
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,999
If you dare something so atrocious,

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,669
I'll break your legs!

97
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,958
Mr. Lu,

98
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,789
have some tea.

99
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,590
Jing was too much.

100
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,390
It was all my fault for spoiling her

101
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,229
so she became rampant.

102
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,109
Thankfully, Chuning is wise.

103
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,070
She's like you indeed.

104
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,860
(That is exactly the reason why)

105
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,830
(she can't stay here.)

106
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:26,870
Mrs. Lu.

107
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,470
You gave birth to

108
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:29,479
a daughter.

109
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,559
Mr. Lu has always wanted a son.

110
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,789
Why did I give birth to a daughter?

111
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,590
Mrs. Lu,

112
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,830
the servant, Cui, gave birth to a boy.

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,950
Quick.

114
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,390
Show him to me.

115
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,070
(Lin Chuning is a time bomb.)

116
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,719
(One day,)

117
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,470
(her father might find out
about how I abandoned her.)

118
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,989
(I mustn't let her
destroy my perfect family.)

119
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,869
(I also won't let anyone
steal my son away.)

120
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,510
(I had no choice but to
impersonate a daughter of the Lu family.)

121
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:13,270
(Ancestors of the Lu family,
please bless and save Rou from this.)

122
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,950
What did you hide?

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,030
Show it to me.

124
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,884
Focus on kneeling.

125
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:23,910
Why do you care about me?

126
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:26,150
What are you doing?

127
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,479
Lu Siyan!

128
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,229
Don't move.

129
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,950
Give it back.

130
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,429
(Bazi)
Rou?

131
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:45,990
She was born on the same day as I.

132
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,707
Why must you place her bazi

133
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,150
under the memorial tablet
of the Lu family's ancestors?

134
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,189
Give it to me.

135
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,070
Rou had no friends and family.

136
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,950
She might not be my biological sibling,

137
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,880
but we were close
like a pair of real siblings.

138
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,710
I only want to share my luck with her.

139
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,390
I hope

140
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,638
the ancestors of the Lu family

141
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,749
can bless her

142
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,030
with peace and safety.

143
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,390
What a surprise.

144
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:18,950
Why do you believe in this so much?

145
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,599
It's because

146
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,669
you've never been forced into a corner.

147
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,999
You don't know the point

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,204
of living on a prayer.

149
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,670
I don't know about the rest.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,109
I only know

151
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,878
that you treat this
so-called sibling of yours

152
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,309
better

153
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:33,590
than your own brother.

154
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,670
Are you jealous?

155
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,269
No.

156
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,470
It's rare to see you being so obedient.

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,119
I can live

158
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,710
a comfortable life

159
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:49,199
because it's all thanks

160
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,749
to my ancestors' blessing.

161
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:53,582
So, I must pay my respects to them.

162
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,070
Will you follow
your parents' arrangements

163
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,950
because of this?

164
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,590
Of course, not.

165
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,599
I have to take my own path.

166
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,430
Nothing can stop me

167
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,149
when it comes to this.

168
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,190
You are right.

169
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,558
You are not the only one

170
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,190
who can inherit the family business.

171
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,878
I think

172
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,558
they also hope

173
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,790
you can get your wish.

174
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,790
Is that really what you think?

175
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,790

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,789
♪Stop calling the chaos
a fortress of joy♪

191
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,381
♪Is it you or is it me♪

192
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:06,870
♪Or is it someone else
who made the mistake?♪

193
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:08,521
No.

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,790
Don't do this.

195
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,350
No.

196
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,869
Don't do this.

197
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,830
No.

198
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,638
Siyan.

199
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,710
No!

200
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:29,310
You...

201
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,887
Why are you here?

202
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:37,158
You caught a cold after you got splashed
with cold water yesterday.

203
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,749
You kept mumbling just now.

204
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,430
Are you avoiding me?

205
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,470
I'm not.

206
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,269
Just now,

207
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,033
what...

208
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:56,790
What did I mumble?

209
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,550
You...

210
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,989
I didn't hear what you said clearly.

211
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,310
However,

212
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,989
it seemed like
you were having a nightmare.

213
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,909
A nightmare.

214
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:14,590
I did have a nightmare.

215
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,638
A nightmare.

216
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,869
It was a nightmare.

217
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,269
Lin Chuning,

218
00:13:27,754 --> 00:13:32,710
we might be partners now
but coming into my room directly.

219
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,950
Aren't you overstepping your boundaries?

220
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,439
We might be partners

221
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,959
but we are also siblings.

222
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,470
It's completely reasonable for me
to care for my younger brother.

223
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,630
Thank you for your care.

224
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,350
Mr. Lu.

225
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,389
It has been dry recently.

226
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,790
Have some lotus seed porridge.

227
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,229
It's cooling.

228
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,269
If you

229
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,869
educate your son well,

230
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,280
it'd relieve my heat
better than ten bowls of porridge.

231
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,470
Where's that unfilial son?

232
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:19,190
I'm here.

233
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,310
From today onward,

234
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,269
I want you to work in Lu Group.

235
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,190
Chuning will supervise you on my behalf.

236
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,038
Dad.

237
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,313
Isn't it enough to have a capable daughter?

238
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:35,830
Why must I be supervised?

239
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,710
A daughter is different from a son.

240
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,359
I know

241
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,790
what you are thinking.

242
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,038
You're always dreaming

243
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,470
about becoming a pilot.

244
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,070
Aviation school?

245
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,558
I think it's a place

246
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,359
for rich children

247
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,918
to gather formally

248
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,470
and live a muddled life.

249
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,959
Live a muddled life?

250
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,758
We are taking initiative.

251
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:01,758
When the enemy's planes

252
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,719
start flying above us,

253
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,398
Lu Department Stores will be bombed.

254
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,758
Then, it'll be too late.

255
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,389
You...

256
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:07,710
Siyan.

257
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,310
Don't talk back to your father.

258
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,590
Chuning.

259
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,950
What's wrong?

260
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,670
I...

261
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,590
This...

262
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,878
Is this egg

263
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,550
fried with peanut oil?

264
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,710
I'm allergic to peanuts.

265
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:48,070
Dad.

266
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:48,950
Look.

267
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,280
She is your daughter indeed.
She even shares the same allergies as you.

268
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,090
I'm very different from you.

269
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:55,481
Don't put your hopes on me.

270
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,950
I only know that your father
has a peanut allergy

271
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,229
so I made his portion separately.

272
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:06,950
It seems like I need to prepare
your portion separately as well.

273
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,350
I think

274
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,269
Chuning is like me.

275
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,950
Here. Eat.

276
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,229
You don't even

277
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,389
feel like my own child.

278
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,109
Are you going to see Mr. Gao?

279
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,830
Since he is using Rou
as his bargaining chip,

280
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,638
he won't harm me

281
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,950
before he gets what he wants.

282
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,269
Don't be so full of yourself.

283
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,590
I'm not worried about you.

284
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,310
Is that so?

285
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,989
Fine.

286
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,670
I'm just full of myself, then.

287
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,012
I'll go with you.

288
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,029
No need.

289
00:16:57,028 --> 00:16:58,350
I'm not going with you

290
00:16:58,514 --> 00:16:59,959
because I'm worried.

291
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,670
I'm doing it for Rou.

292
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,896
After all,

293
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,479
If I were more sensible

294
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,758
and brought her out for you,

295
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,399
this would not happen.

296
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,558
(If the Lu family hadn't abandoned Rou,)

297
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,350
(none of this would happen.)

298
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,518
The most important thing

299
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,439
is to rescue Rou.

300
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,078
As for what you and the Lu family

301
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,758
owe her,

302
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,518
I'll let her

303
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:21,189
settle the score with you.

304
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,270
What the Lu family owe her?

305
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,270
What do we owe her?

306
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:30,110
(She's standing up for Rou)

307
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:33,080
(but why does she have
such a grudge against the Lu family?)

308
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:43,590
Congratulations

309
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,278
on becoming

310
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,550
an official member of the Lu family.

311
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,389
Stop beating around the bush.

312
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,469
Where's Rou?

313
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,909
You did come here alone.

314
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,189
Aren't you afraid...

315
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,350
Gao Yunfeng,

316
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,510
I'm warning you.

317
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,109
I helped you last time

318
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,070
because of Rou.

319
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,078
I can keep you alive

320
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:09,590
and make you dead.

321
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,709
Rou!

322
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:19,838
Chuning.

323
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:20,830
Chuning.

324
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:21,919
Chuning,

325
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,270
take me away.

326
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,318
Rou,

327
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,389
sorry.

328
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,270
It's all my fault.

329
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,030
I should've noticed
that you were still alive.

330
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,949
Then, you wouldn't be in this situation.

331
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:32,999
Chuning,

332
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,758
I beg you to take me away.

333
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:35,679
They beat me up,

334
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,159
scolded me,

335
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,119
and forced me.

336
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,919
I want to die

337
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,799
but I can't even take my own life.

338
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,070
Rou!

339
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:47,441
Chuning.

340
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,159
Chuning.

341
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,230
Don't be afraid.

342
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,070
Gao Yunfeng,

343
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,550
state your condition.

344
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,869
I want the Lu family...

345
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,869
Shares,

346
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,030
land,

347
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,070
or shops?

348
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,070
Everything.

349
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,429
I want all of Lu family's assets.

350
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,109
Gao Yunfeng,

351
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:11,550
don't go overboard.

352
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,830
What do you know?

353
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,399
I need money.

354
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,389
I need a lot of money

355
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,239
so I can build a paradise

356
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,469
and make this paradise

357
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,919
into the happiest pleasure den
in this world.

358
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,869
No.

359
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:26,903
No!

360
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,550
When the time comes,

361
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,518
I will...

362
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,310
Don't touch her.

363
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,830
Don't worry.

364
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:38,701
I won't let you leave with nothing.

365
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,270
You'll get 30%

366
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,469
of the paradise's total income.

367
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,149
Chuning,

368
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,109
take me away.

369
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,118
I don't want to stay here anymore.

370
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:51,949
Chuning.

371
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,038
Rou,

372
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,149
don't be afraid.

373
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,149
I'll take you away.

374
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,990
That's enough.

375
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,669
Time's up.

376
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,590
Yijing,

377
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,038
please leave.

378
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,149
Gao Yunfeng,

379
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,719
if you dare hurt her again,

380
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,189
you won't get anything.

381
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,389
Please leave.

382
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,510
Wait for me.

383
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,230
Chuning.

384
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,109
Chuning.

385
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,030
You must rescue me!

386
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,629
Chuning!

387
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,149
Tell me.

388
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,510
Will she give you everything

389
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,030
from the Lu family?

390
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,109
Don't you understand

391
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,189
your buddy well?

392
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:46,662
She has always been wise.

393
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,838
She only entered the Lu family

394
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,830
for its assets.

395
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,270
If she can make money,

396
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,590
she will never miss this opportunity.

397
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:58,270
Rescuing you

398
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:00,378
is just part of her plan.

399
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,550
Is that so?

400
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,310
What?

401
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:09,189
Are you in a rush to leave me now?

402
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,624
Of course, not.

403
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,750
Master,

404
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,070
I'll always be yours.

405
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,669
Today,

406
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,230
let's have

407
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,669

the daughter of the Lu family.)

410
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,149
(and made me into this.)

411
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,550
