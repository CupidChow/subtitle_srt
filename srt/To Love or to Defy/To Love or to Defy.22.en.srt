3
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,880
Useless, useless.

4
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,080
You are all useless!

5
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,870
How could you waste

6
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,430
such a good opportunity?

7
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,960
Master,

8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,120
Ouyang Shao was well-prepared.

9
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,030
We couldn't act in time.

10
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,220
Then Lord Wang's men arrived.

11
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,480
This time,
I won't give you the antidote.

12
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,760
Reflect on yourself.

13
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,350
Aye.

14
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,150
Wait.

15
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,590
The poison should've taken effect.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,320
Well,

17
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,070
doesn't it hurt?

18
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,360
(It's her scent.)

19
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,720
Did you see Di Shiqi?

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,960
It seems

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,080
your dear sister

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,510
has to suffer.

23
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,200
Master,

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,790
I'll tell you.

25
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,970
I met Di Shiqi

26
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,790
at the post station.

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,650
But I really don't know

28
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,050
where she is now.

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,670
Di Shiqi,

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,080
I knew you weren't dead.

31
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,210
- Guards.
- Yes.

32
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,020
Find that woman.

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,370
Find her before Ouyang Shao does.

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,660
- Hurry.
- Aye.

35
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,580
Hurry!

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,160
Don't worry,

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,080
your sister will be fine.

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,880
You need to make amends.

39
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,790
You know what to do.

40
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,600
- Yes.
- Go.

41
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,400
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

42
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,830
- Hurry!
- This old house can't hide anyone.

43
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,470
Let's go. Check over there!

44
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,390
- Aye!
- Aye!

45
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,440
They've gone far.

46
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,760
Thank you for saving me.

47
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,830
Sprout!

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,040
Are you still leaving?

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,510
Along my journey,

50
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,950
I've taken many lives.

51
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,710
But you're different.

52
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,640
You're the most favored prince.

53
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,360
If you return,

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,030
you'll be the esteemed Fifth Prince.

55
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,000
No more Fifth Prince,

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
no more Crown Prince,
no more Shadow Palace!

57
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,080
Your Highness, we'll patrol.

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,630
The moment I decided to kill
the Guardian Duke,

59
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,150
I already made up my mind.

60
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120
I only want to be with you,

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,720
regardless of storms.

62
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,080
Please don't leave me again.

63
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,760
While you were away,

64
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,390
I found your mother.

65
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,110
Where is she?

66
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,950
Is she doing well?

67
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,110
Rest assured.

68
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,480
She's fine.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
She's been searching for you too.

70
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,480
In five days at most,

71
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,030
you'll meet her.

72
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,310
Why are you

73
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,150
so determined to choose me?

74
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,640
I've been a lonely killer
my entire life.

75
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,150
You don't have to...

76
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,460
(Sprout)

77
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,460
(Sprout)

78
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,510
Why is this with you?

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,080
I met a Sprout in the black market.

80
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,680
She refused to fall into darkness

81
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,710
or be trampled by others.

82
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,550
Back then,

83
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,390
I wanted to give her freedom.

84
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,440
But I led her into another abyss.

85
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,510
You've suffered too much
in the Shadow Palace.

86
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,060
I won't let you leave again.

87
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,860
(Sprout)

88
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,800
It was you.

89
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,320
Will you be my wife?

90
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,270
From now on,

91
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,080
I won't let anyone bully you.

92
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,720
You can chase your dreams

93
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,680
and do what you want.

94
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,440
And I'll be by your side.

95
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,270
Sister, you must be happy,

96
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,950
or I won't forgive him.

97
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,550
Enough.

98
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,670
Let's go over there.

99
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,030
Let me take another look.

100
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,680
Guardian Duke.

101
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,000
Rest in peace.

102
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,160
You...

103
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,680
Son, are you going to rebel?

104
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,200
That's not true.

105
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,560
I just want justice.

106
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,080
Ouyang Shao and Consort Wei
fled after the murder.

107
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,680
They should be executed.

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,240
Wang Jiarou,
daughter of the Grand Marshal,

109
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,440
is their accomplice.

110
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,120
Please issue a decree to capture them,

111
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,800
dead or alive.

112
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,440
He is your brother!

113
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,590
Uncle brought me up.

114
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,320
Now that he's dead,

115
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,110
I must avenge him

116
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,440
so that he can rest in peace.

117
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,630
Do you want me to spare him?

118
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,000
Perhaps,

119
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,040
do you want to die in his stead?

120
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,070
Shut up!

121
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,630
I'm your father!

122
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,830
Are you going to kill me?

123
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,400
Issue a decree.

124
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,350
It seems you don't care about

125
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,160
Shao that much.

126
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,680
Get out now.

127
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,550
Go!

128
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,440
My father is old.

129
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,950
Take care of him.

130
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,750
If anything happens,

131
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll kill you.

132
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,830
Ouyang Heng!

133
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,950
- Try this.
- Okay, come on.

134
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,830
She looks

135
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,840
so familiar.

136
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,320
What's wrong with them?

137
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,960
It's her! It's her!

138
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,880
Looks like her.

139
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,240
Take her!

140
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,160
Who are you?

141
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,160
Get off me! Get off me!

142
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,310
Help!

143
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,190
Father?

144
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,180
Hush.

145
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,550
Rou,

146
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,400
there are spies everywhere.

147
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,200
I'll be brief.

148
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,680
What's happening, Father?

149
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,220
(The Wanted, Wang Jiarou)

150
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,160
This...

151
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,590
A wanted notice?

152
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,520
The Crown Prince

153
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,550
has controlled the emperor

154
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,590
and the court.

155
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,440
Not just us,

156
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,750
even the Fifth Prince
is accused of treason.

157
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,280
If they catch us, we'll die.

158
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,080
How's that possible?

159
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,550
Father,

160
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,830
what should we do?

161
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,630
I can't move swiftly.

162
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,680
There's a small path.

163
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,200
Get out now

164
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,040
and find the Fifth Prince.

165
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,360
Tell him

166
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,320
our soldiers are ready outside the city.

167
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,200
He must decide now

168
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,750
to stop the Crown Prince
from contacting Wei.

169
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,680
Otherwise,

170
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,920
Qi will lose more cities.

171
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,120
Okay.

172
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
I'll tell him.

173
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,920
I'll keep watch.

174
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,670
You...

175
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,240
Leave now.

176
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,790
Father!

177
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,240
Take care!

178
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,800
Miss, check the fabric.

179
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,280
What? The Crown Prince
has controlled my father?

180
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,840
I'm afraid he'll kill him

181
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,990
and take the throne.

182
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,870
My father said our soldiers

183
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,920
are outside the city

184
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,630
waiting for your command.

185
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,800
We can't attack them now.

186
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,150
Without a legitimate reason,

187
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,870
we'll be regarded as rebels.

188
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,830
That's exactly what he wants.

189
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,600
Ming'en,

190
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,280
borrows some elite soldiers

191
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,350
to rescue my father secretly.

192
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,950
Sprout and I will come
after we pick up her mother.

193
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,440
