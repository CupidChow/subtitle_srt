Eunuch Li.

4
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,230
Your Highness.

5
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,430
I think I accidentally

6
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,310
burned Eunuch Li's body.

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,400
Why are you all standing there?

8
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,150
Take him to the Imperial Hospital!

9
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,150
No need!

10
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,480
I... I have medicine.

11
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,840
I can help myself.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,560
Help me up!

13
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,680
Okay.

14
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,870
But I heard

15
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,200
someone bought her freedom.

16
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,400
Yes, she was sold to the arena
after she got

17
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,870
separated from her mother.

18
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,680
But she made so many enemies

19
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,350
that she had been kidnapped

20
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,760
before she found her mother.

21
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,910
Kidnapped?

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,990
Yes.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,480
By the time I returned,

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,790
she'd already gone.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,950
I only found some loose coins

26
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,120
(Sprout)
and this pouch.

27
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,420
(Sprout)

28
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,910
Why did you return?

29
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,310
To avenge my right leg.

30
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,740
My,

31
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,710
My legs!

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,870
My both legs are gone!

(Ladies' Court)

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,590
Eunuch Li likes to hide the papers

35
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,630
in the treasure box.

36
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,590
They're really here.

37
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,400
I decide who's on duty!

38
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,190
How dare you talk back?

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,560
Freshly steamed buns,

40
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,710
do you want one?

41
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,840
If you want it,

42
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,750
bark like a dog.

43
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,150
Bark, bark,

44
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,750
and you'll get the bun.

45
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,240
You'll take the duty tonight.

56
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,550
That's right.

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,190
I'll make you a real eunuch.

58
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,400
Help!

59
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,910

How did you get that injury?

74
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,360
It's Consort Wei!

75
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,000
She's very powerful.

76
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,870
She must be a fake princess!

77
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,270
What did she do to you?

78
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
When I was instructing
the consort on duty,

79
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,600
she came in and kicked me!

80
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,030
And then?

81
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,920
She also injured me with a knife.

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,560
Anything else?

83
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,240
She tried to burn away the evidence.

84
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,070
Luckily, the fire went out

85
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,750
before the rain stopped.

86
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,680

87

What are you going to do?

92
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,630
A kick.

93
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,880

how's it going with the Ladies' Court?

102
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,160
Is there any evidence?

103
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,720
Good thing the rain stopped,

104
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,360

109
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,070

The emperor values the Ladies' Court.

111
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
He'll ask about it.

Greetings, Your Majesty.

114
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,080
Yesterday, my godfather

115
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,030
personally guided Her Highness
in etiquette.

116
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,150
But she neglected her lessons

117
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,480
and even burned my godfather.

118
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,120
She must've disguised herself

119
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,720
as a man in black
to set the fire for revenge.

120
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,710
Father...

121
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,080
Consort Wei,

122
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,080
do you have anything to say?

123
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,080
Eunuch Li's injury was an accident.

124
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,360
Everyone in the Ladies' Court

125
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,670
can testify for me.

126
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,750
If it weren't for
the recent peace with Wei,

127
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,080
I'd shoot you like hunting a rabbit.

128
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,270
I built the Ladies' Court

129
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,910
by my own hands.

130
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,200
It's the foundation of our nation.

131
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,150
Now that our reputation is ruined,

132
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,750
we must find the criminal!

133
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,580
(Shao's Mother)
Stay out of it.

134
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,660
Father,

135
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,670
I want to investigate this.

136
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,040
Shao!

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,840
Father,

138
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,510
please let me investigate it.

139
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,870
Shao, you've never been
a fan of work.

140
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,320
Well,

141
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,030
are you taking the initiative

142
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,440
for Consort Wei?

143
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,750
There's an assassin in the palace,

144
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,240
which threatens
Father and Mother's safety.

145
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,270
I have to do this.

146
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,680
Good.

147
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,840
It's rare you both show such intent.

148
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,440
Now that we're at the archery range,

149
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,320
let's settle this with a contest.

150
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,840
Yes, Father.

151
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,960
- Great!
- Great.

152
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,720
You're evenly matched.

153
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,790
Since you both wish to compete,

154
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,150
we shall let her decide
who should be the one

155
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
proving her innocence.

156
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,150
Your Highness, please trust me.

157
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,390
I'll...

158
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,670
I won't let you down...

159
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,600
Your Highness, this...

160
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,870
Both of you, listen to me.

161
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,630
I'm your mother

162
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,870
instead of the reward you fight for.

163
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,150
Nor am I a toy for your entertainment.
