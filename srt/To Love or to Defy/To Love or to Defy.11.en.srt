00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,360
Shao,

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,840
Changle Palace will host
the Spring Banquet soon.

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,280
I've invited
all the noblewomen in the capital.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,230
Your father wants you

7
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,000
to select a woman

8
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,040
and marry her.

9
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,510
- Mother...
- You don't have a choice.

10
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,280
I like Wang Jiarou,
the Grand Marshal's daughter.

11
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,230
You've known each other since young.

12
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,150
I believe you like her too.

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,000
But the Grand Marshal
works for the Crown Prince.

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,870
After you marry his daughter,

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,400
he will work for you.

16
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,560
Stay out of trouble these days.

17
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,640
Keep an eye on him.

18
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,550
Aye.

19
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,760
(I can't let the Crown Prince
stop Yilan from leaving.)

20
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,310
Blessed by heaven,

21
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,310
(Imperial Study)
Qi has enjoyed prosperity.

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,950
The Spring Banquet is a good opportunity

23
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,950
for everyone to have fun.

24
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,950
You should feel relaxed.

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,790
Long live the emperor!

26
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,120
Long live Qi!

27
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,580
(Guardian Duke, Crown Prince's Uncle)

28
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,470
The compass cracked.

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,590
Is it an ominous sign?

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,080
You've trained with the Grand Marshal
in the mountains.

31
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,840
They say you're
the most talented fortune-teller.

32
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,310
Tell me

33
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,960
what you've observed.

34
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,420
Congratulations.

35
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,630
(Wang Jiarou, Grand Marshal's Daughter)

36
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,560
Consort Wei's destiny is Taiyin,

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,310
with great blessings.

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,910
With this auspicious star,

39
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,150
Qi will definitely enjoy

40
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,280
long-term prosperity.

41
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,560
Long live Qi!

42
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,840
Good! Reward!

43
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,120
Keep playing the music.

45
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,640
Keep dancing.

46
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,190
Be careful!

47
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,030
Father.

48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,200
Play the music.

49
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,430
Dance!

50
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,990
Shao.

51
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Have a drink with me.

52
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,870
Crown Prince, I shall accept

53
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,840
your kind invitation.

54
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,150
Your Highness.

55
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,040
Your destiny is Qisha.

56
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,160
Born a tough rebel

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,720
with a difficult life.

58
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,720
You were supposed to
lose your family and live in poverty,

59
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,600
yet as the peace-making princess,

60
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,830
you've become a noblewoman.

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,920
You shouldn't be Consort Wei.

62
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,870
But you just said my destiny

63
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,240
was Taiyin with great blessings.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,840
That's right.

65
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,920
I just deceived the emperor.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,680
Why did you cover for me?

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,870
Yuan likes you.

68
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,880
Yuan?

69
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,630
I heard Father

70
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,600
wants you to marry Miss Wang.

71
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,480
Shao,

72
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,600
you should settle down.

73
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,310
Brother, you haven't got married.

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,390
How can I seek happiness first?

75
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,190
I will tell Father that I want

76
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,360
to build a career
before getting married.

77
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,750
What a great excuse.

78
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,510
But as for your affairs
with the consort,

79
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,560
if Father wants to investigate,

80
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,600
he'll find traces.

81
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,310
You're his favorite child.

82
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,680
There is no doubt.

83
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,880
However,

84
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,430
the woman you love...

85
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,560
What do you want to say?

86
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,750
You're way out of line.

87
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,070
Control your people,

88
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,680
and I'll keep the secret.

89
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,680
They called me a freak
when I was little.

90
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,190
Some even said I was a monster.

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,750
Only the Fifth Prince
treated me like a friend.

92
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,070
I don't want him to be upset.

93
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm the Fifth Prince's mother.

94
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,830
Miss Wang, please don't talk nonsense.

95
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,630
My divinations never go wrong.

96
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,320
You're wrong.

97
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,870
I am Consort Wei,

98
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,680
and I'm not a rebel.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,560
I just want to live.

100
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,120
Qisha, Pojun, Tanlang.

101
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,040
Your destiny has three ominous stars.

102
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,720
When they converge,

103
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,600
the ruler will change,

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,920
and there's no turning back.

105
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,910
Your Highness,

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,680
Qi is going to fall,

107
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,520
and

108
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,040
it's because of you.

109
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,800
What happened to him?

110
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,390
Everything is predestined.

111
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,270
You can't escape your destiny.

112
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,680
He's coughing blood, this...

113
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
The wine is poisonous.

114
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,120
Poison.

115
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,920
Your Highness, it was too risky.

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,270
You nearly died.

117
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,430
Don't worry. I have a plan.

118
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,600
What about the Crown Prince?

119
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,950
He failed to manage his men.

120
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,240
He's no longer the leader
of the imperial guards.

121
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,160
His Majesty even sealed the East Palace.

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,430
No one can stop Yilan

123
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,950
from taking Her Highness's mother out.

124
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,510
Replace the imperial guards
at East Palace

125
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,830
with our people tomorrow.

126
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,510
Let Yilan leave the city quickly.

127
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,200
Aye.

128
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,440
Wait.

129
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,950
Did Her Highness come?

130
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,590
No.

131
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,720
Your Highness, I'm here.

132
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,040
Your Highness.

133
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,920
Your Highness,

134
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,750
guess what I brought you.

135
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,600
What is it?

136
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,960
May you live happily

137
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,440
every day.

138
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,120
Thank you, Miss Wang.

139
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,630
I like it.

140
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,840
If you like it,

141
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,630
why don't you tell me
an interesting story?

142
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,790
I'm not good at storytelling.

143
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,150
That's strange.

144
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,440
I was certain

145
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,200
today was meant for stories.

146
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,840
If you can't tell a story,

147
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,630
why don't you
tell me something interesting?

148
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,510
Listen,

149
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,550
my father and I love gossip.

150
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,000
Now that you mention it,

151
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,320
I do have

152
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,790
an interesting story.

153
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,960
Really?

154
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,960
Come on, tell me!

155
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,350
Listen...

156
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,510
Forbidden love
with an overbearing rascal?

157
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,720
Oh my god!

158
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,320
The consort is so miserable.

159
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,870
Your Highness,
if I share this interesting story

160
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,910
with my father,

161
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,800
will...

162
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,270
will the consort in the story be upset?

163
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,030
It's just a story, isn't it?

164
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,510
You've lost again.

165
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,270
What's going on?

166
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,720
You're distracted.

167
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,910
I'm thinking about

168
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,960
the poisonous wine
at the Spring Banquet.

169
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,910
I'm anxious.

170
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,200
For what?

171
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,630
This is quite suspicious.

172
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,600
I can't figure out the reason.

173
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,000
If the Crown Prince was the target,

174
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,080
who would benefit from it?

175
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,910
It's indeed inappropriate
to let the Fifth Prince

176
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,630
lead the imperial guards.

177
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,840
Forgive me!

178
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,720
I'm always thinking too much.

179
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,910
I have no ill intentions!

180
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,320
And my doubts aren't baseless.

181
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,510
I've heard some rumors.

182
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,200
Your Majesty, please investigate it.

183
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,000
Rumors again?

184
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,750
Okay.

185
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,870
Tell me what you heard.

186
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,630
I heard that

187
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,790
a prince is having an affair
with Consort Wei.

188
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,630
Father,

189
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,670
could this be a misunderstanding?
