=Episode 12=

3
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,590
Father,

4
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,520
could this be a misunderstanding?

5
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,150
Fifth Prince is compassionate.

6
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,350
Rou might be imaginative,

7
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,710
but she never lies.

8
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,630
Father.

9
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,400
You promised not to tell anyone.

10
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,200
How could you snitch?

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,390
How dare you?

12
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,840
This is not your place to speak.

13
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,510
His Majesty will find out the truth.

14
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,840
Indeed, Fifth Prince,

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,760
His Majesty hasn't said anything,

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,070
but you're defending her.

17
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,590
How can we not suspect you?

18
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,430
Silence.

19
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,280
Consort Wei, tell me,

20
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,350
is Wang Jiarou telling the truth?

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,680
Your Highness, I didn't mean it.

22
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,640
I told them you were innocent.

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,680
Just tell us who the rascal is,

24
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,310
and His Majesty won't blame you.

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,040
Your Majesty,

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,120
I didn't mean to stir up trouble.

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,400
These days,

28
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,280
you've been so good to me,

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,070
and I'm deeply grateful.

30
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,510
If my humble existence

31
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,350
has bothered the lords,

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,950
I beg you to sentence me to death.

33
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,030
Consort Wei,

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
would you rather die
than revealing his identity?

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,640
Uncle, Jiarou said

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,350
this wasn't Consort Wei's intention.

37
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,920
She endured shame
to protect Father's reputation.

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,870
Why do you have to blame it on her?

39
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,680
What's wrong with you, Your Highness?

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,680
Why are you defending Consort Wei?

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
Your Majesty.

42
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,430
Just search the place.

43
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,310
If we find the evidence,
we'll know who he is.

44
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,800
Guards, search.

45
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,310
Aye.

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Your Majesty, we found it.

47
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,430
We found it at Consort Wei's place.

48
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,990
Open it.

49
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,870
Crown Prince, where's your bracelet?

50
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,080
Father,

51
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,870
I lost it yesterday.

52
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,280
How dare you?

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,060
- Your Majesty!
- Father!

54
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,000
Do you really want to

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,190
replace me so badly?

56
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,150
I wouldn't dare.

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,710
Your Majesty, this is strange.

58
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,750
How?

59
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,280
Why is it strange?

60
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,400
Get out, all of you!

61
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,190
Guards, take the Crown Prince back.

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,190
Without my permission,

63
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,590
he can't go anywhere!

64
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,520
I've been so focused on
Consort Wei's etiquette

65
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,630
that I forgot about your ambitions.

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
Get out!

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,870
His Majesty told us to go.

68
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,750
Let's go.

69
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,550
Get out!

70
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,590
Let's go.

71
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,870
You took the risk

72
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,430
just to take me down.

73
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,000
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

74
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,310
I was born in the filth.

75
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,360
I don't mind going to hell with you.

76
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,760
Brother,

77
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,480
please behave yourself.

78
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,120
Are you and my brother...

79
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,110
Your Highness,

80
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,430
I advise you to

81
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,070
stay out of this mess.

82
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's go.

83
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,320
I can't believe it!

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
How could you collude with an outsider
to deceive me

85
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,120
and betray the Crown Prince?

86
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,190
Do you want to ruin our family?

87
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
I have a clear conscience!

88
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,950
How dare you talk back?

89
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,390
Do you think you can
change your destiny with

90
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,630
a glance of the heaven's way?

91
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,870
Stop dreaming!

92
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,190
You're ruining yourself!

93
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,750
I just don't want to be a sacrifice.

94
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,390
Am I wrong?

95
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,800
If that's the case,

96
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,920
I'd rather die in pain.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,310
All women have endured this.

98
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
How could you say

99
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,120
you're a sacrifice?

100
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,950
You...

101
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,310
You need discipline!

102
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,150
Father!

103
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,430
Open your eyes and see.

104
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,430
What kind of country

105
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,870
are women living in?

106
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,600
Grandmother was a talented woman,

107
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,600
but she was trapped in the room
and died in despair.

108
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,000
Mother wanted to bear a son
for your prestige

109
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,070
and died of hemorrhage.

110
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,630
Because of a decree,

111
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,000
Aunt married an old widower.

112
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,040
Now it's my turn.

113
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,480
If this world wants me to die,

114
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,070
why can't I fight against the world?

115
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,200
Shut up!

116
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,160
Since ancient times,

117
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,270
men have always been the rulers.

118
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,950
Will rebellion

119
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,270
bring you any good?

120
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,870
But it doesn't mean it's the right way.

121
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
Father.

122
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,600
You know this nation is plagued by

123
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,920
the wrongful principles.

124
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,720
Why are you still so stubborn?

125
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,720
Do you want to make it worse?

126
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,470
Father.

127
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,430
Destruction brings rebirth.

128
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,070
This world is unjust,

129
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,920
but people will rise to fight.

130
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,270
Behind us,

131
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,630
there are countless women

132
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,870
who are exploited and oppressed.

133
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,560
You can't stop us.

134
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,560
It's not even dark,

135
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,950
and you're eager to serve me.

136
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,470
You know

137
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,160
I could've executed you, right?

138
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,560
My life is yours,

139
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,750
so it's up to you.

140
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,510
Wang Jiarou said you were wronged.

141
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,600
Why didn't you tell me about it?

142
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,160
Did you feel wronged,

143
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,560
or did you do it willingly?

144
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,560
Your Highness!

145
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,040
I can die,

146
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,560
but I can't be slandered.

147
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,430
If I did it willingly,

148
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,870
why would I tell Miss Wang?

149
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,720
I came here

150
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,510
to explain it to you.

151
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,560
Please have mercy

152
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,270
and send my remains to Wei.

153
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,270
Get up.

154
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,350
It's enough.

155
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,120
Go to Changle Palace more often
to learn proper etiquette.

156
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,160
Don't act like Grand Marshal's daughter.

157
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,270
You won't execute me?

158
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,750
I'm an emperor,

159
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,720
not the King of Hell.

160
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,840
What about the Crown Prince?

161
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,550
It's not entirely his fault.

162
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,840
If you hadn't been reckless,

163
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,150
he wouldn't have fallen for you.

164
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,910
You're right, Your Majesty.

165
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,710
Enough.

166
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,920
You may leave now.

167
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,000
Aye.

168
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,720
Your Highness,

169
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,360
leave this to me.

170
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,870
Okay.

171
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,910
Thank you, Uncle.

172
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,350
Your Highness.

173
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,320
According to our eye,

174
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,910
after meeting the Crown Prince,

175
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,910
the Guardian Duke sent a troop out.

176
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,960
Are they going after Yilan?

177
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,030
Follow them.

178
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,630
Aye.

179
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,390
A madwoman escaped!

180
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,240
Forget it, bring this one back first!

181
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,200
Go!

182
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,470
Your Highness!

183
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,600
Your Highness, bad news!

184
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,510
What happened?

185
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,030
I found this at the gate this morning.

186
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,280
It's...

187
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,510
It's...

188
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,680
Yilan!

189
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,030
It's Yilan!

190
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
I don't like the way you look at me.

191
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Consort Wei?

192
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,120
It's been a while. How have you been?

193
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,110
Yilan!

194
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,160
It's all my fault.

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,360
I shouldn't have let you go.

196
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,080
These days,

197
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,150
I've seen many

198
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,960
new sights on the road.

199
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,510
You can't imagine how happy I am.

200
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,870
That's enough.

201
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,510
Shiqi.

202
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,910
I'm happy now.

203
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Your mother wasn't caught.

204
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,600
There's still hope.

205
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,320
Let her go!

206
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,870
I'll do anything for you!

207
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,080
Kneel and beg me.

208
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,560
Don't beg him!

209
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,200
Shiqi...

210
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,440
Yilan!

211
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,230
Yilan!

212
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,440
Why are you so stupid?

213
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,150
I... I'm finally free.
