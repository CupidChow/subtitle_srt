=Episode 24=

3
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,500
Depose the late Crown Prince, Ouyang Heng.

4
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,490
His accomplices conspired with Wei

5
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,030
- Father has ordered me
- to occupy Shu

6
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,870
- to go to Shu
- and start a war.

7
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,490
- to eliminate the enemy.
- Ouyang Shao, the Fifth Prince

8
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,670
- Return soon.
- is now the Crown Prince.

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,150
- I'll wait for you.
- He'll lead the army

10
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,940
to Shu

11
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,920
- Sprout.
- to eliminate the traitors.

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,200
Do you love me?

13
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,280
When you return,

14
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,150
I will tell you in person.

15
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,950
(As long as the emperor is alive,)

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,150
(women will never live with dignity.)

17
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,710
(Ouyang Shao,)

18
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,150
(I'm sorry.)

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,400
Your Majesty.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,360
The Guardian Duke

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,920
and the Crown Prince are dead.

22
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,440
Consort Wei did well.

23
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,510
Servant.

24
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,160
Reward her.

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,640
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

26
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,200
The Shadow Palace is gone,

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,510
but its remnants must be eliminated.

28
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,200
Guards,

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,320
kill her!

30
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,270
Shao is the heir.

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,160
His life must be unblemished.

32
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,350
You...

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,320
Your Majesty.

34
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,990
I've been waiting for this day

35
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,480
for way too long.

36
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,630
Protect me!

37
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,710
Kill this vicious woman!

38
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,790
Protect me!

39
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,760
Your Majesty, your people aren't here.

40
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,320
Noble Consort,

41
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,040
we've been married for 20 years.

42
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,790
I even plan to pass my throne to Shao.

43
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,600
Why are you...

44
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,080
Why are you doing this to me?

45
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,550
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,270
Stop deceiving yourself.

47
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,320
You favored me

48
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,790
to break the late queen's heart.

49
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,670
You made Shao the heir

50
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,240
because you wanted to use him

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,040
to eliminate the Crown Prince's forces.

52
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,510
Everyone

53
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,320
is manipulated by you.

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,550
They're all pawns
to strengthen your power.

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,760
I didn't expect you, an ignorant woman,

56
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,390
to become smart one day.

57
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,030
Even if I die,

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,510
Shao will go to hell with me!

59
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,110
Your Majesty.

60
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,000
You used my daughter Chenxi

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,470
to trade for an army.

62
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,120
Are they waiting for

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,800
Shao to fall into the trap?

64
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,640
Your Highness, don't worry.

65
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,160
My sisters

66
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,590
formed a vanguard

67
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,350
to clear the threats.

68
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,240
Now His Highness has arrived safely.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,920
You...

70
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,480
You...

71
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,800
You...

72
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,720
Witches!

73
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,240
You're all witches!

74
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,560
Your Highness,
thank you for saving my life.

75
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,950
You should thank Shao.

76
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,470
He cares about you

77
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,510
and loves you so much.

78
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,470
If you died,

79
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,030
he'll be heartbroken.

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,560
Spread the message.

81
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,150
His Majesty is not feeling well

82
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,320
and needs to rest.

83
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,280
Aye.

84
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,350
Your Highness,

85
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,080
this can buy us some time,

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,200
but people will find out eventually.

87
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,440
Now that your son is far away,

88
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,880
we need someone to stabilize the court.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,470
I only trust you.

90
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,120
The emperor,
by the grace of heaven, decrees

91
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,560
that I'm not feeling well

92
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,760
and can't handle work.

93
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,830
Now that Heng is dead,

94
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,830
and Shao is on the front line,

95
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,270
only Consort Wei is wise enough

96
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,710
to consider for the people.

97
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
Moreover, she restored peace.

98
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,680
Now I make her Empress in Charge,

99
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,000
and the Grand Marshal will assist her.

100
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,320
End of the decree.

101
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,120
Long live the empress!

102
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,310
No.

103
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,790
No!

104
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,950
Maybe I was in a poor condition

105
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,760
and got the wrong answer.

106
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,080
It's the third time,

107
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,950
and it's still the same.

108
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,310
You should stop.

109
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,110
No, I can't.

110
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,440
This is a dire omen.

111
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,240
You and Ouyang Shao might...

112
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,000
become enemies.

113
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,880
It's the way of heaven.

114
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,270
(I killed his father.)

115
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,200
(He should hate me.)

116
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,080
Your Highness, news from the court.

117
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,160
His Majesty is gravely ill.

118
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,240
Consort Wei is in charge now.

119
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,710
(You really decided to harm my father.)

120
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,790
How's my mother?

121
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,640
She's staying in the palace

122
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,670
to take care of him.

123
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,840
Got it.

124
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,670
Here's my order.

125
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,680
We shall set off in 15 minutes

126
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,950
to clear the enemy for Her Majesty.

127
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,520
Aye.

128
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,840
I know she harmed my father,

129
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,080
but I just can't bear to hate her.

130
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,310
Let's go.

131
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,550
Your Majesty,

132
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,870
since the refugees came,

133
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,750
we've been short of relief supplies.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,950
We must do something.

135
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,120
That's right.

136
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,040
I suggest

137
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,950
we use the previous policy to expel them

138
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,800
and keep them outside the city.

139
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,440
Otherwise, no amount of grain

140
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,630
and gold

141
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,360
can fill up the vacancy.

142
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,320
Nonsense!

143
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,560
Most of the refugees are women.

144
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,630
They are healthy and intelligent.

145
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,110
They can still make a living

146
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,400
without relief.

147
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,350
If it weren't for Qi's wicked traditions,

148
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,520
if you hadn't regarded women
as lowly individuals

149
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,830
who can only serve men

150
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,720
and deprived their opportunities

151
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,080
to build a career and chase dreams,

152
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,110
how could they have ended up like this?

153
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,680
Here's my decree.

154
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,110
From now on,

155
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,560
a woman's talent shouldn't be
confined to housework.

156
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,160
They can take on

157
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,790
any occupations they like.

158
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,870
Men have ambitions,

159
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
but women can also
make great contributions.

160
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,440
Men and women should get
equal pay for equal work.

161
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,710
Whoever defies me

162
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,080
shall be executed!

163
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,950
Yes, Your Majesty!

164
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,120
Your Majesty, you're wise

165
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,470
and care about the people.

166
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,680
You're a great blessing for Qi.

167
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,320
We humbly request

168
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,440
that you follow the way of heaven

169
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,320
and take the throne.

170
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,590
Report!

171
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,110
The Fifth Prince was attacked in Shu

172
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
and died for our country!

173
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,400
This...

174
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,040
The Fifth Prince devoted his life
to the country

175
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,280
and made great contributions.

176
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,680
Grant him posthumous title

177
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,230
and bury him with utmost respect.

178
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,070
Aye.

179
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,660
(Five Years Later)

180
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,390
Yesterday,

181
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,600
according to the third national census,

182
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,110
half of the newborn babies are female.

183
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,350
The Women's Workshop
managed by Noble Consort

184
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,120
has seen a surge in applications

185
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,400
with various subsidies.

186
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,200
Moreover,

187
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,550
this Spring Imperial Exam

188
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,400
had 2,333 candidates,

189
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,440
and one-third of them are women.

190
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,680
The top tier includes 180 candidates,

191
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,200
and half of them are women.

192
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,470
These years, thanks to your help,

193
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,270
all women can finally live

194
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,280
with dignity.

195
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,750
It's no longer a dream

196
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,440
but a reality.

197
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,920
You may go rest now.

198
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,880
Aye.

199
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,670
I'm back.

200
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,100
(Five Years Ago)
The empress decrees

201
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,400
that you defeated the King of Wei

202
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,230
and protected the border.

203
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,790
You shall be rewarded.

204
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,820
(Imperial Edict)

205
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,440
Why are there two edicts?

206
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,680
The left one

207
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,630
appoints you as Jingyuan Duke

208
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,990
to guard Shu forever.

209
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,750
The right one says

210
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,800
you died for the nation.

211
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,750
Will you cut ties with her

212
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,510
(Imperial Edict)
or fake death to return

213
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,710
to reunite with her?

214
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,990
The empress leaves this question to you.

215
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,160
Sprout

216
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,660
is really cruel and stubborn.

217
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,620
(Imperial Edict)

218
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,520
Will you leave again?

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,920
No.

220
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,320
The King of Wei has surrendered,
no more worries.

221
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,110
From now on,

222
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,350
I only want to stay with you, Sprout.

223
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,590
But I don't have
that much time to spare.

224
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,070
It's okay.

225
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,160
You review the reports,
and I'll prepare the ink.

226
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,400
You start a school,

227
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,830
and I'll teach the students.

228
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
You build an orphanage,

229
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,630
and I'll take care of the kids.

230
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,110
You don't need to stay for me.

231
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,950
I'll follow you wherever you go.

232
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,640
Ouyang Shao,

233
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,680
have I ever told you

234
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,160
that I love you?

235
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,240
Yes, you have.

236
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,460
