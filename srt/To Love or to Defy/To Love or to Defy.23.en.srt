3
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,480
It's almost midnight.

4
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,030
Where is my mother?

5
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,790
Don't worry.

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,870
Maybe she got delayed on the way.

7
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,270
Oh, no.

8
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,150
No, the incense...

9
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,430
Ouyang Heng!

10
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,480
What a cozy room.

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,480
Di Shiqi,

12
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,760
I've been searching for you.

13
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,960
Guess

14
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,510
who I met at the door?

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,950
It was your mother.

16
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,760
Ouyang Heng!

17
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,950
What did you do to her?

18
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,390
What did you do?

19
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,630
Ouyang Heng!

20
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,840
Get off her!

21
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,990
No way!

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,720
Listen, Ouyang Shao.

23
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,360
She's mine.

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,400
Even if she's not mine,

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,710
she'll never be yours.

26
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,630
No.

27
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,600
She doesn't belong to anyone.

28
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,110
Shao!

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
Shao!

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,440
Sprout!

31
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,880
Sprout!

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,280
Get off me!

33
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,040
Sprout!

34
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,200
Get off me!

35
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,720
Ouyang Heng!

36
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,150
Ouyang Heng!

37
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,550
Give him the Ink Poison.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,760
Get off me!

39
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,440
You're so sad without him.

40
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,600
I'm going to take the throne.

41
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,670
What do you want?

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,760
I can give you everything.

43
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,160
Even if you don't want to live,

44
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,550
you must

45
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,920
think about your mother.

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,320
She's in the side room

47
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,990
waiting to reunite with you.

48
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,960
Don't touch my mother!

49
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,880
Eat well.

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,280
If you're well,

51
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,510
your mother will be safe.

52
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,800
Your Highness, it's ready.

53
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,710
Keep an eye on her.

54
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,040
Aye.

55
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,750
Shiqi.

56
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,430
Give up.

57
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,830
We can't defeat him.

58
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,280
Sai Qi,

59
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,830
think about your young sister.

60
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,590
Do you want to see her
imprisoned for life

61
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,760
and used by the Crown Prince
against you?

62
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,910
Help me bring Shao to the capital.

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,470
We can change everything.

64
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,900
(Sprout)

65
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,670
Your Majesty.

66
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,750
It's Me.

67
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,870
Your Highness,

68
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,040
we've rescued
His Majesty and Noble Consort

69
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,080
and sent them to a safe place.

70
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,080
As for Consort Wei and her mother,

71
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,830
their courtyard is heavily guarded.

72
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,320
We can't get inside.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,200
(Imperial City)
Tell me more.

74
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,950
The city gates are sealed.

75
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,310
The Crown Prince's men

76
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,800
have surrounded
all officials' residences.

77
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,920
I'm afraid he's planning something big.

78
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,320
Your Highness, we're out of time.

79
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,320
But we can't act rashly.

80
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,920
Sprout and her mother

81
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,640
might be held hostages

82
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,240
and get hurt.

83
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,750
Your Highness,

84
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,280
it's the Shadow Palace.

85
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,180
(Sprout)

86
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,170
Sprout...

87
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,510
One mile south of the city,
under the stove at the tea shop,

88
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,310
there's a secret tunnel
that he doesn't know.

89
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,480
The tea shop.

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,750
The Shadow Palace works for him.

91
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,760
Why would they be so kind?

92
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,710
Your Highness, it might be a trap.

93
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,220
(Imperial City)

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,030
I trust Sprout.

95
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,600
Ming'en,

96
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,320
lead your men into the city
through the tunnel

97
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,400
and attack them.

98
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,600
Aye.

99
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,700
(Sprout)

100
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,040
Mother!

101
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,550
You're awake.

102
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,040
Did you sleep well?

103
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,590
You poisoned my food.

104
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,640
Why did you do it?

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,120
I don't want to hurt you

106
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,030
or fight against you.

107
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,200
Why don't you understand?

108
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,120
You're afraid I'll ruin your plan.

109
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,120
But listen,

110
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,560
even without me,

111
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,320
you will still fail.

112
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,560
Because people won't support you.

113
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,830
You seem confident.

114
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,800
Are you waiting for Shao to come

115
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,710
and rescue you?

116
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,040
Unfortunately,

117
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,510
it won't happen.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,910
You knew Ouyang Shao was alive.

119
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,150
When I saw you alive,

120
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,560
I knew you had the antidote.

121
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,510
If I wanted to kill him,

122
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,950
how could I leave his body intact?

123
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,110
Shiqi, you were fooled again.

124
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,400
You let him go

125
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,110
to lure his soldiers out.

126
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,400
Sai Qi...

127
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,950
You deliberately made me turn her

128
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,630
and leak the false information,

129
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,800
and Ouyang Shao will meet a dead end.

130
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,560
How ruthless.

131
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,160
I like it.

132
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,230
Shao must be trapped now.

133
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,320
The Grand Marshal and Rebel Army

134
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,830
must've taken action.

135
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,870
Luckily, I buried

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,590
a thousand barrels of explosives there.

137
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,160
Shiqi,

138
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,230
the fireworks of blood and flesh

139
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,160
are my gift to you.

140
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,440
Do you like it?

141
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,110
You're a psycho!

142
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,630
Calm down, Shiqi.

143
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,750
Your lover is dead,

144
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,750
but your mother is still here.

145
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,110
Throw the knife over.

146
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,750
Go to hell!

147
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,310
Are you alright?

148
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,830
I'm fine.

149
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,560
You're Yue Ping, maid of Noble Consort.

150
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,110
No wonder.

151
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,280
I heard

152
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,160
Master's trail was found
near the Hui River.

153
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,000
It's false.

154
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,120
I leaked the information.

155
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,830
Why did you do that?

156
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,400
It's time to put an end to this.

157
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,320
What do you mean?

158
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,910
The Fifth Prince found

159
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,800
the Shadow Palace's
list of dead sisters.

160
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,200
My mother is dead.

161
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,280
We haven't found evidence
against the Crown Prince,

162
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,710
but we found a list of Di Assassins.

163
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,140
(Ziyan, Dou, Yao, Yan, Shan)

164
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,600
Master...

165
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,200
Back then, my mother

166
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,950
lured them away to protect me

167
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,750
and disappeared.

168
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,280
Over the past ten years,

169
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,110
I've been searching for her.

170
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,310
However,

171
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,110
she died ten years ago.

172
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,120
I want revenge.

173
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,030
No wonder the person

174
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,910
I searched for years

175
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,110
suddenly appeared.

176
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,710
Di Shiqi,

177
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,590
we're the same kind of people.

178
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,950
We'd do whatever it takes
to reach our goals.

179
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,800
Ouyang Shao is too ignorant

180
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,710
to be with you.

181
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,990
He only likes your good side.

182
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,400
But I

183
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,360
love the way you are!

184
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,280
Shut up!

185
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,040
You can't compare to him at all!

186
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,830
You love destruction.

187
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,160
But he

188
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,870
has saved me many times.

189
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,110
It's over.

190
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,040
You've lost.

191
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,950
No...

192
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,190
Don't move.

193
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,750
