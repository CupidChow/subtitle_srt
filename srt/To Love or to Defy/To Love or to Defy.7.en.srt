=Episode 7=

3
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,750
It's the Fifth Prince.

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
He likes Her Highness
and doesn't want her

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,200
to sleep with the emperor.

6
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,760
He likes her?

7
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,920
Do you like him too?

8
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,040
No, no!

9
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,150
We didn't know about

10
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,150
His Majesty's disease.

11
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,000
The Fifth Prince meant well,

12
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,480
but it delayed our mission.

13
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,000
Her Highness kept silent
to protect the innocent.

14
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,600
Master,

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm telling the truth.

16
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,070
Your Highness, I'm impressed.

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,840
You even persuaded Shao

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,120
to drug Father.

19
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,280
He was more impressive.

20
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,870
I don't know how he did it.

21
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,640
Isn't it easy for you to find out?

22
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,120
I want proof

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,350
of Ouyang Shao's misconduct.

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,710
Don't let me down again.

25
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,240
Our body is our weapon,

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,360
but Master didn't give me
medicine for scars.

27
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,750
It means he's already abandoned me.

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,680
Shiqi,

29
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,280
will you blame me
for mentioning the Fifth Prince?

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,960
Of course not.

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,680
Master has noticed something.

32
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,360
He'll figure it out sooner or later.

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,080
Even if you didn't say it,

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,630
I wouldn't keep silent forever.

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,400
We can't let Master

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
control us forever.

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,080
The emperor won't sleep with me for now,

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,400
so Master won't hurt us

39
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,400
or kill my mother.

40
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,400
We still have time

41
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,310
to find the antidote for the Ink Poison.

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,840
I once met a pharmacist in a brothel.

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,470
He has a unique skill.

44
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,360
He can create antidotes for all poisons,

45
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,560
but he needs the poison.

46
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,910
Then we'll find a way to get
the Ink Poison.

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,400
In that case,

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,560
we'll not only escape from here

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,910
but also live with dignity.

50
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,030
Shiqi,

51
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,360
you're all I have.

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,560
We agreed

53
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,870
to enter and leave the palace together.

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,840
If there's no way for us to survive,

55
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,870
we'll make our own way.

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,080
Master wants proof of
the Fifth Prince's misconduct.

57
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,710
What's your plan?

58
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
I will see him.

59
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,070
Mother, what's the matter?

60
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,000
Your father's Paralysis
came unexpectedly.

61
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,800
We must investigate it.

62
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,510
I thought about it earlier,

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,750
and I think Consort Wei did this.

64
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,480
I was so foolish.

65
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,270
I even wanted to make friends with her.

66
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,800
But after all, she is from Wei.

67
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,160
It wasn't her.

68
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,520
You...

69
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Do you know who did this?

70
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,910
It was me.

71
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Have you lost your mind?

72
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,320
Mother,

73
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,000
I replaced Father's sleeping incense.

74
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,430
I didn't want her to sleep with him.

75
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,680
Shao,

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,390
how could you be so stupid?

77
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,560
We can only count on your father.

78
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,350
Do you...

79
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,510
Do you like Consort Wei?

80
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,240
She doesn't belong here
in the first place.

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,950
Did Consort Wei force you?

82
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,270
She was unaware

83
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,870
the whole time.

84
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,680
Nor did she ask for my help.

85
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,510
Mother, don't worry.

86
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,040
The incense I used is harmless.

87
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
It just contains an herb

88
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,040
that conflicts with Father's medicine.

89
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,370
Moreover,

90
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,040
I've already taken care of the incense.

91
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,390
Even if they suspect me,

92
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
they won't find anything.

93
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,790
Tell me,

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,430
what spell has Consort Wei cast on you?

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,480
I don't know.

96
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,910
Mother,

97
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,310
since childhood,

98
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,920
I've seen many eyes

99
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,800
in the palace.

100
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
They're sad,

101
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,230
frightened,

102
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,750
cunning, or submissive.

103
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,600
But her eyes...

104
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,270
Even in darkness,

105
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,430
she never surrenders.

106
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,870
Ouyang Shao,

107
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,430
do you know how many people
count on you to survive?

108
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,000
Are you going to ignore them?

109
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,800
But I can't ignore her.

110
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,030
Shao!

111
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
I want proof

112
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,630
of Ouyang Shao's misconduct.

113
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,750
Don't let me down again.

114
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,920
(Ouyang Shao,)

115
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,360
(what should I do?)

116
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,240
Isn't it a pity

117
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,870
that you enjoy

118
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,950
the beautiful moonlight alone?

119
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm useless.

120
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,830
I couldn't invite the Fifth Prince here.

121
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,360
You couldn't,

122
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,040
or you didn't invite him at all?

123
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,560
To leave the Shadow Palace,

124
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,920
we need to rely on our blades.

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,270
Do you mean...

126
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,070
We must kill Master to survive.

127
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,480
Moreover, I've figured out

128
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,070
how to get the Ink Poison.

129
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,310
How?

130
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,310
The antidote of the Ink Poison

131
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,720
has been hidden well.

132
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,560
But as for the poison,

133
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,870
Master doesn't guard it closely but

134
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,480
place it in the punishment room

135
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,240
so that he can use it anytime.

136
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,670
Go to the punishment room?

137
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,750
That's right.

138
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,150
If I make a mistake, I'll get in.

139
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,390
However, our future is uncertain.

140
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,440
I can't let him take risks for me again.

141
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,670
Our force has infiltrated the city.

142
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,320
It's easy to control the city.

143
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,240
Master, why waste so much time?

144
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,390
Let our people act
before my father's eyes?

145
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,600
Do you want to get me into trouble

146
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
or benefit Shao?

147
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,750
I wouldn't dare.

148
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,840
If you don't want to invite him,

149
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,150
I'll do it myself.

150
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,030
I hope

151
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,000
you can finish the show
according to the script.

152
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,390
This is Enchanting Snake.

153
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,000
You served the former master

154
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,200
for quite a long time.

155
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,240
You should know the effect well.

156
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
You...

157
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,120
Just wait patiently for Shao.

158
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,440
Your Highness!

159
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,680
Your Highness!

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,840
Your Highness!

161
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,420
Your Highness,

162
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,270
Consort Wei encountered trouble
in the West Garden

163
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,480
and asked you over.

164
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,990
Your Highness!

165
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,080
Your Highness!

166
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,960
Your Highness!

167
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,800
Come on.

168
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,200
Your Highness,

169
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,910
do you mean someone saw the Fifth Prince

170
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,720
meeting with Consort Wei in the garden?

171
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:18,830
Exactly.

172
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,150
This could damage our reputation.

173
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,510
We must investigate thoroughly.

174
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,510
Your Highness.

175
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,800
Are you alright?

176
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,630
What happened?

177
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,910
We found the prince's pendant

178
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,200
at the door of the west chamber.

179
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,300
(Wang Shouxin, Grand Marshal of Qi)

180
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,160
This...

181
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,000
Could it be that they're in the room...

182
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,870
Let's check it out.

183
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,920
Lead the way.

184
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,590
