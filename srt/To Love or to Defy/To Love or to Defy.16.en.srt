00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,200
(It was just a dream.)

4
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,230
Ming'en, I foresaw danger today.

5
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,040
You must protect me.

6
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,950
If there's danger,

7
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,280
why don't you stay at home?

8
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,000
How can I

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,510
not worry about Yuan?

10
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,870
Look, she's smiling!

11
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,430
She's smiling!

12
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,430
Be gentle.

13
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,600
Don't let her find out.

14
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,550
I told you there'd be danger.

15
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,760
Look.

16
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,280
This is...

17
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,310
(Ziyan, Dou, Yao, Yan, Shan)

18
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,230
This is Yilan.

19
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,600
This is Shisan.

20
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,390
This is little Shiba.

21
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,040
In the army,

22
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,320
if a soldier's body is missing,

23
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,600
we write their names on bamboo slips.

24
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,040
Leaves fall to the ground,

25
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,440
just as people return home.

26
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,710
How do you know their names?

27
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
I've been investigating
the Shadow Palace.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,360
Though we haven't found
evidence against the Crown Prince,

29
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,760
we found a registry of Di Assassins.

30
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,740
(Ziyan, Dou, Yao, Yan, Shan)

31
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,440
Thank you.

32
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,990
I know you've been blaming yourself,

33
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,790
but it's not your fault.

34
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,990
We should blame the Crown Prince,
the Shadow Palace,

35
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,390
and the existing system.

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,320
Our mission

37
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,990
is to live on with their spirits.

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,480
Okay.

39
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,700
(Ziyan, Dou, Yao, Yan, Shan)

40
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,220
(Will report to His Majesty.)

41
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,160
Master,

42
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,560
Prime Minister of Wei

43
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,510
has written a letter.

44
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,270
He will send it to His Majesty.

45
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,910
Your pulse is stable.

46
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,030
The poison is suppressed for now.

47
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,830
If you can't bear the pain,

48
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,320
take this medicine for relief.

49
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,920
But remember, do not overuse it.

50
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,630
Take it only once a month.

51
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,390
Otherwise, it'll worsen the poison

52
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,120
and make you suffer.

53
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,480
Okay.

54
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,350
Your Highness.

55
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,390
The poison has taken effect.

56
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,320
You're so weak right now.

57
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,080
Do you think you can kill me?

58
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,320
You sneaked into a consort's room

59
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,880
with ill intentions.

60
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,760
You should be executed!

61
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,240
Di Shiqi,

62
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,510
if you kneel and beg me,

63
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,270
I'll grant you the antidote.

64
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,590
Stop dreaming.

65
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,560
Get off me!

66
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,150
I've been lenient with you.

67
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,710
If it were anyone else,

68
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,750
they would've died a thousand times.

69
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,320
Why do you still want to betray me?

70
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,640
Is it

71
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,350
really because of Shao, that loser?

72
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,200
Are you still up?

73
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,600
Well,

74
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,470
the Fifth Prince met the favored consort

75
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,950
but was caught in the act.

76
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,120
What an interesting story, isn't it?

77
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,030
It's between us.

78
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,830
Why involve others?

79
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,120
Only when he's involved

80
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,270
are you willing to speak more, right?

81
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,910
Your Highness, are you all right?

82
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,000
Should I invite him in

83
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,590
and let him see you like this?

84
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,270
It's late, please leave.

85
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,200
I just need to tell you one thing.
Then I'll leave.

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,270
I'm already in bed.

87
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,190
Please don't come in.

88
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,640
If you insist,

89
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,200
I will tell His Majesty.

90
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,520
Okay.

91
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,040
I'll take my leave.

92
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,550
Get off me!

93
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,320
Your Highness, you're so smart.

94
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,400
You used Father as an excuse.

95
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,920
However, he's not a fool.

96
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,990
Does he know

97
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,470
you're not alone?

98
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,560
Your Highness,

99
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,480
message from the East Palace.

100
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,990
His Majesty wants to see you.

101
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,110
It's the second time
the poison has acted, right?

102
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,440
You love Shao so deeply,

103
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,080
so why should I give you the antidote?

104
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,830
Next time, beg me on your knees.

105
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,680
Otherwise, I'd have to
collect your body.

106
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Sprout!

107
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,350
It really hurts!

108
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,550
Mom...

109
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,470
Mom, I can't bear it anymore.

110
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,040
Come on.

111
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,400
It's alright.

112
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,440
It's alright.

113
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,360
I'm here.

114
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,310
You'll be fine.

115
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,950
You'll be fine.

116
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,950
Prime Minister Li from Wei

117
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,580
(Report)
will come in person.

118
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,910
They've never sent

119
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,510
such an important figure before.

120
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,120
I think the King of Wei
really wants to make peace

121
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,320
with us.

122
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,350
We solved this with just a few women.

123
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,710
It's far better than starting a war.

124
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,630
Your Majesty, you're truly wise.

125
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,080
I heard

126
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,440
Prime Minister Li once taught
Consort Wei etiquette,

127
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,350
and Consort Wei respects him very much.

128
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
I think

129
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,630
maybe Consort Wei should

130
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,680
accompany us during this visit

131
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,080
to show that we've
treated their princess well,

132
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,750
which can showcase our sincerity.

133
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,200
Foreign visitors

134
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,320
are really important.

135
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,280
How can women be involved?

136
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,520
Guardian Duke,

137
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,710
you have your own reasons.

138
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,960
Your Majesty, you always

139
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,830
see through everything.

140
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,240
Last time, I believed a rumor

141
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,470
and wronged Consort Wei.

142
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,400
I'd like to use this chance
to apologize to her.

143
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,670
That's thoughtful.

144
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,160
Okay.

145
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,800
You'll arrange

146
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,200
Prime Minister Li's visit.

147
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,560
- Thanks, Your Majesty.
- Thank you.

148
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,950
(Imperial Edict)
The Emperor, by the grace of heaven,

149
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,360
decrees that Qi and Wei are now allies

150
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,830
with great marriages.

151
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,630
The King of Wei
has sent the prime minister

152
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,000
to visit Qi.

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,720
Consort Wei and Guardian Duke

154
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,990
shall treat
Prime Minister of Wei together.

155
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,520
End of the decree.

156
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,590
I accept the decree with gratitude.

157
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,940
(Six Days Before the Wei Envoy Arrives)

158
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,190
Come on.

159
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,560
Your Highness, don't worry.

160
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,230
His Highness already knew this.

161
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,800
He's waiting at the Imperial Garden.
