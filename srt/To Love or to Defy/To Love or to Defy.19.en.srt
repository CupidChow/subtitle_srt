3
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,870
This is my choice.

4
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,600
Sprout...

5
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,680
Consort Wei harmed the prince.

6
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,040
Send her to the death row!

7
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,760
- Await further orders!
- Yes!

8
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,070
(The Ink Poison...)

9
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,640
(The poison is gone.)

10
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,080
This is my choice.

11
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,360
I'm not afraid of death.

12
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,590
Even if I have to die in your hands,

13
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,870
I will die without regret.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,960
Idiot...

15
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,590
Is this how you look at your master?

16
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,960
Master...

17
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,710
You asked me to kill Ouyang Shao,

18
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,280
but you set me up
and caught me on the spot.

19
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,910
I'm just an abandoned pawn.

20
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,750
If I wanted to abandon you,

21
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,590
I wouldn't have come.

22
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,030
However, I'm quite curious.

23
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,190
Is it because you lack practice

24
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,400
and became weak,

25
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,710
or do you

26
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,910
love him so much

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,240
that you couldn't bear to kill him?

28
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,310
Unfortunately,

29
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,080
you might've shown mercy,

30
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,630
yet with that stab,

31
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,590
you two will never

32
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,520
get back together.

33
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,870
There was never
anything special between us.

34
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,190
Master, I hope you can keep your word

35
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,470
and save me.

36
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,520
What did you call me?

37
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,750
Say it again.

38
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,240
(Make him happy)

39
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,520
(and let him save me,)

40
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,280
(and there'll be evidence of
his connections with the Shadow Palace.)

41
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,870
Master.

42
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,150
This can ease the Ink Poison.

43
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,310
Stay here for now.

44
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,390
When the time is right,

45
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,240
I will rescue you

46
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,120
and take you back.

47
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,480
(Ouyang Shao,)

48
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,190
(let me protect you this time.)

49
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,680
How is Shao?

50
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,430
Your Highness,

51
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
His Highness's wounds are strange.

52
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,870
Consort Wei

53
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,430
didn't hurt his vital points.

54
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,590
Normally,

55
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,190
His Highness shouldn't be this ill.

56
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,000
But why is he

57
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,120
still unconscious?

58
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,630
In my opinion,

59
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,190
first, his old wounds haven't healed.

60
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,150
- Second...
- What is it?

61
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,040
The poison inside him
hasn't been cleared.

62
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
The injury disturbed his vital energy,

63
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,870
and the poison attacked his heart,

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,950
causing unconsciousness.

65
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,960
Poison?

66
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,310
How could he

67
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,830
be poisoned?

68
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,520
Well...

69
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,270
I don't know about that.

70
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,520
Sprout,

71
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,720
he looks like a dog.

72
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,230
Sprout.

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
Why?

74
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,480
Why?

75
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,950
I've told you

76
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,040
I only want him,

77
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
not you.

78
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,400
Shao!

79
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,710
Shao!

80
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,680
Witch! Witch!

81
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,830
Your Majesty, please calm down.

82
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,950
Consort Wei harmed the prince.

83
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,430
She deserves to die.

84
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,750
However, she's still the tie

85
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,800
between two nations.

86
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,640
Your Majesty,

87
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,680
I heard his daughter
is close to Consort Wei.

88
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,590
Well,

89
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,360
is the Grand Marshal also close to her?

90
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,680
Do you want to defend her?

91
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,520
You...

92
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,390
That's not what I meant.

93
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,190
However, we've finally
made peace with Wei.

94
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,750
If we start another war,

95
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,510
I'm afraid it won't do any good to us.

96
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,240
Your Majesty, please think it through.

97
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,200
Your Majesty,

98
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,360
Consort Wei has committed a grave crime.

99
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,470
If we don't kill her,

100
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,430
Qi's reputation will be ruined!

101
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,470
As for Wei,

102
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,830
I will write a letter
to explain the reason.

103
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,870
She's committed a grave crime.

104
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,040
I believe the King of Wei
will accept it.

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,840
Your Majesty...

106
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,430
The witch will be executed
in three days.

107
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,830
If the King of Wei starts a war,

108
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,480
I'll fight till the end!

109
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,720
Shao, Shao!

110
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,120
Shao, you're finally awake!

111
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,960
Mother,

112
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,240
how long has it been?

113
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,720
Where is Consort Wei? Where is she?

114
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,040
Why are you still thinking of her?

115
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,160
She nearly killed you!

116
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,120
Why can't you wake up?

117
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,360
Your Highness, don't dwell on it.

118
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,000
His Majesty has decreed

119
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,600
Consort Wei will be
executed in three days.

120
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,760
Shut up.

121
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,710
Executed?

122
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,630
No, no!

123
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,560
Mother, Consort Wei was framed.

124
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,750
I must speak to Father!

125
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,680
Shao, Shao!

126
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,480
Shao!

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,040
What spell did Consort Wei cast on you?

128
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,390
You'd even risk your life
to protect her!

129
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,270
I won't explain anymore.

130
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,470
Your Highness!

131
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,880
Shao!

132
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
Fine, I'll talk to him.

133
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,630
You must rest well.

134
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,550
Keep a close eye on him.

135
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't let him leave the room.

136
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,280
Aye.

137
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Thank you, Mother.

138
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,710
Shao.

139
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,550
Your Majesty,

140
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,100
(Three Days Before the Envoy Arrives)
Noble Consort and Consort Wei are here.

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

142
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,840
How could you report to my father

143
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,680
without my permission?

144
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,720
She's ruined many plans of ours.

145
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,790
Shouldn't we kill her?

146
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,840
Even if she must die,

147
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,390
I should be the executor!

148
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,750
The envoy will arrive in three days.

149
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,320
Three days...

150
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,600
Write a letter to him.

151
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,270
Ask him to plead for Consort Wei.

152
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,840
Your Highness!

153
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,510
I can't do this!

154
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,080
If you don't write, I will!

155
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,590
- Your Highness!
- Speak!

156
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,630
His Majesty wants to
execute Consort Wei!

157
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,120
Father, are you okay?

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,910
This is outrageous.

159
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,000
I favored

160
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,600
this lowly woman

161
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,750
and slept with her.

162
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,600
How dare she show no gratitude?

163
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,960
This witch...

164
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,390
The assassination isn't over.

165
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,590
Father,

166
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,960
let me handle this.

167
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
With severe punishment,
she will tell the truth!

168
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,230
No need.

169
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,790
I've sentenced her to death.

170
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,630
She said she wanted to thank me,

171
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,440
so I agreed to see her.

172
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,360
Who'd have known she'd be so bold

173
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,510
that she tried to harm me?

174
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,480
This witch!

175
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,320
It was a desperate act.

176
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,350
Father,

177
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,270
let me handle this.

178
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,750
- Let me...
- She's already dead.

179
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,320
However, she's
the princess of Wei after all.

180
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,390
I granted her dignity.

181
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,080
As for the body,

182
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,390
she should be buried with
those nasty servants.

183
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,870
Otherwise, it'd stain the royal shrine.

184
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,870
That's the right thing to do.

185
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,030
However, how could

186
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,200
a lowly woman plot this?

187
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,230
Could it be

188
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,790
related to the Shadow Palace
Shao is investigating?

189
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,560
Son,

190
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,870
what do you think?

191
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,350
Father,

192
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,630
after all,

193
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,440
she's the princess of Wei.

194
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,240
I will figure out

195
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,360
if she works for the Shadow Palace.

196
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,360
But before that,

197
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,870
please allow me

198
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,720
to write to

199
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,240
the prime minister of Wei

200
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,030
to explain the situation.

201
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,030
He will surely

202
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,200
feel guilt towards Qi

203
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,350
and be grateful

204
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,320
for your kindness!

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,840
Okay.

206
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,920
Son.

207
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,750
This is the true wisdom.

208
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,750
You may proceed.

209
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,840
(Shiqi...)

210
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,000
(You've been lying to me.)

211
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,960
(You never wanted to come back to me.)
