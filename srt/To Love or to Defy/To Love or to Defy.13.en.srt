Yilan,

4
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,560
why are you so stupid?

5
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,520
Didn't we agree

6
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,000
to survive together?

7
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,190
Shiqi.

8
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,400
You're free.

9
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,710
Yilan!

10
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,790
Yilan!

11
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,760
You deserve to die!

12
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,120
You should go to hell!

13
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,220
Your Highness,

14
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,230
Guardian Duke really stopped Yilan.

15
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,260
What about our people?

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,840
He used the terrain for an ambush.

17
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,680
We only saved the middle-aged woman,

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,680
but Miss Yilan was taken away.

19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,280
Let's go to the East Palace.

20
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,870
Do you really want to kill me?

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,240
What's your relationship with Shao?

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,870
Did he touch you? Which hand?

23
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,590
I meant to spare your life,

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,240
but you're dirty now.

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,400
You're disgusting!

26
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,680
Your Highness,
the doctor outside the palace

27
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
has treated Her Highness's wound.

28
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,520
It's not serious,

29
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,960
but she must rest well.

00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,760

No.

67
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,440
You should leave.

68
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,560

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,430

I'm not afraid of death.

77
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,520
I love you.

78
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,430
But maybe I'm not the person
you really love.

79
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,070
You love Princess Abi Ya, the woman

80
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,560
who longs for freedom
and would escape to be free,

81
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,720
instead of me, Consort Wei.

82
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,480
No matter who you are,

83
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,680
no matter where you come from,

84
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,390

What if I'm not Princess Abi Ya?

87
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,270
I knew it all along.

88
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,310
But does it really matter?

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,690
I'm glad

90
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,560
you chose to tell me everything.

91
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,920
But you must stay strong.

92
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,430
Like you said,

93
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,240
there are still many sisters

94
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,800
waiting for you to rescue them.

95
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,750
Can I really make it?

96
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,150
You can.

97
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,000
I will help you.

98
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,590
Yes.

99
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,120
There are many sisters

100
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
like Yilan and Shiba

101
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,680
waiting for me.

102
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,910
If you need anything,

103
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,480
ask Chuncan to tell me.

104
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,080
Don't worry.

105
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,960
I've arranged guards here.

106
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,270
No one can hurt you.

107
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,940
By the way,

108
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,270
when they tried to rescue Yilan,

109
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,240
did they find

110
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,510
a crazy woman?

111
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,030
They brought her back.

112
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,350
Really?

113
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,510
Where is she now?

114
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,510
I want to see her!

115
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,360
The Crown Prince's eyes are everywhere.

116
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,280
It's not easy.

117
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,670
You should rest well.

118
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,120
I'll arrange your meeting.

119
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,790
When can I see her?

120
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,630
Is she important to you?

121
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,840
She is my mother.

122
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,200
Master,

123
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
the Fifth Prince hid the madwoman
in the capital.

124
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,720
We couldn't find her.

125
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,600
Should we send more people?

126
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,710
No need.

127
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,870
Keep a close eye on the Changle Palace.

128
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,960
If the Fifth Prince
takes Consort Wei out,

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,910
capture them immediately.

130
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,750
Aye.

131
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

132
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,600
His Highness said he'd bring her here.

133
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,840
Please be patient.

134
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,030
How do I look?

135
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,000
Your Highness, you still look beautiful.

136
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,080
I wonder if she will recognize me.

137
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,710
Your Highness.

138
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,200
Where is my mother?

139
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,150
Don't worry, I've arranged everything.

140
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,990
Then let's go.

141
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,510
My brother's men are here.

142
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,390
What should we do?

143
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,390
They won't find anything.

144
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,200
Don't catch a cold.

145
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
It's okay.

146
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,870
Mother, do you remember me?
