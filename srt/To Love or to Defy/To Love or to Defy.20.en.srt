3
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,150
His Highness is fine,

4
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,790
but his energy hasn't fully recovered.

5
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,000
He needs to rest well.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you, doctor.

7
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,760
Mother,

8
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,280
he said I was fine.

9
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,920
Please let me talk to Father.

10
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,870
I talked to him,

11
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,590
and he agreed to spare Consort Wei.

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,360
I should see him myself.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,030
It's late at night.

14
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,870
You should wait until tomorrow.

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,200
Mother,

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,790
are you hiding something from me?

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,840
Shao.

18
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,720
Consort Wei was audacious.

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,030
She tried to harm your father.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,390
Your father has

21
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,350
executed her.

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,040
No.

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,710
Mother, are you

24
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,280
joking with me?

25
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,000
It's true.

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,640
No, you're lying.

27
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,280
You must be lying. I'll find her.

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,200
- Shao!
- Your Highness!

29
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,630
Never mind.

30
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,990
Let him go.

31
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,400
Perhaps only by seeing it

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,510
can he move on.

33
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,790
Ming'en,

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
protect Shao.

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,280
Aye.

36
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,040
Move!

37
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,630
Let's go.

38
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,440
Sprout, come with me.

39
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,360
We'll go to a distant town

40
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,550
to do business

41
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,550
or go to a beautiful place

42
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,360
to live a carefree farming life.

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,270
Anyway, let's leave this place.

44
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,270
Actually, as long as I'm with you,

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,230
I can go anywhere.

46
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,950
You don't know how much I wanted

47
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,110
to give up everything and go with you.

48
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,480
But I can't.

49
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,670
Sprout,

50
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,950
have you thought about

51
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,790
what kind of life you want?

52
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,950
I wouldn't dare to think.

53
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,110
Since I was born,

54
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,790
none of my wishes have ever come true.

55
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,710
Therefore,

56
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,080
I gradually stopped making wishes.

57
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,600
Since fate is unjust,

58
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,390
then I'll stay with you.

59
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,360
Because I believe

60
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,640
we can conquer fate.

61
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,270
Is my willingness

62
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,200
really worth such risk?

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,270
I fell in love with someone.

64
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,360
He's got a pretty face,

65
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,950
good handwriting,

66
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,080
and fine martial arts,

67
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,440
and he often helps me.

68
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,070
If I had known

69
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,440
I'd fall for him,

70
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,710
when I first met him,

71
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,150
I would've knocked him out

72
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,440
and hidden him away

73
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,760
for a lifetime.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,320
Your Highness, there seem to be

75
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,560
tears in your eyes.

76
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,350
I rarely smile.

77
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,950
Over time, I forgot how to smile.

78
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,200
I'm trapped in this tiny place,
struggling every day.

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,830
Should I feel happy about it?

80
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,510
I don't want to escape.

81
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,030
Take me away.

82
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,310
I can't go back home anymore.

83
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,630
I don't want to see such tragedies

84
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,560
happen again.

85
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,800
Now that you've bought her,
why don't you want

86
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,950
to see her?

87
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,800
I want her to be truly free.

88
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,120
Why did you get her killed?

89
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,150
Why?

90
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,390
Do you really think

91
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,880
Di Shiqi belongs to you?

92
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,320
Let me tell you.

93
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,000
You're just a pawn.

94
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,440
She's mine.

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,030
She must do

96
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,680
whatever I tell her to do,

97
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,360
even if it's to die.

98
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,910
You should go to hell!

99
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,550
Your Highness!

100
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,080
It's about Consort Wei's mother.

101
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,440
Come on, kill me.

102
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,680
Ouyang Shao,

103
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,270
you're a coward!

104
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,350
I guess you don't love her that much.

105
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,950
I've changed my mind.

106
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,640
I'll spare your life.

107
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,190
I'll make you pay for

108
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,800
what you've put her through.

109
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,950
Don't you dare die,

110
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,200
Ouyang Heng.

111
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,910
You said

112
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,350
there was news about her mother.

113
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,840
We heard

114
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,950
that someone saw her near the Hui River.

115
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,120
We searched for three days
and really found her.

116
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,680
Your Highness, don't be reckless again.

117
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,080
I bear not just vengeance,

118
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,880
but Sprout's mission.

119
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Your Highness, that's right.

120
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,720
As for today's matter,

121
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,350
I'm afraid the East Palace...

122
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,240
They're tied to the Shadow Palace.

123
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,200
The Crown Prince won't do it blatantly.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,920
Tell them

125
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,120
to guard against their schemes.

126
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,430
Aye.

127
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,060
(Three Days Later)
Your Majesty,

128
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,390
I've informed

129
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,760
the King of Wei of Abi Ya's death.

130
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,030
Wei didn't teach our women well

131
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,710
and chose the wrong person.

132
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,630
I apologize for this.

133
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,990
To maintain the friendship
between Qi and Wei,

134
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,200
I'll offer a thousand taels of gold

135
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,630
and a great amount of grain

136
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,160
as an apology.

137
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,710
Okay.

138
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,830
Now that the King of Wei
has shown sincerity,

139
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,750
I shall

140
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,320
send people to Wei to receive the gifts.

141
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,800
Father, you're wise.

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,160
In my opinion,

143
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,630
Shao escorted Princess Abi Ya back,

144
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,920
so he should be familiar with the route.

145
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,470
He should be the one

146
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,160
receiving the gifts.

147
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,350
If we send a prince

148
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,990
to handle this,

149
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,990
it'll showcase our generosity.

150
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,190
Okay.

151
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,240
Shao,

152
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,320
you'll handle this.

153
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,160
Receive the diplomatic corps
with utmost respect

154
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,230
to show our sincerity.

155
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,080
(He wanted me to do this.)

156
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,950
(I'm sure the Shadow Palace
will block me.)

157
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,190
Aye.

158
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

159
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,670
Uncle,

160
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,110
do you believe Di Shiqi is really dead?

161
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,910
Our men buried her at the Mass Grave.

162
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,950
How could that be false?

163
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,080
But she wouldn't be so reckless.

164
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,750
Your Highness,

165
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,160
please don't be so suspicious.

166
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,800
Our biggest threat is gone.

167
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,110
If we don't seize power right now,

168
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,520
someone else will take it.

169
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,670
Moreover,

170
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,800
the emperor thinks you have
something to do with the Shadow Palace,

171
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,560
and Shao is investigating it.

172
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,310
Your Highness?

173
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,470
Your Highness?

174
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,120
Your Highness,

175
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,040
you must plan ahead.

176
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,950
Di Shiqi,

177
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,800
if you knew this,

178
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,750
would you want to meet me?

179
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,870
I knew it!

180
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,830
Di Shiqi.

181
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,160
You've deceived us all.

182
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,120
Don't worry.

183
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,160
As long as you're alive,

184
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,800
you'll never escape from me.

185
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,920
Here's my order.

186
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,870
All members of the Shadow Palace

187
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,230
must search for Di Shiqi.

188
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,800
Alive or dead, bring her to me.

189
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,070
- Aye!
- Aye!

190
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,280
Your Highness,

191
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,800
the diplomatic corps are doing well.

192
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,320
Have you checked all the members?

193
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,630
Our enemy is in the dark.

194
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,990
We must be cautious.

195
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,590
Don't worry,

196
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,590
they're all our brothers.

197
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,000
But I don't understand

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,860
why His Majesty

199
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,440
had to let us handle this.

200
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,080
He's always capricious.

201
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,230
I don't know what he really wants.

202
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,390
Forget it.

203
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,350
It's his order.

204
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,750
We have to obey it.

205
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,590
How about Consort Wei's mother?

206
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,630
No new information yet.

207
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,510
However,

208
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,750
there's something strange.

209
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,670
Speak.

210
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,520
It seems the Shadow Palace has sent

211
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,590
many assassins to look for someone.

212
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,400
Shouldn't he be thinking about
how to deal with us?

213
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,630
Who's worth all the effort?

214
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,870
Could it be...

215
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,280
