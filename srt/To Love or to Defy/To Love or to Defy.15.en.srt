3
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,440
Your Majesty,

4
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,470
I beg you to uphold justice!

5
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,720
I'm just a princess
for peace-making marriage,

6
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,310
and I'm grateful for your favor.

7
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,200
But now they're
humiliating me like this.

8
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,640
They're disrespecting you, Your Majesty!

9
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,760
She had the guts to falsely accuse me.

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm sure someone ordered her to do this

11
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,560
to disrupt Qi-Wei relations.

12
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,670
What an exquisite human skin mask.

13
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,390
She even severed a finger

14
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,920
just to impersonate Yilan.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,080
Only the Shadow Palace
could've done this.

16
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,710
Guardian Duke,

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,840
I've never offended you.

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,920
Why do you have to frame me?

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Your Majesty,

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,080
I beg you to uphold justice!

21
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,230
Father,

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,030
she's a disguise master.

23
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,350
I believe that Guardian Duke

24
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,920
must've been so concerned
about your safety

25
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,560
that he was deceived.

26
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,710
Enough!

27
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,080
This is ridiculous!

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,670
With a small trick,

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,080
you nearly sparked a war
between Qi and Wei again.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,840
Guardian Duke,

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,790
is this all you've got?

32
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,030
You'd better retire early
and return home!

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,760
I've realized my sins.

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,200
I can't believe the Shadow Palace

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,920
has infiltrated my court.

36
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,320
Shiqi, we can't escape.

37
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,510
We can't escape...

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,000
Your Highness!

39
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,470
Your Highness, your wound isn't severe.

40
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,080
But why is there
such poison inside your body?

41
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,040
This is the Ink Poison.

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,440
It's really strong.

43
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,560
(Nanny Tong, Maid of Late Queen)

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,390
I'm not confident about
making the antidote.

45
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,670
Are you sure

46
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,510
you'll test it yourself?

47
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
I've agreed.

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,990
How can I back out?

49
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,080
Aren't you afraid
I conspired with the Crown Prince?

50
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,830
If you die,

51
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,920
the Crown Prince
will no longer have enemies.

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,510
The late queen's death was strange.

53
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,360
After that, you voluntarily
went to the cold palace.

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,440
He tried to visit you many times.

55
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,040
To avoid him,

56
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,920
you even poisoned yourself.

57
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,500
I believe you.

58
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,790
And I believe

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,200
you don't want the Crown Prince
to make more mistakes.

60
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,810
This...

61
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,360
No one can know this,

62
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,870
especially

63
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,080
my mother.

64
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,230
Aye, aye.

65
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
Ming'en, go.

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,950
Find Nanny Tong!

67
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,870
Aye.

68
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,870
Your Highness.

69
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,150
I'm warning you.

70
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,470
Stay away from Shao.

71
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,640
If you have any conscience,

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,390
you should keep your distance from him.

73
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,910
Only then will Shao be safe.

74
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,350
Let's go.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,120
Your Highness, congratulations
on your rebirth.

76
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,440
From now on,

77
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,030
you'll be Princess Abi Ya.

78
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,640
I prepared a gift for you.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,240
I hope you like it.

80
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,440
Are you sure you won't open it?

81
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,920
After all, this is

82
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,470
Yilan's stuff.

83
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,150
Why is it broken?

84
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,240
You ruined it yourself.

85
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,600
What a pity.

86
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,200
I made a lot of effort

87
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,810
to rip off the skin intact.

88
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,790
You were dear sisters.

89
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,700
I believe her face can

90
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,340
keep you company and comfort you

91
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,750
in the lonely palace.

92
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,780
I will kill you.

93
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,660
I'll do it myself!

94
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,020
Don't you remember?

95
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,660
Now you're Abi Ya,
the prestigious Consort Wei.

96
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,860
Don't demean yourself.

97
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,900
Counting the days,

98
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,300
I think the poison inside you
is about to take effect.

99
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,940
I'll be waiting for you to beg me!

100
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,170
Your Highness!

101
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,020
Your Highness!

102
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,540
Your Highness,

103
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,220
here's the new antidote.

104
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,740
However, you've tried too many antidotes

105
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,940
and got severe internal injuries.

106
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,860
If we fail this time...

107
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,100
It's okay.

108
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
Let's try it.

109
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,580
Aye.

110
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,700
Your Highness!

111
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,700
Only by sharing her pain

112
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,660
can I understand her struggle!

113
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,180
I think the poison inside you
is about to take effect.

114
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,980
I'll be waiting for you to beg me!

115
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,980
Ouyang Heng,

116
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,620
you won't control me again!

117
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,860
Your Highness!

118
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,140
Your Highness!

119
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,500
Your Highness,

120
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,780
you only spat
part of the poisonous blood.

121
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,740
It isn't strong enough

122
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,500
to cure the poison.

123
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,380
Okay, keep making the antidote.

124
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,820
Ming'en...

125
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,980
Don't...

126
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,420
Don't tell Her Highness...

127
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,220
Come in.

128
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,540
Your Highness!

129
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,060
It's over.

130
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,620
That's good.

131
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,780
Well...

132
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,580
Ming'en also said

133
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,900
the Fifth Prince's blade injury

134
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,500
was not serious.

135
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,900
Help me get changed.

136
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,500
Your Highness,

137
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,860
how are you feeling?

138
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,540
The poison is suppressed for now.

139
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,020
I'm fine.

140
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,220
What's the matter?

141
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,900
The prisoner from the Shadow Palace

142
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,780
hit the wall and died this morning.

143
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,740
Forget it.

144
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,300
The Ink Poison causes extreme pain.

145
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,740
Death would be a relief.

146
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,340
But she...

147
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,460
You may leave now.

148
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,500
Aye.

149
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,820
Why didn't you come inside?

150
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,060
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

151
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,220
Do you want to enjoy it with me?

152
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,060
By the way,

153
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,100
how is your injury?

154
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,820
I'm fine.

155
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,380
No Crown Prince's eyes here.

156
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
So?

157
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,260
So...

158
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,220
Stop pulling me,

159
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,260
or my wound will open.

160
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,700
It really hurts.

161
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,820
Sprout,

162
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,380
have you thought about

163
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,180
what kind of life you want?

164
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,820
I wouldn't dare to think.

165
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,940
Since I was born,

166
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,820
it seems none of my wishes
have ever come true.

167
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,420
Gradually,

168
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,780
I stopped making wishes.

169
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,700
If fates treat you unjustly,

170
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,820
I'll stay by your side.

171
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Because I believe

172
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,380
we can overcome fate.

173
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,100
Okay.

174
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,460
It's getting late. I should head back.

175
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,580
You should also rest early.

176
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,460
Sprout,

177
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,660
I've loved you for a long time.

178
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,780
For the rest of my life,

179
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,340
I want to

180
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,340
stay with you

181
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,820
and grow old with you.

182
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,220
