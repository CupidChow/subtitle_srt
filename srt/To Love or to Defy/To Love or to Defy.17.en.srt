3
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,470
I've informed Prime Minister Li.

4
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,240
(Six Days Before the Envoy Arrives)
Princess Abi Ya will welcome them.

5
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,600
Consort Wei

6
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,920
will definitely be exposed.

7
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,590
Uncle, you're so impressive.

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,240
Thank you.

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,040
Your Highness, if you're determined
to eliminate Consort Wei,

10
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,480
I will do anything I can

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,920
to help you.

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,240
Of course.

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,560
Uncle, if there's nothing else,

14
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,070
you may leave.

15
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,400
I shall take my leave.

16
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,640
Di Shiqi,

17
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,840
only I can save you this time.

18
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,200
If you beg me...

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,470
You were in a hurry.

20
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,080
Where are you heading?

21
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,270
Your Highness,

22
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,400
I heard the begonias are beautiful,

23
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,150
so I want to take a look.

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,430
If you want to see flowers,

25
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,560
I won't stop you.

26
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,590
But you've promised me,

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,800
so stay away from my son.

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,240
You got her wrong.

29
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,870
I invited Consort Wei
to the Imperial Garden.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Shao,

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,910
this woman is involved in many matters.

32
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,630
Why are you so stubborn?

33
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,960
Mother, Consort Wei is a noble princess
for peace-making marriage.

34
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,960
She can affect the relations
between Qi and Wei.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,590
The prime minister of Wei will visit us,

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,190
and Father wants
Consort Wei to be there.

37
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,750
I came here to talk about this.

38
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,520
Mother, if someone

39
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,120
heard what you said
and told the Wei envoy,

40
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,030
wouldn't it worsen our relations?

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,800
Your Highness, stop arguing.

42
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,150
It's my duty to welcome

43
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,470
the envoy from my homeland.

44
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,400
It has nothing to do with you.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,030
Thank you for your guidance.

46
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,840
I shall take my leave now.

47
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,750
Shao.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
Likewise,

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,080
people will keep an eye on you.

50
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,920
Your Highness.

51
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,000
- Behave yourself.
- Why not ask for his help?

52
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,680
I don't have much time left.

53
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,470
Why risk his future?

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

55
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,840
Your Highness,

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
what brings you here?

57
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,710
I've heard you're dying.

58
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,080
So, I want to know if you have

59
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,750
any last wishes.

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,830
What if I tell you

61
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,800
I want to live?

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,120
Beg me.

63
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,680
That depends on

64
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,750
how sincere you are.

65
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,270
I can be sincere.

66
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,510
But I don't know if you can take it.

67
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,160
Shiqi, oh, Shiqi.

68
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,480
I'm so impressed.

69
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,430
You've toyed with

70
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,680
the two princes of Qi

71
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,190
and my father.

72
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,560
I'm so flattered.

73
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,350
I just

74
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,070
learned some

75
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,750
of your tricks.

76
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,430
Now that you're determined to die,

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,720
I will say no more.

78
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,190
You're on your own.

79
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,030
Get out!

80
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,950
Your Highness.

81
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,950
Since he returned,

82
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,430
he's been staying in his room.

83
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,830
He hasn't even had lunch.

84
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,560
Should I try to persuade him?

85
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,520
No need.

86
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,950
Leave him alone for a while.

87
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,920
Tell the kitchen to keep the food warm.

88
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,670
Aye.

89
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,270
Your Highness,

90
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,870
sweet bird's nest soup is ready.

91
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,710
Leave it here.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,840
Aye.

93
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,150
Your Highness,

94
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,830
when did you start to like sweet food?

95
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,360
Perhaps I've endured bitterness
for so long

96
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,190
that I've forgotten about sweetness.

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,840
Chuncan,

98
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,430
have you thought about leaving?

99
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,040
Leaving?

100
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,390
Yes, leave the palace.

101
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,000
You can go to a small town

102
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,070
to do business

103
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,360
or go to the countryside

104
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,270
to live a regular and carefree

105
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,430
farming life.

106
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,920
If you want it,

107
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,950
please tell me.

108
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,800
I will get you out.

109
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,590
Your Highness!

110
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
I don't know

111
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,240
what will happen in the future,

112
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,750
but I don't want to leave you.

113
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,430
I hope you can allow me

114
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,040
to stay by your side.

115
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,270
Get up.

116
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,150
Aye.

117
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,200
It's me.

118
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,120
The Fifth Prince is here.

119
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,110
I'll get the door.

120
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,270
Chuncan!

121
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,670
Your Highness, it's midnight.

122
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,440
What do you need?

123
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,160
Sprout,

124
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,200
come with me.

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,840
Go?

126
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,350
Where are we going?

127
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,750
Anywhere.

128
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,150
We'll go to a remote town

129
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,470
to do business

130
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,360
or go to a beautiful place

131
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,030
to live a carefree farming life.

132
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,750
Anyway, let's get out of here.

133
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,630
Let's go.

134
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,150
I'm your father's favorite consort.

135
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,240
Why should I go with you?

136
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,560
Sprout...

137
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,750
I'm Princess Abi Ya from Wei.

138
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,160
You shouldn't

139
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,870
call me this.

140
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,710
Princess,

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,840
consort...

142
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,550
Didn't you dislike these titles?

143
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,030
Besides, the Wei envoy will arrive.

144
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,790
The Crown Prince wants to kill you!

145
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,630
I can handle my own business!

146
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,200
I don't need your help.

147
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,360
Did you really beg the Crown Prince?

148
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,390
Now that you've known it,

149
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,390
why are you asking me?

150
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,560
I don't believe it.

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,080
- Let's go!
- Go away!

152
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,440
Can you stop fantasizing?

153
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
We're over.

154
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,480
Do you understand?

155
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,440
Chuncan!

156
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,320
Yes, Your Highness.

157
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,320
Walk him out.

158
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,870
This...

159
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,870
Walk him out!

160
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,440
Okay.

161
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,960
I was too impulsive.

162
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,150
Now that you've made up your mind,

163
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,590
I'll take my leave.

164
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,120
No matter what,

165
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,670
I wish you well.

166
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,230
Your Highness,

167
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,630
why did you...

168
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,790
He has a promising future.

169
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,120
He shouldn't risk his life

170
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,600
or give up his future

171
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,440
for a woman like me.

172
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,480
The less he cares about me,
the safer he is.

173
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,000
This is between the Crown Prince and me.

174
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,630
I must deal with it myself.
