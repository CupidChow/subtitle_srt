3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,710
Serve the emperor?

4
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,960
Master ordered me to help you
kill the Emperor of Qi.

5
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,640
(Yilan, Consort Wei's Maid)
I'm Yilan, your maid.

6
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,800
Get used to this.

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,840
Master wants to assassinate the emperor.

8
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,640
Do I have to serve him in bed?

9
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,150
Master has ordered

10
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,280
that he can't die from an attack

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,790
but from intercourse.

12
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,680
They'll try to hide

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,000
such a disgraceful accident.

14
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,200
But I know nothing

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,960
about this.

16
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,640
Precisely because you're ignorant,

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,480
you seem like a princess.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,870
She must be scared.

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,600
Don't be afraid.

20
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,040
Take this pill

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,000
and make your body poisonous.

22
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,280
When combined with aphrodisiac incense,

23
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,150
it will become deadly to men,

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,920
and it can't be traced.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,870
I promised her

26
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,640
to take her away from here.

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,280
But it seems I can't change anything.

28
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,150
The emperor has arrived!

29
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,310
My Princess.

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,030
Afraid to look at me?

31
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,520
Do you like me?

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,640
Take it off.

33
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,960
Why are you smiling like that?

34
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,840
Are you nervous?

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,400
Remember,

36
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,280
you only have half an hour.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,470
Take it off.

38
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,630
Don't eat too much. I like skinny women.

39
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,080
Protect the emperor!

40
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,470
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,030
Shao, what are you doing?

42
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,960
Shao, behave yourself.

43
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,910
Father, I just found out

44
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,590
that Princess Abi Ya passed

45
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,750
Huaxi Village on the way.

46
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,120
It's my fault.

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,430
I put someone important at risk.

48
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,590
I failed to protect you.

49
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,630
I beg you to sentence me to death!

50
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,120
Huaxi Village?

51
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,270
Isn't it where measles broke out?

52
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,560
Doctor!

53
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,430
Summon the imperial doctor!

54
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Nonsense!

55
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,830
How could a passerby get infected?

56
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,480
All of you, get out now!

57
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,870
(I can't take action tonight.)

58
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,670
Protect the emperor!

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,000
Protect the emperor!

60
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,510
Take her out and burn her!

61
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,750
Your Majesty, wise choice!

62
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,030
Father, wise choice.

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,070
Measles is highly contagious.

64
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,390
All the servants, guards,
and doctors here

65
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,190
were in close contact with Consort Wei.

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,560
Why don't we burn all of them

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,840
to ensure safety?

68
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,350
Father,

69
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,120
Shao has a point.

70
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,240
Why don't we

71
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,360
burn them all?

72
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,240
Father, burn them.

73
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,070
Mercy, Your Majesty!

74
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,520
Your Majesty,

75
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,040
I've heard

76
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,950
that all measles patients

77
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,950
have rashes on their bodies.

78
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,750
But Consort Wei

79
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,270
shows no rash symptoms.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,830
Doctor, say something!

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,440
That's right.

82
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,800
A cold can also cause coughing.

83
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,160
Maybe we should let her
rest for a few days.

84
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,470
Never mind.

85
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,870
If she needs to rest,

86
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,950
send her to Li Changshun's Ladies' Court

87
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,560
to learn Qi's etiquette.

88
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,800
Your Majesty, wise choice!

89
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,390
Goodbye, Father.

90
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,120
Don't think I'll thank you.

91
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,240
Mind your own business.

92
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
Your Highness.

93
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,680
She didn't say thanks,

94
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,190
but she clearly didn't want to serve.

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,270
Otherwise, why would she
pretend to be sick?

96
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
She has her reasons.

97
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,000
She's not a princess.

98
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,310
I've seen her before.

99
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,630
My Lord, you purchased her.

100
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,830
But why don't you want her or see her?

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,800
Why hide your identity?

102
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,680
I want her to truly be free.

103
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,160
So, you've been a busybody
since childhood.

104
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,040
Then why didn't you tell her?

105
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,800
She must've been manipulated.

106
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,830
We can't alert them until we figure out

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,510
who's the mastermind.

108
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,670
I've heard

109
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,830
Ladies' Court is a living hell
for women in the palace.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,190
It won't be easy to get out.

111
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,390
It's dangerous in the palace.

112
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,510
The longer we wait,
the riskier it gets.

113
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Why did the Fifth Prince do this?

114
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,560
Does he suspect your identity?

115
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,630
That's not right.

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,950
If he suspected you,

117
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,390
why would he take the risk?

118
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,430
He thought I didn't want to serve
and ruined

119
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,190
my plan out of good intentions.

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,720
Because only he knows

121
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,950
we never passed Huaxi Village.

122
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,950
He lied to...

123
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,880
It's Master.

124
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,710
Let's go.

125
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,430
Is this how you greet me?

126
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,710
- Master, forgive me!
- Don't kneel.

127
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,230
I've told you

128
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,070
to forget you're an assassin.

129
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,630
I'll never forget

130
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,720
the instincts of an assassin.

131
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,630
Since when

132
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,720
did mercy become an assassin's instinct?

133
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,320
No!

134
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,680
No!

135
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,960
Don't kill me!

136
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,480
You mustn't doubt my decisions.

137
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,240
Don't forget the Ink Poison
inside your bodies.

138
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,150
If you defy me, it will take effect.

139
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,790
If you obey me, you'll get the cure.

140
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,510
What's going on
with you and the Fifth Prince?

141
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,320
Why would he save you

142
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,910
from His Majesty's bed?

143
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,630
I don't know why either.

144
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,840
You finally got news of your mother.

145
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,480
You don't want to meet her
in the underworld, do you?

146
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,230
Sprout.

147
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,550
Sprout, hold my hand.

148
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,390
I pledge my loyalty to you, Master.

149
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,480
You have three days.

150
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
You have to leave

151
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,240
the Ladies' Court within three days

152
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,910
and continue to serve in bed.

153
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,960

the Ladies' Court in three days.

158
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,670
It's possible.

159
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,960
You just need to memorize
all these books.

160
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,360
Once you've finished,

161
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,390
I'll test you.

162
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,240

I can't memorize them.

It's impossible.

176
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,030
I have to punish you.

Do you remember Sprout?

191
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,040
Sprout?

192
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,750
I'll never forget her...

193
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,510
Respect and obedience are key for women.

194
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,550
Respect and obedience are key for women.

195
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,200
Your Highness.

196
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,870
You've been studying hard.

197
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,360
Have some tea and take a break.

198
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,390
Thank you.

199
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,460
(Be a Good Girl)

200
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,040
Your Highness,

201
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,320
please memorize these too.

202
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,440
Although Sprout

203
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,120
looks skinny and weak,

204
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,440
she's tough and fierce.

205
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,960
If you offend her,

206
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,200
she'll break your leg!

207
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,630
Eunuch Li.

208
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,320
