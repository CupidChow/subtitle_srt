00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,340
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,920
(I was once a prisoner of despair,)

4
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,760
(struggling to survive,
fighting to please others.)

5
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,680
(I was abandoned by the world)

6
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,790
(and trampled by fate.)

7
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,040
(I slayed countless enemies)

8
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,040
(just to beg for food.)

9
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,510
(Until that day...)

10
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,560
Someone's here to free you.

11
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,510
Sprout, you're free.

12
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,200
(His arrival chased away the darkness)

13
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,790
(and gave me a ray of hope.)

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,510
Long live the Empress.

15
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,560
(If god is unjust,)

16
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,240
(I'll seek justice myself.)

17
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,960
(I'll drag you tormentors)

18
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,190
(down to hell.)

19
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,300
(Before Accession)
(Half a year)

20
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,630
(ago, farces of moral turpitude)

21
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,430
(unfolded here every day.)

22
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,360
Your Majesty,

23
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,960
for the peace-making marriage with Wei,

24
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,960
I found a lowly woman on the death row

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,910
of the Women's Prison.

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,310
This is Princess Yujing.

27
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,030
If we send her to Wei,

28
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,870
(Emperor of Qi)
she'll disgrace the King of Wei

29
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,080
and boost Qi's prestige.

30
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
Lord Gou,

31
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,310
why are you calling this beautiful lady
a lowly woman?

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,870
During an ancestral rite,

33
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,000
Princess Yujing's got her period

34
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,150
and tainted the ancestral hall.

35
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,120
It was a grave insult to the ancestors.

36
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,360
However, she refused punishment

37
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,630
and took the initiative
to propose a divorce,

38
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,430
which is unforgivable.

39
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,520
I've arranged for Princess Yujing

40
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,960
to train at Lianqing Pavilion

41
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,500
(Xin, Courtesan)
for a month.

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,030
A defiled body

43
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,280
is the best dowry.

44
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,190
You've done a good job.

45
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,710
Father, forgive me.

46
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,800
The glory of a nation

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,150
can be earned through war

48
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,360
or diplomacy.

49
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,710
How can we sacrifice a woman
to make peace?

50
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,840
Father, please think it through.

51
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,710
Shao,

52
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,590
watch your attitude.

53
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,120
She is

54
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,120
just a lowly woman
no one wants to marry.

55
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,520
She should've been imprisoned to death.

56
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,240
I'm giving her a chance.

57
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,870
- Father!
- Your Highness.

58
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,150
We are strangers.

59
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,710
Please don't overstep.

60
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,430
Your Majesty,

61
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,750
I promise to turn over a new leaf.

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
Okay, unlock her chains.

63
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,190
I'll grant her Fertility Soup.

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
The Fertility Soup

65
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,310
is carefully simmered with

66
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,870
the remains of dozens of

67
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,480
rare animals,

68
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,600
which can benefit pregnancy.

69
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,630
Hope you can bear a fat kid

70
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,000
for King of Wei.

71
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,800
Your Majesty,
thank you for your kindness.

72
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,560
I learned a phrase to praise Wei.

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,750
I'd like to share it with you.

74
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,920
You're a good girl.

75
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,560
Your Majesty,

76
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
go to hell!

77
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,830
- Father...
- Your Majesty!

78
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,600
You want me to drink manure?

79
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,040
- Your Majesty!
- Are you okay?

80
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,310
You all drink it too!

81
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,120
- Guard the emperor!
- Go to hell!

82
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
Guards, help!

83
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,660
Protect the emperor!

84
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,670
My Lord!

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,160
Calm down!

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Calm down!

87
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,600
The Three Obediences and Four Virtues
and male superiority

88
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,120
- are nonsense!
- Guard the emperor!

89
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,560
Even if I die,

90
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,310
I'll die with pride!

91
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,390
Today, I swear on my life

92
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,680
that countless women

93
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,830
who were trampled like me

94
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,000
shall start a new life

95
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,680
and get revenge!

96
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,000
This...

97
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,230
Your Majesty!

98
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,190
Pretentious...

99
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,160
Loser.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,840
Guards,

101
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,160
find someone obedient

102
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,000
to be the King of Wei's consort.

103
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,000
Shao, go to Wei and escort

104
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,160
Princess Abi Ya back to be my consort.

105
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,870
(How many tragedies
do we have to witness)

106
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,480
(before this can change?)

107
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,630
(Even if some women stand up)

108
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
(to challenge the absurd dogma,)

109
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,190
(they're just ants trying to
topple a giant tree,)

110
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,480
(who will only end up dead.)

111
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,170
Your Highness,

112
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,160
the princess and her guards

113
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,510
disappeared after entering Qi.

114
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,360
Many of her dowries are missing too.

115
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,800
I'm afraid they've escaped.

116
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,040
There are many bandits at the border.

117
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,320
Send more people.

118
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,920
We must find her before nightfall.

119
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,150
Aye.

120
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,310
Little Vixen,

121
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,070
I lost several men.

122
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,100
(Abiya, Princess of Wei)
When you inhale

123
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,600
the aphrodisiac, you'll beg me in bed!

124
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,730
No!

125
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,350
Get off me!

126
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,760
Get off me!

127
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,720
Are you here to save me?

128
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,040
I want to go home!

129
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,720
Don't forget your mission.

130
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,240
Replace the princess
to be the emperor's consort.

131
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,440
No, no!

132
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,990
Your Highness,

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,920
there are many corpses
from the marriage escort team.

134
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's go inside.

135
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,030
Princess Abi Ya?

136
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,670
I'm Ouyang Shao, the envoy of Qi.

137
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,320
Don't be afraid.

138
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,840
I won't hurt you.

139
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,040
Someone escaped!

140
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,560
Leave one alive.

141
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,670
Yes, Your Highness.

142
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,240
I don't want to escape anymore.

143
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,670
Take me away.

144
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,150
If you don't want to marry His Majesty,

145
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,120
I can let you go.

146
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
(What does he mean?)

147
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,150
(Has he found out I'm a fake princess?)

148
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,630
Why are you helping me?

149
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,150
You'll be my father's consort.

150
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,550
The ruler is heartless,

151
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
and women have no dignity.

152
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,440
I don't want such tragedies

153
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
to happen again.

154
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,360
Pretentious.

155
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,960
Aren't you one of them?

156
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,790
Pretentious...

157
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,360
Even if you let me go,

158
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,960
Qi will stop me,

159
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,320
Wei will stop me,

160
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,670
and so will those

161
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,720
women traffickers.

162
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,550
I can't go home anymore.

163
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,790
(Oh no, it's aphrodisiac!)

164
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
Just go!

165
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,670
What are you doing?

166
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,750
Go...

167
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,080
Your Highness, you're finally awake.

168
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,390
If it weren't for Consort Wei,

169
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,680
you would've...

170
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,120
Who's Consort Wei?

171
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,750
Where is Princess Abi Ya?

172
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,790
Starting tonight, she'll be

173
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,960
Consort Wei.

174
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,080
She should be preparing
to serve His Majesty.

175
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,510
Tonight?

176
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,360
Serve His Majesty?
