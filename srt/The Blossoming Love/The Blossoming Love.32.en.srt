00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,870
declare war on Zhao Ming now.

192
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,910
People are extremely stupid and greedy.

193
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,120
The Lord of Xilin longs for eternal life,

194
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,510
so if we throw him this temptation of being immortal,

195
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,440
all we need to do

196
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,480
is to incite it

197
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,720
to boost the war.

198
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,120
My favorite thing is war.

199
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,200
This world

200
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,000
is meant to be filled

201
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,750
with war.

202
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,600
Your Majesty, do not worry too much.

203
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,550
The nations turned

204
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,440
against us,

205
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,510
but our border guards

206
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,240
are well-trained

207
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,120
and strong,

208
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,720
so they will be able to overwhelm the enemy.

209
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,150
The Humans should have been a family,

210
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,360
but now, they have to fight

211
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,270
and kill on the battlefield.

212
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,510
The Divine Clan's plan was extremely vicious.

213
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,910
Moreover,

214
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,870
the current war situation is strange,

215
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,870
and the tactics of the countries are tricky and changeable,

216
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,750
so it must be the Divine Clan's manipulation behind the scenes

217
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,240
that caused the war to continue.

218
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,030
Your Majesty.

219
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,630
The spy's pigeon has sent word

220
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,670
that the lord of Xilin has killed our envoy.

221
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,030
He has gathered the armies of the nations and tribes

222
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
into a powerful alliance

223
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,480
and is heading for the borders of Dongze.

224
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,030
This battle

225
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,600
is the result of internal strife,

226
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,360
and the Divine Clan is stirring up

227
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,480
and planning the war.

228
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,270
The will of the nation's warriors is not strong enough,

229
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,390
so if we only send Dongze's strongest army to meet the enemy,

230
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,960
no matter how strong Dongze's army is,

231
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,150
it may not be enough to quell this.

232
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,150
Inform all the generals

233
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,480
to be ready to march

234
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,480
at a moment's notice.

235
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,390
- Yes. - Yes.

236
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,200
Zhao Ming.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,630
Pearl,

238
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,240
why are you here?

239
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,510
I have a bad appetite

240
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,240
when I'm alone,

241
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,150
so I want you to eat with me.

242
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,630
Do you want me to eat with you

243
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,240
or do you want to keep me company?

244
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,600
I really

245
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,840
can't hide anything from you.

246
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,150
There's still a lot of truth I haven't learned,

247
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,150
but I know

248
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,960
people can't carry on

249
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,510
if they don't eat properly.

250
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,240
What will happen

251
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,720
to those who need you

252
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,440
if your health collapses?

253
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,870
So the only way to have the energy

254
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,670
to think about the battle

255
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,840
is if you can eat well.

256
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,550
You're right.

257
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,790
Pearl.

258
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,480
The war is urgent right now,

259
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,960
so I recently had to participate in the war myself.

260
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
Participate in the war?

261
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,550
I once heard that

262
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,120
a king participating in a war

263
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,320
is different from a general doing that.

264
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,120
Do you

265
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,910
have to go?

266
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,960
Battles

267
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,440
are about tactics and mindset.

268
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,670
This time,

269
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,510
we will not only fight against humans

270
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,150
but also against immortals.

271
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,960
I must go

272
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,030
and must win.

273
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,780
[Graceful Palace]

274
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,120
This time,

275
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,870
we will not only fight against humans

276
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,670
but also against immortals.

277
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,440
I must go

278
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,390
and must win.

279
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,030
Why am I upset?

280
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,870
Is it because I'm worried

281
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,550
or

282
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,240
upset?

283
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,240
I want to know

284
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,440
what feelings are.

285
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,240
Are feelings

286
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,360
lust

287
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,270
or motivation?

288
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,320
As long as I keep missing him,

289
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,750
we'll never be apart.

290
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,120
No matter what happens,

291
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,150
I will always be with Zhao Ming.

292
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,150
Please forgive the Chaos Pearl.

293
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,440
Now she has not yet awakened,

294
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,750
so she has feelings.

295
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,560
I will bring her back to the Celestial Altar as soon as possible

296
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
and avoid the divine artifact having feelings.

297
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,280
This thunder is only a warning.

298
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,080
If she continues to have feelings,

299
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,560
celestial punishment will go to her.

300
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,160
The rules cannot be broken.

301
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,200
If you cannot stop the Chaos Pearl from having feelings,

302
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,510
I will destroy her.

303
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,510
Since the dawn of creation,

304
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,230
you have been indifferent to all things,

305
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,400
but today, you are impulsive.

306
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,440
Is this because

307
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,110
you love her?

308
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,830
I do not.

309
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,820
[Graceful Palace]

310
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,680
You're finally awake.

311
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,470
Zhao Ming.

312
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,280
You're about to participate in the war,

313
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,710
so don't waste your spiritual power on me.

314
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
You've been struck by lightning,

315
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,750
and your body is depleted,

316
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,870
so the doctor's medicine for gathering energy

317
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,590
may not work.

318
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,280
Giving you my spiritual power is the safest way.

319
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,200
Who says the doctor's medicine is useless?

320
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,470
I feel much better now.

321
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,630
Besides,

322
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,160
I wasn't struck by lightning.

323
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,870
My teacher blocked that for me.

324
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,280
They say only bad people get struck by lightning,

325
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,710
so I'm fine now.

326
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,440
But that thunder was very strange,

327
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,800
so I sent someone to investigate

328
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,990
what caused the thunder at Graceful Palace.

329
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,590
Pearl.

330
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,710
In the future, if the sky is different,

331
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,040
try not to go out.

332
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,470
You must be more careful

333
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,870
during the time I'm in the war.

334
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,590
If you're not sure,

335
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,870
let me go with you.

336
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,870
Pearl.

337
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,590
Sometimes guarding doesn't mean you need

338
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,920
to stand in front of me or walk alongside me.

339
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,710
Did you know that frontline fighters

340
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,560
are motivated by the people they love behind them?

341
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,470
As long as their loved ones are safe and sound,

342
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,990
the fighters will be able to fully commit

343
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,990
to fighting the enemy to the end.

344
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,590
It may seem like the fighters are guarding their friends and family,

345
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,470
but in fact,

346
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,470
their friends and family are also guarding the fighters.

347
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,040
I want you

348
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,830
to stay in the palace

349
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
and guard me.

350
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,160
I guard you?

351
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,680
And how long will it take you

352
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,440
to come back after you leave?

353
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,070
I will return safely

354
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,960
before you finish this bag of candy.

355
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,230
I will ask Yan to stay in the palace.

356
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,790
You can ask him anything.

357
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:19,960
Zhao Ming.

358
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,960
Starting tomorrow,

359
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,030
I'm going to learn swordsmanship.

360
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,750
Swordsmanship?

361
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,400
I don't want to be the Pearl

362
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,920
who faints

363
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,310
at a single thunderbolt

364
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,750
or turns to Yan

365
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,750
for help with everything.

366
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,710
Since I've decided to protect you,

367
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,920
I must have the strength to do so.

368
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,230
You're not the same

369
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,030
as when you woke up.

370
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,790
People grow up.

371
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,920
A pearl won't grow up,

372
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,030
but it'll understand a lot of things.

373
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,470
Zhao Ming.

374
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,640
Your back

375
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,120
will be safe and sound.

376
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,860
[Two months later]

377
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,140
[Ming]

378
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,960
Zhao Ming has been gone for more than two months,

379
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,710
so are you going to stay like this?

380
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,790
When Zhao Ming was here before,

381
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,270
I felt like the day went by so fast,

382
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,550
but why is every day

383
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,160
so long now

384
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,310
that it

385
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,470
doesn't end after I've read

386
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,070
so many novels,

387
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,880
eaten so many snacks,

388
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,960
and written so many words?

389
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,710
That would be the idiom you taught me,

390
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,200
days are like years, right?

391
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,550
You've run out of candy,

392
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,710
but he still hasn't come back.

393
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,990
I haven't.

394
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,270
There's one left.

395
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,600
It was the only one left half a month ago.

396
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,990
You dare not eat it

397
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,990
because you're afraid he won't come back.

398
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,440
He will.

399
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,030
I gave you this jade pen

400
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,750
so that you could write your own life instead

401
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,160
of trusting it to others

402
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,270
as you do now.

403
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,400
Sir.

404
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,710
What do you mean?

405
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,600
Come with me to a place.

406
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:03,880
After you get there,

407
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,510
you will know everything.

408
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,960
This is...

409
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,230
Zhao Ming's secret room.

410
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,160
Do you really know Zhao Ming?

411
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,640
Zhao Ming is dedicated to fighting the Divine Clan

412
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,640
for the sake of his people.

413
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,440
That's what you and I have known for a long time.

414
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,310
Yes.

415
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,200
Fighting the Divine Clan is true,

416
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,790
but what if it's at the cost

417
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,920
of using and sacrificing others?

418
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,030
Even if Zhao Ming was born with divine channels,

419
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,640
the Humans are still vulnerable

420
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,120
to the gods,

421
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,960
so the only way he can fight them

422
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,510
is with the power of the divine artifact.

423
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,680
The Chaos Pearl

424
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,160
is the tool he has

425
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,310
at his fingertips,

426
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:35,990
and you

427
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,070
are the Chaos Pearl.

428
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,070
Do you want to know the whole story?

429
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:05,140
[The Note of Chaos]

430
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,310
When the world was first created,

431
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,510
Hao Tian invented two divine artifacts,

432
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,070
the Chaos Pearl

433
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,310
and the Book of Fate,

434
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,710
so

435
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,790
Zhao Ming revived you

436
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,310
only to utilize your Chaos Power

437
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,550
to kill the immortals.

438
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,600
The so-called salvation

439
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,200
is just another way to sacrifice you.

440
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,550
But I don't remember any

441
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,600
of what you said.

442
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,230
I only know that it was Zhao Ming who awakened me

443
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,640
and brought me much warmth and joy.

444
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,680
I don't know the Chaos Power

445
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,750
or the ancient artifact.

446
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,360
Now I am just a wasted pearl

447
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,680
with no divine power.

448
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,990
I just want to be a human

449
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,510
and stay by Zhao Ming's side.

450
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,470
Nothing else matters.

451
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,440
Not even your own life?

452
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,200
You already have feelings for Zhao Ming,

453
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,750
so that lightning strike was a warning.

454
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,200
Divine artifacts cannot have feelings

455
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,360
or fall in love with someone.

456
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,990
Otherwise, you will be destroyed.

457
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,030
What I can do now

458
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,510
is to take you back to the Celestial Altar

459
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,600
and kill your love to help you continue

460
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,550
to be a divine artifact that will live as long as heaven.

461
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,750
Only then will you be able

462
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,550
to escape this disaster.

463
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,750
I'm not going back.

464
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,230
I've begun to feel what it means to have feelings,

465
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,160
so how could I go back

466
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,880
to that cold and lonely life?

467
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,640
What's the point of living as long as heaven?

468
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,640
What everyone cares about is different.

469
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,270
For me,

470
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,750
it doesn't matter how long I live.

471
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,550
It's how I live

472
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,710
and who I live with

473
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,990
that matters.

474
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,360
The Chaos Pearl you mentioned

475
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,550
was already gone when the sky was mended.

476
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,880
The one saved by Zhao Ming

477
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,030
is Pearl.

478
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,470
You and I can live forever

479
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,200
and see through karma,

480
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,270
but why don't you understand

481
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
that human love

482
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,310
is the most fleeting

483
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,070
and fragile of all?

484
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,470
Is it really me

485
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,710
who doesn't understand love?

486
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,360
Fate.

487
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,600
I should call you that,

488
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,120
right?

489
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,030
You said we were together for tens of thousands of years,

490
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,680
but I'm sorry,

491
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,200
I don't have that memory today.

492
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,640
Maybe it saddens you to say this,

493
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,790
but I'm not going back with you.

494
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,470
I'm going to stay here

495
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,840

and if you win,

513
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,790
you can stay

514
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,710
and remain a human.

515
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,200
Why should I bet with you?

516
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,840
Because

517
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,750
I can give you this Qiankun Pearl,

at a critical moment.

520
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,030
What do you mean?

521
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,840
Fate told me

522
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,510
Zhao Ming would be in a life-and-death situation.

523
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,920
The Book of Fate has never been wrong,

524
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,600
and Qiankun Pearl

525
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,510
can reverse everything

526
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,600
and give Zhao Ming a chance to live,

527
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,680
so you have to

528
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,400
bet with me.

529
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:21,880
OK.

530
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,750
I will.

531
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,550
Some destinies

532
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,710
can't be ignored

533
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,840
just because you want them to be.

534
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,070
What exactly

535
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,790
do you think feelings are?

536
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,120
Why is it that human beings

537
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,710
are alive and well

538
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,070
when they have feelings?

539
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,960
If we had feelings,

540
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,550
wouldn't the Celestial Altar

541
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,840
be so cold?

542
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,030
You and I are divine artifacts

543
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,680
that are and deserve to follow Hao Tian.

544
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,710
The exploration of feelings is tantamount

545
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,070
to the process of extinction.

546
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,640
Anyway, I have you by my side.

547
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,920

Fate,

550
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,030
we'll always be together.

551
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,710
The Divine Clan's civil war

552
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,070
has caused the skies to break apart

553
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,880
and everything to come to an end.

554
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,360

555
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,120
mend the skies now.

556
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,120
Take it upon yourself to enforce the law

557
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,270
to restore order to the world.

[Graceful Palace]

559
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,200
The gaping hole in the sky is so great

560
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,640
that this repair will be dangerous.

561
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,400
Hao Tian.

562
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,990
I would like to take the place of the Chaos Pearl

563
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,310
and repair the rift in the sky myself.

564
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,400
Please allow me to do so.

565
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,470
The divine artifacts have their own roles to play,

566
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,710
and we must not disrupt their order.

567
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,160
The Chaos Pearl specializes in salvation,

568
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,640
so it is her duty to deal with the catastrophe.

569
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,640
You specialize in running,

570
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,840
so you have your own mission.

571
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,680
Fate.

572
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,440
You have defied the will of Heaven.

573
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,510
Do you know the consequences?

574
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,560
We can only be together

575
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,400
if we don't die.

576
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,840
Pearl.

577
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,320
Be alive.

578
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:16,880
Those

579
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,880
are my memories.

580
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,670
I must be under the influence of Qiankun Pearl

581
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,920
to dream those terrible things.

582
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,140
Fate told me

583
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,320
Zhao Ming would be in a life-and-death situation.

584
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,400
The Book of Fate has never been wrong,

585
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,510
and Qiankun Pearl

586
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,030
can reverse everything

587
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,320
and give Zhao Ming a chance to live,

588
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,800
so you have to

589
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,190
bet with me.

590
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,880
News has come from the front

591
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,880
that our troops have been ambushed,

592
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,640
and His Majesty has been seriously wounded.

593
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,400
I'm afraid the army doctors can't cure him.

594
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,080
Send the best doctors

595
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,030
to the camp now.

596
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:14,840
- So... - Yes.

597
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,600
this is his life-and-death situation.

598
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,400
Yan.

599
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,080
Let me go to the barracks with the doctor.

600
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,470
You're going there?

601
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,670
Can you heal the injured

602
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:26,950
or kill the enemy?

603
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,800
His Majesty's wounds will be healed by the doctor.

604
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,670
Zhao Ming's calamity

605
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,190
cannot be solved by a doctor.

606
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,160
Take me with you.

607
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,080
I can help him.

608
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,640
Your presence in the palace

609
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,600
will be the best help to His Majesty.

610
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,510
Zhao Ming is in danger,

611
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,840
and only I can save him.

612
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,560
His Majesty's orders to me

613
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,840
are to keep you in the palace

614
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,750
and protect you.

615
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,360
You can do whatever you want in the palace,

616
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,600
but I won't let you leave.

617
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,990
His Majesty's orders?

618
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,990
Do you really only see him as a monarch?

619
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,270
You and Zhao Ming

620
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,270
have shared a common bond and fought to the death.

621
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,710
Your bond has long exceeded that

622
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,190
of monarch and subject

623
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,600
and is more like that of close friends

624
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,400
and even brothers.

625
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,160
I know you can't disobey

626
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,750
a king's order,

627
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,360
but putting aside his status as emperor,

628
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,840
do you still have to follow the rules

629
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,600
and do nothing when you know

630
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:17,950
your brother is in danger?

631
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:19,920
Now, Zhao Ming

632
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,360
is gravely wounded

633
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,400
and in danger.

634
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,670
Yan.

635
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
If you are loyal, I will not make it difficult for you,

636
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,510
but I will go to the barracks in my own way

637
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,670

662
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,630
You scared me.

663
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,680
I thought you...

664
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:51,800
Thought what?

665
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,920
Where are you hurt?

666
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,630
Why did you lose the battle?

667
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,800
Why don't you retreat?

668
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,470
We won.

669
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,720
Won?

670
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,240
But we received word

671
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,880
that you lost

672
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,950
and that you were seriously wounded.

673
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,110
That was yesterday's news.

674
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,320
The so-called loss was His Majesty's way

675
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,920
of confusing the enemy.

676
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,550
We hid it from you

677
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,400
only to perfect the plan.

678
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,400
This morning,

679
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,360
His Majesty led his army through the enemy camp

680
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,320
and won a great victory.

681
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,550
Then why were you acting

682
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,590
like you were defeated?

683
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,110
I was just agonizing over

684
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,110
what to have for lunch.

685
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,470
I've been with the army for months,

686
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,760
and now that we've won,

687
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,880
shouldn't we have a feast to celebrate?

688
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,990
Do you know this too?

689
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,280
Yes, I do.

690
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,950
So you kept it from me?

691
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,030
Confuse the enemy?

692
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,430
You really scared me to death.

693
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,200
What's wrong with you?

694
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm fine.

695
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,630
The news is not all false.

696
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,840
His Majesty is really wounded.

697
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,110
Where are you hurt?

698
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,590
Is it bad?

699
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,430
I've brought

700
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,550
a lot of good medicine from the palace.

701
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,550
Come with me,

702
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,430
and I'll give you some medicine.

703
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,700
[Jingyang, Princess of Xilin]

704
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,320
Since you have fallen in love with Zhao Ming

705
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,720
and thus defied Hao Tian,

706
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,510
let's make the first wager.

707
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,990
Human nature will not be firm.

708
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,470
Zhao Ming will fall in love with someone else.

709
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,070
This is...

710
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,510
This is Princess Qingyang from Xilin.

711
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,320
This is Pearl.

712
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,110
Does every wound

713
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,030
you have hurt?

714
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
I grew up

715
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,550
either following my father on campaigns

716
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
or leading troops alone.

717
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,630
I've fought

718
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
in many battles,

719
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,840
so injuries are common.

720
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,510
It doesn't matter.

721
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,680
When you're unhappy,

722
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,320
eat a candy.

723
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,550
With sweetness,

724
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,430
you won't be in so much pain.

725
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,630
You eat candy slower

726
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,720
than I thought.

727
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,030
I promised you my return date with this packet of candy

728
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,950
to give you something to look forward to,

729
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,720
but I didn't expect you

730
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,800
to really finish it as promised

731
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,430
on the day of my triumph.

732
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,840
I was worried that if I ate it too fast,

733
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,280
you wouldn't be able to come back in time

734
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:00,990
and that you wouldn't be able

735
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,950
to come back after I

736
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,110
finished the candy,

737
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,070
so

738
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,240
I didn't dare to continue eating it

739
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,990
when there was only the last one left.

740
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,320
It's a good thing

741
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,760
that I am finally reunited with you.

742
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,150
The armor is so heavy.

743
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,070
You know what?

744
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,280
There have been many rumors about you in the palace.

745
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,830
They all say

746
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,520
that you are an invincible fighter,

747
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,190
but until today I didn't realize

748
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,070
that an invincible fighter

749
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,200
carries something so heavy.

750
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,950
I've never been that invincible.

751
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,590
I just held the determination

752
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,360
of certain death every time...

753
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,950
You must not die.

754
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,520
Of course not.

755
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:22,920
You won't.

756
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,360
How did you get hurt?

757
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,240
I was rubbed by the reins on my horse.

758
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,240
Don't worry about it. It doesn't hurt.

759
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,400
Did I ever tell you

760
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,320
you're never very good at lying?

761
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,920
Your eyes don't lie.

762
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,240
How can a wound this deep

763
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,910
not hurt?

764
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,960
Pearl.

765
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,550
You've had

766
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,440
a hard journey.

767
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,440
Promise me

768
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,160
you'll be well.

769
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,070
You already have feelings for Zhao Ming,

770
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,640
so that lightning strike was a warning.

771
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,430
Divine artifacts cannot have feelings

772
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,720
or fall in love with someone.

773
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,680
Otherwise, you will be destroyed.

774
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,320
What are you looking at?

775
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,910
Princess Qingyang

776
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,030
is a gift from the defeated Xilin

777
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,390
to His Majesty.

778
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,430
Would even a noble princess

779
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,590
be a gift?

780
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,640
What's so noble about a princess

781
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,910
in a world of chaos?
