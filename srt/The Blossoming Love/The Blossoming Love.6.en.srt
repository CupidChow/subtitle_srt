00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,630
There wasn't much to see.

194
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,200
But standing there alone,

195
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,150
he looked so lonely,

196
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,120
so I was kind enough

197
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,480
to keep him company.

198
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,390
I talked to him about the Dark Abyss.

199
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,390
He didn't comment

200
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,360
on my past

201
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,080
or share anything about his own.

202
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,030
Sometimes I feel

203
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,120
like I'm the blood moon in the Dark Abyss,

204
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,480
while he is

205
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,240
the bright moon of the human realm,

206
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,480
distant at times, yet close at others.

207
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,480
We each have our own place,

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,910
never crossing paths.

209
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,270
But if it's possible,

210
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,000
I want him to know

211
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,790
that he doesn't have to

212
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,030
live such a lonely life.

213
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,870
Mr. Xie,

214
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
I just took an arrow

215
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,200
for you.

216
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,080
Even if it was just an illusion,

217
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,000
it still hurt a lot.

218
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,440
Couldn't you at least show some concern for me?

219
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,320
Why don't you

220
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,360
let me have the demonic essence

221
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,670
that the Desire Demon just transformed into?

222
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,270
It would help strengthen my power.

223
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,720
Mu Xuanling?

224
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,550
Mu Xuanling?

225
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,600
You're awake.

226
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,360
Xie Xuechen!

227
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,320
How do you feel?

228
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,600
My body hurts.

229
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,120
It hurts so much.

230
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,120
My head hurts.

231
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,870
My chest hurts.

232
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,910
My hands and feet hurt.

233
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,720
Everything hurts.

234
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,000
Even the clothes

235
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,270
I'm wearing

236
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,360
feel like knives

237
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,510
cutting into me.

238
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,600
Circulate your power to absorb the demonic energy,

239
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,000
and it won't hurt as much.

240
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,790
Xie Xuechen,

241
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,150
am I affected by the gu too?

242
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,960
Why...

243
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,910
Why does it hurt so much?

244
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,440
You're not affected by the gu.

245
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,750
You just consumed the Desire Demon's demonic essence,

246
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,750
so demonic energy is flowing back into your body.

247
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,630
You need to circulate your power to take it in.

248
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,790
The Desire Demon's demonic essence?

249
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,870
All right,

250
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,550
I'll try.

251
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,020
♪Join me to savor the world's dazzling fireworks♪

252
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,740

undisturbed,

262
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,830
and egoless.

263
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,590
No thought.

264
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,400
Stay calm.

265
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,240
Forget.

266
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,400
Xie Xuechen,

267
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,350
what are you doing?

268
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,620
♪Being my rock, as always♪

269
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,030
Miss Gao,

270
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,790
is there anything you need?

271
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,750
Mu Xuanling's demonic power

272
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,830
neutralized the Soul-Stealing Gu.

273
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,750
I've cleansed everyone

274
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,070
of the lingering demonic energy

275
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,830
with Brightmind Pills.

276
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,510
They'll wake up tomorrow.

277
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,830
I'm here because I want you to tell me

278
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,270
the truth

279
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,960
behind Mu Xuanling.

280
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,720
It's true

281
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,110
that she's a member of the Spirit Clan.

282
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,680
But with her spiritual apertures damaged,

283
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,510
she has no choice but to cultivate demonic power.

284
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,590
It was she and I who fought you

285
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,680
at the staging post the other day.

286
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,350
We just used magical artifacts

287
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,480
to hide our faces.

288
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,240
I thought her demonic vines

289
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,200
looked familiar!

290
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,070
You two have been lying to me all this time.

291
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,680
She tried to kill me that day!

292
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,310
That was all a misunderstanding.

293
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,240
Besides, it started with you

294
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,070
mistakenly capturing a Treasure Sniffer

295
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,720
and attacking first.

296
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,000
You should see

297
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,720
by now

298
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,400
that Mu Xuanling has no ill intentions.

299
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,400
So now you're

300
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,960
defending the Spirit Clan?

301
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,270
Aren't you doing the same, Miss Gao?

302
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,880
You're showing mercy

303
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,510
to the Spirit Clan too.

304
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,030
I didn't,

305
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,720
and I won't.

306
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,200
You knew Mu Xuanling was cultivating demonic power

307
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,920
and was in a weak state.

308
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,920
If you'd truly been against her,

309
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,550
you could've had her arrested by the Spirit Management Bureau.

310
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,920
But instead, you let her

311
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,680
stay in the Mirror Palace to recuperate,

312
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,510
and you came to me to ask

313
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,400
about the truth.

314
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,160
I just didn't want people

315
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,350
to think I couldn't tell right from wrong.

316
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,200
And by the way,

317
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,830
aren't you worried

318
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,030
she'll betray your trust?

319
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,270
Are you talking about Mu Xuanling

320
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,240
or Cui Wanwan?

321
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,000
I can trust you

322
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,510
to keep Mu Xuanling's situation

323
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,550
secret from Miss Su, right?

324
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,510
I'm not one to gossip.

325
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,350
Keep an eye on her.

326
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
She's your responsibility.

327
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,750
Mr. Nan,

328
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,920
you arrived just in time.

329
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,070
Could you tell me

330
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,000
more about the Soul-Stealing Gu?

331
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,110
Why did everyone get affected?

332
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,640
It's recorded

333
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,790
in an ancient text.

334
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,720
To make the poison, you need to capture Dark Abyss gu worms,

335
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,350
feed them with your own blood,

336
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,270
and grind them into powder when they mature.

337
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,400
Then, coat an object with the powder,

338
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,960
and anyone who touches the object

339
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,980
will become your puppet

340
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,160
when you die.

341
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,160
They'll forget everything

342
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,550
except your dying wish.

343
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,920
The poison can also spread,

344
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,240
affecting many people.

345
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,510
Where could this object be hidden?

346
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,400
Even my master didn't notice it.

347
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,480
It doesn't necessarily need to be hidden.

348
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,350
It could be something so obvious

349
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,640
that no one thought to question it.

350
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,920
What do you mean?

351
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,480
Cui Wanwan did it.

352
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,750
She knew the Rewinding Array

353
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,640
could be a trap,

354
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,880
so she risked her life

355
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,000
to sabotage it.

356
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,310
She also had a backup plan.

357
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,160
She put the Soul-Stealing Gu powder on the token.

358
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,550
If she survived,

359
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,440
she would destroy the array

360
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,350
and the spiritual essence herself,

361
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,200
keeping her secret safe.

362
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,880
But if she failed

363
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,160
and died,

364
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,480
the Soul-Stealing Gu would be activated,

365
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,240
and naturally,

366
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,400
someone would come

367
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,640
for Xie Xuechen's life.

368
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,400
But her goal

369
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,030
was to eliminate humans and protect the Spirit Clan.

370
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,510
Why would she want to kill Xie Xuechen?

371
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,070
"Possessing something valuable is to invite trouble."

372
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,000
Xuechen knows the Jade Vault Technique.

373
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,640
He's the most powerful human expert

374
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,640
and the future pillar of the Immortal Alliance.

375
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,240
If she wanted to destroy humanity,

376
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,790
she must first destroy

377
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,830
the hope of the human race.

378
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,550
To complete her mission,

379
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,750
she was willing to even risk her own life.

380
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,110
She must have had a deep hatred.

381
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,590
Sirs,

382
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,830
I'm tired,

383
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,000
so I'll take my leave now.

384
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,640
- Why did you come back? - What are you doing here?

385
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,750
I've found a method

386
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,550
that might ease

387
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,310
Miss Mu's pain.

388
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,720
Come on.

389
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,030
Let's try it on her.

390
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,790
Don't bother.

391
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,160
She's fine now.

392
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,640
Already?

393
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,750
Perhaps her strength

394
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,590
sped up her recovery.

395
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,750
Anyway, she's already asleep.

396
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,240
It's better if you leave her alone.

397
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,160
You know what?

398
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
You're not good at lying.

399
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,680
Why would I lie to you?

400
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,830
She really is asleep.

401
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,350
I'm not talking about Miss Mu.

402
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,790
You used to remain sober

403
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,960
after drinking 1,000 cups of wine,

404
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,480
and earlier, you claimed to be

405
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,510
a teetotaler?

406
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,110
It was so obvious

407
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,440
you were lying.

408
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,590
Oh, Xie Xuechen,

409
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
did it never occur to you

410
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,310
what "Desire Demon" meant?

411
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,270
How could you just feed me her demonic essence like that?

412
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,960
Don't hold my actions from last night against me.

413
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,550
How dare she poison us with gu!

414
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,350
What a shame

415
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,350
Cui Wanwan died just like that.

416
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,350
If she hadn't, I would made her pay.

417
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,680
If I'd known she was this vicious,

418
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,790
I would've torn her to pieces long ago!

419
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,000
Master,

420
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,680
Cui Wanwan is already dead,

421
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,030
and the turmoil in the Mirror Palace has settled.

422
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,790
Please don't

423
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,310
work yourself up over her.

424
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,240
I'm angry with her, not with you.

425
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,590
Don't be scared.

426
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,070
But, Qiumin,

427
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,070
after all this chaos,

428
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,200
you should realize

429
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,640
how few things

430
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,310
and people can truly be trusted.

431
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,270
In the end, the only one you can rely on

432
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,350
is yourself,

433
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,400
so you must make yourself

434
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,550
stronger

435
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,960
and more invulnerable.

436
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,750
Do you understand?

437
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,240
I understand.

438
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,240
Although I don't remember everything from last night,

439
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,400
I do have some vague recollections.

440
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,640
Xie Xuechen's spiritual power hadn't fully recovered.

441
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,030
How did

442
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,160
the five of you

443
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,720
quell such intense chaos?

444
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,030
Although

445
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,550
his spiritual power hadn't fully recovered,

446
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,070
he observed closely

447
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,920
and found a flaw in the puppets.

448
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,960
Combined with Nan Xuyue's

449
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
unparalleled arrays,

450
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,270
the two of them

451
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,830
neutralized the gu poison without much effort.

452
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,920
This time, we owe Snow City

453
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,160
and Greenview Heights a huge favor.

454
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,790
Knowing we'll have to repay the favor

455
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,920
sooner or later

456
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,720
really makes me uneasy.

457
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,880
In the Immortal Alliance, we look out

458
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,310
for each other like family.

459
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,720
They won't expect

460
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,830
anything in return.

461
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,720
Look out for each other

462
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,510
like family?

463
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,960
Do you really believe that?

464
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,680
I've heard that Immortal Alliance cultivators rise with the sun,

465
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,880
but Mr. Xie,

466
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,000
you got up quite late today.

467
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,000
Could it be that you were

468
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,510
lying awake all night,

469
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,000
thinking about someone

470
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,070
or something?

471
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,550
Is that why you got up late?

472
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,400
Stop talking nonsense.

473
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,310
Is it nonsense?

474
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,790
Or did someone

475
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,830
take advantage of me

476
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,270
while I wasn't fully sane?

477
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,240
Last night, you were the one who...

478
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,830
What did I do?

479
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,550
You were the one who fed me the pill.

480
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,310
Who knows if you did it out of kindness

481
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,270
or if you had other motives?

482
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,550
Maybe you said one thing but meant another.

483
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,680
You rejected me with words,

484
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,920
but deep down...

485
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,790
I only did it to save you.

486
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,720
So you admit it.

487
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,440
You do care about me.

488
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,400
You care so much

489
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,350
that you secretly went through my notebook.

490
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,200
I offered to let you read it,

491
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,640
but you had to do it behind my back.

492
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,160
Is it

493
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,000
because you thought peeking was more exciting?

494
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,240
I didn't peek.

495
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,640
I left your notebook by your pillow last night

496
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,030
so that when you woke up, you'd see it

497
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,160
and know I'd read it.

498
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,240
I didn't try to hide anything,

499
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,510
so it doesn't count as peeking.

500
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,030
Xie Xuechen,

501
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,880
don't you think that sounds like sophistry?

502
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,960
You're just

503
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,310
so stubborn.

504
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,480
On the contrary,

505
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,590
your lips are

506
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,680
quite "open-minded."

507
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,640
They welcome

508
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,790
interaction with mine.

509
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,400
So you know how to dodge?

510
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Then why didn't you dodge last night?

511
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,550
Will you stop backing away?

512
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,310
Give me a kiss.

513
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,110
Miss Mu,

514
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,160
why are you up so early

515
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,400
after exhausting yourself last night?

516
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,440
Are you feeling better?

517
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,160
Thanks to Mr. Xie's help last night,

518
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,680
I'm almost fully recovered.

519
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,030
I came here to thank him personally.

520
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,590
The Immortal Alliance is facing an emergency.

521
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,830
I've wasted quite a bit of time in the Mirror Palace.

522
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,310
I should hurry back to Greenview Heights

523
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,400
and use the Teleportation Array to return to Snow City.

524
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,640
Before I came here,

525
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,880
I'd already arranged

526
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,110
for the array materials to be prepared.

527
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,920
Let's go.

528
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,750
Say our goodbyes to Miss Su.

529
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,310
Why is he in such a hurry?

530
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,160
It's not like I'm going to bite him.

531
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,000
Wait for me!

532
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,960
Miss Su,

533
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,440
now that the chaos at your palace has been resolved,

534
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,030
I must leave to attend to matters in Snow City.

535
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,750
I'm here to bid you farewell.

536
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,310
In that case,

537
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,030
I won't keep you.

538
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,440
But Mr. Xie, your spiritual power

539
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,440
hasn't fully recovered.

540
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,110
Why don't I send some of my disciples

541
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
to escort you?

542
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,880
Greenview Heights

543
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,240
will take care of that.

544
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,920
Don't worry, Miss Su.

545
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,310
Besides, the Mirror Palace has just been through a battle.

546
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,240
You and your disciples should take time to recover.

547
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,350
Thank you for your kindness, Miss Su.

548
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,720
Qiumin,

549
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,110
see them off for me.

550
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,640
Yes, Master.

551
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,720
Farewell.

552
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,750
This way, please.

553
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:32,310
[Mirror Palace]

554
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,590
Miss Gao, this is far enough.

555
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:34,920
Mu Xuanling,

556
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:35,960
let me tell you this.

557
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,920
I only kept your secret from my master

558
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,160
out of respect

559
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,030
for Xie Xuechen.

560
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,750
You'd better turn over a new leaf and start acting

561
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,760
- like a decent... - Person?

562
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,640
For me to act like a human

563
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,310
is quite a challenge.

564
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,350
Enough with the wordplay.

565
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,750
If I ever catch you causing trouble again,

566
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,160
I'll hand you over to the Spirit Management Bureau myself.

567
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,960
Thank you, Miss Gao, for your forgiveness.

568
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,410
In return,

569
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,400
I won't tell anyone about how you mistakenly captured

570
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,830
a Treasure Sniffer,

571
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,160
took treasures from a little child,

572
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,070
and lost to me.

573
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,690
Everyone can hear you.

574
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,580
Couldn't you keep it down?

575
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,550
- Why are you like this? - Like what?

576
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,750
Since you're both interested in making peace...

577
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,920
We're not!

578
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,510
Right.

579
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,580
No matter what, you shouldn't be

580
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,370
arguing here and now.

581
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,350
We're in a hurry.

582
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,350
Stop bickering.

583
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,510
Fine. See you never.

584
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,680
Why are you so hostile

585
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,480
toward Gao Qiumin?

586
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,270
Do you have

587
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,640
some past grudge against her?

588
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,480
You're so forgetful.

589
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,160
Even if I told you, you wouldn't remember.

590
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,830
Am I forgetful?

591
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,830
Bao,

592
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,880
what do you think of this one?

593
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,680
The aura of this crystal feels off.

594
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,640
It's not 300 years old.

595
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,830
It's at most 70 years old.

596
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,000
Only 70 years?

597
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,750
See for yourself.

598
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,240
But it looks

599
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,240
so ancient.

600
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,400
Bao,

601
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,350
why don't you sniff it again, just to be sure?

602
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,790
Enough.

603
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,030
Bao is a Treasure Sniffer.

604
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,160
She knows what she's doing.

605
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,880
There's no way she could be wrong about the age.

606
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,240
Bao,

607
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,240
take a break.

608
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,480
If there's anything else you'd like to eat,

609
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,440
just let us know.

610
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,680
Bao,

611
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,310
why don't you have some snacks first?

612
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:52,790
Sure.

613
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,070
Xuanling?

614
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Xuanling!

615
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,510
Bao!

616
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,000
It's only been three days.

617
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,960
Do you really miss me that much?

618
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,960
Perhaps I should've

619
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,000
brought you along to meet Gao Qiumin.

620
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,110
I'd rather not.

621
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,070
Mr. Xie,

622
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,830
Mr. Nan,

623
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
and Yao.

624
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,590
Greetings, sir.

625
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,640
Are the array materials ready?

626
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,640
Yes.

627
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,640
They're being refined now.

628
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,640
It'll be done in the afternoon.

629
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,720
In the afternoon?

630
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,110
It seems

631
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,920
you'll have to wait half a day longer.

632
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,750
Why don't you rest in your room?

633
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,030
By the time you've regained your strength,

634
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
the refinement should be complete.

635
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,510
Xuyue,

636
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,680
thank you.

637
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,110
Go get some rest.

638
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,590
You'll have plenty

639
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,590
to deal with

640
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,640
when you return to Snow City.

641
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,310
Xie Xuechen!

642
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,640
What is it?

643
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,920
You really are forgetful.

644
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,030
You still owe me an answer.

645
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,960
Fine. I'll ask you again.

646
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,550
Can I go back to Snow City

647
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,840
with you?

648
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,510
Mu Xuanling,

649
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,550
I have a question for you.

650
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,590
Answer me honestly.

651
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,630
Sure.

652
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,480
Do you really want to start anew

653
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,110
outside the Dark Abyss?

654
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,960
Don't move.

655
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,150
You want my honest answer, don't you?

656
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,760
You think

657
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,840
I always tell half-truths, and you can't tell

658
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,440
when I'm being honest, right?

659
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,630
Xie Xuechen,

660
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,550
I wasn't always like this.

661
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,840
There was a time

662
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,110
when I treated others very sincerely.

663
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,480
Do you believe me?

664
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,150
However, in the Dark Abyss,

665
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,320
sincerity and kindness won't keep you alive.

666
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,710
The Dark Abyss shows no mercy.

667
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,630
It only respects strength.

668
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,760
I had to fight my way through

669
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,360
and hide behind a facade

670
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,710
just to survive.

671
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,230
Only by surviving

672
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,670
could I meet the people I wanted to see

673
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,230
and repay the debts I owed.

674
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,670
I'm being completely honest with you now.

675
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,920
I don't want to return to the Dark Abyss.

676
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,960
I want to live under the sunlight.

677
00:35:59,150 --> 00:35:59,800
Will you

678
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,920
take me with you?

679
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,920
Your temperament

680
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,710
doesn't align with Snow City.

681
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,590
So when we get there,

682
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,500
you'll have to start as an entry-level

683
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,480
external disciple,

684
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,800
refine your character,

685
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,920
and turn over a new leaf.

686
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,000
Sure!

687
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,630
You mustn't use demonic power anymore.

688
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,590
I won't.

689
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,800
And no pestering me.

690
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,630
I...

691
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,280
That might be a bit difficult.

692
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,360
All right,

693
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,550
I'll try my best to restrain myself.

694
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,320
Xuanling,

695
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,360
did you really agree to Xuechen's conditions?

696
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,400
How dare you eavesdrop.

697
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,440
Oh, Xuanling,

698
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,110
I'm a Sniffer, remember?

699
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,760
Are you really

700
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
going to stop pestering Xuechen?

701
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,590
Of course

702
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,960
not.

703
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,530
So you lied again!

704
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,880
I didn't!

705
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,400
I just said I'd try my best to restrain myself.

706
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,070
Whether I can succeed

707
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,480
is another matter.

708
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,840
Xuechen will be

709
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,590
led astray by you sooner or later.

710
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,710
I'll take responsibility for that.

711
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,550
Sir, aren't you going to ask her to stay?

712
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,230
She's already made her choice.

713
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,320
I can't change her mind.

714
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,400
I couldn't keep her back then,

715
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,230
and I certainly won't be able

716
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,280
to keep her now.

717
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,000
All those candies

718
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,360
only earned me this tiny bit of her affection.

719
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
She's really hard to please.

720
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,480
Father.

721
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,670
Who were you

722
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,070
talking to just now?

723
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,920
A young spirit slave.

724
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,580
[Nan Wujiu]

725
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,710
Did Mr. Gao

726
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,360
refuse to lend us the Chaos Pearl?

727
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,630
It doesn't matter if my extra sense

728
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,070
can't be restored.

729
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,800
There's still a lot I can do.

730
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,020
For example, I could help improve Greenview Heights'

731
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,740
- defenses... - It doesn't matter?

732
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,230
How could you say that?

733
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,030
Do you have any idea

734
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,880
what strength and glory

735
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,030
your extra sense

736
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,070
could've brought you?

737
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,760
Greenview Heights is in decline.

738
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,440
I'd always hoped

739
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,070
you could restore its glory.

740
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,510
But look at you.

741
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,550
You've become nothing but a cripple.

742
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,510
And now you dare to tell me it doesn't matter?

743
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,550
Gao Fengxu wouldn't lend us the Chaos Pearl.

744
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,840
Let's go.

745
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,590
Father,

746
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,070
can I

747
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:39,960
take

748
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,280
that spirit slave with us?

749
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,840
Are you joking?

750
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,630
With three apertures destroyed,

751
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,190
you're basically

752
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,480
useless.

753
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,030
What right do you have

754
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,440
to ask the Immortal Alliance Leader for a spirit slave?

755
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,880
You...!

756
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,440
We had a fleeting meeting on an afternoon long ago.

757
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,360
To her,

758
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,840
I was just

759
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,190
the most ordinary passerby.

760
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,920
I couldn't take her with me then.

761
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,030
Nor can I keep her now.

762
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,190
When the timing isn't right,

763
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,030
everything becomes a mistake.

764
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,510
So, are you going to give up?

765
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,590
Give up?

766
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,070
I still haven't figured out

767
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,880
if she's the person I've been dreaming of.

768
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,550
If she's not staying,

769
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,190
I'll go with her.

770
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,920
What's the harm in that?
