You cannot find the Divine Child

352
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,550

what it truly means to be divine.

354
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,270
Divinity is not about race,

355
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,750
nor about lineage.

356
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,480

358
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,160
are truly divine.

359
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,750
But you

360
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,310
are unworthy!

362
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,510
is where you truly belong.

363
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,160
The Chaos Pearl should have remained pure,

364
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
but you are lost in love and hate,

365
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,640
no different from mortals.

366
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,350
You've driven yourself into this corner.

367
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:47,880
Do you regret it?

368
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,400
No regrets.

369
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,920
Every decision

370
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,070
was true to my heart.

371
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,030
I've told you before...

372
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,310
Zhao Ming's relationship with you

373
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,960
was purely for his own gain.

374
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,160
But he never once used me, not even in the end.

375
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,270
From beginning to end,

376
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,030
he only saw me as Pearl,

377
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,750
not the Chaos Pearl.

378
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,160

Fate,

381
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,200
you will never understand love.

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,310

00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,920
I will not,

384
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,640
nor can I.

385
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,640
From now on,

386
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,590
there will no longer be Saint Emperor Zhao Ming,

387
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,960
only Fallen Deity Zhao Ming,

388
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,240
forever imprisoned in the Lava.

389
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,030
Fallen Deity Zhao Ming?

390
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,960
Fate, how dare you!

391
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,750
Humans lack divine channels,

392
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,270
unable to cultivate.

393
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,690
Facing the mighty Divine Clan,

394
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,020
they are powerless to defend themselves,

395
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,480
left to be trampled and slaughtered.

396
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,440
Even at the last moment,

397
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,250
Zhao Ming scattered his own divine channels

398
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,270
to humanity,

399
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,590
so they could cultivate,

400
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,160
no longer living helplessly.

401
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,510
In the eternal night

402
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,680
without a single torch,

403
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,240
he was willing to be the first light.

404
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,680
This is Zhao Ming's noble spirit.

405
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,160
This is the man I love.

406
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,750
If you refuse to rewrite his fate,

407
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,270
then I will

408
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,720
write it myself.

409
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,590
Now that we're both badly hurt,

410
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,960
do you still wish to continue?

411
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,680
I'm still alive!

412
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,510
From this day forward,

413
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,920
your name shall be High Cyclic Divinity.

414
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,640
I have bestowed upon you the power of reversing time.

415
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,960
You will control time.

416
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,420
Greetings

417
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,120
to Your Supreme Deity.

418
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,030
My time is running out.

419
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,070
Listen carefully.

420
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,240
The Divine Clan

421
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,070
was destroyed by Zhao Ming and me.

422
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,000
Yet Zhao Ming became a demon,

423
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,000
imprisoned in the Lava.

424
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,920
I will also fall into sleep soon,

425
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,880
losing all my memories,

426
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,830
unable to save Zhao Ming again.

427
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,000
Only by casting his blood essence

428
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,880
into the cycle of rebirth

429
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,350
can there be hope for a reunion

430
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,720
thousands of years later.

431
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,440
After a deadly battle against Fate

432
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,440
when he was gravely wounded,

433
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,440
Is this the slim chance for survival

434
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,790
Your Supreme Deity secured

435
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,920
for Zhao Ming?

436
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,000
These words,

437
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,070
these events,

438
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,270
you will likely soon forget.

439
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,070
All memories of Zhao Ming

440
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,790
will be altered by Fate.

441
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,750
You only need to remember this:

442
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,640
You must wait here.

443
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,310
Many years from now,

444
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,680
someone will come here.

445
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,750
No matter what wish he makes,

446
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,510
you must agree to it

447
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,680
and help him.

448
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,200
Understood.

449
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,110
I can't say any more.

450
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,830
If I reveal the fate,

451
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,200
it will be erased.

452
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,110
That would ruin everything.

453
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,070
After you lose your memory,

454
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,200
how can you

455
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,960
find his blood essence again?

456
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,680
After thousands of years,

457
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,550
in the vast sea of mortals,

458
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,030
the one I fall in love with

459
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,200
will be him.

460
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,110
What exactly did you do?

461
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,880
The Book of Fate

462
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,230
and the Chaos Pearl

463
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,150
are interdependent and opposed.

464
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,710
You cannot control my fate,

465
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,320
and I cannot override your laws.

466
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,230
But, Fate,

467
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,440
even if the Book of Fate is burned

468
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,280
and the Chaos Pearl loses its light,

469
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,960
I will never yield.

♪Like passing through the snowfalls of ten thousand years♪

471
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,980

What is love, truly?

♪I hope we can spend our lives together♪

I will not let you die.

486
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,230
Fate,

487
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,400
you have disturbed the heavenly laws.

488
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,920
Your sin is unforgivable.

489
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,630
I have transferred the Chaos Pearl's

490
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,220
emotional fate onto myself.

491
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,510
Your Grace can destroy me.

492
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,800
Destroying you

493
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,480
would be too easy

494
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,800
for your sins.

495
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,230
I shall punish you by sending you into the mortal realm,

496
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,030
cursed by fate for all eternity.

497
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,670
None of your wishes will be fulfilled,

498
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,360
and you will be abandoned

499
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,030
by your love ones in every life.

500
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,280
You say I don't understand love.

501
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,360
Then I will also descend into the mortal realm

502
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
to see for myself

503
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,030
what this "love" you speak of

504
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,230
truly is.

505
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,110
At that time,

506
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,480
you will return to me,

507
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,320
won't you?

508
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,000
So,

509
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,510
Zhao Ming and Xie Xuechen

510
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,670
were truly one before.

511
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,550
It was you.

512
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,030
You altered Zhao Ming's fate,

513
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,150
turned right to wrong,

514
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,030
made him believe that Pearl betrayed him,

515
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,630
and suppressed him as a demon.

516
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,440
Even,

517
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,840
he himself believed

518
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,190
he was the bloodthirsty Demon Lord,

519
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,480
seeking to rule the world.

520
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,760
Zhao Ming is virtuous,

521
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,440
Xie Xuechen is righteous,

522
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,710
but the Demon Lord was force-fed with evil thoughts.

523
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,110
What wrong did he commit?

524
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,510
As for right and wrong,

525
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,960
there are no definitive answers.

526
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,960
Everything is fate.

527
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,030
To make the most virtuous person bear the most evil name,

528
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,760
is this the fate you gave him?

529
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,800
Ten thousand years of fate

530
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,510
are all in the stroke of your pen.

531
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,800
Now,

532
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,230
reverse Zhao Ming's fate!

533
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,880
The Book of Fate can only change one person's fate once.

534
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,320
Moreover, the condition for changing fate

535
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,030
is that someone must request it

536
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,510
and pay an equal price.

537
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,190
Ten thousand years ago,

538
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,920
the Divine Clan fell,

539
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,510
and that was the price to suppress Zhao Ming.

540
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,190
Now, if you want to change his fate,

541
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,070
the entire world

542
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,710
has no one who can bear

543
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,960
the same cost.

544
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,440
I don't believe it.

545
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,800
Why bother forcibly taking the Book of Fate?

546
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,920
I have already told you,

547
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,510
Zhao Ming's fate

548
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,000
cannot be changed.

549
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,440
Hearing is false,

550
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,800
and seeing is believing.

551
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,110
All of this

552
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,150
should've already returned to its rightful course!

553
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:44,440
"Zhao Ming descended into a demon. His fate was sealed.

554
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,280
It can never be reversed."

555
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,920
"The fate of a fallen deity can still be purified

556
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,630
with the Waterless Land's water cleansing his demonic body

557
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,000
and the Snow Cliff's ice sealing his demonic bones.

558
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,320
Then, the Chaos Power can purify it."

559
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,670
This is

560
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,800
the method to purify the Demon Lord.

561
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:11,960
Close!

562
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,400
The Book of Fate

563
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,400
clearly records the method to purify the Demon Lord.

564
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,480
Why didn't you tell me?

565
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,440
Yes,

566
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,840
use the world's most yang water

567
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,510
from the Waterless Land to soak his demonic body,

568
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,440
and use the world's most yin ice

569
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,480
from the Snow Cliff to seal his demonic bones.

570
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,480
Then, infuse it with the Chaos Power.

571
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,880
This will drive away his demonic thoughts

572
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,360
and cleanse his demonic body.

573
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,710
But the Demon Lord's evil thoughts are very strong,

574
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,330
and he hates you to the core.

575
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,370
If you go

576
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,840
to perform the purifying,

577
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,480
he'll easily kill you.

578
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,190
You must not proceed.

579
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,000
No matter the cost,

580
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,960
I will purify the Demon Lord.

581
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,230
Zhao Ming devoted his heart to the world.

582
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,960
He doesn't deserve such an end.

583
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,960
Xie Xuechen risked his life to protect this world.

584
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,360
I must safeguard it on his behalf.

585
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,800
Hey...

586
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,840
What's wrong with you?

587
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,760
Forcibly activating the Fate Array

588
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,800
has already consumed much of my strength.

589
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,400
Moreover, just now,

590
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,800
you clashed with me using the Chaos Power.

591
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,360
Even a divine body

592
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,030
would suffer greatly from such burden.

593
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,710
Ten thousand years ago,

594
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,320
you took my emotional fate

595
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,190
to save my life

596
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,510
at the cost of subjecting yourself to the pain of rebirth.

597
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,000
Over these ten thousand years of rebirth,

598
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,800
what have you experienced?

599
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,590
In these ten thousand years,

600
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,320
I've been many different people:

601
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,550
an emperor,

602
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,400
a general,

603
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,000
a scholar,

604
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,800
a performer,

605
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,630
a beggar...

606
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,190
lowly,

607
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,710
noble...

608
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,000
too many to count,

609
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,630
and too many to remember.

610
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,840
Yet in every life,

611
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,030
I barely remembered

612
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,480
that I was searching for something,

613
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,880
as if it were an object,

614
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,480
or perhaps,

615
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,230
a person.

616
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,000
It wasn't until this life as Nan Xuyue

617
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,400
that I finally understood

618
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,440
what I was searching for

619
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,320
was you.

620
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,630
I've sought you through ten thousand years of rebirth.

621
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,590
You have been in a deep sleep all this time.

622
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,510
But that's fine.

623
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,000
Anyway, in this life,

624
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,590
I have finally found you.
