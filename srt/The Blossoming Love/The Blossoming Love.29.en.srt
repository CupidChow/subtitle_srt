00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,120
Go.

195
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,870
How are you hurt?

196
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,550
Mister.

197
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,120
I'm fine.

198
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,480
Really.

199
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,720
Let's go.

200
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,910
Mister.

201
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,000
Mister.

202
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,320
Mister, are you okay?

203
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,030
I'm fine.

204
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Don't be afraid.

205
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,750
Ling.

206
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,670
Don't be afraid.

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,080
Why are the demonic patterns on her face

208
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,480
exactly like the sacred patterns

209
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,440
on the Chaos Pearl?

210
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,580
So...

211
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,120
Did it hurt?

212
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,750
No,

213
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,790
not at all.

214
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,670
Mister.

215
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,750
I'll be with you

216
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,440
wherever you go from now on.

217
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,740
No wonder Xie Xuechen

218
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,120
asked me for a spirit slave.

219
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,750
He's coveting the Chaos Pearl.

220
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,270
Xie Xuechen.

221
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,390
Give her to me.

222
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,440
What do you mean?

223
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,840
Where's the Spirit Lock key I asked you for?

224
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,910
Do you still want to play games with me?

225
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,890
I wondered at first

226
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,200
why you asked me

227
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,140
for an insignificant spirit slave,

228
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,000
but until I saw her face,

229
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,510
I realized

230
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,790
this is

231
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,670
what you want.

232
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,150
My nephew.

233
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,200
Give her to me.

234
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,630
My spirit is damaged,

235
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,320
and I don't know how much longer I can last,

236
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,150
so I can't waste my time here with Gao Fengxu.

237
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,200
Ling.

238
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,000
Wait for me.

239
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,910
I'm going to grab the key to Spirit Lock.

240
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,750
Mister.

241
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,960
Leave me alone.

242
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,720
I'm actually here for you.

243
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,960
My nephew.

244
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,790
You're at the end of your rope,

245
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
so I'm afraid you can't even withstand one of my attacks.

246
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,960
As long as you give her to me,

247
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I can forget about your conspiracy

248
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,240
with Sang Qi to take the Pearl

249
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
and your attack on this place.

250
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,360
I think you should know better than me

251
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,960
why Sang Qi chose today to attack.

252
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,440
You are the Immortal Alliance's Grandmaster,

253
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,840
yet you are greedy for treasures and power.

254
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,910
A heartless man like you

255
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,720
doesn't deserve her.

256
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,360
You...

257
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,600
It seems you don't need my mercy.

258
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,100
Mister.

259
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,820
Mister.

260
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,050
Mister.

261
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,000
Mister, are you alright?

262
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,120
Mister, are you alright?

263
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,270
Give her to me,

264
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,270
and I'll spare your life.

265
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,240
Don't be afraid.

266
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,510
Close your eyes.

267
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,720
When you open your eyes,

268
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,360
everything will be fine.

269
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,840
No.

270
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,080
Good girl.

271
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,240
Do as I say.

272
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,030
Okay.

273
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,750
Mister, I will.

274
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,390
Stubborn.

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,390

00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,680
you'd take me away soon.

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,070
Don't trust him.

386
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,680
You must leave.

387
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,480
I went back so many times

388
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,960
just so she could be safe,

389
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,680
but in the end,

390
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,240
the little warmth

391
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,960
I gave her

392
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,510
turned into a lifetime

393
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,110
of pain that she couldn't forget

394
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,440
and even killed her.

395
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,440
Xie Xuechen.

396
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,640
Ten years ago,

397
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,830
I saw you in the samsara mirror.

398
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,880
You knew

399
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,640
I couldn't save her even if I went back in time,

400
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,070
but why did you purposely lure me back

401
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,720
to the same mistake?

402
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,880
Do you know

403
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,550
what time is to me?

404
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,310
The beginning is the end.

405
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,750
The first is the last.

406
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,720
I can go back and forth in time and space,

407
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,920
but I am just an observer

408
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,130
who cannot make any changes

409
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,350
to the past or the future.

410
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,790
Likewise,

411
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,960
for High Fate Divinity,

412
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,590
it is the nature of fate.

413
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,310
All endings are revealed before the beginning,

414
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,680
and all attempts to change destiny

415
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,720
are destiny.

416
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,830
What did I do wrong?

417
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,440
What did Ling do wrong?

418
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,000
Why do we have such a destiny?

419
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,200
I don't understand fate either,

420
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,640
but a man once told me

421
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,510
to wait here for someone

422
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,720
who would solve the mystery of fate for me.

423
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,400
I thought

424
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,030
you were that person.

425
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,000
You have the Chaos Power.

426
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,030
The Chaos Power

427
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,960
can reverse the outcome.

428
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,350
But I can't even save Ling.

429
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,830
You can.

430
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,350
The Chaos Pearl gave you what was left of her power,

431
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,070
so she couldn't wake up,

432
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,030
but if you destroy your own spiritual channel,

433
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,550
the Chaos Power

434
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,920
will return to her.

435
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,440
However, in doing so,

436
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,720
you will die.

437
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,030
Completely.

438
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,550
In my mind,

439
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,070
it's not a reborn

440
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,830
but an exchange.

441
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,680
I can save her

442
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
by destroying my own spiritual channel.

443
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,200
Did you hear

444
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,830
what I said?

445
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,680
Yes.

446
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Very clearly.

447
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,030
I am merely

448
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,590
returning to her what is rightfully hers.

449
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,720
Anyone who crosses the Divine Execution Platform

450
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,070
is an idiot.

451
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,590
When I die,

452
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,680
the Chaos Power will return to Ling,

453
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,720
so where will my soul go?

454
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,310
A normal person's soul

455
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,750
will dissipate completely in this world,

456
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,030
but

457
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,050
yours seems

458
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,480
to have survived for 10,000 years,

459
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,720
so it might go somewhere else.

460
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,590
I have a soul that remains in the world.

461
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,060
You are just a tiny fragment

462
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,200
of me remaining in the human realm.

463
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,850
Is my soul really connected

464
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,070
to the Fallen Deity?

465
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,400
Why are you doing this?

466
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,160
I'm using the Jade Vault Technique to place limits on my soul.

467
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,960
If my soul is captured

468
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,310
by an outlaw after I die,

469
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,640
they will not be able to do evil

470
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,510
with this limitation.

471
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,880
The world should have been at peace.

472
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,070
Ling.

473
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,640
I return all this to you.

Xie Xuechen.

495
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,310
So it was you all along.

496
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,110
You

497
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,030
are Mister,

498
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,550
and since you have given me your life,

499
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,030
I will guard the human world

500
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,510
you love for you.

501
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,510
If I accidentally die

502
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,960
one day,

503
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,510
I'll be able to see you.

504
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,310
When that time comes,

505
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,720
don't blame me.

506
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,680
Xie Xuechen.

507
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,640
Xie Xuechen.

508
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,920
You left me alone again.

509
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,110
You're finally back.

510
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,110
Nan Xuyue.

511
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,440
How dare you show up again?

512
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,110
It was Xie Xuechen's fate

513
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,000
to die in exchange for your rebirth.

514
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,030
Don't use fate as an excuse.

515
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,690
If you hadn't planned to kill him

516
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,790
with Immortals Array,

517
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,070
how could he have traded his life for mine?

518
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,680
For all of this,

519
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,750
it's time to put an end to it.

520
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,310
You want to avenge Xie Xuechen,

521
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,960
but not now.

522
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,830
Your body is weak

523
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,200
from the Immortals Array breach.

524
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,750
Also, you just regained the Chaos Power,

525
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,400
so you're not very skilled at utilizing it.

526
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,590
Your Chaos Power should

527
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,030
be equal to mine,

528
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,790
but at this moment,

529
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,510
you have no chance of winning.

530
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,680
You are not Nan Xuyue.

531
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,310
Who are you?

532
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,030
It seems that regaining the Chaos Power

533
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,240
still hasn't brought back your memories.

534
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,310
It doesn't matter

535
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,160
if you've forgotten me.

536
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,310
Let me introduce myself again.

537
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
I am

538
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,750
fate.

539
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,810
You've been in a tough place

540
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,880
like Snow Cliff long enough.

541
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,200
I'm taking you home.

542
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,680
Why did you bring me here?

543
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,790
You and I began in the Foreworld

544
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,110
and were born in Chaos.

545
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,440
We've been together for tens of thousands of years in the divine realm

546
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,440
and lived only with each other,

547
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,070
and now you don't want to talk to me

548
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,000
and even think I'm an enemy.

549
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,550
It's ironic.

550
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,480
I don't remember

551
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,920
any of this.

552
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,710
All I remember is

553
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,920
that you killed Xie Xuechen.

554
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,110
It's OK if you don't remember.

555
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,070
Fate can't be changed.

556
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,800
No matter what the process is,

557
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,360
the result is the same.

558
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,480
The others are just a moment in time

559
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,670
for you and me.

560
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Only you and I are connected

561
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,710
for eternity.

562
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,880
I'm just Mu Xuanling,

563
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,400
and I never believe in fate.

564
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,070
Some moments are long,

565
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,920
but some long periods

566
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,510
are just a moment.

567
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,840
What matters is who I'm with.

568
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,110
I never cared about eternity

569
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,880
and will never be with you.

570
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,880
I've heard that in this world,

571
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,400
when two people get married,

572
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,480
it'll be for life.

573
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,710
Today is the day

574
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,360
you and I are reunited,

575
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,800
and it's a perfect time.

576
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,150
It is a good day

577
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,630
for us to be married.

578
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,920
I refuse.

579
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,800
All I think about

580
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,590
is Xie Xuechen.

581
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,190
Whether I live or die,

582
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,360
I only do it for Xie Xuechen.

583
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,710
Our marriage doesn't depend

584
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,230
on whether you want it or not.

585
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,230
Because you

586
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,590
don't have a choice.

587
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,800
Two Realms Mountain has an anomaly.

588
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,590
The demonic energy is so strong.

589
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,840
It seems a new demon

590
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,480
has been born in this world.

591
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,510
I've never seen

592
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,360
such a strange phenomenon

593
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,880
in all my years of cultivation.

594
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,440
But the Void Sea has been sealed,

595
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,920
and the Immortals Array has been rebuilt,

596
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:19,920
so have we

597
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,280
missed someone from the Dark Clan?

598
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,800
[Temple of Divine Execution]

599
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,920
Such powerful demonic energy does not come

600
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,030
from ordinary ones of the Dark Clan.

601
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,320
I'm afraid it's far stronger

602
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,670
than Sang Qi's.

603
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,190
That's impossible.

604
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,670
I've been to the Dark Abyss many times,

605
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,800
but I've never seen anyone stronger than Sang Qi.

606
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,100
[Temple of Divine Execution]

607
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,030
Who are you?

608
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,840
Xie Xuechen?

609
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,550
Now that the sects are without a leader,

610
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,670
and the Dark Abyss may cause trouble again,

611
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,940
the sects of the Immortal Alliance should work together.

612
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,480
Everyone, gather your elite disciples

613
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,510
and go with me to Two Realms Mountain

614
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,360
to find out what's going on.

615
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,280
Yes.

616
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,800
Bao.

617
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,550
Are you going

618
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,320
with them?

619
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,280
Stay in Snow City

620
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,550
and wait for me.

621
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,690
Be safe.

622
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,800
I'm speaking for my mom.

623
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,230
She's waiting for you.

624
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:20,960
OK.

625
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,960
How dare you come to the Dark Abyss again?

626
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,000
Good.

627
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Then let's have a good fight today.

628
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,070
I'll make you a corpse

629
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,800
before you get out of here.

630
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,670
Why can you use demonic power?

631
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,880
Trap him with Prison of Lust.

632
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,550
You overestimated yourselves.

633
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,780
[Temple of Divine Execution]

634
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,190
You're afraid?

635
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,880
A warrior's destiny

636
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,630
is either victory or death.

637
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,000
And those who are cowardly in battle

638
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,630
deserve to die.

639
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,400
Who are you?

640
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,280
I am

641
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,280
Zhao Ming.

642
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,110
You are the Fallen Deity who was suppressed in the Lava Chasm?

643
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,360
You are still alive?

644
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,890
I don't want to hear the word "the Fallen Deity" again.

645
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,730
Next time,

646
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,630
you die.

647
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,440
It's time to change the rules of the Dark Abyss.

648
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,190
From this moment on,

649
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,880
it's no longer the law of the jungle.

650
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,280
It's the law of me.

651
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,360
Those who obey me

652
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,230
live.

653
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,440
Those who fight me

654
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,280
die.

655
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,150
Long live the Demon Lord.

656
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,550
Ten thousand years have passed,

657
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,840
and my old friend is waiting for me.

658
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,150
It's time to catch up.

659
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,110
Master.

660
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,960
Miss Mu won't change.

661
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,710
We've been persuading her for a long time.

662
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,510
It's all right.

663
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,230
Leave us alone.

664
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,360
Yes.

665
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,960
You've gone mad.

666
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,630
I'm sober.

667
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,190
I know you don't want to wear a wedding dress

668
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,150
because you want to mourn for Xie Xuechen.

669
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,670
I won't force you.

670
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,590
If you wear all black and white,

671
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,800
I will too.

672
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,230
That would be a good match.

673
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,960
Since you're fate,

674
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,320
how can you believe in mortal marriage?

675
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,710
Of course, I don't believe in it,

676
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,030
but I know

677
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,590
you've always wanted

678
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,880
to have this ceremony with Xie Xuechen

679
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,960
and hold hands with him

680
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,880
in the presence of heaven and earth

681
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,320
until you die.

682
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,840
I can give you

683
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,150
what Xie Xuechen can give you.

684
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,480
I don't need you to love me

685
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,030
but just to be there for me.

686
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,400
The future is long,

687
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,360
so I just hope we can always be there

688
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,510
for each other.
