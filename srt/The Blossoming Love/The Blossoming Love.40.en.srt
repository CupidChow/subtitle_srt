192
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,790
we have already been cooperating for tens of thousands of years.

The starting point is also the ending point.

202
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,790
The beginning and end are intertwined,

The chance of life

205
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,910
lies in the moment of our reunion.

206
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,200
I never expected

207
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,630
that they would figure out this method.

208
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,480
But trying to defy me with human strength

209
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,910
is truly overestimating themselves.

210
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,390
These arrogant ones must pay the price.

211
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,320
Let them

212
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,000
be forever condemned.

213
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,670
Revered Saint Emperor,

214
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,030
do you truly understand yourself?

215
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,670

216

217
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,510
and rebellion

218
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,960
deep in your heart,

219
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,150
do you think they do not exist?

220
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,240
No,

221
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,080
the Demon Lord is the best proof.

222
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,080
He

223
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,390
is your dark side.

224
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,630
Zhao Ming is the Saint Emperor,

225
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,790
loved by the masses,

226
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,390
and you are the fallen demon of the Dark Abyss,

227
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,670
despised by the world.

228
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,960
You are Zhao Ming's shame,

229
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,480
the burden he most wishes to abandon.

230
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,360
What the world needs is the Saint Emperor,

231
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,030
not the Demon Lord.

232
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,550
Everyone calls you noble and selfless,

233
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,510
but when the ministers betray,

234
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,030
and the people turn away,

235
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,480
you truly feel no hatred?

236
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,360
When you separated from Pearl

237
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,790
to save the world,

238
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,200
you truly feel no regret?

239
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,750
You feel anger, obsession, and regret,

240
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,790
It's simply impossible

241
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,150
for you to remain pure forever.

242
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,270
Pearl awaited Zhao Ming,

243
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,960
Mu Xuanling awaited Xie Xuechen,

244
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,030
and you,

245
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,750
the fallen Demon Lord,

246
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,550
with no loved ones, no friends,

247
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,750
only seen as Zhao Ming's dark thoughts.

248
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,480
Your existence

249
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,720
is utterly meaningless!

250
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,120
Zhao Ming's heart is clear,

251
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,000
and the Demon Lord's heart has been released.

252
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,150
How could they still be deceived by Hao Tian?

253
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,270
There is no one in this world without inner demons.

254
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,630
As long as there is desire in the heart,

255
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,440
something to cling to, something to yearn for,

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,870
Hao Tian will find the flaw.

257
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,720
If this continues,

258
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,550
the incense will burn out soon.

259
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,870
This is exactly Hao Tian's plan.

260
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,840
Once this incense burns out,

261
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,360
the two Hao Tians

262
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,240
will return to their respective timelines,

263
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,240
and once again rule the world.

264
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,910
We cannot let Hao Tian succeed.

265
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,360
We must find a way to awaken them quickly.

266
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,840
The rule-free zone lies beyond our time and space.

267
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,270
We can't intervene.

268
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,870
The incense time is almost up.

269
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,840
If we can't kill Hao Tian now,

270
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,240
the world will be destroyed.

My true form is the Timekeeper artifact,

274
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,670
not bound by time and space.

275
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,870
I will give you all the power of Chaos.

276
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,750
You must stabilize time and space here,

277
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,670

278

279
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
and help them fight Hao Tians.

280
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,150
No!

281
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,450
Your true form will perish

282
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,340
with the collapse of the rule-free zone.

283
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,510
It's better to follow my plan.

285

The artifact's destruction

286
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,910
will cause a brief change in time and space.

287

The passage to the rule-free zone

288
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,790

our duty

304

But the fault lies neither with the sunlight,

379
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,510
nor with the shadow,

380
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,640
nor with you, who stand in its light!

381
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,920
Listen, how deceitful she is.

382
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,350
She loves the Beacon of Righteousness,

383
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,750
Xie Xuechen.

384
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,830
She's here now to help you,

385
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,790
but only to bring Xie Xuechen back.

386
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,310
What does that have to do with you?

387
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,550
See how she pretends?

388
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,240
She is an ancient artifact.

389
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,640
She has been on the Celestial Altar for tens of thousands of years,

390
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,350
observing countless lives and deaths, good and evil.

391
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,350
In fact, being emotionless is her true nature.

392
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,240
The rules are her fate.

393
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,440
You two

394
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,270
are destined to be on different paths.

395
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,160
You and I

396
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,750
are the ones

397
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
who understand each other the most.

398
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,680
We have no family,

399
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,680
and we've both lost our loved ones.

400
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,440
Though I have Pearl's memories,

401
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,590
I am not her.

402
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,160
You also have Xie Xuechen's memories,

403
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,160
but you are not him.

404
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,270
I understand you,

405
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,350
just as I understand myself.

406
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,480
Understanding?

407
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,720
You've always been wrong!

408
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,750
As the ruler,

409
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,350
you've disregarded life for ten thousand years,

410
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,160
slaughtering the world.

411
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,440
What is the difference between your actions and those of demons?

412
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,830
If Hao Tian is unkind,

413
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,920
and deities are heartless,

414
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,830
then this world doesn't need you!

415
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,270
It doesn't need us?

416
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,880
Think carefully,

417
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,350
the human race you once protected

418
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,350
betrayed you.

419
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,300
Even the Chaos Pearl,

420
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,200
nurtured with blood essence by you,

421
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,680
eventually betrayed you, didn't it?

422
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,400
It was she

423
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,550
who pushed you into the deepest abyss.

424
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,920
What's left to trust in her?

425
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,880
Ten thousand years ago,

426
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,590
you were suppressed by Fate,

427
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,400
falling from a revered Saint Emperor into a Fallen Deity.

428
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,350
Who ever gave you the chance to choose?

429
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,590
Zhao Ming,

430
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,550
whether to do good or evil,

431
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,720
the choice has always been yours.

432
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,110
You must know all this better than I do.

433
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,270
We've come here today, no matter the cost,

434
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,920
not for ourselves.

435
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,110
Just now, to bring me and Pearl in,

436
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,070
Nan Xuyue has already fallen.

437
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,480
Wake up,

438
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,000
otherwise all the sacrifices and efforts

439
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,680
will have been in vain.

440
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,440
I fell to the mortal realm after repairing the heavens.

441
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,030
You warmed the heart of that pearl.

442
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,680
You taught that pearl

443
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,240
what love is.

444
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,550
Now, I've regained my memory and power.

445
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,160
This time,

446
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,270
let me stand by your side,

447
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,750
and break all these unjust rules

448
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,790
of Hao Tian.

449
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,240
You once asked me for the power of Chaos.

450
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,720
I refused to give it to you

451
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,750
because I hope

452
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,880
that you can see who you really are first.

453
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,160
Now,

454
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,790
I, Mu Xuanling,

455
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,270
am willing to use the power of Chaos

456
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,640
to help you break through the universe,

457
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,960
and recreate the heavens and earth.

458
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,440
After the strongest clash,

459
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,750
both Hao Tians

460
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,110
have been completely gone.

461
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,070
Then

462
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,880
what will our ending be?

463
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,350
No matter the outcome,

464
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,200
if one of you survives,

465
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,750
the Demon Lord or Zhao Ming,

466
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,790
you must return to the time of ten thousand years ago,

467
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,590
and follow the original course

468
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,550
to walk history again

469
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,880
to preserve the future.

470
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,720
This method has never been tried before.

471
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,830
Everything must be decided according to the situation.

472
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,070
Does Xie Xuechen's soul

473
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,240
truly not exist anymore?

474
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,790
I'll say this once more:

475
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,400
Xie Xuechen's soul

476
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,270
has been completely integrated by me.

477
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,350
Have you ever considered

478
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,960
that with Xie Xuechen's soul fragment,

479
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,750
your power may surpass Zhao Ming's?

480
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,830
If your fight ends in life or death,

481
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
the one who survives

482
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,270
may very well be you.

483
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,110
Hao Tian is dead.

484
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,440
The world-ending crisis has been solved.

485
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,000
The world has been saved.

486
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,160
I die without regret.

487
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,920
But the established cause and effect

488
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,880
already exist,

489
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,510
and cannot be changed.

490
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,480
Future generations of people,

491
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,550
events,

492
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,110
and objects

493
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,880
are all derived and inherited from ten thousand years ago.

494
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,240
The major historical course back then

495
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,790
must not shift.

496
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,270
Otherwise, the entire future

497
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,030
will collapse.

498
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,440
The incense has burned out.

499
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,110
With the restoration of time and space,

500
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,400
you'll return to ten thousand years ago.

501
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,680
Whether to walk the old path again,

502
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:16,960
this time,

503
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,550
the final choice is yours.

504
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,000
Zhao Ming.

505
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,350
Pearl awaits Zhao Ming,

506
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,960
Mu Xuanling waits for Xie Xuechen,

507
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,030
and you,

508
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,720
the fallen Demon Lord,

509
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,590
with no loved ones, no friends,

510
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,030
only seen

511
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,000
as Zhao Ming's dark thoughts.

512
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,240
Your existence

513
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,550
is utterly meaningless!

514
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:39,960
You're back.

515
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,480
I'm not the one you were waiting for.

516
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,030
Let me ask you,

517
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,240
was it you who nurtured me

518
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,790
with your blood essence?

519
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,200
Was it you who taught me to be human?

520
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,000
Was it you

521
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,640
who gave me candy?

522
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,960
Was it you

523
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,790
who swapped the marriage agreement?

524
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,590
Was it you who left me alone

525
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,750
in this world?

526
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,240
Whether the world recognizes you or not,

527
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,960
I recognize you.

528
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,070
Zhao Ming,

529
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,030
Through these ten thousand years,

530
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,680
you must have suffered greatly.

531
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,640
But I'm no longer the Zhao Ming of the past.

532
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,550
I'm now consumed by dark thoughts.

533
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,880
What if...

534
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,550
what if I don't wish to walk the old path again,

535
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,070
and only want to stay by your side?

536
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,400
Then I'll follow your will.

537
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,510
In that case,

538
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,790
I will be a dishonorable scoundrel for once.

539
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,830
Mu Xuanling and Xie Xuechen

540
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,510
will never reunite.

541
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,400
Let us take their place

542
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,070
to see all the great mountains and rivers,

543
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,070
to witness this world together.

544
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,510
Even if we are scorned by all beings?

545
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,070
We are so powerful.

546
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,640
Who would dare insult us?

547
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,030
Besides,

548
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,510
wouldn't being a foolish emperor

549
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,720
and a demon empress

550
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,790
be quite wonderful too?

551
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,160
Even if the future world is destroyed?

552
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,160
I've never seen the future world anyway.

553
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,590
All I can see

554
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,240
is you right in front of me.

555
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,270
You little pearl,

556
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,240
still great at cheering people up.

557
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,240
But you don't need to comfort me with false words.

558
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,160
Zhao Ming,

559
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,200
you've endured ten thousand years of torment

560
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,640
and misunderstanding.

561
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,400
If it were possible,

562
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,880
I truly hope you could follow your heart and nature.

563
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,110
But I know,

564
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,030
whether ten thousand years ago

565
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,830

753
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,030
It's because I believed you

754
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,230
that I brought you to the Snow City.

755
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,440
Here,

756
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,550
you can live like an ordinary person,

757
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,230
cultivate and have fun with them,

758
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,510
without fighting or seizing,

759
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,030
brewing poisonous wine,

760
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,550
or sleeping in unease.

761
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,000
Xuanling,

762
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,510
half a day is too short to understand the human world.

763
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:41,110
If there's a chance in the future,

764
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,070
I'll show you the real human world.

765
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:53,840
