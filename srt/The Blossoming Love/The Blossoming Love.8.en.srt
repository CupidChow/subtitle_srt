I'm just wondering

why you like him so much.

54
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,960
Maybe

55
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,280

57

I've been thinking

58
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,580
why there's a vibe of old memories

59
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,240
and sorrow when you look at him

60
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,800
instead of just love and admiration.

61

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,480
We shall keep in mind that righteousness brought us together,

194
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
and we cannot yield.

195
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,750
Yes.

196
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
My lord.

197
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,020
[Jade Sky Palace]

198
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,060
[Jade Sky Palace]

199
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,700
[Xuantian Sect]

200
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,740
[Saint Fajian, Lord of Xuantian Sect]

201
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,500
[Saint Yinian, Elder of Xuantian Sect]

202
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,380
[Xuan Xin, First Disciple of Xuantian Sect]

203
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,820
[Mirage Palace, Hall of Lively Spring]

204
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,500
[Osprey Island]

205
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,780
[He Xianwo, Lord of Osprey Island]

206
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,940
[Duan Xiaorong, Mistress of Jade Sky Palace]

207
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,980
[Fu Yuanting, Lord of Jade Sky Palace]

208
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,510
Any news from the master?

209
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,390
When is he arranging for us to leave the city?

210
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,630
The master has responded

211
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,390
that you should stay in the city

212
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,870
and not act recklessly.

213
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,240
Xuechen is a smart kid.

214
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,670
If I stay longer,

215
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,150
I may lose my chance to leave.

216
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,600
Elder Yu.

217
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,630
Elder Yu.

218
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,320
My lord.

219
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,320
Sit.

220
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,270
Please.

221
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,000
My lord,

222
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,120
what brought you here?

223
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,600
Elder Yu. Do you remember

224
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,270
that we have an unfinished chess game

225
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,390
from ten years ago?

226
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,000
I can hardly remember it

227
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,720
if you didn't bring it up.

228
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,510
I remember

229
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,390
you insisted on having a game with me.

230
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,080
If I remember correctly,

231
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,240
I was

232
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,600
winning back then.

233
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,030
The game hasn't finished yet.

234
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,870
How can you tell who's winning?

235
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,240
How about

236
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,440
we finish the game today?

237
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,600
What do you say?

238
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,030
All right.

239
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,320
Xuechen,

240
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,480
it seems that

241
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,120
you didn't improve

242
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,600
your chess skills in the last ten years.

243
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,030
This game

244
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
is ten years old now.

245
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,030
Elder Yu, you are still good.

246
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,360
You never cut me any slack.

247
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,550
You care about winning and losing so much.

248
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,930
I guess

249
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,930
you have put a stake

250
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,960
in this game.

251
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,030
I do.

252
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,080
There is a stake.

253
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,080
Care to elaborate?

254
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,870
If I win,

255
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,320
you'll tell me the whereabouts of the master of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion.

256
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,390
If I lose,

257
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,960
you can have the Sect Leader's Jade Token.

258
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,550
He doesn't have his full power right now.

259
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,360
Attack!

260
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,000
Your spiritual power has come back.

261
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,120
I fully recovered

262
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,840
before arriving at Snow City.

263
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,750
Elder Yu, you are the head of law enforcement in Snow City.

264
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,120
You should know

265
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,600
the punishment for colluding with the Decaying Immortal Pavilion,

266
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,270
murdering the alliance leader,

267
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,870
and causing chaos in the human realm.

268
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,510
I think you know

269
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,200
that with me here,

270
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,000
you will not step out of the door.

271
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,350
Finish this game with me.

272
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,830
Let's finish

273
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,310
what we started.

274
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,550
Why did you betray us?

275
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,480
Do you remember

276
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,640
that the Immortals Array was broken once?

277
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,070
I organized our disciples

278
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,790
to resist the Dark Clan.

279
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,240
Nan Xuyue and you came to help us.

280
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,640
On that day,

281
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,720
there were 210 disciples

282
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,000
who fought under my lead

283
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,550
and none survived.

284
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,270
I…

285
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,830
I will never forget

286
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,960
their eyes.

287
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,790
Killing members of the Dark Clan

288
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,070
is easy

289
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,680
for you people.

290
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,720
But for us,

291
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,550
they are formidable.

292
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,720
The Decaying Immortal Pavilion is a powerhouse.

293
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,960
Their master is an unpredictable man.

294
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,440
He found me

295
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,030
and asked for my assistance.

296
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,590
I didn't want to die.

297
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,030
So…

298
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,590
So, I had to choose another leader.

299
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,680
Is it just about living?

300
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,110
Just?

301
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,310
Easy for you to say.

302
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,750
That's what makes you different from us.

303
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,680
Death is just

304
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,120
a normal

305
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,160
and natural thing for you.

306
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,110
But for us,

307
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,550
living

308
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,200
is our goal.

309
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,830
What does the master of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion want?

310
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,680
Peace

311
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,070
of the world.

312
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,750
Peace of the world.

313
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,030
At the cost

314
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,000
of the alliance leader, you, me,

315
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,400
and everyone else's life.

316
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,960
Is that it?

317
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,200
You don't care about the peace of the world.

318
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,820
You are just succumbing to

319
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,880
your fear.

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,270
Who murdered the alliance leader?

321
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,440
I don't know.

322
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,960
That night,

323
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,070
I got a letter from the Decaying Immortal Pavilion,

324
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,720
asking me to distract the guarding disciples

325
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,270
at the alliance leader's seclusion location.

326
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,070
I did their bidding.

327
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,960
[Yongqian Pavilion]

328
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,790
Get the disciples to leave.

329
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,750
Elder Yu.

330
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,030
Leave the Yongqian Pavilion defenseless.

331
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,880
The leader's seclusion is about to end.

332
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,920
Come with me for the preparation.

333
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:57,930
You exposed the leader

334
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,550
- Yes. - to enemy attack.

335
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,750
Yes.

336
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,110
That's how he was killed without a struggle.

337
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,550
What else did you do?

338
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,830
I put a sound barrier over the place

339
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,160
to keep the noise down

340
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,680
in case the leader

341
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,640
calls for help.

342
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,510
I don't know

343
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,550
what happened after that.

344
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,510
Where is the Master of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion?

345
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,550
The Master of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion

346
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,510
is a fickle man.

347
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,240
No one knows where he is.

348
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,160
I communicate with him in letters,

349
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,160
not face to face.

350
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,920
Xuechen,

351
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,030
is the result

352
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,080
of this game

353
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,590
mean so much

354
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,310
to the two of us?

355
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,310
The Spirit Clan, the Dark Clan,

356
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,680
and the Decaying Immortal Pavilion have formed an alliance.

357
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,830
You might be powerful,

358
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,680
but can you protect the whole world

359
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,790
on your own?

360
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,830
Do you…

361
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,720
Do you have to go to extremes?

362
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,070
The result doesn't matter.

363
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,560
What matters is that

364
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,000
you've made your choice.

365
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,070
I just

366
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,110
want to finish

367
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,590
this one last game

368
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,590
with the man who once fought by my side.

369
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,440
Maybe you are right.

370
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,590
I am not good enough

371
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,200
to protect everyone.

372
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,880
If I have sensed your fear earlier,

373
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,090
things wouldn't have

374
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,270
come to this.

375
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,160
Xuechen,

376
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,310
enemies in the dark are all taken care of.

377
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,350
Good.

378
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,070
I'll take it

379
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,750
from here.

380
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,960
Sang Qi and the Decaying Immortal Pavilion

381
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,240
are not going to stop.

382
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,590
When all the sects arrive,

383
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,200
there will be trouble.

384
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,160
Starting from tonight,

385
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,310
the barrier over Snow City shall be reinforced.

386
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,440
Everyone who enters or leaves

387
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,790
shall be monitored.

388
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,830
Yes.

389
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,000
My lord.

390
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,160
There's one more thing.

391
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,680
The new disciple…

392
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,720
I met her at the Two Realms Mountain.

393
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,030
My road back

394
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,070
was full of dangers.

395
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,550
She never left me hanging.

396
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,550
She has the intention for cultivation.

397
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,830
She's just a little naughty.

398
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,480
Elder Cang,

399
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,310
please be patient with her.

400
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,550
Xie Xuechen.

401
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,720
There is it.

402
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,240
You are the lord of Snow City,

403
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,030
yet you killed a human being.

404
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,550
I never said that I don't kill human beings.

405
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,000
The law of the world says

406
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,830
that murderers shall be punished

407
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,000
and killers shall pay for their lives.

408
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,920
I don't kill for no good reason,

409
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,590
and I won't let criminals slip through my fingers.

410
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,070
What about the Spirit Clan?

411
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,350
The same.

412
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,160
The Spirit Management Bureau is not thinking the same.

413
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,720
Guilty human beings

414
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,790
are enjoying a good life

415
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,750
while innocent members of the Spirit Clan

416
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,400
are suffering.

417
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,110
We can't generalize the problem.

418
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,640
But I will find a way to change things.

419
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,680
How?

420
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,480
Starting with you being a decent human being.

421
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,590
I sensed

422
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,400
sarcasm.

423
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,110
Respect your identity as the Snow City disciple.

424
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,750
Let people know

425
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,210
that not all members of the Spirit Clan are cruel and violent.

426
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,200
You have misunderstood me.

427
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,480
I am the best at being cruel and violent.

428
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,070
I'm only gentle

429
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,110
in front of you.

430
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,110
Unless

431
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,480
you can promise me rewards.

432
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,590
What kind of rewards?

433
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,550
You tell me.

434
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,400
In your dream!

435
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,000
Starting from tomorrow,

436
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,160
you will show up at the Hall of Heritage.

437
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,310
For every mistake you make, there will be a record.

438
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,480
Get ten records

439
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,790
and you shall leave Snow City.

440
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,200
You are the only one

441
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,510
who dares to talk to me like that.

442
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,550
If it's someone else,

443
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,440
I'll make sure that he never sees one more sunrise.

444
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,140
[Hall of Heritage]

445
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,070
I thought I could spend more time

446
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,030
with Xie Xuechen after joining the Snow City.

447
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,510
I never expected

448
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,510
to have classes every day.

449
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,480
Mu Xuanling.

450
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,240
Tell the class

451
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,750
why you joined the Snow City.

452
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,310
I…

453
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,590
My father adopted me when I was a child.

454
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,750
He was not in good health

455
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,310
or temper.

456
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,680
He looked

457
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,550
like a zombie every day.

458
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,200
The place we lived in

459
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
was a barren landscape

460
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,160
without a scrap of vegetation.

461
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,550
People fought and killed for a living.

462
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,490
My father wanted me

463
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,830
to be loyal to him,

464
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,590
so he threw me into the habit of bandits

465
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,110
and used all kinds of means

466
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,350
to force me to gain strength.

467
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,790
Mr. Xie

468
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,270
was the one who saved me.

469
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,440
What happened after that?

470
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,830
So,

471
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,030
to pay my debt,

472
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,110
I came here.

473
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,750
Okay.

474
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,590
In the five sects of the Immortal Alliance,

475
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,680
the Xuantian Sect Curse

476
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,110
aims at fighting the Dark Clan.

477
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,920
The spiritual plants from the Mirage Palace

478
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,920
are the best in the world.

479
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,830
The Jade Sky Palace focuses on the study of artifacts.

480
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,310
The Osprey Island

481
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,400
worships the power of nature.

482
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,440
Snow City

483
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,350
focuses on sword craftsmanship.

484
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,720
You mentioned that you were trained.

485
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:17,880
Show me

486
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,550
your progress

487
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,310
and your talent.

488
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,640
I can't let them know that I'm from the Spirit Clan.

489
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,400
It will be bad if they kick me out of the city.

490
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
I don't even have a sword.

491
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,000
I can't show you.

492
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,550
It's okay.

493
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,270
The sword is in your mind.

494
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,510
The way of cultivation in the Immortal Alliance

495
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,350
has three stages.

496
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,350
The first is the golden essence.

497
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,880
The second is the spirit manifestation.

498
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,680
The top is the spiritual form.

499
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,960
The spiritual form stage

500
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,550
is the goal for all cultivators.

501
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,880
Forms represent cultivators,

502
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,550
of their mind

503
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,160
and their power.

504
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,570
We are at the place

505
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,240
that is thickest with aura in Snow City.

506
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,270
It will help you with developing your spiritual form.

507
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,480
The lesson 101 of the sect

508
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,240
is manifesting

509
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,200
what's in your mind.

510
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,920
All right.

511
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,070
Exercise hard

512
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,030
and build a good foundation.

513
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,440
It's hard to contemplate quietly,

514
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,200
but it doesn't call for talent.

515
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,310
Just put the worldly thoughts aside

516
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,590
and focus your mind on one thing

517
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,790
to summon

518
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,550
a physical object.

519
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,640
Try it.

520
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,240
Isn't my physical object

521
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,070
quite powerful?

522
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,680
Really good.

523
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,480
You have to know

524
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,400
that the strength of your spiritual power

525
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,070
does not rely on the spiritual form.

526
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,030
It's about the power

527
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,310
of the cultivator.

528
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:12,960
So,

529
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,550
do exercise hard

530
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,000
and no slack off.

531
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,410
I want you

532
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,920
to keep your behaviors in check.

533
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,000
Don't do anything absurd.

534
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,400
And no disrespect

535
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,720
to His Grace.

536
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,680
All right.

537
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,240
Let's call it a day.

538
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,310
Class is over.

539
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,590
Elder Xie.

540
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,310
Mu Xuanling.

541
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,790
Yes, Elder.

542
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,500
You just joined us

543
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,800
and I forgot to tell you.

544
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,550
New disciples of the Snow City

545
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,400
can have days off on Qingming Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival,

546
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,720
and the eve of the Spring Festival.

547
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,680
Other than those, they shall wake up at the Mao hour and train

548
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,960
till noon.

549
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,510
In the afternoon, they will do

550
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,350
chores, farming, or guarding

551
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,030
as they were assigned.

552
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,440
It's your turn

553
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,310
to clean up today.

554
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,830
Can I use my power to do that?

555
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,760
You should

556
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,880
say no.

557
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,690
And then I'll say

558
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,640
that I was just joking.

559
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,880
So, Elder,

560
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,960
where am I cleaning today?

561
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,680
You look a little distressed.

562
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,200
Have you been busy

563
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,790
after becoming the city lord?

564
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,310
Well…

565
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,200
That's mine.

566
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,590
Are you so thirsty?

567
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,030
I have cleaned

568
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,720
13 yards

569
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,580
and a toilet today.

570
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,160
Fortunately,

571
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,400
the last one is your place.

572
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,270
Why did you clean the toilet

573
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,000
instead of coming here first?

574
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,790
I need to do

575
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,830
Elder Cang's bidding

576
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,000
and I want to spend more time with you.

577
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,960
I thought I was different.

578
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,350
That I might be able to assist you.

579
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,350
It turns out

580
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,680
that I'm just like everyone else.

581
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,510
Are you sure that you see me

582
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,270
like you see everyone else?

583
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,880
Have you washed your hands?

584
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,000
I was tricking you.

585
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,160
I am

586
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,000
the Saintess of the Dark Abyss.

587
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,640
How could I go clean toilets

588
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,510
if the situation is not critical?

589
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,680
Mr. Nan is staying in the Bright Snowy Pavilion

590
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,270
and your place is named Swirling Snow Pavilion.

591
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
The two of you are elegant.

592
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,160
Even the tree in the yard…

593
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,310
Why do you have a Xuanling Tree here?

594
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,640
It grows only in the Dark Abyss.

595
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,510
The seed can only be found in the Dark Abyss.

596
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,110
Have you been there before?

597
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,720
No, of course.

598
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,640
The elders say

599
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,270
that this tree was rooted here

600
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,240
a long time ago.

601
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,680
I don't know how

602
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,550
it got here.

603
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,270
So, it's called Xuanling.

604
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,310
The same as your name.

605
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,590
What a pity.

606
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,070
The tree doesn't bloom in the human realm.

607
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,280
I wish you could see its blossoms.

608
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,510
They are beautiful.

609
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,000
It seems that she couldn't

610
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,550
fit in with the life in Snow City in a short time.

611
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,480
I should have made better arrangements.

612
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,070
I'm thinking

613
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,400
that since this tree can grow up

614
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,230
outside the Dark Abyss,

615
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,840
you will find

616
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,510
your place in the Snow City.

617
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,190
Come with me.

618
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,840
First, his home,

619
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
now his room.

620
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,230
And then…

621
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,510
Xie Xuechen, I'm coming.

622
00:34:59,150 --> 00:34:59,510
You…

623
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,670
You…

624
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,760
Do you like

625
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,960
this sword?

626
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,800
If you ask me like that,

627
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,960
how can I say no.

628
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,000
I noticed

629
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,960
that you had no sword.

630
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,480
To cultivate in Snow City,

631
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,510
a sword is important.

632
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,190
If you don't like this one,

633
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,190
check the others.

634
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,960
These swords are like you.

635
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,190
Too tough.

636
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,630
I'm touched,

637
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,590
but they are not for me.

638
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,440
Come with me.

639
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:45,800
Where to?

640
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,590
The Tomb of Swords.

641
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,280
Each sword here

642
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,280
belonged to old timers or disciples

643
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,440
of Snow City.

644
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,760
They were like friends,

645
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,920
following the cultivator for their whole lives

646
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
and left in the Tomb of Swords afterward.

647
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,440
They are like monuments.

648
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,190
Disciples who just joined the Snow City

649
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,880
can pick one here

650
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,710
to be their swords.

651
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,280
So,

652
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,320
their former masters have…

653
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,320
People come and go, and humanity lasts.

654
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,030
I understand.

655
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,200
A Snow City disciple must have a sword.

656
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,590
If you don't like the one from before,

657
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,670
get one here.

658
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,110
Have you brought a lot of people here to pick swords?

659
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,150
You are the first one.

660
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,480
There are a lot of swords.

661
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,670
How should I get the right one?

662
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,000
You can sense the vibes of swords

663
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,550
and pick the one

664
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,510
that resonates with you the most.

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,230
Heartbeats.

671
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,190

I sense that you are seducing me.

677
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,410
This will delay my cultivation.

678
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,480
Stop the nonsense.

679
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,400

689
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,480
How about

690
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,000
First Sword?

691
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,100
[Temple of Divine Execution]

692
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,110
Your Grace, congratulations for ending your seclusion.

693
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,030
Your Grace,

694
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,630
there's a message from the Decaying Immortal Pavilion.

695
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,360
Xie Daocheng is dead.

696
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,280
Xie Xuechen has become the new lord

697
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,840
and sent a flame message.

698
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,000
The five sects of the Immortal Alliance

699
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,110
will gather at Snow City.

700
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,960
That's a huge move.

701
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,510
It seems that

702
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,030
he's trying to reverse the situation.

703
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,840
How much spiritual power

704
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,150
has Xie Xuechen recovered?

705
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,230
We… We don't know it yet.

706
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:51,670
Your Grace,

707
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,980
why do we have to rely

708
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,070
on the Decaying Immortal Pavilion for this?

709
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,010
Ignorance Demon can easily

710
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,230
find that out.

711
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,320
I need him for some other tasks.

712
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,880
Tell the Decaying Immortal Pavilion,

713
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,150
to check Xie Xuechen's strength as soon as possible.

714
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,230
Yes.

00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,590
are you going to

719
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,550
No.

720
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,550
I'm waiting for something.

721
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,320
