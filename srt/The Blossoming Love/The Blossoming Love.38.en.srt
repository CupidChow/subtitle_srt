[Episode 38]

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,710
How long do you want to play?

19
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,150
The fog was too thick,

20
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,310
so I just had a momentary lapse.

21
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,120
Where's my bracelet?

22
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,480
I dropped my bracelet in.

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
It's in Everlife Pond.

24
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,790
Take it out...

25
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,150
Thanks, Your Grace.

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,280
Can we go now?

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,430
In that case, I'll have to do it the hard way.

28
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,190
The chances are slim,

29
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,870
but I can only rely on force.

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,560
This is Saint Feng Xiang.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,470
God favors me.

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,450
How dare you pick Lotus of Life?

33
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,140
Here's my chance.

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,750
I don't mind getting hurt.

35
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,560
Now that we have the Lotus of Life, let's go.

36
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,280
You don't have to fight her here.

37
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,430
Want to leave?

38
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,910
Not that easy.

39
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,150
Ant to leave?

40
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,030
Why is a Dark Abyss demonic cultivator in the human realm?

41
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,910
So

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,520
the Immortals Array has been compromised?

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,560
Saint.

44
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,960
We meant no harm.

45
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,430
Look. The Lotus of Life doesn't grow to maturity,

46
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,360
so even if we eat it, we won't get longevity.

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,430
However,

48
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,750
an old friend of mine once

49
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,150
saved me with the seed of this lotus,

50
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,190
so I would like to keep this

51
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,000
to build a burial mound for him.

52
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,630
Picking Lotus of Life to build a burial mound?

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
Such arrogance.

54
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,870
Don't kill her.

55
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,600
Qian Guang.

56
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,510
Why are you here?

57
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,430
Feng Xiang.

58
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,630
I've always been here.

59
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,680
Qian Guang and Feng Xiang's predicament

60
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,950
was created by cyclic power,

61
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,000
so how did you make them meet?

62
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,430
I can even kill the immortal,

63
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,600
so how could I have been suppressed by a mere cyclic power?

64
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,800
But Cycles of Rebirth said

65
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,430
the price was demanded by Fate

66
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,830
and irrevocable.

67
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,750
Irrevocable?

68
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm the one who broke Fate,

69
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,600
so what can Fate's rules

70
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,270
do to me?

71
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Even if you could break Cycles of Rebirth's curse,

72
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,750
why would you do it?

73
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Are you doing it

74
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,430
to help Qian Guang and Feng Xiang

75
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,240
make up for their regrets?

76
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,190
Your Grace,

77
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,830
you've been so kind

78
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,720
and serious about helping others.

79
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,430
Kind and serious?

80
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,190
Long time no see.

81
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,480
It's been a long time, Qian Guang,

82
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,430
but it seems you've mistaken me

83
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,750
for someone else this time.

84
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,430
You look like someone from the past,

85
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,510
but you're not.

86
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,070
I bear no resemblance to him.

87
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,480
Did you come here

88
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,560
with the other one?

89
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,190
If you are still in the same predicament,

90
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,560
are you still willing to fight to the death

91
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,920
to save her?

92
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,870
Your so-called love

93
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,950
is ridiculous.

94
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,360
Qian Guang, you don't have to be so eager

95
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,270
to argue my relationship with him.

96
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,680
You have been ridding the world of demons for so many years,

97
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,950
so you should be well aware of the vast differences

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,560
between demons and righteous people.

99
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,430
There is a difference in what you want

100
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,190
but not in your original intentions.

101
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Why did you

102
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,070
come here?

103
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,630
Feng Xiang has been trapped

104
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,160
by the One-day Samsara for 6,000 years.

105
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,390
This false and ridiculous longevity

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,310
has tortured her endlessly.

107
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,870
You want to help her but you can't,

108
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,360
but what if

109
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,240
I could help you?

110
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,600
Do you know how?

111
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,720
In ancient times, there were ten suns,

112
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,160
nine of which were struck down.

113
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,510
Dark Cloud Mountain

114
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,750
is where those nine suns are buried.

115
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,550
The power of the heavens and the earth

116
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,790
does not come out of nowhere.

117
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,320
The One-day Samsara from Cycles of Rebirth

118
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,360
was created

119
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
by the cyclical power of the nine suns.

120
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,550
I can remove the power of the nine suns

121
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,630
with a blood moon

122
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,720
and make the One-day Samsara dissipate instantly,

123
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,720
but...

124
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,480
I've been here with Feng Xiang for 6,000 years,

125
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,960
and I know the cost and what we want are always equal,

126
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,670
so let's get right to it.

127
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
Based on Feng Xiang's injuries back then,

128
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,630
without One-day Samsara,

129
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,440
she wouldn't have survived more than a few years.

130
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,600
She stole 6,000 years of her life

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,510
with One-day Samsara.

132
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,670
If One-day Samsara dissolves,

133
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,630
she will also die

134
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,510
to repay the loss of the rules.

135
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,840
Since you have come to me,

136
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,480
you must have a solution.

137
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,150
Tell me

138
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,510
how to solve it.

139
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,440
It's not hard to solve it.

140
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,000
It only requires the exchange of lives.

141
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,120
If I trade my life for hers,

142
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,870
will she live?

143
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,960
Qian Guang.

144
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,080
You have to think clearly.

145
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,840
Don't think too well of me.

146
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,550
My intentions

147
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,840
have always been unjust.

148
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,120
Is there no compassion

149
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,720
in that injustice?

150
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,240
Of course not.

151
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,870
Well, I wouldn't doubt it.

152
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,200
Wait.

153
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,270
So

154
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,720
the long life I crave

155
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,510
is only for one day.

156
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,910
It was my fault.

157
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,150
My hesitation and cowardice

158
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,750
have resulted in irreparable regret.

159
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,360
You're not the only one

160
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,870
who didn't say what you should have said.

161
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,720
Since we weren't meant to be,

162
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,240
we could have just missed it,

163
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,420
but why did you get involved

164
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,480
in this curse?

165
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,670
Because I don't accept it.

166
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,600
I wanted to force it

167
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,840
and see if the outcome

168
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,720
would be different.

169
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Is that what you want to see?

170
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,360
I'm trapped in One-day Samsara,

171
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,870
and you have been spending 6,000 years

172
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,440
just by breaking free

173
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,480
for a moment while I sleep.

174
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,480
Feng Xiang.

175
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,480
You may not remember

176
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,030
that we also had

177
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,080
over 30,000 days

178
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,000
of loving each other.

179
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
In the first hundred years after I found you,

180
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,670
we actually saw each other day after day.

181
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,630
Why...

182
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,150
Why are you here?

183
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,600
Feng Xiang.

184
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,360
I came just to see you.

185
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,840
How are you hurt?

186
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,270
You don't need to worry about me.

187
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,120
Lotus of Life will take time to mature,

188
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:28,840
but I will wait with you.

189
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,240
How do you know I'm waiting for Lotus of Life?

190
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,910
I've been following you

191
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,840
since you left,

192
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,120
so I naturally know what you seek.

193
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,360
What you seek

194
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,440
is the cultivation

195
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,320
and me,

196
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,480
right?

197
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,600
If you don't want to answer,

198
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,150
I'll do it.

199
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,870
In my life,

200
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,360
I care about the world

201
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,720
and you.

202
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,200
This love will not die.

203
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,320
But you said before

204
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,790
that you already have someone you love.

205
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,320
But why

206
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,120
can't it be you?

207
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
That person

208
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,120
was always you.

209
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,750
Feng Xiang.

210
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,790
Will you forgive me for my cowardice

211
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,080
and stupidity

212
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,270
and be willing to start over with me?

213
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,750
Why didn't you

214
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,750
say this earlier?

215
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,870
Between the eternal life and you,

216
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,440
I choose you.

217
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,000
Feng Xiang.

218
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,670
I've come just to see you.

219
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,150
How is your wound?

220
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,670
You don't need to worry about me.

221
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,910
I have things to do.

222
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,240
Qian Guang, go back to the Immortal Alliance.

223
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,200
Thanks to you,

224
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,840
the Dark Clan has been sealed

225
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,150
and the human realm is safe now.

226
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,120
Aren't you bored

227
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,750
here alone?

228
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,910
Of course not.

229
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,960
But I am bored

230
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,600
and need your company.

231
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,840
I don't have time for that.

232
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:21,840
Don't worry.

233
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,630
I do.

234
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,390
Every day you wake up,

235
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,360
you don't remember.

236
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,670
Every day you wake up,

237
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,120
we're in love again.

238
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,030
Feng Xiang.

239
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,600
Will you forgive me

240
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,720
and give me

241
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,390
a chance to start over?

242
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,790
Why are you so skillful?

243
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,510
Do you have another favorite?

244
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,270
Of course not.

245
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,630
My heart

246
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,550
is only for you.

247
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,840
How could I have another favorite?

248
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,390
I've been repeating the same confessions

249
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,790
and entanglements

250
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,320
for over 30,000 days,

251
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
so I'm just skillful.

252
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,080
Six thousand years.

253
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,790
Over two million days and nights.

254
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,270
You're the only one

255
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,400
who knows and remembers it.

256
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,600
In fact, it's not me who suffers

257
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,630
but you.

258
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,150
There's something I want to tell you.

259
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,910
Actually,

260
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,630
I fell in love with you

261
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,270
a long time ago.

262
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,880
I want to confess my feelings to you

263
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,750
while I still remember.

264
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,400
Did I say that

265
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,550
in those 30,000 days?

266
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,680
That's good.

267
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,830
Actually, it's my fault that we missed each other

268
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,030
for 6,000 years.

269
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,200
My pride wouldn't allow me

270
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,590
to show that in the slightest

271
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,510
in front of you.

272
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,110
Your pride

273
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,400
is not at fault.

274
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,200
Saint Feng Xiang,

275
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,000
you are talented, beautiful,

276
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,640
and honorable.

277
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,030
You should be proud

278
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,550
in your lifetime.

279
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,550
So

280
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,590
what about the blood moon tonight

281
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,030
and our meeting?

282
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,880
For breaking your One-day Samsara.

283
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,550
At what cost?

284
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,830
My soul will vanish,

285
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,680
so tonight

286
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,200
will be my last night in this world.

287
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,270
If it's in exchange for your life,

288
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,120
I won't allow it.

289
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,690
From the moment we met,

290
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,790
it was a foregone conclusion.

291
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,200
It's that man from earlier.

292
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,880
I'll beg him.

293
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
That's what I begged.

294
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,030
At first, I made a wish

295
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,030
to Cycles of Rebirth because I was afraid

296
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,640
I wouldn't be able to be with you forever,

297
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,510
but after 6,000 years, I finally realized

298
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,440
that immortality

299
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,920
isn't the true meaning of life

300
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,110
and that being together forever

301
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,680
isn't the only proof of love.

302
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,750
Do you remember

303
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,750
what I told you

304
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,830
when I first met you?

305
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,200
How can we break the spiritual form

306
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,510
without seeing all beings?

307
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,680
How can we attain immortality

308
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,480
without doing what is right in front of us?

309
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,590
Feng Xiang.

310
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,680
You shouldn't be stuck here

311
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,750
but go out into the world

312
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,850
and see how people live.

313
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,350
But you will die.

314
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,750
You and I are allies,

315
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,110
comrades,

316
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,440
and companions.

317
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,310
No matter what we are,

318
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,880
apart from the bond,

319
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,110
there is another word between us,

320
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,510
fulfillment.

321
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,160
Feng Xiang.

322
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,350
Forgive me.

323
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,320
This time, I will go first,

324
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,790
but I don't want you

325
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,650
to feel the pain of loss,

326
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,920
so I will erase your memory.

327
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
When you wake up,

328
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,070
you will forget me

329
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,160
and this 6,000-year-old obsession.

330
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,880
Promise me

331
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,510
to be a happy

332
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,200
and carefree Feng Xiang

333
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,640
after you forget me,

334
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,350
okay?

335
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,480
What if I don't?

336
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,920
Then I will force you once more.

337
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,110
Feng Xiang.

338
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,000
You know it.

339
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,030
I have a way.

340
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,120
Every time I fight you,

341
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,670
I always lose.

342
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,640
Feng Xiang.

343
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,030
You just need to sleep

344
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,750
a little more.

345
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,950
When I wake up from my sleep,

346
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I will forget you completely and utterly.

347
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,400
At that time,

348
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,080
I'll see the world

349
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,670
and their lives.

350
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,400
Don't regret it.

351
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,950
OK.

352
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,190
OK.

Feng Xiang.

360
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,470
I've had a favorite for a long time.

Thank you for helping me fulfill my dream.

372
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,270
Thank us?

373
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,140
For what?

374
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,480
My death gives Feng Xiang

375
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,290
a new life,

376
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,860
so I must thank you.

377
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,400
We're just getting what we want.

378
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,320
I have erased Feng Xiang's memory.

379
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,850
She won't remember me

380
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,920
when she wakes up.

381
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,750
Phoenix Perch Forest is dangerous,

382
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,510
and Feng Xiang is weak tonight,

383
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,750
so I'd like to ask you

384
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,080
for one more favor.

385
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,710
Please take care of her.

386
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:35,920
Thank you.

387
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
You and your love

388
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,670
won't be remembered by her,

389
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,080
which means it's all gone.

390
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,750
Are you really willing to do that?

391
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,230
Love doesn't be gone.

392
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,800
Her everyday happiness and carefreeness

393
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,750
are where my love belongs.

394
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,750
Let's go.

395
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,620
Then I'll follow you

396
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,980
to meet the living

397
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,460
and finish what is in front of us.

398
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,990
How are you doing on Osprey Island?

399
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,760
I appreciate your concern.

400
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,990
All is well.

401
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,920
Saint Feng Xiang stole the array's diagram

402
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,270
and was taken into the Death Door.

Do you know us?

427
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,920
I'm not old enough to be forgetful.

428
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,190
Yesterday, you came to Waterless Land

429
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,160
for the Lotus of Life

430
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,750
and fought me.

431
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,160
Have you forgotten?

432
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,750
She knows what happened yesterday,

433
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,230
so the curse of One-day Samsara has been broken.

434
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:51,990
So did you lose or win?

435
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,120
You're so narrow-minded,

436
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,160
but I won't deny

437
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,920
that you're above me.

438
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,400
I lost.

439
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,920
If you want Lotus of Life,

440
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,400
take it.

441
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,030
The Lotus of Life takes a hundred years to bloom.

442
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,600
If you want it,

443
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,230
you'll have to wait another hundred years here.

444
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,640
Waiting here for 100 years

445
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,750
just for a Lotus of Life?

446
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,400
Boring.

447
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,560
So boring.

448
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,920
Didn't you come to Waterless Land

449
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,750
to find the Lotus of Life and achieve immortality?

450
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,360
Immortality?

451
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,560
I'm just curious

452
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,920
if there's a Lotus of Life in this place

453
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,840
not to achieve immortality.

454
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,840
Besides, girl,

455
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,080
do you really think

456
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,560
immortality is a blessing?

457
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,840
You're going to look for Qian Guang?

458
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,920
Who is Qian Guang?

459
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,270
Why should I look for him?

460
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,470
Everyone knows

461
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,990
that Qian Guang

462
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,800
was the first Lord of the Immortal Alliance.

463
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,030
The Immortal Alliance is a bunch

464
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,750
of stereotypical guys who only fight demons and protect the world.

465
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,230
I don't want to be associated with them.

466
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,320
I couldn't agree more.

467
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,430
So where are you going now?

468
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,800
I haven't decided yet,

469
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,670
but since the world is so big,

470
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
there must be some lively and interesting places.

471
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,970
I advise you not to stay

472
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:25,990
in this deserted place

473
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
and waste your time.

474
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,430
It has been a thousand years since she woke up from her dream.

475
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,270
She has finally let go

476
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,320
of someone she once couldn't forget

477
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,710
or meet.

478
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,640
Do you really believe she has forgotten?

479
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,190
Only she knows

480
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,990
if she's forgotten.

481
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,010
As long as she can let go,

482
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,990
it doesn't matter if I believe it or not.

483
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,920
What about you?

484
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,320
Have you let go?

485
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,030
What do I need to let go of?

486
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,990
Now that we've got Lotus of Life

487
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,160
and enjoyed the story,

488
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,160
let's go to Snow City.

489
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,230
Qian Guang.

490
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,230
I'm sorry.

491
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,950
I didn't keep my promise.

492
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,950
You and I have equal cultivation,

493
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,800
so if I don't agree,

494
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,030
you can't erase my memory.

495
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,400
It's painful to have memories,

496
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,510
but I still don't want to forget you.

497
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,160
I will try to accomplish

498
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,510
what you want.

499
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,400
To see all beings

500
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,600
and their lives.

501
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,360
I'll be as free, carefree,

502
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,640
proud, and honest

503
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,230
as you want me

504
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,080
to be.

505
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,360
[Bright Snowy Pavilion]

506
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:28,920
Mr. Nan.

507
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,160
Please pass this

508
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,230
on to Feng Yao.

509
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,800
I'd like to give her a small gift

510
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,560
to thank her for taking care of me

511
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,320
these past few days.

512
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,400
Have you totally healed?

513
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,360
The demonic energy in my body was expelled,

514
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
but it created an obsession,

515
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,030
so I still have inner demons.

516
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,120
Those who have inner demons

517
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,750
may not be evil,

518
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,950
and those who do not

519
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,920
may not be free of evil thoughts.

520
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,430
Many things change

521
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,800
because of a single thought.

522
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,710
Fate.

523
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,120
Do you also have obsessions?

524
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,920
Do you want to observe my heart?

525
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,160
I am disturbed by inner demons,

526
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,600
so if I could stand on top

527
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,470
of millions of years,

528
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,840
would I be able to comprehend it?

529
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,670
Time is not the key

530
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,230
to whether you can comprehend it or not.

531
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,430
Comprehending it is easy, but doing it is hard.

532
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,230
If I can remember

533
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,510
and forget,

534
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,320
I need not force it.

535
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,600
Farewell.

536
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,840
Are you really going to keep avoiding him?

537
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,080
Xuanxin is a meticulous observer,

538
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,080
so it would be better for both of us

539
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
if we didn't see each other anymore.

540
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,990
He may have noticed.

541
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,990
You're surely a family,

542
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
so you guys like the same things.

543
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,270
We don't have to reunite.

544
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,510
It'll be fine if he and I

545
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,430
are both fine.

546
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,510
Why are you here so late?

547
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,360
Did you cry?

548
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,100
I didn't.

549
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,880
The evening breeze is a bit cool today,

550
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,190
causing my eyes to be a bit dry.

551
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,670
I noticed something unusual

552
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,120
in the sky tonight.

553
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,080
These two stars are bright and dim

554
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,470
and very unfavorable to me,

555
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,320
so

556
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,510
I did a divination

557
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,400
and found out

558
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,920
that I have to give my beloved one

559
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,080
her beloved things

560
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,030
to solve it.

561
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,360
The people I love can only protect me

562
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,320
when she's happy.

563
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,990
Whether I want to protect you or not

564
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,230
depends on whether your gift

565
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,470
is to my liking

566
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,750
or not.

567
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,920
Of course.

568
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,050
It seems

569
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,920
I have quite the talent

570
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,900
for casting artifacts.

571
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,280
I recast Hossu Sword perfectly

572
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,200
with just

573
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,150
a little research.

574
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,680
How's that?

575
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,630
Hossu Sword

576
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,400
is different from ordinary swords.

577
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,280
Its blade is repulsive to all ores,

578
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,430
so there has never been a way to recast it.

579
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,030
You must have put a lot of thought into it.

580
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,360
Fu Lansheng.

581
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,760
Thank you.

582
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,400
Why do you need to say thank you to me?

583
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,720
I want to see you and this sword

584
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,430
on top of the Humans.

585
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,030
Those were just arrogant words

586
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,240
in my ignorance.

587
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,840
I've seen my own mediocrity

588
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,150
long after all the events I've endured.

589
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
I have nine channels

590
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,920
and have trained for over a decade

591
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,320
but I am still at the Golden Core stage.

592
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,950
My master has passed on his life's cultivation to me,

593
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,030
but I have only just broken through spirit manifestation.

594
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,680
Along the way,

595
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,920
I have wanted to do many things

596
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,760
but have accomplished very few.

597
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,800
The Hossu Sword

598
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,320
is the symbol

599
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,280
of successive Mirage Palace leaders.

600
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,630
But that day in the Dark Abyss,

601
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,720
I couldn't even hold onto it.

602
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,470
The Hossu Sword was broken

603
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,800
because of my incompetence after all.

604
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,110
That is why

605
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,920
you refused your seniors' offer

606
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,630
to succeed you in the Mirage Palace.

607
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,680
Qiumin.

608
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,400
You are extraordinary.

609
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,950
You were willing

610
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,430
to lay down your life

611
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,110
to save your seniors who had taunted you,

612
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,070
and you defied He Xianwo,

613
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,990
who was so much more powerful than you.

614
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,840
You've been in danger many times

615
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,920
but stepped forward without hesitation.

616
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,150
Also, you often

617
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,680
say things

618
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,720
that I find shocking.

619
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:05,990
Human nature

620
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,070
makes us avoid harm,

621
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,400
but you've always done

622
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,630
what you knew you couldn't do.

623
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,360
Every time I saw that,

624
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,840
I wondered

625
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,950
if I should try harder

626
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,550
or be braver.

627
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,030
Today,

628
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,990
why do you always say nice things?

629
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,720
Those aren't nice

630
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,430
but true.

631
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,070
Qiumin.

632
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,680
You've illuminated me in many moments

633
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
when you weren't aware.

634
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,510
I'm sure you'll illuminate

635
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,680
many more others.

636
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,840
If you don't believe in yourself,

637
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,920
you can believe in me.

638
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,760
Not only me,

639
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,550
but many people believe in you.

640
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,720
Among all my disciples,

641
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,200
you are the only one

642
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,920
who has never intentionally tried to realize

643
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,400
but has achieved

644
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,550
no obsession.

645
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,360
No obsession means no inner demons.

646
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,630
Xuanxin.

647
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,110
Your faith

648
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,880
has surpassed mine.

649
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,430
No, Master.

650
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,720
I also have obsessions

651
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,880
as well as inner demons.

652
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,030
Obsessions. Inner demons.

653
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,240
One thought can make you immortal or demonic.

654
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,990
Is there really no way

655
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,110
to rid the world of inner demons?

656
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
I'm sorry.

657
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,400
As Lord of the Immortal Alliance,

658
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,280
am I really incapable of ridding the world of demons?

659
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,070
Greed, anger, stupidity.

660
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
Live with obsessions.

661
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,110
Your faith is unstable.

662
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,430
Forget what you should forget.

663
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,510
What you have not gained

664
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,240
won't make you obsessive.

665
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,150
If you fail to keep something,

666
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,360
how can you not have an obsession?

667
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,920
So what if you have the goods without the obsession?

668
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,840
So what if you have

669
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,110
or don't have an obsession?

670
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,400
The world is endless.

671
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,200
Life is like the morning dew.

672
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,150
All origins

673
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,990
are zero.

674
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,400
All origins

675
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,200
are zero.

676
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,470
So what if you have

677
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,990
or don't have an obsession?

678
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,360
Why obsessed with obsession?

679
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,400
The world is endless.

680
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,030
Life is like the morning dew.

681
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,280
All origins

682
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,760
are zero.

683
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,950
Xuanxin.

684
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,840
I believe

685
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,920
you'll make it.

686
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,510
Mind's emergence

687
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,920
gave birth to all kinds of obsessions,

688
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,030
and its demise

689
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,590
gave birth to all kinds of demons.

690
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,920
So what if there are obsessions?

691
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,280
I wouldn't have inner demons even if I had obsessions.

692
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,460
Why did you lay a death trap in Snow City?

693
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,550
Tomorrow, the Demon Lord will come,

694
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,840
so I'm inviting him into this trap.

695
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,680
Don't you believe Mu Xuanling can fulfill her plan?

696
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,320
I don't believe in anything.

697
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,280
Feng Yao.

698
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,110
Do you know what the world in the painting

699
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,990
and the world out of it are?

700
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,470
The in-painting world

701
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
is your creation.

702
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,560
The outside world

703
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,800
is where we really are.

704
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,550
How do you know

705
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,130
if you're in or out

706
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,110
of the painting?

707
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,550
With my heart,

708
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,950
I don't have to know.

709
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,070
It's the same wherever I am.

710
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,430
With your heart?

711
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,880
If the heart can solve everything,

712
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,720
everything will be fine.

713
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,680
Why are you in a hurry to get the sword?

714
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,020
Since we're in the old haunt,

715
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,360
why don't we feel it?

716
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,400
What trick are you playing now?

717
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,400
It's just a trap for you.

718
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,060
Once again, you're teaming up

719
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,440
with him to find a way to get at me?

720
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,720
Not exactly.

721
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,630
When I brought you to Ethereal Jade Island and Snow Cliff,

722
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,400
I lied to you on the way,

723
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,850
but I never meant to hurt you

724
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,240
but to purify you

725
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,320
to help you get back on the right path.

726
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,200
Back on the right path?

727
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,640
Whether I'm good or evil,

728
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,660
I am what I am, so how do you purify me?

729
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,420
You're just like

730
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,470
all those stupid beings

731
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,520
who want a righteous light that cares

732
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,720
for the world and sacrifices itself for others.

733
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,680
You...

734
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,510
This...

735
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,070
This ice is weird...

736
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,950
Exactly.

737
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,680
What is going on here?

738
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,880
The Demon Lord cannot be purified.

739
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,780
The only way to purify him

740
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,360
is to kill him.

741
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,680
But I saw the method of purification

742
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,760
in The Book of Fate.

743
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,090
You never entered the real Book of Fate.

744
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,110
You entered an illusion that I created.

745
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,630
What you saw

746
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,240
was what I wanted you to see.

747
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,680
You deliberately used the Purification

748
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,070
of Demon Lord as bait

749
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,360
to lure me into your plan of killing him.

750
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,200
That's right.

751
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,590
I said Waterless Land would cleanse the demon's body,

752
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,070
but I actually wanted to crush his soul with spiritual water.

753
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,280
I said Snow Cliff's ice could lock up the demon's bones,

754
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,880
but I actually wanted to kill the demon's spirit

755
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,030
with the ice of a thousand years.

756
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,320
Now all that's left is the final step,

757
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,430
which is to use the Chaos Power

758
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,470
to kill Demon Lord completely.

759
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,200
The Chaos Power was given to you by me,

760
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,680
so naturally, I can seal it.

761
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,360
Even if you seal the Chaos Power,

762
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,360
so what?

763
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,760
I have already laid a dragnet in the city.

764
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,000
Xuanxin broke through the spiritual form

765
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,420
and upgraded the curse.

766
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,360
He's leading the Immortal Alliance on the outside.

767
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:46,320
Demon Lord.

768
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,990
You can't escape Snow City.

769
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,880
Why did you have to kill him?

770
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,360
Because when Hao Tian comes into the world,

771
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,550
he will destroy it.

772
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,950
And Demon Lord is connected to Hao Tian.

773
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,510
Hao Tian created the world,

774
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,280
so how could he destroy it?

775
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,070
This is not something

776
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,400
that can be explained in a few words.

777
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,720
All you need to remember

778
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,320
is that if you don't kill the Demon Lord,

779
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,920
Hao Tian will surely destroy the world

780
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,470
after he comes.

781
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,030
Do you want to see the world

782
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,990
that Xie Xuechen has fought so hard to protect

783
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,690
being completely destroyed?

784
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,400
Demon Lord's evil thoughts were imposed by The Book of Fate,

785
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:48,300
but even so,

786
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,550
his good thoughts are still intact,

787
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,240
so he shouldn't be killed just like that.

788
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,720
If you miss this opportunity,

789
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,050
you will never be able to kill me again.

790
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,050
Think well.

791
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,730
After all that happened,

792
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,510
I've seen that you're not an evil person.

793
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,280
Even with the coming of Hao Tian,

794
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,630
I believe that man can triumph over the immortal.

795
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,180
Just like Zhao Ming and Xie Xuechen,

796
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,170
we are all fighting against the immortal.

797
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,800
I am evil by nature,

798
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,150
but you answered quite well.

799
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,280
