and taught you the Jade Vault Technique,

96
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,480
you shouldn't waste

97
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,040

Why didn't I

104
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,920
just kill him in one strike

105
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,040

106
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,480

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,000
It's easy.

111
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,480
When my Jade Vault Technique is ready,

112
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,510
I will take Xie Xuechen's head down

113
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,600
and hang it in the Temple of Divine Execution

114
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,510
as a keepsake for you.

115
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,750
To guard the Chaos Pearl, the Immortal Alliance

116
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,720
paid a great price.

117
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,070
All that just for

118
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,630
a fake!

119
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,630
But when was

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,950
the Chaos Pearl switched.

121
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,040
I think it was a fake

122
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,070
that was put in the Pearl Tower in the first place.

123
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,630
I believe

124
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,360
that with Leader Xie's integrity,

125
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,430
he will never do something like that.

126
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,360
Besides,

127
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,160
he guarded the Chaos Pearl

128
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,720
with his life.

129
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,480
So,

130
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,510
we can remove him

131
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,920
from the list of suspects.

132
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,270
Then it must have been switched

133
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,680
before it was put in the Pearl Tower.

134
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,360
Is it

135
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,510
Moonlight Heights?

136
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,480
What we can be sure of

137
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,950
is that the real Chaos Pearl

138
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,800
is not in the Decaying Immortal Pavilion.

139
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,000
That's one thing to be glad about.

140
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,240

143

144

But you guys should understand

145
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,750
that the Immortal Alliance

146
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,160

148
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,680
It is guarding the tranquil life of humanity

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,070
and peace of the world.

150
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,480
Whether the Chaos Pearl is real or not,

151
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,720

Mr. Xie put aside your personal safety

160

171
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,390
to find another candidate.

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,720
Mr. Xie.

173
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,670
When Sang Qi

174
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,910
and the Decaying Immortal Pavilion attacked,

175
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,200
we didn't have enough power to fight them

176
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,320
and brought danger to the people and the Chaos Pearl.

177
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,280
That's our failure,

178
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,360
and the fault is ours.

179
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,240
Thanks to you,

180
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,670
it was not all ruined that night.

181
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,630
We know what we saw.

182
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,750
We can't live up to

183
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,720
the code of the Immortal Alliance.

184
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,120
Mr. Xie

185
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,480
may not be interested in the position,

186
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,360
but the Immortal Alliance is in urgent need

187
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,670
of a new leader

188
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,790
to keep going,

189
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,720
and humanity

190
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,080
can have hopes and a future.

191
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,320
Therefore,

192
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,600
we plead with Mr. Xie

193
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,790
to accept the position.

194
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,400
Please accept the position.

195
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,150
I can be the acting alliance leader for the time being.

196
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,720
After all of this is over,

197
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,600
we'll have to select another leader

198
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,150
for the Immortal Alliance.

199
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,150
For the time being?

200
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,320
The news that the Chaos Pearl has been missing will get out.

201
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,390
Masters,

202
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,720
please return to your cities

203
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,320
and ease people's minds.

204
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,790
I will take the disciples of Snow City

205
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,510
to guard the Two Realms Mountain

206
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,270
and watch out for any actions from the Dark Abyss.

207
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,550
Mirage Palace is the closest to the Two Realms Mountain.

208
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,120
Madam Su,

209
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,960
please send help.

210
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,510
Yes.

211
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:17,960
Yes,

212
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,790
Leader Xie.

213
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,790
The Immortal Alliance does respect you,

214
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,240
but they are also pushing you to the frontline.

215
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,030
The imposed position

216
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
brings no benefit.

217
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,120
Your experience boils down to five words.

218
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,550
No good deed

219
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,150
goes unpunished.

220
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,720
The Two Realms Mountain is just by the Dark Abyss.

221
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,750
That means she's close.

222
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,790
Do you want to save her?

223
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,960
How about you?

224
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,840
Are you acting on your own or coming with me?

225
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,080
You need to find the Chaos Pearl,

226
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,440
guard the Immortals Array,

227
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,670
stay vigilant about the Spirit Clan and the Dark Clan,

228
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
and save her.

229
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,030
If I don't go with you,

230
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,000
you will be the first leader of the Immortal Alliance

231
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,750
who dies overworking.

232
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,750
Before we set off,

233
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,960
there's an arrangement that I need to make.

234
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,510
Miss Gao, do you know

235
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,270
how the Chaos Pearl was delivered to Snow City?

236
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,670
Sang Qi and his demon troops

237
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,080
attacked Moonlight Heights.

238
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,080
I was young.

239
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,790
My memory is a blur.

240
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,390
All I know is that the then-lord of Mirage Palace,

241
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,750
Saint Miaohua got there.

242
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,120
I was saved,

243
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
and the Chaos Pearl was brought away.

244
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,440
Saint Miaohua is Madam Su's master, right?

245
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,870
Yes.

246
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,440
My mother

247
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,480
and my master are sisters.

248
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,240
She was also Saint Miaohua's disciple.

249
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,960
It's just that

250
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,510
my mother died

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,200
when giving birth to me.

252
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,120
Saint Miaohua was the one who brought the Chaos Pearl

253
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,600
to Snow City.

254
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,720
My father was also there

255
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,960
when the pearl was sealed in the tower.

256
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,510
I asked Elder Cang.

257
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,870
The Pearl Tower was never opened over the years.

258
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,670
No abnormalities as well.

259
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,750
What are you trying to say?

260
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,240
My father guarded the Chaos Pearl until his last breath.

261
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,000
Snow City has nothing to do with this,

262
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,200
no doubt.

263
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,390
There's only one possibility left.

264
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,720
The Chaos Pearl that was delivered to Snow City

265
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,390
was a fake.

266
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,840
Are you saying

267
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,000
that the Mirage Palace is the thief

268
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,510
and that Saint Miaohua and my master

269
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,390
faked the pearl

270
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,080
to take the real one for themselves?

271
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,600
The Mirage Palace is not my enemy

272
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,390
or the Snow City's enemy.

273
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,080
I just want to find the Chaos Pearl

274
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,720
to stop Decaying Immortal Pavilion and the Dark Clan.

275
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,150
I'm having this talk with you

276
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,550
not to blame anyone.

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,200
I need a favor.

278
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,790
Do you want me

279
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,150
investigate my master for you?

280
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,000
Yes.

281
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,360
Shortly after what happened to Moonlight Heights,

282
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,440
Saint Miaohua gave the leadership

283
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,390
to Madam Su

284
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,910
and was never seen again.

285
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,030
Madam Su

286
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,960
is the one most likely to know what happened.

287
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,390
Sang Qi and my master

288
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,790
must have been good friends.

289
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,910
One brought massacre upon Moonlight Heights

290
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,670
while the other stole the important artifact.

291
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,510
In that case,

292
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,080
why did Sang Qi

293
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,120
come to Snow City?

294
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,960
If you have no doubts,

295
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,960
you wouldn't have come to see me.

296
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,480
You also want the truth,

297
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,270
don't you?

298
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,630
Mr. Xie.

299
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,480
I've collected all the things

300
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,720
that Xuanling left behind.

301
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,790
Should we seal them off

302
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,000
or…

303
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,360
Classes, chores, and shifts.

304
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Life in Snow City

305
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,550
is so boring.

306
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,360
The process of becoming a common human

307
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,670
is so long.

308
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,900
[I drank tea water from his cup.]

309
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,580
[He brought a lot of swords to me, and I didn't like any one of them.]

310
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,670
It's strange.

311
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,030
I found the boring people

312
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,670
and events in Snow City

313
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,120
are interesting in a way.

314
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,750
Did they become more interesting

315
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,600
or have I become boring?

316
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,910
It turns out

317
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,670
that I have never escaped

318
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,440
Sang Qi's control.

319
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,030
Am I never

320
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,150
getting what I want?

321
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,320
In the past

322
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,840
and in the present.

323
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,150
Never mind.

324
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,750
Let death come.

325
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,550
I will help Xie Xuechen

326
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,910
to guard the things he wants to guard for this once.

327
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,790
Put everything back as they were.

328
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,750
Keep

329
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,320
everything.

330
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,750
Mr. Xie, are you saying

331
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,440
that she might come back?

332
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,240
Yes.

333
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,270
Understood.

334
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,120
I heard that the Saintess managed

335
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,790
to activate spiritual channels as a Spirit Clan member!

336
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,200
She's training

337
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,510
with spiritual power today, right?

338
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,360
I wonder between spiritual power

339
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,870
and demonic power,

340
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,240
which one is stronger?

341
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,550
Since you are so curious about the spiritual power,

342
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,870
you can taste it yourselves.

343
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,480
Cultivations with spiritual power and demonic power

344
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,790
are similar.

345
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,630
They are both about accumulating power

346
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,670
and master it.

347
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,600
The key

348
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,360
is to keep practicing.

349
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,910
Saintess!

350
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,030
Spare us!

351
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,950
I just need to keep a fine control

352
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,000
over spiritual power,

353
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,550
to not kill a Dark Clan member in an instant.

354
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,870
Just like fire

355
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,910
won't burn a candle down in an instant.

356
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,600
Saintess!

357
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,720
It's been a while.

358
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,360
Ignorance Demon and Anger Demon

359
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,480
have been avoiding me.

360
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,790
Do you still mind

361
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,720
what happened in the human world?

362
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,360
Or

363
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,200
you think less of me since I've lost

364
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,870
my demonic power.

365
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
How ruthless are my comrades?

366
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,440
Don't be ridiculous.

367
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,910
His Grace trusts you as always.

368
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,720
We heard that

369
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,750
you've been busy cultivating spiritual power,

370
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,960
and we didn't want to disturb you.

371
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,550
Do you think you have the right

372
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,480
to stick your noses in my business?

373
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,480
You said

374
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,720
that you didn't want to disturb me.

375
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,310
What's so important

376
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
that changed your mind?

377
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,310
His Grace summoned you.

378
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:39,960
Now?

379
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,310
Master.

380
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,310
Are you finally letting me go to the human world?

381
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,750
I heard

382
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,350
that you took quite a few Dark Clan members.

383
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,350
I was just focusing on improving the Jade Vault Technique

384
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,070
as you've requested.

385
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,920
It seems

386
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,350
that you did well.

387
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,790
Go, then.

388
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,440
Do you know where to get started?

389
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,640
Mirage Palace.

390
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,000
Their young madam, Gao Qiumin,

391
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,960
is a good friend

392
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,400
since Moonlight Heights.

393
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,920
I believe

394
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,880
that she will help me find the Chaos Pearl.

395
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,680
Good.

396
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,350
Master.

397
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
Do you trust me?

398
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,510
Where did that come from?

399
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,960
No reason.

400
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,550
I'm just worried

401
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,720
that I failed

402
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,640
to get the Chaos Pearl

403
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,720
from Xie Xuechen,

404
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,590
you might doubt

405
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,310
my loyalty because of that.

406
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,440
You shouldn't worry about that.

407
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,880
Go.

408
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,160
Mu Xuanling is a Spirit Clan member,

409
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,270
yet she acts

410
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,550
like she's a Dark Clan member.

411
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,640
She's a little different after she returned.

412
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,550
No.

413
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
Maybe she has gotten better at pretending.

414
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,110
His Grace is also a member of the Spirit Clan.

415
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,720
If you ask me,

416
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:52,830
no one is more like a Dark Clan member

417
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,790
than His Grace.

418
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,590
She betrayed us for a human,

419
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,350
and she will do it again.

420
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,350
I will never believe that she'd be loyal to His Grace.

421
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,830
Your Grace.

422
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,960
What is the Saintess's…

423
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,240
You don't need to know that.

424
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,000
What about you?

425
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,680
I have

426
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,790
acquired the Jade Vault Technique

427
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,270
and activated spiritual channels.

428
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,440
I just need to train for a few days longer

429
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,400
to completely control

430
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,240
both spiritual power and demonic power.

431
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,440
I will defeat our enemies

432
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,720
with their weapon.

433
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,000
Isn't that interesting?

434
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,480
Yes.

435
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,030
I didn't get such a warm welcome

436
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,440
the last time I came to the human world.

437
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,440
Mu Xuanling!

438
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,640
Her Grace

439
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
asked us to inspect the Two Realms Mountain every day

440
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,720
to avoid the Dark Abyss and the Spirit Clan

441
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,830
invade the human world again.

442
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,920
Look what the cat dragged in!

443
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,440
Isn't it the Saintess of the Dark Abyss?

444
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,400
Su Ningzhen.

445
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,270
It seems that she has been thinking

446
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,310
about Master and I.

447
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,750
I didn't expect to be spotted

448
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,960
right after arriving in the human world.

449
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,480
Well,

450
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,480
to avoid my whereabouts getting out,

451
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,240
maybe I should kill you all.

452
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,400
How are you using spiritual power?

453
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,310
Isn't that interesting?

454
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,200
I wonder if your soul

455
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,110
burns faster

456
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,310
than Dark Clan members.

457
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,310
Mr. Nan,

458
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,550
I knew it was you.

459
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,680
Ms. Mu!

460
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,750
Here we meet again.

461
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,880
How did you manage to escape?

462
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Escape?

463
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,030
After Sang Qi took you,

464
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,240
I've been worried that he might hurt you.

465
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,440
Mr. Nan, I think you've misunderstood something.

466
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,640
I was trapped in Snow City,

467
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,720
and Master was here to bring me home.

468
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,200
He has treated me really well.

469
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,830
How could he hurt me?

470
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,030
Go home?

471
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,960
Mr. Nan,

472
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,550
we have spent time together.

473
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But if you are going to help

474
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,270
those cultivators from the Immortal Alliance,

475
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,790
I will not go easy on you.

476
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,350
Ms. Mu.

477
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,070
Why don't you tell me

478
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,640
what happened

479
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,440
after you got back to the Dark Abyss.

480
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,110
To think back,

481
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,830
Nan Xuyue seems to care about me in a way.

482
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,270
Mr. Nan,

483
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,510
I've let my master down.

484
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,240
I need to find a way to make it up.

485
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,550
Mr. Nan,

486
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,960
since you care about me,

487
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,550
maybe you can help me out.

488
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,480
You are…

489
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,640
What

490
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,960
do you want me to do?

491
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,350
To start with,

492
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,110
deactivate all the arrays in this forest

493
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,550
and let me kill all

494
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,720
of those cultivators.

495
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,240
Then what?

496
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,440
Keep trying to take the Chaos Pearl?

497
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,750
You are always so smart.

498
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,270
I always knew

499
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,510
that you are different from Xie Xuechen.

500
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,270
You don't care about the Immortal Alliance

501
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,720
or humanity.

502
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,440
You are helping Xie Xuechen

503
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,960
because you want to see

504
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,240
what interesting things you can find

505
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,510
in this boring world.

506
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,830
What you really

507
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,790
care about

508
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,920
is me.

509
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,550
Am I right?

510
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,030
I can see you,

511
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,750
and you can see me as well.

512
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,830
Mr. Nan,

513
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,070
join me.

514
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,960
I can give you what you want.

515
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,590
That includes

516
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,440
that "little affection."

517
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,400
The Spirit Clan's life span is over a thousand years.

518
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,160
It is a wide world

519
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,440
full of men.

520
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,780
Why would I give up my life

521
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,680
for Xie Xuechen, who is just a guy.

522
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,640
I've played

523
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,590
your admirer for long enough.

524
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,480
It has become tiring.

525
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,790
Enemies always meet.

526
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,400
I don't think Xie Xuechen

527
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,720
will cut me any slacks anymore.

528
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,960
Mu Xuanling!

529
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,590
Mu Xuanling!

530
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,240
Since you have gotten out,

531
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,880
why are you running?

532
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,000
You are trying to kill me.

533
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,590
It's a shame

534
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,270
that I failed.

535
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,480
Why not pursue her?

536
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,750
Xie Xuechen is there.

537
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,310
She won't get away.

538
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,830
She's a little weird.

539
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,680
The mole under her eye

540
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,510
is called Mundane Tear.

541
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,720
It's the sign of drinking the Disillusion Water.

542
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,030
The Disillusion Water?

543
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,750
It is documented in the Greenview Archive.

544
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,400
It's a type of medicine that makes people forget about love.

545
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,750
Forget about love.

546
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,000
Why would she take it?

547
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,480
Should we let Xie Xuechen know?

548
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,110
No matter what the reason might be,

549
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,310
she has forgotten all kinds of personal feelings.

550
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,440
If it's you,

551
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,640
would you tell Xie Xuechen?

552
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,750
But she doesn't love Xie Xuechen

553
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,000
or you.

554
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,310
I know.

555
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,240
You saw it in your divination, didn't you?

556
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,350
The ending of Xie Xuechen and her.

557
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,200
How will they end?

558
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,920
A relationship with no results.

559
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,350
The coldness and the intention

560
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,680
to kill in her eyes was real.

561
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,030
Is it because I left her behind

562
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,070
and that hurt her?

563
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,440
That was a bad beginning.

564
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,400
Why does it have to be the most difficult target in the Immortal Alliance?

565
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,440
Xie Xuechen

566
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,310
is a shrewd man.

567
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,550
Fighting him head-to-head will not do.

568
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,000
I need to be smart about this.

569
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
Xie Xuechen.

570
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,070
Say something.

571
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,270
Stop reading.

572
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,270
Do you want to know

573
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,880
why I attacked you earlier?

574
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,550
You know this.

575
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,270
Sang Qi put Heartstring on me.

576
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,070
It wasn't me who tried to kill you.

577
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,750
He controlled me.

578
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,640
Xie Xuechen.

579
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,720
What I said that day

580
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,160
was not my intention.

581
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,350
How could I not love you?

582
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,960
I went through all kinds of dangers

583
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,960
to escape the Dark Abyss

584
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,720
just so that I can get back to you

585
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,550
and be with you forever.

586
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,270
What happened to you?

587
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,270
We haven't seen each other for so long.

588
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,590
Don't you miss me?

589
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,440
They say that a short time apart makes the couple miss each other more.

590
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,110
You've set a barrier outside.

591
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,400
No one can get in.

592
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,550
How about…

593
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,110
I have other plans.

594
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,790
You should rest.

595
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,200
Just as expected.

596
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,550
This is the way to make him leave.

597
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,510
Master.

598
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,550
Luck did not favor me.

599
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,680
I met our nemesis, Xie Xuechen.

600
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,000
What?

601
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,510
Already got caught when you just arrived in the human world

602
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,200
and you want me to save you?

603
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,680
That's not necessary.

604
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,030
But

605
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,720
I do have another plan.

606
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,320
Xie Xuechen will not give up

607
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,500
on searching for the Chaos Pearl.

608
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,960
With him.

609
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,840
I don't need to go to Mirage Palace

610
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,680
and find Gao Qiumin.

611
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,160
So,

612
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,200
I want to stay close to him.

613
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,440
Even if I couldn't

614
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
get the Chaos Pearl directly,

615
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,070
I will get clues.

616
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,160
Are you sure

617
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,510
that he will allow you?

618
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,350
That's why

619
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,510
I'd like to ask you to do something for me.

620
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,120
If Xie Xuechen can witness

621
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,480
that I suffer from Heartstring,

622
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,860
how could he

623
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,270
leave me here by myself?

624
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,840
All right.

625
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,030
Tonight, I will

626
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,830
help you put on another show.

627
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,640
I always knew that

628
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,880
that you are different from Xie Xuechen.

629
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,720
You don't care about the Immortal Alliance

630
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,070
or humanity.

631
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,000
What you really

632
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,160
care about

633
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,680
is me.

634
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,310
Am I right?

635
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,400
I can see you,

636
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,110
and you can see me as well.

637
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,000
Mr. Nan,

638
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,030
join me.

639
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,270
I can give you what you want.

640
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,030
That includes

641
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,440
that "little affection."

642
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,510
I knew you would visit.

643
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,070
Do you also feel that there's something

644
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:58,880
strange about her?

645
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,880
Her tone, behaviors,

646
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,590
expressions, vibe,

647
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,720
and the grey mole under her eye…

648
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,550
Everything is strange.

649
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,830
But her mind is clear.

650
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,680
There's no sign of her being controlled

651
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,840
like when we were in Snow City.

652
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,830
Just ask

653
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,440
what you want to know.

654
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,960
What were you talking about

655
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,270
in the forest?

656
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,400
She said that she was here for the Chaos Pearl

657
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,110
and she wanted me to help her.

658
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,160
In return,

659
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,160
she will give me what I want.

660
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,110
What you want?

661
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,350
Her affection.

662
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,400
Nan Xuyue.

663
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,830
You do know how to annoy people.

664
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,270
You asked.

665
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,160
I was just telling the truth.

666
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,480
She has betrayed the Dark Abyss and joined me.

667
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,350
She never liked human beings.

668
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,440
Yet for me,

669
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,790
for the people I want to protect,

670
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,310
she risked everything

671
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,110
including her life.

672
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,640
I left her behind that day

673
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,480
and allowed her to be taken by Sang Qi.

674
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,280
That was all my fault.

675
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,320
I left her behind once.

676
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,000
That will never happen again.

677
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,960
If the Immortal Alliance won't tolerate her,

678
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,550
I will protect her.

679
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,070
Mr. Xie,

680
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,550
you are finally living like a common person.

681
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,710
Just like when I first met you.

682
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,960
You have desires,

683
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,320
persistence,

684
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,590
and do not accept restraining.

685
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,280
Always

686
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,800
trying to win.

687
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,880
It's not about win or lose when it comes to her.

688
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,590
I will never

689
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,150
let her go again.

690
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,070
Even if you have feelings for her,

691
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,550
I will not cut you any slacks.

692
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,710
I know.

693
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,550
I knew that when you decided

694
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,960
to come to the Two Realms Mountain.

695
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:01,960
Oh, right!

696
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,710
I need to talk to you about something.

697
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,840
There's an emergency

698
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,670
that requires me to go back to Greenview Heights.

699
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,110
I'm leaving early in the morning.

700
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,360
What is it?

701
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:14,670
It's a secret.

702
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,840
Fine.

703
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,230
Don't tell me.

704
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,190
It's just that

705
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,960
I haven't thought this through myself.

706
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,630
If I want to share

707
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,960
this secret one day,

708
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,230
you will hear it.

709
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,440
Okay.

710
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,920
What about the Chaos Pearl?

711
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,510
Any news?

712
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,670
I asked Gao Qiumin to help me with the investigation.

713
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,480
She might be the young madam of Mirage Palace,

714
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,070
she was also once the young madam of Moonlight Heights.

715
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,440
I believe

716
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,070
that she doesn't want the truth buried as well.

717
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,550
Master.

718
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:08,760
Be careful, it's hot.

719
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,630
You've been trying to say something lately.

720
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,280
Spit it out.

721
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,510
Master.

722
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,880
What's the connection between Sang Qi and my mother?

723
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,400
Why did the Sword of Vitality deem him as the master?

724
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,800
How can you connect him to your mother?

725
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,190
She was obsessed with my sister

726
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,150
and gave her the Sword of Vitality.

727
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,520
How could my sister ever

728
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,190
fall for a Spirit Clan member?

729
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,190
She was just too kind.

730
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,760
She felt sorry after driving him off

731
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,110
and kept the sword.

732
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,280
Is that

733
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,000
the whole truth?

734
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,920
Qiumin.

735
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,880
Master.

736
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,920
You are born with nine apertures.

737
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,030
Though not as talented as Xie Xuechen,

738
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,440
you are still one of the best among your peers.

739
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,960
But you've been too easy on yourself.

740
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,360
Until now,

741
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,880
you are still in the Golden Core stage.

742
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,110
I asked you to come here

743
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,000
to channel my power to you.

744
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:24,630
Master.

745
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,920
You are not fully recovered.

746
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,370
If you give me your power…

747
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,320
You don't have

748
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,370
time to waste.

749
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,110
I will train harder.

750
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,300
Sang Qi and Mirage Palace

751
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,710
have a life-and-death vendetta.

752
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,150
Since he won't

753
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,360
stay quietly in that small Dark Abyss,

754
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,960
he will be looking for a chance to pay us back.

755
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,110
Besides, now that the Chaos Pearl is missing,

756
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,920
he's not the only one

757
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,400
watching Mirage Palace right now.

758
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,670
The world is different.

759
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,960
It's getting more and more dangerous.

760
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,190
Do you understand?

761
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,920
Yes.

762
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,800
Master!

763
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,030
Are you all right?

764
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:45,760
I'm fine.

765
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:49,880
Master,

766
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,400
your hair…

767
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,630
Leave me.

768
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,590
Master.

769
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,670
Go.

770
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:25,000
[Plantation Pavilion]

771
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,710
Elder Zai Xi.

772
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,150
Have you been waiting for long?

773
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,110
I'm here to talk to Madam.

774
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,670
It seems that I'm too late.

775
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,630
Go back.

776
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,110
Yes.

777
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,910
Now that the Chaos Pearl is missing,

778
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,590
he's not the only one

779
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,150
watching Mirage Palace right now.

780
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,480
The world is different.

781
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,920
It's getting more and more dangerous.

782
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,150
Do you understand?

783
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,320
Madam Su

784
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,190
is the one most likely to know what happened.

785
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,550
You also want the truth,

786
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,590
don't you?

787
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,360
By danger,

788
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,510
is Master referring to Sang Qi

789
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,800
or Xie Xuechen?

790
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,400
Why are you in a rush to give Qiumin your power?

791
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,190
The Chaos Pearl is missing.

792
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,880
A lot of eyes

793
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,880
are on Mirage Palace.

794
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,070
The Immortals Array can no longer constrain the Dark Clan.

795
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,280
The rodents lurking in the darkness

796
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,150
will come to Mirage Palace sooner or later.

797
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,590
I can face my death,

798
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,760
but not Qiumin.

799
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,070
Moonlight Heights is no more,

800
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,630
and Ningxi is dead.

801
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,920
Sang Qi may not come to Mirage Palace.

802
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,440
He can't wait to burn Mirage Palace

803
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,320
to the ground

804
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,630
and remove the one who cost him his arm completely from this world.

805
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,150
Why wouldn't he come?

806
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,480
If your sister didn't fall for that Spirit Clan member…

807
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,510
My sister did nothing wrong.

808
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,880
It was Sang Qi who lured her…

809
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,440
And Miaohua made her marry Gao Fengxu.

810
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,510
Miaohua

811
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,400
did it for Mirage Palace.

812
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,800
Otherwise,

813
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,630
how would Gao Fengxu agree to leave the Chaos Pearl

814
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,960
with Mirage Palace for a hundred years?

815
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,360
Yes.

816
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,800
Gao Fengxu wanted to restore the power of the Chaos Pearl

817
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,880
and Mirage Palace coveted

818
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,030
that piece of unparalleled treasure.

819
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,360
Why not

820
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,710
sacrifice just one person?

821
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,230
Miaohua never saw her

822
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,670
as a disciple.

823
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,110
She cared for my sister

824
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,280
because

825
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,710
she has the body of a Primal Celestial Maiden.

826
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,550
The body of a Primal Celestial Maiden?

827
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,400
That kind of body contains endless vitality.

828
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,670
Reviving people

829
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,590
are already magical for common people.

830
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
Who would have thought

831
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,360
that she could be

832
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
the container that nourishes objects!

833
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,400
Are you still holding on to all that?

834
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,000
You've made Miaohua pay a great price.

835
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,030
That's far from enough.

836
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,110
It's all in the past.

837
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,510
You are the lord of Mirage Palace now.

838
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,320
Qiumin knew

839
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,760
that Sang Qi shares a connection with her mother.

840
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,920
She will not let this slide.

841
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,590
She will ask the wrong questions.

842
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,190
Once someone gets curious,

843
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,840
the buried secret

844
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,480
will be revealed.

845
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,590
Can you risk letting her know?

846
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,110
If anyone learns

847
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:36,960
that the real Chaos Pearl…

848
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,280
All the people who know that secret

849
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,840
cannot talk anymore.

850
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,230
I will not tell Qiumin.

851
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,840
Even when I die.

852
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,440
That place is still there.

853
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,320
Traces from back then can be found in Moonlight Heights.

854
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,230
I know

855
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,800
that you don't want to be anywhere close

856
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,030
to the place your sister lived.

857
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,150
But considering the situation,

858
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,230
we'd better make plans in advance.

859
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,150
Someone is there.

860
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,440
Is that real?

861
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,960
My mother loved Sang Qi.

862
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,670
She was forced to marry my father

863
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,590
to nourish the Chaos Pearl.

864
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,760
