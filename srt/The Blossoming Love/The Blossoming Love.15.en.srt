[Episode 15]

18
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,640
Let him go.

19
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll return to the Dark Abyss with you.

20
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,000
After staying in the human realm for so long,

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,480
you haven't learned much,

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,920
but you've become more useless.

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,560
He's not part of the Immortal Alliance.

24
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,150
He's no threat to you.

25
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,680
Don't kill him.

26
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,350
Fine.

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,950
There's really no need

28
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,560
to damage the bond between us

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,350
as master and disciple for someone irrelevant.

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,430
I despise nothing more

31
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,030
than people scheming behind my back.

32
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,800
Master,

33
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,590
don't kill him!

34
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,400
I'm begging you!

35
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,150
Trying to call for reinforcements, huh?

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,870
I can help you with that.

37
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,400
It's Sang Qi.

38
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,240
What exactly are you planning?

39
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,800
Don't worry.

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,560
You'll find out soon enough.

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,000
Mu Xuanling...

42
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,630
Sir!

43
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,080
Mr. Xie,

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,910
is Sang Qi attacking?

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,120
You're just in time.

46
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,680
Sang Qi is launching a night attack.

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,330
We must not let him enter the city and cause harm.

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll take him on.

49
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,240
The Pearl Tower

50
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,080
is in your capable hands.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,030
Be careful.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,190
Why hasn't Su Ningzhen arrived?

53
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,750
Forget about her for now.

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,840
Protecting the Pearl Tower comes first.

55
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,680
What exactly are you trying to do?

56
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,280
Xie Xuechen,

57
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,030
we meet again.

58
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,470
Why have you intruded into the Snow City at night?

59
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,680
What business do you have?

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,870
Naturally,

61
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,840
I'm here to bring my disciple back.

62
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,150
Then I can't let you have your way.

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,150
Mu Xuanling belongs

64
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,280
to Snow City now.

65
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,870
If you want her to change loyalties,

66
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
I won't agree to it.

67
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,870
Mr. Xie,

68
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,270
I put a lot of effort

69
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,310
into setting up this killing array.

70
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,800
Now,

71
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,120
do you want a duel to the death with me,

72
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,560
or

73
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,600
will you save those suffering humans?

74
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,870
Mu Xuanling...

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,680
wait for me!

76
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,630
You saw it.

77
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,120
He left.

78
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,600
For his human world,

79
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,510
he abandoned you.

80
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,920
Is this

81
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,240
the love

82
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,800
you're willing to sacrifice your life for?

83
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,000
It's not worth it.

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,600
You don't understand me,

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,920
and you understand him even less.

86
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,600
I don't need to understand someone

87
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,390
who's about to die.

88
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,120
He took the explosion

89
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,920
of Fajian's golden essence head-on alone.

90
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,040
Even if he hides it well,

91
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,600
it won't change the fact

92
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,120
that he's injured.

93
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,190
If Xie Xuechen wants to win,

94
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,270
he can only fight desperately.

95
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,390
Xie Xuechen...

96
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,070
Sang Qi's power

97
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,240
is truly overwhelming!

98
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,360
If this demonic energy killing array

99
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,480
covers the Snow City,

100
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,630
the entire place will be destroyed.

101
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,000
Can Mr. Xie

102
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
hold out?

103
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,040
Whether he can hold out, I don't know,

104
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,560
but you all...

105
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,000
definitely cannot.

106
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Who are you?

107
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,120
The one here for the Pearl.

108
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,800
Mr. Xie,

109
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,270
you want to keep her so badly.

110
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,600
Have you fallen for her?

111
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,510
But you probably don't know.

112
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,720
Ling approached you

113
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,390
with hidden motives

114
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,310
from the very beginning.

115
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,120
People always say the Dark Clan is inherently cruel,

116
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,190
and the Spirit Clan at deception.

117
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,750
Actually,

118
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,360
there's some truth to it.

119
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,830
I'm sure Ling never told you

120
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
that back then,

121
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,920
it was with my permission

122
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,560
that she rescued you from the Lava.

123
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,360
You don't believe me?

124
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,720
I gave her the Half-Day Glory pill

125
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,310
you took that day.

126
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,360
There's only one in existence.

127
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,000
What could the Lava do to him?

128
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,870
Keeping him there is useless.

129
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,270
Master,

130
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,120
why not try my method?

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,670
Let's hear it.

132
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,910
Save him,

133
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,120
stay with him,

134
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,270
get close to him,

135
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,120
trick him into letting down his guard,

136
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,670
then seize the Chaos Pearl

137
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,510
and destroy the Immortal Alliance.

138
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,160
Here is the Half-Day Glory.

139
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,040
Take it.

140
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,120
For Xie Xuechen's life,

141
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,550
are you even throwing yours

142
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,720
away?

143
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
How could I?

144
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,360
The Spirit Clan lives for a thousand years.

145
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,790
The world is vast,

146
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,150
and men are plentiful.

147
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,450
Why would I

148
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,480
die for someone like Xie Xuechen?

149
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,150
I'm just toying with him.

150
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,440
Rest assured, Master.

151
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,030
I will complete the mission,

152
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,510
retrieve the Chaos Pearl,

153
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,480
and kill Xie Xuechen.

154
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,440
If this fight continues,

155
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,910

it's time for us to go.

177

178
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,360
it seems you've paid quite a price.

I won't believe what he says.

181
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,270
Love truly leads to ruin.

182
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,720
Even Mr. Xie is trapped in it.

183
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,120
You know full well the recording stone doesn't lie,

184
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,480
yet here you are,

185
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,200
deceiving yourself.

186

Xie Xuechen!

188
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,600
Mr. Xie,

189
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,120
do you still want to fight?

190
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,080
Your injuries are severe.

191
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,510
If you keep fighting,

192
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,790
you will really die.

193
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,670
All because of Ling,

194
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,670
you want a duel to the death with me?

195
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,000
Is it worth it?

196
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,870
Mu Xuanling's demonic power is gone.

197
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,960
She has no ties to the Dark Abyss anymore.

198
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,270
She is now a disciple of the Snow City.

Don't you understand?

225
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,400
Master has already told you the truth.

226
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,440
What's wrong?

227
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,200
You don't want to believe it?

228
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,830
Let me tell you the truth,

229
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,590
this act of liking you

230
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
has gone on long enough.

231
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,560
I'm already sick of it.

232
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,790
I am the proud Saintess of the Dark Abyss.

233
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,160
What makes you think

234
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,590
I'd willingly stay in the Snow City

235
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,960
as a lowly cleaning disciple,

236
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,310
at your beck and call?

237
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,070
No...

238
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,350
These are not true words from your heart.

239
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,110
Xie Xuechen,

240
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,350
you're so full of yourself.

241
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,410
You were nothing more to me

242
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,680
than a substitute for my Mister,

243
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,400
just a toy.

244
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,310
I only wanted to see

245
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,440
what the Chosen of Heaven

246
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,880
would look like caught in a web of love.

247
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,720
And now that I see it.

248
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,720
It's honestly quite dull.

249
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,400
Just like any ordinary person,

250
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,550
trapped by love,

251
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,400
unable to let go.

252
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,160
You're gravely injured.

253
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,510
How could you possibly be a match

254
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,310
for Master and me?

not killing you

258
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,550
is only because you saved my life.

259
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,350
Stop deceiving yourself and ruining my plans.

260
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,510
Otherwise,

261
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,160
I really will kill you.

263

Ling,

264
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,070
it's time to go back.

265
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,790
I've waited for you for ten thousand years...

266
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,070
the Chaos Pearl!

267
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,750
Ridiculous!

268
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,550
Mr. Xie,

269
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,440
you've arrived quite quickly.

270
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,350
You didn't kill them.

271
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,720
Hand over the Chaos Pearl,

272
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,830
and I'll spare your life.

273
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,310
Mr. Xie, do you really think

274
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,400
you can command me?

275
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,960
You endured the golden essence explosion

276
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,880
and Sang Qi's blows.

277
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,310
How much spiritual power

278
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,200
do you have left?

279
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,240
However much remains...

280
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,750
I face death,

281
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,200
but I do not retreat!

282
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,350
For what you wish to protect,

283
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,240
you've always given your all.

284
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,350
But if you realized that what you're protecting is a joke,

285
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,030
I wonder how you'd feel.

286
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,750
The Chaos Pearl is still in the Pearl Tower.

287
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,110
But when you see it,

288
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,720
you might be disappointed.

289
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,070
No way...

290
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,160
Even if an ancient artifact perishes,

291
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,350
it can never shatter.

292
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,160
Could it be fake?

293
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,720
For what you wish to protect,

294
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,830
you've always given your all.

295
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,000
But if you realized that what you're protecting is a joke,

296
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,790
I wonder how you'd feel.

297
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,110
The Chaos Pearl has been heavily guarded by the Immortal Alliance.

298
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,070
How could it be fake?

299
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,920
Could it be

300
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
you made a mistake?

301
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,350
I'm also curious

302
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,000
who could the masterful one be,

303
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,200
using a fake pearl

304
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,070
to fool the entire Immortal Alliance

305
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,270
for so long?

306
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,440
I misspoke earlier.

307
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,640
I shouldn't have

308
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,030
doubted you, Master.

309
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,400
No harm done.

310
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,920
The act is over now.

311
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,110
It's time to remove the disguise.

312
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,880
Master, your disguise techniques

313
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,200
are truly brilliant.

314
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,440
However,

315
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,400
this is my first time impersonating you.

316
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,550
Though I tried my best to mimic you,

317
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,200
I still worry someone might uncover the tricks.

318
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,070
You've followed me for many years,

319
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,680
and have always been my most trusted agent.

320
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,790
When facing Sang Qi and Xie Xuechen earlier,

321
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
you showed no fear.

322
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,680
Why, then, are you worried tonight?

323
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,160
Because tonight should've been the night

324
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,060
our plan succeeded.

325
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,920
No mistakes were allowed.

326
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,640
But unexpectedly,

327
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,400
the greatest mistake

328
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,640
turned out to be the Chaos Pearl itself.

329
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,440
Our grand cause isn't urgent.

330
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,640
As long as the Chaos Pearl still exists in this world,

331
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,830
hope remains unbroken.

332
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,510
One day,

333
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,110
I'll make

334
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,830
the world you yearn for a reality.

335
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,030
Having you impersonate me tonight

336
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,590
was merely to prove my presence.

337
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,200
In the future, unless necessary,

338
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,200
I won't ask you to do it again.

339
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,440
Return now.

340
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,160
The longer you stay, the more suspicious they'll become.

341
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,200
Let those in the Immortal Alliance

342
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,160
help us figure out

343
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,590
where exactly the Chaos Pearl is.

344
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,920
I've already returned with you.

345
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,750
What more do you want?

346
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,550
If you truly wish to come back,

347
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,510
I would naturally be delighted.

348
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,880
But you did it

349
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,920
for Xie Xuechen!

350
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,750
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

351
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,200
You said to him

352
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,410
those harsh words

353
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,960
just because you were worried

354
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,830
I'd take his life.

355
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
Since you know this,

356
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,510
why not just kill me?

357
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,110
Xie Xuechen

358
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,440
struggled so hard to save your life,

359
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,510
and now you're so ready to throw it away?

360
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,400
Let me tell you,

361
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,270
he expelled your demonic power

362
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,750
but passed on the Jade Vault Technique

363
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,920
to you.

364
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,510
He's treated you

365
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,790
so extraordinarily well.

366
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,550
The Jade Vault Technique is truly profound.

367
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,400
I always wondered

368
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,240
how could his power grow stronger

369
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,110
even after his spiritual channels

370
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,960
were destroyed seven years ago?

371
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,720
It turns out the Jade Vault Technique

372
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,880
can truly rebuild spiritual channels.

373
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,110
He passed the Jade Vault Technique to me?

374
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,270
No wonder...

375
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,400
I have been recovering

376
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,240
day by day,

377
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,550
and I'm no longer afraid of the burning sun.

378
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,400
But why didn't I know this myself?

379
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,720
He passed the Jade Vault Technique to you,

380
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,240
and now you possess spiritual channels.

381
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,880
With the Immortal Alliance's Spiritual Forms gathered in the Snow City,

382
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,790
if they discover this,

383
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,960
the Alliance members

384
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,720
will surely put you to death.

385
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
He thought he could deceive everyone,

386
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,510
but he couldn't fool me.

387
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,790
How do you know this?

388
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,620
Xie Xuechen

389
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,350
can block

390
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,640
Heartstring's control over you,

391
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,310
but he cannot block

392
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,110
Heartstring's perception of you.

393
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,070
No matter where you are,

394
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,310
I can always find your location,

395
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,830
and I can understand

396
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,590
your physical condition.

397
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,440
So when your demonic power was expelled

398
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,960
and your spiritual channels were unlocked,

399
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,590
I knew it even better

400
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,960
than you did.

401
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,440
So everything you've done

402
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,270
isn't just

403
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,160
to obtain the Chaos Pearl and break the Immortals Array.

404
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,200
It's also for the Jade Vault Technique.

405
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,790
I have to do this!

406
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,200
Cultivating demonic power

407
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,550
can make me stronger,

408
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,640
but it's far from enough.

409
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,750
If I can unlock spiritual channels,

410
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,240
I will break through

411
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,160
the limits of Spirit Clan cultivation.

412
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,400
From then on,

413
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,830
I'll fear no one.

414
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,360
What is this?

415
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,070
It's a medicine to ease your pain.

416
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,510
It's called the Disillusion Water.

417
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,000
Take it, and you'll break all emotions,

418
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,480
forgetting both love and hate.

419
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,030
You may still remember

420
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,350
the people you've met

421
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,790
and the experiences you've had,

422
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,030
but recalling them

423
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,640
will no longer

424
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,160
stir your heart.

425
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,750
All your love

426
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,750
stems from Xie Xuechen,

427
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,070
and your hatred toward me

428
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,680
is also because of him.

429
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,160
Once you forget your love for him,

430
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,070
you'll also forget

431
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,350
your hatred toward me.

432
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,830
You'll only remember

433
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,160
that you approached him on my orders

434
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,720
to seize the Chaos Pearl.

435
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,830
Everything you've said to him

436
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,270
and everything you've done

437
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,510
were just tactics.

438
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,920
All of it was false.

439
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,350
From now on,

440
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,550
the barriers between us

441
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,830
will no longer exist.

442
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,480
Only then

443
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,110
will I

444
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,750
spare your life.

445
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,880
I won't drink it!

446
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,350
Ling,

447
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,110
I'm truly doing this for your sake.

448
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,350
Falling in love with a human

449
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,590
is harmful, not beneficial.

450
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,680
The human heart

451
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,110
is the most complex and ever-changing thing.

452
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,270
Today, they might treat you

453
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,110
with soft words,

454
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,070
but tomorrow, they could turn their backs,

455
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,590
even

456
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,880
abandon you like a worn-out shoe

457
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,070
and kill you.

458
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,920
I truly don't want

459
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,480
such a thing

460
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,000
to happen to you.

461
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,160
Sang Qi,

462
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,880
have you ever loved someone?

463
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,070
She hurt you, right?

464
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,030
Twenty years ago,

465
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,640
you lost an arm.

466
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,310
Was it because of her?

467
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,680
Silence!

468
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,790
But, Sang Qi,

469
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,110
you've been betrayed,

470
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,440
you've been hurt,

471
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,000
yet you still refuse to take the Disillusion Water.

472
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,200
Why?

473
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,420
Because you don't want to forget

474
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,070
the warmth she gave you,

475
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,960
even if it might have been fake.

476
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
Neither would I!

477
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,590
Once it's taken,

478
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,830
there's no turning back.

479
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,480
You and Xie Xuechen

480
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,160
are destined to become enemies.

481
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,790
Mister!

482
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,070
Mu Xuanling!

483
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,510
Half a day isn't enough

484
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,720
to understand the human world.

485
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,960
If there's ever a chance,

486
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,270
I'll take you to see the real human world.

487
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,030
Mu Xuanling, disciple of Snow City, protects the array!

488
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,030
This is Snow City,

489
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,960
and this is my decision.

490
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,400
Tonight,

491
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,550
I feel as though I've seen

492
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,590
the real human world.

493
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,830
Xie Xuechen...

494
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,660
[Bright Snowy Pavilion]

495
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,160
As long as you're by my side,

496
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,240
the sun and moon still rise and fall,

497
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,000
and the universe still endures,

498
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,640
we will always be together.

499
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,440
Don't leave...

500
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,750
Don't leave!

501
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:23,960
Sir.

502
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,590
Sir,

503
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,480
you're awake.

504
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,510
Where's Mu Xuanling?

505
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,030
Where's Mu Xuanling?

506
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,640
I brought you medicine,

507
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,680
but unexpectedly,

508
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,550
I encountered Sang Qi attacking the city.

509
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,880
When I arrived,

510
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,640
the only thing left by your side was this folding fan.

511
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,480
As for Miss Mu,

512
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,960
according to the Immortal Alliance,

513
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,590
she was taken away by Sang Qi.

514
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,000
Even Mr. Xie couldn't stop him.

515
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,670
Do you know what it feels like to gain, only to lose again?

516
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,840
So, she truly was the one in my dreams,

517
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,190
and yet I couldn't protect her.

518
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,320
To gain and lose again

519
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,190
is one of life's greatest regrets.

520
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,000
I can understand

521
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,800
the pain within.

522
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,710
Since she and the one in your dreams

523
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,590
are the same,

524
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
what do you plan to do?

525
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,840
There were three times

526
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,400
I tried to protect her,

527
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,510
but each time, I failed.

528
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,880
The first time, when I was young,

529
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,760
I wanted to take her away

530
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,150
from the Moonlight Heights.

531
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,630
But I couldn't fulfill my wish.

532
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,000
The second time, during the Immortal Alliance trial,

533
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,190
I prepared the Separation Array for her,

534
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,710
hoping to help her escape.

535
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,480
But in the end,

536
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,960
it was never put to use.

537
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,190
This time,

538
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,070
when Sang Qi attacked,

539
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,440
I thought I could finally protect her.

540
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,920
But in the end,

541
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,190
I failed completely.

542
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,110
Tell me...

543
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,960
if this is fate,

544
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,360
then why is my bond with her

545
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,510
so deep?

546
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,590
She is both my old friend

547
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,030
and the one in my dreams.

548
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,110
In the depths of my heart,

549
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,840
I feel it's my destiny

550
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,150
to guard her,

551
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,150
to protect her.

552
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,230
What about Xie Xuechen?

553
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,230
How is he?

554
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,590
Gravely injured,

555
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,110
he remains unconscious.

556
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,460
[Swirling Snow Pavilion]

557
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,710
Senior,

558
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,840
you're awake.

559
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,920
Mr. Nan, thank you

560
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,190
for sacrificing the ancient herb

561
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,590
to create medicine for Mr. Xie.

562
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,880
How was she taken by Sang Qi?

563
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,320
Sir,

564
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,920
Mu Xuanling leaving with Sang Qi

565
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,030
means betraying Snow City.

566
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,480
You must act decisively.

567
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,550
Judge people

568
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,030
by their heart.

569
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,400
I know what kind of person Mu Xuanling is.

570
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,920
She did not betray Snow City.

571
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,320
She's just using her own way

572
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,920
to give me a reason to let go of her guilt-free

573
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,840
so I can save the humans.

574
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,630
However,

575
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,550
I knowingly let her fall to Sang Qi.

576
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,070
In the end, I owe her.

577
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:53,550
Senior.

578
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,440
Sir.

579
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,000
Elder,

580
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,150
Yan Tong,

581
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,800
go inform the other sects

582
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,920
that I'm fine now.

583
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,070
Go.

584
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,000
Understood.

585
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,590
Senior, don't forget to drink the medicine.

586
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,190
If you had given it your all,

587
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,510
you could have stopped Sang Qi

588
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,190
and kept her here, right?

589
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,920
But you didn't do it.

590
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,670
Xie Xuechen...

591
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,920
do you regret it?

592
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,480
I once asked Elder Cang,

593
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,230
how should I weigh

594
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,710
and how should I choose

595
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,800
between the life of one person, a hundred people,

596
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,440
and ten thousand people...

597
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,670
What my father worried about

598
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,030
was like a curse.

599
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,190
I resisted it over and over,

600
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,360
kept questioning it.

601
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,590
And yet today,

602
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,710
it still happened.

603
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,760
In the end,

604
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,550
I still made

605
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,630
that choice.

606
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,190
Since meeting

607
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,510
Mu Xuanling,

608
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,550
it's been a story of debts.

609
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,110
What you and I care about is different,

610
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,510
yet the outcome is the same.

611
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,550
You couldn't save her

612
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,760
because of duty,

613
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,190
while I couldn't save her

614
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,880
because I lacked strength.

615
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,320
In the end, the one who bears all the pain

616
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,590
is her alone.

617
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,920
Now she's in the Dark Abyss,

618
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,440
and we both know

619
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,190
what we must do.

620
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,590
Sir,

621
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,230
how is Mr. Xie?

622
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,000
After taking the ancient herb you brought,

623
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,920
he's fine now.

624
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:07,800
Feng Yao,

625
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,710
would you die for me?

626
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,190
I would.

627
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,230
Then do you love me?

628
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,670
No.

629
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,190
So, it's the same with her.

630
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,880
When Sang Qi attacked,

631
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,110
she risked her life to save me.

632
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,400
But the one she saved

633
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,480
was just

634
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,630
an old friend.

635
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,670
Nothing more.

636
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,150
You should've known this all along.

637
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,360
No.

638
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,150
You've always known.

639
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:48,840
Yes.

640
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,800
I've always known.

641
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,880
I was just clinging to that bit of time

642
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,960
we spent together,

643
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,550
lost in a dream

644
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,070
I've had for years.

645
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,630
But she clearly loves him,

646
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,110
why would she turn against him

647
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,800
and never see him again,

648
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,190
just to fulfill his wishes?

649
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,590
Feng Yao,

650
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,960
what exactly is love?

651
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,150
Sir, you're asking the wrong person.

652
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,360
As for this question,

653
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,320
I probably understand even less than you.

654
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,840
If I truly understood nothing at all,

655
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,670
then maybe it'd be easier.
