00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,720
Emotional veins...

191
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,150
the name

192
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,270
is rather poetic.

193
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,480
You must return to the Celestial Altar with me immediately

194
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,480
to completely rid yourself of the pain from the emotional veins.

195
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,910
Fate,

196
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,360
I think I now

197
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,550
understand the taste of love.

198
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,960
It's not only sweet.

199
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,870
There's also bitterness and sorrow.

200
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,670
I don't want to return to the Celestial Altar.

201
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,270
I want to experience being a person with emotions.

202
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,550
For this so-called love,

203
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,360
you would rather die?

204
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,910
Isn't death

205
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,200
the fate of all humans?

206
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,150
But you're an ancient artifact.

207
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,550
You surpass both humans and deities!

208
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,320
Is death...

209
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,510
really worth it?

210
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,240
I don't know if it's worth it,

211
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,440
but right now,

212
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,720
this is my choice.

213
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,630
Who would've thought

214
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,410
Zhao Ming could stabilize all the regions

215
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,480
in such a short time?

216
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,360
These small nations are truly useless!

217
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,270
If my divine power weren't limited in the human realm,

218
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,480
I'd have dragged him to the Celestial Realm

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,630
and fought him myself.

220
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,630
Then let's use the human way

221
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,480
to deal with him.

222
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Even heroes fall for beauty.

223
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,550
Qingyang has successfully entered the palace.

224
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,440
So many emperors have been ruined by women!

225
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,870
As long as Qingyang can cause chaos in Dongze,

226
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,000
Zhao Ming's sovereign fortune

227
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,870
will come to an end.

228
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,550
By then,

229
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,120
what will he have left to resist the Divine Clan?

230
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,720
In the end,

231
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,240
submission

232
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,670
will be his only option.

233
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,960
Mr. Fate!

234
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,120
The Book of Fate has been silent for years,

235
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,200
answering no questions.

236
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,440
Who would've thought

237
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,440
you had come to the human realm?

238
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,150
Have you left the Celestial Altar

239
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,550
on Hao Tian's orders?

240
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,550
Then, whose command were you three following

241
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,750
to descend to the human realm?

242
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,200
Sir, don't be angry.

243
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,120
The Divine Clan has no intention of breaking Hao Tian's rules.

244
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,720
We are here

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
only because

246
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,320
of the Book of Fate's instruction that day.

247
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,670
Sir, do you still recall

248
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,840
the prophecy of the Divine Child's birth

249
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,720
and the ruin of the deities?

250
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,200
Indeed.

251
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
We humbly ask you to reveal the truth

252
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,240
so we can locate the Divine Child.

253
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,360
So, Jun Yu's afraid of it.

254
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,630
The Immortal Emperor is merely acting for the Divine Clan.

255
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,320
In my eyes,

256
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,510
there is no difference

257
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,750
between the Divine Clan,

258
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
the Human Clan,

259
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,670
or the Spirit Clan.

260
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,030
Even if I know the whereabouts of the Divine Child,

261
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,870
why should I tell you?

262
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,240
You see through our actions.

263
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,750
You could've remained unseen.

264
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,720
Now that you've revealed yourself,

265
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,670
is there something you wish to say?

266
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,320
You want to deal with Zhao Ming,

267
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,240
but this fire of chaos

268
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,600
isn't burning hot enough,

269
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,270
nor fierce enough.

270
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,750
So, you suggest...

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,240
Keeping Zhao Ming distracted with national affairs,

272
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,670
or even...

273
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,390
removing him altogether.

274
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,030
Your Majesty, are you ready?

275
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,480
Let's begin.

276
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
The divine fire doesn't burn

277
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,030
clothes or flesh.

278
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,270
Instead, it delivers pain

279
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,120
that pierces the soul.

280
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,510
If Your Majesty can endure it this time,

281
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,360
you'll gradually adapt in the future.

282
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,320
He Zhou!

283
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,840
[Everbright Palace]
Why are you here?

284
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,240
Go back quickly!

285
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,960
Is Zhao Ming inside?

286
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,750
No, he's not.

287
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,200
By the way,

288
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,840
have you felt

289
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,080
anything unusual?

290
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,440
Like,

291
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,390
a burning pain?

292
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,910
No.

293
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,790
What's wrong?

294
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,670
His Majesty's dealing with important matters today

295
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,960
and cannot see you for the time being.

296
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,390
What's happened again?

297
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,750
He Zhou,

298
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,390
don't try to fool me this time.

299
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,600
No, nothing.

300
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,390
Zhao...

301
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,000
He Zhou,

302
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,600
His Majesty is resting.

303
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,200
No one is allowed to disturb him.

304
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,320
He Zhou,

305
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,360
does this important matter

306
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,670
have to do with Princess Qingyang?

307
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,670
You should go back.

308
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,030
I'll explain it to you later.

309
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:50,960
I...

310
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,600
His Majesty is truly exhausted.

311
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Let's not disturb him.

312
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,670
Alright.

313
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,240
I'll come back another day.

314
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,120
He Zhou.

315
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,200
Your Majesty, you're awake!

316
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,150
How is your health?

317
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,840
It's nothing serious.

318
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,200
The Celestial Ladder's divine fire

319
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,840
is indeed extraordinary.

320
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,000
Did Pearl come by?

321
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,360
I faintly heard her voice.

322
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,390
Yes,

323
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,790
as per your instructions,

324
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,360
I didn't let her in.

325
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,200
That's good.

326
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,750
You hide these things from Pearl

327
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,200
and keep her away

328
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,870
because you fear that the fragment

329
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,790
of your essence within her

330
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,120
would share the pain of the divine fire?

331
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,750
Or is it because

332
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,910
you don't want her to worry

333
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,400
about your injuries and weakness?

334
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,830
Perhaps both.

335
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:09,960
I...

336
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,160
Just say what you intend to.

337
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,480
There are rumors spreading in the palace

338
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,350
that Princess Qingyang will marry Your Majesty.

339
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,920
With Princess Qingyang frequenting Everbright Palace,

340
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,030
the spies from Xilin believe it's true.

341
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,310
Before long, they'll relay the news back to Xilin.

342
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,920
For now, Princess Qingyang's crisis is resolved.

343
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,550
However,

344
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,510
if you don't tell Pearl the truth,

345
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
she might be heartbroken.

346
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
You know Pearl's nature

347
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
as well as I do.

348
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,830
If she knew what I was doing,

349
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,510
she would go to any lengths to help me.

350
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,920
The fight against the Divine Clan leads only to death or injury.

351
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,640
Even knowing she is the Chaos Pearl,

352
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,240
I don't want to use her.

353
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,790
Let Pearl remain just her own Pearl,

[Everjoy Palace]

381
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,550
You go.

382
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,240
No, you go.

383
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,720
You should go.

384
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,400
What's wrong?

385
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,070
Miss Pearl,

386
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,070
we're here to deliver pastries to Princess Qingyang.

387
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,440
Why aren't you going in?

388
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,960
Because...

389
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,920
because...

390
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,960
yesterday, a maid came to deliver something

391
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,550
and was scolded to tears by the princess.

392
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,510
Now we're...

393
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,110
too scared to go in.

394
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,070
I'll go.

395
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,200
Thank you, Miss Pearl!

396
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,680
What brings you here?

397
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,070
I heard

398
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,000
you scolded a maid to tears yesterday.

399
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,270
Now they're all afraid of you

400
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,510
and don't dare come in.

401
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,640
So,

402
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,480
I came to deliver pastries for them.

403
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,030
How overly sensitive.

404
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,480
They made mistakes

405
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,790
and couldn't even handle a scolding?

406
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,550
From now on,

407
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,920
they don't need to come anymore.

408
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,200
But you're a princess.

409
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,830
If no one takes care of you,

410
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,720
won't that be inconvenient?

411
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,480
Does being a princess mean

412
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,480
I must've been spoiled and pampered?

413
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,880
Have you gotten used

414
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
to living here these days?

415
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,590
If I said I haven't,

416
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,200
are you planning to send me back to Xilin?

417
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,680
You don't need to be so defensive around me.

418
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,070
I've never thought of being your enemy.

419
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,880
Even if I take His Majesty away?

420
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,030
I know you love him.

421
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,070
But you've probably heard,

422
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,510
soon,

423
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,160
I'll be marrying him.

424
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,000
Coming to me won't help.

425
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,270
You should go cry in the Everbright Palace.

426
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,920
Zhao Ming

427
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,070
was never mine to begin with.

428
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,440
There's no taking involved.

429
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,310
I'm just curious...

430
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,830
you've never met Zhao Ming before,

431
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,680
yet you want to marry him.

432
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,590
Is it really because you love him?

433
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,270
No, I don't love him.

434
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,510
But I have to marry him.

435
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,270
Marrying someone you don't love,

436
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,510
isn't that too careless?

437
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,310
And marrying someone just because you love them,

438
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,960
isn't that too simple?

439
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,920
Look outside.

440
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,110
In the palace of Xilin,

441
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,680
we have such beautiful ponds too.

442
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,160
And...

443
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,000
blooming peach trees like these,

444
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,000
and elegant pavilions.

445
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Do you know what I think

446
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,200
every time I see such beauty?

447
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,720
I think...

448
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,640
it's so beautiful.

449
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,070
Where would be a good place for me to die?

450
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,070
So you see,

451
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,590
people

452
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,200
can never truly understand each other.

453
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,240
Keep your curiosity to yourself.

454
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,400
You've been so well-protected.

455
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,920
You'll never understand me.

456
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,440
But you're still alive.

457
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,920
Doesn't that mean

458
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:10,920
there's still something

459
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,960
you care about, some hope in your heart?

460
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,790
So,

461
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,110
live well.

462
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,400
What if one day your hopes come true?

463

Don't come here again.

468
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
Stay as far away from her as possible.

469
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,030
Why?

470

She's not a good person.

471
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,750
Not a good person?

472
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,110
Why would you say that?

473
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,590
The more beautiful a woman is,

474
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,640
the more ruthless her heart.

475
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,830
What kind of nonsense is that?

476
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,270
What about me then?

479
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,240

No.

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,310

He won't be available for these days.

490
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,310
- Then... - He won't be available for the next few days too.

494
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,790
Why would you still need an advisor?

495
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,440
Dongze needs you,

496
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,240
not for the divine edicts,

497
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,200
but for your abilities.

498
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,350
You understand the heavens and the earth,

499
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,310

such abilities

504
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,000
are meaningless.

505

Sir, have you truly decided to leave?

506

After ten years together,

00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,590
would you grant me

511
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,030
one last game of chess?

512

Who would've thought it would lead to such a situation?

515

00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,480
Is this your way of making me stay?

519
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,200
If it could keep you here,

520
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,240
then it wouldn't be so bad.

521
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,920
My staying

522
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,590

I also know Your Majesty believe even more

527
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,350
that humanity can triumph over the heavens.

528
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,640
Perhaps, someday not far from now,

529
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,440
we will meet again

530

00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
How is Qingyang?

547
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,160
According to our spies,

548
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,270
she's quite favored by Zhao Ming.

549
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,550
She's thriving

550

in the Everbright Palace.

551
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,440
She's probably already forgotten

552
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,830
that her mother is still here.

553
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,270
This might be for the best.

554
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,160
I hope she never comes back.

She should dedicate

566
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,550
everything she has

567
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,310
to the immortality and prosperity of Xilin!

568
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,920
To Xilin Kingdom...

569
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,680
or rather, to your selfish delusion

570
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,310
of immortality, right?

571
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,750
I am the King of Xilin!

572
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,200
Xilin Kingdom is me,

573
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,920
and I am Xilin Kingdom!

574
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,310
Your Excellency,

575
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,310
according to the spy's report,

576
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,960
Qingyang

577
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,510
is highly favored by Zhao Ming.

578
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,310
It seems they'll be getting married soon.

579
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,830
Useless!

580
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,750
Who cares about these romantic developments?

581
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,270
Why hasn't Qingyang made her move yet?

582
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Perhaps she hasn't found

583
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,440
the perfect opportunity to strike.

584
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,270
The perfect opportunity?

585
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,200
Could it be

586
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,960
that your daughter's fallen for Zhao Ming,

587
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,270
trapped by love?

588
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,110
Impossible!

589
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,510
Her mother is still in my hands.

590
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,200
You're bound by the Mother-Child Poison.

591
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,070
Neither can live without the other.

592
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,640
If you die,

593
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,750
then your precious daughter

594
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,510
won't survive either.

595
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,270
Moreover,

596
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,030
Qingyang herself is poisoned.

597
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,880
She depends on my medicine each month to survive.

598
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,550
I'll write a letter immediately

599
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,920
to push her to act quickly.

600
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,680
Or better yet,

601
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,920
why don't you go to Dongze yourself

602
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,640
and oversee her completing the mission?

603
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,480
If she continues to delay,

604
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,440
find an opportunity and handle it personally.

605
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,830
[Everbright Palace]

606
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,920
The Xilin King has sent a letter

607
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,880
saying he greatly misses his daughter

608
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,920
and wishes to come here to celebrate her birthday.

609
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,510
The Xilin King never favored this daughter.

610
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,550
His intentions

611
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,510
must be suspicious.

612
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,680
An unusual act must hide secret motives.

613
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,680
Your Majesty,

614
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,640
we should refuse.

615
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,270
No.

616
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,640
Let him come.

617
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,440
Your Majesty...

618
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,750
He's a piece of the puzzle.

619
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,880
If he doesn't come,

620
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,270
I would have invited him myself.

621
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,270
But your health...

622
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:09,920
It's fine.

623
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,720
I've gradually mastered

624
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,160
controlling the divine fire of the Celestial Ladder.

625
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,000
I can handle it.

626
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,790
Congrats, Your Majesty!

627
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,200
Now,

628
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,000
you no longer need to keep this from Pearl.

629
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,000
How has Pearl been lately?

630
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,510
She knows you're busy,

631
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,750
so she hasn't been coming much.

632
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,160
These days,

633
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,320
she's been in the Graceful Palace by herself,

634
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,160
working on things.

635
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,720
Who knows what she's up to.

636
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,790
She's also visited Princess Qingyang a few times,

637
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,550
but they didn't argue.

638
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,270
She seems to be doing okay.

639
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,750
But it's hard to say

640
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,310
whether she's really fine

641
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,160
or just pretending to be.

642
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,460
[Everjoy Palace]

643
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,590
Breaking into the princess's room,

644
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,350
what are your intentions?

645
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,880
Why are you secretly sending letters?

646
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,590
It's just a family letter to my mother.

647
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,070
If it's a family letter,

648
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,830
why wasn't it reported?

649
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,590
If you don't believe me,

650
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,480
you can open it and see for yourself.

651
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,920
The Xilin King is coming to see you.

652
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,680
Did you secretly send him a letter

653
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,270
to make this happen?

654
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,510
You know my relationship with him

655
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,350
better than anyone else.

656
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,960
He's the person I hate most

657
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
in this entire world.

658
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,550
I don't know.

659
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,750
You've always been unreliable

660
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
and cunning.

661
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,070
Your words

662
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,070
are not trustworthy.

663
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,750
And you're a noble and upright person?

664
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,110
Then why did you pretend not to know me before?

665
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,240
What were you hiding?

666
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,640
I wasn't hiding anything.

667
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,720
I simply refused to associate with someone like you.

668
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,480
Someone like me?

669
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,480
The Saint Emperor you respect most

670
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,960
is quite willing to associate

671
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,920
with someone like me.

672
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,110
It's just a temporary arrangement.

673
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,640
That proves the Saint Emperor is a wise man.

674
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,790
A wise man

675
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,790
sees the essence of things

676
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,110
and knows what truly matters.

677
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,310
But you'll never learn

678
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,830
how to let go of the past

679
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,240
and move forward.

680
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,800
And you can so easily let go of the past?

681
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,110
Of course...

682
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,590
your past is full of schemes and lies.

683
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,070
Naturally, there's nothing worth remembering.

684
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,360
Let me warn you:

685
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,670
this is not Xilin.

686
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,960
Don't even think about playing tricks here.

687
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,670
Who's there?

688
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,840
I'm here to deliver something for the maids.

689
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,110
You lied to me!

690
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,480
You said you had no history with Qingyang.

691
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Now I've caught you red-handed.

692
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,960
Have you also been lying to me

693
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,000
about Zhao Ming?

694
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,070
Handle this.

695
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,150
Fine.

696
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,190
Just come clean!

697
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,480
You can't run now.

698
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,670
There's no need for this.

699
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,590
I'm not running.

700
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,760
I know you have many questions.

701
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,150
Let's take them one at a time.

702
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,840
I promise to tell you everything.

703
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,550
Then go ahead, speak up!

704
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,150
What's the deal

705
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,480
between Yan and Qingyang?

706
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,510
Their story

707
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,880
is not for me to tell.

708
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,710
If you don't tell me,

709
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,510
I'll go ask Zhao Ming myself.

710
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,320
No!

711
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,400
His Majesty is very busy.

712
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,320
Don't bother him.

713
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,110
Yan isn't from Dongze.

714
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,400
You know it, right?

715
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,550
I've heard

716
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,110
Yan's home is in Xilin.

717
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,440
If that could even be called a home,

718
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,550
then his journey

719
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,800
wouldn't have been so hard.

720
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,230
Yan had a tough life.

721
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,960
When he was very young,

722
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,400
his parents sold him

723
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,800
to the shadow guard corps of the Xilin palace.

724
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,840
Such a small child

725
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,510
suffered horrific torment.

726
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,760
He fought tooth and nail

727
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,440
just to survive

728
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,670
in such a brutal environment.

729
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,590
From then on,

730
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,150
he was confined to the shadows,

731
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,280
taking on the most dangerous murder missions.

732
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,590
When Yan was at death's door,

733
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,440
Princess Qingyang saved him.

734
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,480
Who?

735
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,510
A shadow guard from Xilin

736
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,550
is planning to kill the Xilin princess?

737
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,030
Your wound is poisoned.

738
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,070
I bet you won't make it out of this courtyard alive.

739
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,400
This is poison.

740
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,630
All I have here is poison.

741
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,030
To fight poison with poison,

742
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,880
if you're afraid,

743
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,230
then forget it!

744
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,400
To entrust your life

745
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,760
to a complete stranger

746
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,800
you've only just met...

747
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,400
it seems

748
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,550
you don't care much about living, do you?

749
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,880
Qingyang's mother came from a humble background

750
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,800
and was not favored by the Xilin King.

751
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,320
Even though Qingyang was a princess,

752
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
her life was tough,

753
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,110
living alone in the remotest corner.

754
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,550
But because of this,

755
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,280
Yan could sneak in and out

756
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,320
without being discovered.

757
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:23,710
Your Highness,

758
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,150
this is the latest medicine.

759
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,630
The King asks you to try it.

760
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,070
The Xilin King sought immortality

761
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,710
but feared the risks.

762
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,480
He needed his blood relatives for testing his medicines.

763
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,190
So, the least favored Qingyang

764
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,360
became his subject.

765
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,710
What's wrong?

766
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,800
Yan!

767
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,030
You're here...

768
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,960
What's wrong with your eyes?

769
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:49,880
It's nothing.

770
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,400
I've tried some medicines.

771
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,550
I'll be fine soon.

772
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,760
Don't worry.

773
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Yan was furious,

774
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,550
but he had no choice.

775
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,630
He often stayed by Qingyang's side,

776
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,000
stealing medicine for her from the royal clinic

777
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,070
and secretly punishing those who bullied her.

778
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,550
Thus,

779
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,840
these two unfortunate souls

780
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,000
began to rely on each other.

781
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,630
They developed feelings for one another,

782
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,280
but neither said a word.

783
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,000
Because simply surviving

784
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,670
was already a luxury

785
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,630
for both of them.

786
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,070
And then?

787
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,360
Then,

788
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,670
the Xilin King

789
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,840
somehow learned

790
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,360
of Yan's feelings for Qingyang.

791
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,590
He told Yan

792
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,920
he could join the army.

793
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,550
The border wars were intense.

794
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,000
If he earned military merit

795
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,110
and rose to the rank of general,

796
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,400
marrying the princess wouldn't be impossible.

797
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,710
So Yan left?

798
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,000
Yes, he left.

799
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,400
Through the flames of war

800
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,480
and sleepless nights on the battlefield,

801
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,510
he survived countless brushes with death.

802
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,280
Years later,

803
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,630
bearing scars and military merits,

804
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,550
Yan returned victorious.

805
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,960
But he learned

806
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,840
that the Xilin King had betrothed Qingyang

807
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,480
to an old merchant

808
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,760
in pursuit of gold mines for alchemy.

809
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,800
Confronting the Xilin King,

810
00:38:59,280 --> 00:38:59,960
Yan was told

811
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,440
that if he could retrieve the treasure from Nanyuan,

812
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,760
he could marry the princess.

813
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,280
Thus,

814
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,880
Yan ventured alone to Nanyuan,

815
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,710
risking his life repeatedly.

816
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,030
In the end,

817
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,840
he brought the treasure back to Xilin.

818
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,960
But when he presented it,

819
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,440
he discovered the treasure chest was empty.

820
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,030
No one knew how the treasure had gone missing.

821
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,110
Yan begged the Xilin King

822
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,230
to give him another chance.

823
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,320
The Xilin King agreed

824
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,420
that if Yan could gather

825
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,190
100,000 liang of gold as a bride price within six months...

826
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,840
Get lost!

827
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,360
...he would grant the marriage.

828
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,030
But before he left,

829
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,110
Yan overheard Qingyang

830
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,230
discussing with the Xilin King.

831
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,400
Father,

832
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,760
when Yan brings back

833
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,400
the 100,000 liang of gold,

834
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,440
I'll secretly hide one piece.

835
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,190
When he fails to meet the target,

836
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,920
we can propose

837
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,760
another condition.

838
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,070
You are truly my good daughter.

839
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,840
It turned out everything had been Qingyang's plan.

840
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,670
She saved Yan during his time of crisis

841
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,190
to gain a most loyal servant.

842
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,630
Then,

843
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,360
she used Yan's affection

844
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,280
to complete the Xilin King's tasks,

845
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,280
making her own life better.

846
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,760
Do you believe it?

847
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,630
Yan didn't believe it either.

848
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,800
So,

849
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,110
he asked Qingyang directly.

850
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,320
Since you've already heard,

851
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,590
there's nothing left for me to hide.

852
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,000
Did you really think I wanted to marry you?

853
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,880
Although we've both suffered greatly,

854
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,400
that doesn't mean you and I

855
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,440
are the same kind of people.

856
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,480
After all, I'm a princess of Xilin,

857
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,510
while you are merely a shadow guard.

858
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,030
Even if I used you,

859
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,590
you should be grateful.

860
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,280
At least you still have

861
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,230
some value to be used.

862
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:41,880
Agree?

863
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,880
Consumed by sorrow and anger, Yan left Xilin,

864
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,150
wandering across various nations.

865
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,360
He was fortunate to be recognized by the Saint Emperor

866
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,590
and found his place in Dongze.

867
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,590
So, Yan's past

868
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,230
was truly so bitter.

869
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,920
But Hezhou,

870
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,230
why do I feel

871
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,440
that Qingyang isn't that kind of person?

872
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,230
How long have you known Qingyang?

873
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,150
Yan knows better

874
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,760
what kind of person Qingyang is.

875
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,230
Just listen to Yan's advice

876
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,630
and stay away from Qingyang.

877
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,110
Does Zhao Ming know about this past?

878
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:26,510
He knows.

879
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,710
Then why does he

880
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,000
still want to marry Qingyang?

881
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,840
His Majesty can't simply act as he pleases.

882
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,400
He has his own considerations.

883
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,510
What has Zhao Ming been busy with lately?

884
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,550
Why doesn't he want to see me?

885
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,150
It's complex.

886
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,070
In short,

887
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,710
he's busy refining methods to resist the deities.

888
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,360
He has no time to spare.

889
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,070
Qingyang

890
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,400
can help Zhao Ming,

891
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,400
can't she?

892
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,510
Your Majesty,

893
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,490
Miss Pearl has gone to Princess Qingyang's palace

894
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,150
and hasn't returned yet.

895
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:35,420
[Everbright Palace]

896
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,640
For Princess Qingyang's birthday,

897
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,480
[Everjoy Palace]
His Majesty has arranged a banquet in her honor.

898
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,110
The Xilin King has also come in person.

899
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,840
- She's truly blessed! - Place it over there.

900
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,550
- Let's go. - She's a princess, after all.

901
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,800
That's not something we could ever envy.

902
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,550
All right.

903
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,440
Why haven't you acted yet?

904
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,320
Don't tell me

905
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,800
you're waiting here

906
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,840
to see your mother sacrificed.

907
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,110
If anything happens to my mother,

908
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,630
don't think you'll get away with it either!

909
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,360
Is that how you talk to your father?

910
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,800
Don't you want the antidote anymore?

911
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,550
I've told you,

912
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,320
murdering Zhao Ming isn't easy.

913
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,920
I need time.

914
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,360
This Soul Scattering Poison

915
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,800
was specially made for Zhao Ming by the divine envoy.

916
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,400
Apply it to a sharp weapon,

917
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,000
and when the right moment comes,

918
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,230
pierce it into his body.

919
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,360
Even with his inborn divine channels,

920
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,960
he won't be able to withstand it.

921
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,230
Your mother

922
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,670
is all alone in Xilin.

923
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:51,000
She misses you day and night.

924
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,710
The sooner you complete the mission,

925
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,070
the sooner you can return to Xilin

926
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,320
and unite with your mother.
