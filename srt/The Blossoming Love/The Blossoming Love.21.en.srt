Come here, good girl.

20
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,880
How do you know

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,870
my name is Bao?

22
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,430
How do I know?

23
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,400
Lansheng

24
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,040
often mentions you

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,870
in front of me,

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,480
calling you a mischievous little girl.

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,710
So, that's how I know.

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,560
Lansheng often talks about you too.

29
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,470
He says he has the most elegant

30
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,840
and kind father in the world.

31
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,400
If only my father were here.

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,630
Oh, right...

33
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,560
Lansheng borrowed the Blood Mirror from me,

34
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,280
saying he'd go with you to find your father.

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Did you find anything on this trip?

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,590
My father saved me in secret,

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,750
but he wouldn't show himself.

38
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,030
Does that mean my father doesn't like me,

39
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,560
so he won't come home

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,560

No, that's not it.

what father in this world

44
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,970
doesn't love his own child?

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,910
Maybe

46
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,470
your father has something more urgent to deal with.

47
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,170
Once he's done,

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,740
he'll definitely come back to see you.

49
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,960
My mother said the same thing.

50

51
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,380
my father is the nicest person in the world

52
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,650
and that

53
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,120
we'll definitely reunite someday.

54
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,400
Yes.

so many red ribbons.

made me especially happy,

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,800
I'd throw a ribbon onto the tree.

74
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,800
That way, I could preserve

75
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,680
that moment of happiness.

76
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,840
Later, when I faced troubles,

77
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,800
I'd walk under this tree,

78
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,960
look at all the happiness hanging on it,

79
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,150

80
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,400

Eventually, he fell into the Dark Abyss,

where he cultivated demonic power,

Disassociation was crafted by Sang Qi himself.

190
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,390
There can't be a second one in this world.

191
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,790
Xie Xuechen,

192
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,440
has she bewitched you?

193
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,720
I am the real one!

194
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,270
You are indeed identical.

195
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,550
You don't trust me?

196
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,320
If you want to play,

197
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
count me out.

198
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,600
I told you, I'm the real one...

199
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,750
This is a forest spirit.

200
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,080
It's the fruit of the Soul Capturing Bloom.

201
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,790
Its scent

202
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,630
can also cause illusions.

203
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,200
In your illusion,

204
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,790
I am always the one

205
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,870
who loves you deeply?

206
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,960
Your appearances were the same,

207
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,750
but I know

208
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,790
the one being harsh to me now

209
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,080
is the real you.

210
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,600
What do you mean by this?

211
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,630
This item is called String Bonding.

212
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,390
The two connected by it

213
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,550
cannot be more than three zhang apart.

214
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,360
I know what String Bonding is.

215
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,750
I'm asking what you mean by using it?

216
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,140
I was worried

217
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,150
you might accidentally

218
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,720
get separated from me,

219
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,440
or deliberately try to.

220
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,600
Demons may be killed, but not humiliated.

221
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,120
Are you treating me like a dog on a leash?

222
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,120
Of course not.

223
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,630
Dogs...

224
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,390
are usually leashed by the neck, right?

225
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,150
You...

226
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,390
Let's go.

227
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,600
Xuanling!

228
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,320
Xuanling!

229
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,320
You're awake.

230
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,440
I...

231
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,960
The miasma in this forest is poisonous.

232
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,720
I gave you an antidote pill,

233
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,120
but during the detox process,

234
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,440
you'll temporarily lose your sight.

235
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,870
Lose my sight?

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,440
Are you saving me or punishing me?

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,720
Mu Xuanling...

238
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,390
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,910
I've done some things before

240
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,910
that made you upset.

241
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,870
I feel guilty about them,

242
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,440
and I want to make it up to you,

243
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,030
but I don't know where to start.

244
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,480
In the past, I always thought

245
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,390
I carried the burden of the Snow City,

246
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,600
that I had no other choice.

247
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,670
But after meeting you again,

248
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,550
I've come to realize

249
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,120
I'm not just the Lord of the Snow City,

250
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,750
I'm also my own person.

251
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,600
You're the fake Xie Xuechen?

252
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,550
I am the real me.

253
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,240
Was this jade pendant

254
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,480
given to you by Nan Xuyue?

255
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,390
You...

256
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,790
He gave you such a precious artifact!

257
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,030
Did he say anything to you?

258
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,960
What does that have to do with you?

259
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,030
What are you doing?

260
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,360
Nothing.

261
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,630
It smells so good.

262
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,080
Are there

263
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,720
a lot of peach blossoms here?

264
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,720
There are some planted,

265
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,750
but the scent isn't from the trees.

266
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,840
It's the poison from the miasma.

267
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,120
Those poisoned

268
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,390
will develop many peach-blossom patterns on their skin.

269
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,550
During detox,

270
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,750
their bodies will emit

271
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,270
a strong peach-blossom fragrance.

272
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,600
When the patterns disappear,

273
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,200
the poison will be completely cleared.

274
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,870
Patterns?

275
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,630
Are there a lot?

276
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,550
Does that mean

277
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,670
there are some on my face too?

278
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,240
Does it look ugly?

279
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,550
Your face...

280
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,200
doesn't seem to have any.

281
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,080
There are a few on your neck, though.

282
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,720
And here...

283
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,790
And where else?

284
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,390
You don't need to worry too much.

285
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,270
These patterns,

286
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,360
grow on your skin

287
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,390
like peach blossoms.

288
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,030
They aren't ugly at all.

289
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,200
It's just that...

290
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,000
Just that what?

291
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,440
It's just that

292
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,120
the fragrance is relaxing

293
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,510
and pleasant,

294
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,840
and it makes people lose focus easily.

295
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,630
I'd better go guard the cave entrance.

296
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,790
Funny, isn't it?

297
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,910
Back when

298
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,440
I was in the Dark Abyss,

299
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,480
I was always on edge.

300
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,390
Sometimes,

301
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,600
even when nothing was happening,

302
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,600
I would stay awake all night.

303
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,120
But last night,

304
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,270
with you keeping watch by my side,

305
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,390
I fell asleep quickly,

306
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,750
and slept dreamlessly until dawn.

307
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
It seems that Mr. Xie's image

308
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,360
as a noble gentleman

309
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,320
has truly left a deep impression.

310
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,000
Xie Xuechen...

311
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,960
don't you think...

312
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,750
this peach blossom scent

313
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,840
is getting stronger?

314
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,910
It's making me...

315
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,390
a little hard to breathe.

316
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,790
You...

317
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,910
Your heart is hard,

318
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,120
but your lips are soft.

319
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,510
You...

320
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,720
you're definitely getting back at me!

321
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
If I say I'm not,

322
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,390
would you believe me?

323
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,870
I would.

324
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:40,870
You...

325
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,240
you should let me go.

326
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,870
What happened before was my fault.

327
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,440
I shouldn't have messed with you.

328
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,960
Mr. Xie,

329
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,000
you're an upright person,

330
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,750
noble and pure.

331
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,270
You shouldn't use such a way to get revenge.

332
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,510
How unfair for you.

333
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,840
First,

334
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,590
you didn't do anything wrong.

335
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,200
I was the one who did.

336
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,440
Second,

337
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,750
I'm not as noble and pure as you think.

338
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,590
I'm just an ordinary man

339
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,110
who can feel and be moved.

340
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,830
Third,

341
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,550
I'm not taking revenge.

342
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,160
Fourth,

343
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,110
I don't feel wronged.

344
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,920
Fifth,

345
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,440

♪Staying by your side♪

379
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,480
Sir,

380
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,270
you seem restless tonight.

381
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,270
I gave her a jade pendant

382
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,920
embedded with my protective array.

383
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,750
But just now, I sensed...

384
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,880
the array was triggered.

385
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,680
There's danger?

386
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,240
It was only triggered,

387
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,880
but it wasn't destroyed.

388
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,070
So it doesn't seem serious.

389
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,920
Sir, rest early.

390
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,790
We'll set off

391
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,160
at first light tomorrow.

392
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,440
Did I say where we're going?

393
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,720
You're obsessed with something

394
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,480
you can't let go of,

395
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,240
so you'll end up going there eventually.

396
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,590
The Ethereal Jade Island is Spirit Clan territory.

397
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,030
It's not safe.

398
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,720
I'll go with you.

399
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,270
There's one thing

400
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,310
you've never mentioned,

401
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,720
and I've never asked.

402
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,350
But tonight, I'm curious.

403
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,240
What is it?

404
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,880
Eleven years ago,

405
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,590
you came to Greenview Heights, wounded all over,

406
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,510
swearing ten years of loyalty

407
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,960
in exchange for spirit medicine to save your brother.

408
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,730
Now, the ten-year vow

409
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,780
has long been fulfilled.

410
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,260
Your abilities are remarkable,

411
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,730
and the world is vast,

412
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,000
so why haven't you left?

413
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,830
So,

414
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,640
are you trying to send me away?

415
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,960
Feng Yao,

416
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm not a good person.

417
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,200
I know.

418
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,070
I was there the day the Spirit Clan

419
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,110
attacked Greenview Heights.

420
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,070
I also know about your dealings with the Master

421
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,640
of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion.

422
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,720
Frankly,

423
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,960
I'm not exactly a good person either.

424
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,070
If you're a bad person,

425
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,310
why not act in your own interest?

426
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,350
Maybe it's because...

427
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,680
I have nowhere else to go,

428
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,350
and nothing else to do.

429
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,160
Since you're willing to stay,

430
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,830
then keep traveling with me.

431
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,960
Let's walk this path together,

432
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,680
and see...

433
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,310
if the end is bright or dark.

434
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:56,830
[Temple of Divine Execution]

435
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,680
His Grace still refuses to see visitors.

436
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,070
Please leave.

437
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,550
If that's the case,

438
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,110
I'll take my leave.

439
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,680
You...

440
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,960
Just a Su Ningxi who died 20 years ago

441
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,590
is enough to make His Grace so silent.

442
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,000
This whole "hero brought low" act

443
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,240
just makes me furious to watch!

444
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,480
He's dying,

445
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,240
barely holding on,

446
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,410
just to catch a few more glimpses

447
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,750
of that Su Ningxi.

448
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,720
Ignorance Demon,

449
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,510
what are you getting at?

450
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
Nothing much.

451
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,510
It's just that

452
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,880
power struggles in the Dark Abyss are nothing new.

453
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,920
The former Lord

454
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,440
wasn't Sang Qi, was it?

455
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,750
Sir.

456
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,880
What's the situation?

457
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,510
Sang Qi still refuses to see me.

458
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,400
To be precise,

459
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,030
since he took Su Ningxi's body

460
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,510
from the Mirage Palace,

461
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,310
he hasn't seen anyone else.

462
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,920
Sang Qi can't be relied upon anymore.

463
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,070
That day,

464
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,440
Su Ningzhen set up a barrier in the Starfall Valley.

465
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,200
I couldn't sneak it.

466
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,640
So,

467
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,550
I don't know what happened inside.

468
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,790
Judging by Sang Qi's current state,

469
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,740
that day...

470
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,350
they must have discussed something important.

471
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,960
Most likely,

472
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,590
it was a clue about the Chaos Pearl.

473
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,960
Sir, it seems

474
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,270
you'll need

475
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,720
to personally visit the Dark Abyss.

476
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:56,880
One more thing.

477
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,240
Xie Xuechen and Mu Xuanling have reached

478
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,270
the Ethereal Jade Island

479
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,640
and entered the Phoenix Perch Forest.

480
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,310
Shall we proceed to ambush them?

481
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,750
The Phoenix Perch Forest?

482
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,920
That place is overrun with spirits and beasts.

483
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,960
Few who enter ever leave.

484
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,880
It's a one-way trip.

485
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,350
Station men outside the Phoenix Perch Forest.

486
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,590
If they somehow make it out,

487
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
strike while they're weak

488
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,680
and finish them off immediately.

489
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,550
Your heart is hard,

490
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,680
but your lips are soft.

491
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,200
There are so many petals here.

492
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,000
Two of them

493
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,110
were planted by me.

494
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,880
Why didn't you speak when you woke up?

495
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,550
Too weak to get up?

496
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,160
I can manage on my own!

497
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,750
You can see me again?

498
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,030
What are you doing?

499
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,440
If you are still blind,

500
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,830
I could carry you on my back.

501
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,920
If you can see...

502
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,590
Then...

503
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,200
then what?

504
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,030
Then we shall move on, of course.

505
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,720
What did you think?

506
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,350
I'll walk on my own.

507
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,830
A disgrace to immortals,

508
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,070
a beast in human clothing,

509
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,440
and a shame to humanity.

510
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,200
We're still within three zhang.

511
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,750
I can hear everything you're saying.

512
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,750
It seems like all the aura

513
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,070
is flowing in one direction.

514
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,960
I've heard that the Lotus of Life

515
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,350
needs to absorb the world's aura to grow.

516
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,830
There's another possibility.

517
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,040
Someone

518
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,270
with immense cultivation is training there,

519
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,400
absorbing spiritual power

520
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,350
and causing these flows.

521
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,550
There are enough artifacts and spirit medicines here

522
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,270
to get you out of the forest.

523
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,590
Wait!

524
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,510
Are you seriously after the Lotus of Life

525
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,920
or some medicine for eternal life?

526
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,510
It's something more important

527
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,240
than everlasting life.

528
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,110
I've extended the range of String Bonding.

529
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,680
If danger arises,

530
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,790
you can leave immediately.

531
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,750
Don't worry about me.

532
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
I've heard the Snow City is poor.

533
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,270
What nonsense!

534
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,750
You're clearly wealthy.

535
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,400
Maybe

536
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,070
I should take this chance

537
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,510
and run off with his shrinking pocket.

538
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,720
So this is the Waterless Land.

539
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,960
The pool's liquid

540
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,550
isn't actually water.

541
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,000
It's condensed aura.

542
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,110
No wonder they call it waterless.

543
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,340
[Saint Feng Xiang]

544
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,720
So this is the Lotus of Life.

545
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,000
Such a thing really exists in this world.

546
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,880
Who are you

547
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,640
to dare desire the Lotus of Life?

548
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,510
I am Xie Xuechen.

549
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,790
I came here

550
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,070
not for the Lotus of Life,

551
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,720
but to request its seed.

552
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,790
Xie Xuechen?

553
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,240
I've never heard of you.

554
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,110
A nobody

555
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,440
dares to seek death here at the Dark Cloud Mountain?

556
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,640
Have you been waiting here all this time

557
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,310
for the lotus to bloom?

558
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,270
The true value of the Lotus of Life

559
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,720
lies in its petals and roots.

560
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,270
I have no intention of competing for them.

561
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,030
I only ask for one seed.

562
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,590
Everyone knows

563
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,070
the Lotus of Life is the ultimate treasure.

564
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Its seeds, however, are the most bitter thing in existence.

565
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,270
What do you need it for?

566
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,590
A friend of mine

567
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,720
was poisoned by Disillusion Water.

568
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,750
Her life is in danger.

569
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,240
I urgently need the seed to save her.

570
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,000
Lies.

571
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,000
I don't believe anyone would go through all this trouble

572
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,780
to find this place

573
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,200
without seeking immortality!

574
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,030
The Fire Phoenix Form...

575
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,550
Your cultivation is quite impressive.

576
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,750
You might handle a few more moves.

577
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,270
This aura...

578
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,750
Why are you here?

579
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,070
To return your things.

580
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,790
If you died,

581
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,310
keeping your belongings

582
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,640
would just bring bad luck.

583
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,000
If I'd known she was this strong,

584
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,550
I wouldn't have come.

585
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,020
Your Grace,

586
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,450
we mean no offense.

587
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,920
Why press us so hard?

588
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,440
The Jun Tian Sword...

589
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,920
It was forged from the ancient killing energy of chaos.

590
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:47,960
It possesses a mind of its own.

591
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,480
Who are you

592
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,200
to have gained Jun Tian's recognition as its master?

593
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,960
He's the leader of the Immortal Alliance,

594
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,610
born with ten spiritual channels,

595
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,920
at the peak of cultivation.

596
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,920
Why is it strange that Jun Tian recognizes him?

597
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,240
If you're scared,

598
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,720
just back off.

599
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
Nonsense.

600
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,830
Lord Qian Guang is the true leader of the Immortal Alliance.

601
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,590
Lord Qian Guang?

602
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,350
Isn't he your first-generation Alliance leader?

603
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,160
First generation?

604
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,400
I've only been gone for a year.

605
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,310
Did the Immortal Alliance change leaders already?

606
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,240
Your Grace,

607
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,070
Lord Qian Guang was the Alliance leader 6,000 years ago.

608
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,240
Six thousand years?

609
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,030
I've been in this Dark Cloud Mountain for less than three days.

610
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,310
How could it have been 6,000 years?

611
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,590
What does she mean by this?

612
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,110
Could she be from 6,000 years ago?

613
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,350
But humans can't live that long.

614
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,680
Who sent you two?

615
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,110
What's your purpose in deceiving me

616
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,030
with these words?

617
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,030
Six thousand years ago...

618
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
The Fire Phoenix Form...

619
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,680
I think I know who she is now.

620
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,640
You must

621
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,550
be the founder of the Osprey Island,

622
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,070
Saint Feng Xiang.

623
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,880
The Osprey Island's founder?

624
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,030
That was 6,000 years ago too.

625
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,830
Could it be

626
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,480
there's something unusual about this place?

627
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,030
Have we traveled back 6,000 years,

628
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,440
or has she come to our time?

629
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,750
Six thousand years...

630
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,000
Six thousand years...

631
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
Six thousand years...

632
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,830
Then,

633
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,830
where is Lord Qian Guang now?

634
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,200
It is said

635
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,920
that after you retreated to the mountains,

636
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,790
Lord Qian Guang resigned as Alliance leader

637
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,440
and followed you.

638
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,070
No one knows his whereabouts now.

639
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,830
Impossible...

640
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,160
Impossible...

641
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,590
Impossible...

642
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,400
This can't be!

643
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,160
No...

644
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,480
This can't be...

645
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,030
Lies...

646
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,070
Lies...

647
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,400
You're lying!

648
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,070
How could this be?

649
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,310
She seems to be losing control.

650
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,310
It's the sign of a spiritual form collapse. Run!

651
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,710
Xuanling,

652
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:35,960
are you okay?

653
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,230
Get up.

654
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,590
That was an explosion

655
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,400
caused by the spiritual form collapse.

656
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,920
Feng Xiang might already

657
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,110
be gone.

658
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,710
Her spiritual form

659
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,230
was a Fire Phoenix...

660
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,320
No wonder this place is called Phoenix Perch Forest.

661
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,150
But humans don't live long lives,

662
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,070
and she's from 6,000 years ago.

663
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,800
How could she still be alive?

664
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,880
Could it be

665
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,920
that time flows differently here

666
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
and a few days here equate to 6,000 years outside?

667
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,330
Then we...

668
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,150
It may not be as you think.

669
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,360
The Dark Cloud Mountain is strange,

670
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,630
but just based on Feng Xiang's words,

671
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,440
it's not enough to draw such conclusions.

672
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,630
However,

673
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,480
the Lotus of Life only blooms

674
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,360
once every 100 years

675
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,550
and produces its seeds.

676
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,000
When I checked earlier,

677
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,880
the Lotus of Life hadn't matured yet.

678
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,030
If we want to obtain the seed,

679
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,510
we may have to wait a while longer.

680
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,880
I hope that explosion earlier

681
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,110
didn't damage the Lotus of Life.

682
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,070
So, what you're after

683
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,510
is the lotus seed?

684
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,360
Why do you need it so badly?

685
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,280
Don't you know

686
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,490
we almost died back there?

687
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,730
I must get the seed.

688
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,360
This is a matter of life and death for me.

689
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,630
Look at how tense you are.

690
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,880
If you're planning to wait here for years,

691
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,480
count me out.

692
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,550
I'm afraid I can't afford to wait that long.

693
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,320
This seed...

694
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,510
is it for yourself

695
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,400
or for someone else?

696
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,360
For someone else.

697
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,360
They must be really important,

698
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,150
important enough for you to risk your life

699
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,880
and be in such a hurry.

700
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,800
Are they dying or something?

701
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,710
What good is extending the distance between us?

702
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,290
Just undo it already.

703
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,440
Don't drag me to your death!

704
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,650
Then why did you come

705
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,320
looking for me earlier?

706
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,820
Don't tell me

707
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,820
it was just to return my things.

708
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,280
I...

709
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,580
I was just...

710
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,550
You can stay here.

711
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,800
Once the black mist clears,

712
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,550
I'll go in and check again.

713
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,540
By the time the mist clears,

714
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,920
it'll already be dark.

715
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,290
Besides, you just said

716
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,710
the Lotus of Life hasn't matured yet.

717
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,440
You won't get the seed if you go now.

718
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,760
Why are you in such a rush?

719
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,110
Fine.

720
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,400
I'll go check again tomorrow morning.

721
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,540
[Ethereal Jade Island]

722
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,880
Wait!

723
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,920
We've stepped into an array.

724
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,920
Are you heading to the Phoenix Perch Forest?

725
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,760
I always like to plan thoroughly.

726
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,230
Unfortunately for you,

727
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,500
you've stepped into the array

728
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,960
I set here on the Ethereal Jade Island.

729
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,960
Even more unfortunate,

730
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,880
arrays come in four types:

731
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,710
trapping array,

732
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,360
defensive array,

733
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,230
killing array,

734
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,190
and confusing array.

735
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,890
And today, on a whim,

736
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,760
I set up a killing array.

737
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:20,800
Form the array!

738
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,440
Run!

739
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:32,800
Don't rush.

740
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,710
I still have something

741
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,920
needing you two to take back.

742
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,110
Tell your master this,

743
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,760
Mu Xuanling is under my protection.

744
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,590
If he dares make a move,

745
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,590
I won't hesitate to destroy the Decaying Immortal Pavilion first.

746
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,400
The forest is filled with illusions.

747
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,880
Finding them

748
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,110
won't be easy.

749
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,070
No matter.

750
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,280
Clear this area first.

751
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:02,960
Understood.

752
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,880
This forest is indeed strange.

753
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,840
The dense forest

754
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,360
blocks the stars and moon.

755
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,440
It's hard to tell directions.

756
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,230
Let's find a place to rest first.

757
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,190
All right.

758
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,190
Sir,

759
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,840
the fog is too thick.

760
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,550
It's easy to get separated.

761
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,070
Why don't we...

762
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,670
Sir?

763
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,280
Mr. Nan.

764
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,320
I got separated from Xie Xuechen.

765
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,070
I've been wandering in the fog for so long.

766
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,360
Luckily, I ran into you.

767
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Why are you here?

768
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,800
This place is so dangerous.

769
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,920
Did you come for me?

770
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,000
It's dark, and the path is tough.

771
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,440
Let me take you somewhere to rest.

772
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,920
Is that all right?

773
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,800
No one can ever replace her,

774
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,230
nor can anything

775
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,880
hope to fake her.

776
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,320
Feng Yao...

777
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,960
Yuan!

778
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,150
Feng Yao!

779
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,920
This place is so scary.

780
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,320
I've been trying to find a way out,

781
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,150
but I just can't.

782
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,000
Why aren't you saying anything?

783
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,510
Don't you want me anymore?

784
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,380
Just like back then?

785
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,280
No!

786
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,400
I never wanted to leave you,

787
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,670
not once.

788
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,240
But when the evil cultivators came,

789
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,280
why weren't you there?

790
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm sorry.

791
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,400
I failed to protect you.

792
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,070
I don't blame you,

793
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,030
but I'm so scared.

794
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,550
It's so cold here.

795
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,230
Stay with me, please?

796
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,960
You promised

797
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,280
you'd always be with me,

798
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,510
remember?

799
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,230
Stay with me, please?

800
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,400
No.

801
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,880
You can't stay here.

802
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,280
Let me take you away.

803
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,760
You just want to leave me behind!

804
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
You don't want me anymore.

805
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,500
Then I don't want you either!

806
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,280
Yuan!

807
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,510
Yuan!

808
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,800
Yuan...

809
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,960
He's not your brother.

810
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,920
Deep down, you know that too.

811
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,700
He's been dead for 11 years.

812
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,190
I failed to protect him.

813
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,110
He was killed by evil cultivators,

814
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,630
not you.

815
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:34,840
Get up.

816
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,030
Stand on your own.

817
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,030
I thought

818
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,630
it was supposed to be me protecting you.

819
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,960
They say this Phoenix Perch Forest is dangerous beyond measure.

820
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,000
Its dangers

821
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,190
aren't about strength,

822
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,320
but resolve.

823
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,110
Did you encounter someone you wanted to see?

824
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,480
I did.

825
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,110
And then?

826
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:17,880
I killed it.

827
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,840
It seems your mind is clear.

828
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,590
You'd rather destroy something

829
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:28,590
than accept a fake.

830
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,550
Let's rest for the night.

831
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,590
Once the fog clears, we'll move on.
