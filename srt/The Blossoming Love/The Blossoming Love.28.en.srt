21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
You can think of a time

23
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,560

it wouldn't have had to be rebuilt,

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,430
Unfortunately,

108
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,000
reality didn't change,

109
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,430
and the person you love

110
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,240
didn't come back to life.

111
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,430
It could have been changed.

113
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,750
Just give me a little more time,

114
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,800
and I can stop He Xianwo.

115
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,040
Since you promised to help me return to the past

116
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,240
and change her fate,

117
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,070
why did you suddenly pull me back

118
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,800
to reality at that critical moment?

119
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,120
You misunderstood me.

120
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,600
I didn't bring you back to reality on purpose.

121
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,830
Time and space are unstable,

122
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,510
so the time you can stay there is limited.

123
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,630
Once the time is up,

124
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,830
you will be forced to return to reality.

125
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,160
Then how long can I stay in the past?

126
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,750
One day at most.

127
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,800
Only one day?

128
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,070
One day

129
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,720
is the limit.

130
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,720
I can endure any amount of pain

131
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,720
as long as I can save her.

132
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,630
The damage to the spirit is irreversible.

133
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,040
Each time you pass through the Samsara Mirror,

134
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,680
your spirit is weaker

135
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,270
than the last,

136
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,120

137
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,560
Even so,

138
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,630
will you continue to try?

139
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,920
Yes.

140
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,160
Since your mind is made up,

141
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,310
I

142
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,240
will help you again.

143
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,240
Think carefully.

144
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,720
Which point in time

145
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
do you want to return to this time?

146
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,870
I've thought about it.

147
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,480
It's only one night.

148
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,240
I have to take Ling out of the Dark Abyss

149
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,510
within that one night.

150
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,440
As long as she is no longer the Saintess of the Dark Abyss,

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,440
she can live peacefully

152
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,670
and will not have to be involved

153
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,120
in what happened later.

154
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,200
At this point,

155
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,510
I was still in seclusion in Snow Cliff,

156
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,550
so I couldn't be seen coming down the mountain.

157
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,270
Luckily, I learned how to make

158
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,390
an Anti-illusion Hairpin from Ling

159
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,000
and was able to conceal my appearance.

160
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,480
It's been a long time

161
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,840
since I've had one of the Spirit Clan this fresh.

162
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,910
Get lost.

163
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,910
Stupid the Dark Clan.

164
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,870
Mister put his life on the line to save me,

165
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,080
so I must not die here like this.

166
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,480
Don't be afraid, girl.

167
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,550
I'm not your enemy.

168
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,360
You look pathetic,

169
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,150
but you've done

170
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,630
so well

171
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,790
that you've survived the hunt

172
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,480
from so many men of the Dark Clan.

173
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,150
You saw me being hunted

174
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,240
but didn't help,

175
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
so you're not my friend at least.

176
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,240
I made a bet with Ignorance Demon

177
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,600
on which of the group of the Spirit Clan people

178
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,720
His Grace brought back

179
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,440
would survive to the end.

180
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,320
I told him it would be you,

181
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,440
but he didn't believe me.

182
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,200
Now,

183
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,200
while all the other of the Spirit Clan are dead,

184
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,790
you're the only one who survived.

185
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,870
You're the toughest of them all,

186
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,440
and that's why I admire you.

187
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,030
So,

188
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,030
what gives you

189
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,270
such a strong desire to live?

190
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,150
Countless money

191
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,320
or

192
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,200
endless delicacies

193
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,030
or a luxurious wonderland

194
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,000
or

195
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,870
supreme power?

196
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,440
I don't care

197
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,480
about any of those things.

198
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,390
And what is there

199
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,440
in this world for you to hold on to?

200
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,510
I'm not holding on to this world.

201
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,750
I just don't allow myself

202
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,390
to die like this.

203
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,120
Interesting.

204
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,120
Why is that?

205
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,200
None of your business.

206
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,240
Do you find

207
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,550
the Dark Clan so evil

208
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,910
and disgusting

209
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,840
that you don't even want to talk to me?

210
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,390
Isn't it true?

211
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,480
You act on your desires

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,840
and have no sense.

213
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,600
You should be grateful.

214
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,480
Because the Dark Clan is like that,

215
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,510
you have a chance to live

216
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,120
in the Dark Abyss.

217
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,240
The people of the Dark Clan, whose desires are most obvious,

218
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,320
are the easiest to exploit.

219
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,360
In fact,

220
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,480
so are the Humans.

221
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,000
You should not

222
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,670
despise desire

223
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,750
but utilize it.

224
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,120
That way,

225
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,910
you can manipulate the Dark Clan

226
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,750
and even hearts.

227
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,670
I don't want to be like you.

228
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,030
To survive evil,

229
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,440
you must first become evil.

230
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,240
Only by becoming the ultimate evil

231
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,550
can you fight evil.

232
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,360
Remember that?

233
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,390
Think about it.

234
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,000
Why did you come to the Dark Abyss

235
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,240
and why are you alive?

236
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,080
Above all,

237
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,080
you have to know what you want

238
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,790
and get what you want.

239
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,080
You're right.

240
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,550
Now,

241
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,440
do I look like a villain?

242
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,510
I'm sure

243
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,480
we'll meet again.

244
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,000
I finally found it.

245
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,150
Why would anyone

246
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,040
set a trap like this

247
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,120
on their doorstep?

248
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,510
It's a good thing I'm wearing the Anti-illusion Hairpin.

249
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,670
Shameless Dark Clan

250
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,480
Thinking that I'm a newcomer,

251
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,120
you guys come to harass me from time to time.

252
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,360
Luckily, I set the trap in advance.

253
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,910
I was just passing through.

254
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,910
Who'd believe you?

255
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,000
Why would I lie to you?

256
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,910
I saw the Xuanling Tree in bloom

257
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,600
when I was passing by,

258
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,720
so I was curious

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,670
and got closer,

260
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,600
but I didn't expect to fall into your trap.

261
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,790
You seem to have some aesthetic.

262
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,600
So

263
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,960
there's a lot of bullying going on in the Dark Clan?

264
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,000
Of course.

265
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,910
There are no good guys in the Dark Clan like you,

266
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,630
especially that Ignorance Demon guy.

267
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,360
He's always giving me trouble

268
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,510
and making me uncomfortable.

269
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,240
After I have developed the most powerful demonic power

270
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,440
and defeated the Dark Clan,

271
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,240
I will make him kneel down

272
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,480
and call me King.

273
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,630
I can't let her go on like this,

274
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,910
or she'll be on her set trajectory again.

275
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,840
Do you want to learn the great demonic power?

276
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,870
I can teach you.

277
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,150
You?

278
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,200
You even hit my traps,

279
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,390
so how can you teach me?

280
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,260
[Twilight Spirit Pavilion]

281
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,240
How about this?

282
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,560
Amazing?

283
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,510
That's good, bro.

284
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,200
I’ll give you a pass.

285
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,130
Come on, bro,

286
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,550
- Let's go inside and talk. - Be gentle.

287
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,670
Be gentle.

288
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,360
Be gentle.

289
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,000
I've only seen her being cocky

290
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,120
in front of the Dark Clan,

291
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,240
but I didn't realize she was so down on her luck

292
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,600
when she first came to the Dark Abyss.

293
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,200
She said

294
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,510
she had demonic patterns on her face as a child,

295
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,750
but I didn't see them.

296
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,440
Come on, bro.

297
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,360
Have some tea.

298
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,000
What's your amazing power?

299
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,750
Teach me.

300
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,150
I'm going to be more like the Dark Clan

301
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,480
than themselves.

302
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,480
Being like the Dark Clan is not a good thing.

303
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,870
Why not.

304
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,150
Desire Demon said

305
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,630
that joining the ranks of evil

306
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,510
and becoming more than evil

307
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,030
would be one step closer

308
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
to destroying the Humans.

309
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,240
Why do you hate the Humans so much?

310
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,150
Don't be blinded by hate

311
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,840
or give up on yourself.

312
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,120
You know what?

313
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,200
There are many bad people in this world,

314
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,440
but there are also good people like Mister.

315
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,030
If he were still around,

316
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,640
he'd want you to live

317
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,720
simply and happily

318
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,080
like a normal person.

319
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,030
How do you know Mister?

320
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,920
Stop using

321
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,960
those crooked abilities

322

to read my mind.

323
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,510
I just don't want you to force yourself

324
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
to be someone else.

325
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,720
I'm not.

326
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,640
I just want to be as strong as the Dark Clan.

327
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,790
No.

as a Dark Clan,

00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,270
are so un-Dark-Clan.

If I say I'm not the Dark Clan,

334
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,880
will you come with me?

335
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,030
I would take you to a place

336
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,790
where you could live out your life

337
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,110
without strife or pain.

338
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,350
No.

339
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,270
I want revenge for Mister.

340
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,270
I can only get stronger

341
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,920
if I stay in the Dark Abyss.

342
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,750
Is Mister that important to you?

00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,440
live in pain and fear,

346

Mister is the most important person.

Once it's fired,

359

the entire Dark Abyss will go on alert,

360
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,240
and Sang Qi will immediately bring the Dark Clan after you.

Don't ever say it doesn't hurt again.

I won't let you get hurt again.

581
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,590
Here you go, sir.

582
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,240
Thank you.

583
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,550
Enjoy.

584
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,110
There are so many dishes here,

585
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,750
but why do you only have congee?

586
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,400
Congee fills me up.

587
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,310
I used to drink congee all the time.

588
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,310
The dim sum tastes like this.

589
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,680
It's delicious.

590
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,830
It's too inconvenient for you to eat with your mask on.

591
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,160
Take it off.

592
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,310
No.

593
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,880
I have demonic patterns on my face.

594
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,160
It's ugly.

595
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,110
It'll scare you.

596
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,030
It won't.

597
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,720
I knew you'd be beautiful

598
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,240
when I saw your eyes.

599
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,480
So this is the pattern

600
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,360
from the Chaos Power,

601
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,360
but why would he suddenly disappear?

602
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,110
Does that

603
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,760
scare you?

604
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:30,960
No.

605
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,070
Your demonic patterns are beautiful.

606
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,880
No wonder you didn't want anyone to see it.

607
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:40,840
Come on.

608
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,400
This snack is really good.

609
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,400
Why are you being so nice to me?

610
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,480
Do you

611
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,070
want me to do something?

612
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,190
You don't have to do anything.

613
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,400
I just want you to be happy.

614
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,670
So are you

615
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,480
my long-lost father?

616
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,840
Do you hope so?

617
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,230
If so,

618
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,630
that's fine.

619
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,920
Why?

620
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,150
In that case,

621
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,480
you'd take me with you.

622
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,110
You abandoned me for so many years,

623
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,630
so you have to make it up to me.

624
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,960
How do you want me to make it up to you?

625
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,150
I want to wear nice clothes,

626
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,760
eat good food,

627
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,760
live in a big house,

628
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,440
and sleep four hours a day.

629
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:54,920
Okay.

630
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,550
I promise you.

631
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,840
I'll take you dress shopping later,

632
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,480
okay?

633
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,120
Okay,

634
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,700
Father.

635
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,550
Don't call me Father.

636
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,230
You didn't tell me

637
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,670
your name,

638
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,920
so what should I call you?

639
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,320
If she knows my name,

640
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,480
we'll be involved again in the future.

641
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,030
You've already done too much for me,

642
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,510
so I don't want to see you

643
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,550
sacrifice yourself for me again.

644
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,550
I just want you to live a good life,

645
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,710
even if it's no longer me you love.

646
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,150
Anyway, no calling me Father.

647
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,320
Then

648
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,840
can I call you Mister?

649
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,670
What did you say?

650
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,190
Mister.

651
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,480
It's never me

652
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,440
you're hung up on.

653
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,550
He's my Mister.

654
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,320
He gave me my life.

655
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,360
Mister.

656
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,070
Do you like dim sum so much?

657
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,550
When I was in the human world,

658
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,880
the first thing Mister took me to eat

659
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,230
was dim sum.

660
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,230
So that's how it is.

661
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,400
The Mister she mentioned over and over again

662
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,230
was me.

663
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,880
All the clues have been there

664
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,710
and obvious for a long time,

665
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,280
but I didn't realize it

666
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,030
until now.

667
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,000
What's wrong?

668
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,230
Does it bother you

669
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,440
that I called you Mister?

670
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,150
No.

671
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,030
So

672
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,400
can I call you Mister?

Today is the Timekeeper Festival.

685
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,630
They say

686
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,960
it's for the Chaos Pearl.

687
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,400
They say that 6,000 years ago,

688
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,760
the Immortal Alliance used the power of the Chaos Pearl

689
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,000
to build the Immortals Array

690
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,360
to keep the human realm

691
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,000
safe from the Dark Clan.

692
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,510
But in fact,

693
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,510
the Humans never asked the Chaos Pearl what she wanted

694
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,110
or if she

695
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,000
was willing to be sacrificed.

696
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,280
Isn't the Chaos Pearl

697
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,030
a pearl?

698
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,070
Does it talk?

699
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,710
Mister.

700
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,000
What's wrong with you?

701
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,840
Are you

702
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,710
sad?

703
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,320
As long as you're happy,

704
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,110
I'm not sad.

705
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,280
If only we could watch fireworks together

706
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,110
like this at future Timekeeper Festivals.

707
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,630
I'm just saying.

708
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,880
It's okay if we don't

709
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,590
get a chance like this.

710
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,480
The head doesn't allow us

711
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,150
to celebrate the Humans' festival.

712
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,230
Because we're spirit slaves.

713
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,510
No.

714
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,840
I'll take you away.

715
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,630
Every Timekeeper Festival from now on,

716
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,630
you'll be able to see the fireworks.

717
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,400

718
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,880

720
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:13,880
I'm sorry.

721
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,510
Taking you away and staying with you are different.

722
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,230
If you stay with Xie Xuechen,

723
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,550
there will still be unknown risks.

724
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,030
I will take you away,

725
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:26,710
but in the future,

726
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,670
you must be on your own,

727
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,320
forget about me,

728
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,280
and live well.

729
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,630
I'd love to take you now,

730
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,800
but the Spirit Lock on your foot

731
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,880
restricts your range of motion,

732
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,400
so if we force our way out,

733
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,880
it will jeopardize your life.

734
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,800
It's only been one day,

735
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,510
but I'm very happy,

736
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,550
so Mister,

737
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,960
you don't have to lie to me.

738
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,230
Even if you really can't take me with you,

739
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,840
I won't blame you.

740
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,710
I'm not lying to you.

741
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,840
I really want to take you away,

742
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,840
[Moonlight Heights]
so I'm going to go to Mr. Gao

743
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,960
and ask him to unlock the Spirit Lock for you.

744
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,840
Really?

745
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,800
But Mr. Gao is in the Spiritual Form stage,

746
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,400
very powerful.

747
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,280
If you can't,

748
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,070
don't push yourself.

749
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,880
Don't worry.

750
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,840
I'll get you out of here.

754
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,190
Why is he here all of a sudden?

755
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,400
Let him in.

756
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,150
Yes, sir.

757
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,400
I envy her.

758
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,360
Her birthday party

759
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,400
is so grand every year.

760
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,920
But we have to work hard every time.

761
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,800
We work from morning

762
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,440
till night for this day.

763
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,000
That's enough.

764
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:24,840
We are the Spirit Clan

765
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,880
who are born inferior.

766
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,190
At least we don't starve

767
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,010
in Moonlight Heights.

768
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,400
Sang Qi bloodied Moonlight Heights that year

769
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,550
on Gao Qiumin's birthday.

770
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,400
So it's tonight?

771
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,150
Sang Qi has been planning this battle for years,

772
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,550
so stopping him is almost impossible.

773
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,710
What happened to Feng Xiang

774
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,510
is still fresh in my mind,

775
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,840
and the samsara mirror has repeatedly told me

776
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,880
not to change the trajectory of the past.

777
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,260
As long as I can take Ling away

778
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,160
before it happens

779
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,150
and prevent her from being caught by Sang Qi,

780
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,480
I will have achieved the purpose of my trip.

781
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,110
This man has done so many dirty deeds

782
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,400
and is very cunning,

783
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,030
so I have to be careful in front of him

784
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,070
and not let him find out

785
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,030
that Ling is the Chaos Pearl.
