[Episode 17]

18
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,950
Is this true?

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,840
My mother loved Sang Qi?

20
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,150
She was forced to marry my father

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,920
to nurture the Chaos Pearl?

22
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,640
Qiumin.

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,190
You've heard it all?

24
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,800
Forget everything.

25
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,400
Go back.

26
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,520
They say a short separation makes the reunion sweeter.

27
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,920
Since you've set a barrier outside

28
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,300
and no one else can come in anyway,

29
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,580
so why not...

30
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,150
You've been away for too long.

31
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,960
I couldn't wait for you,

32
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,240
so I thought I'd sleep first.

33
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,150
Now that you're back,

34
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,000
what do you say?

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,030
Shall we continue?

36
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,800
I still have many things to do.

37
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,960
I can't always stay by your side.

38
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,560
Let me take you back to the Snow City first.

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,310
The Snow City?

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,910
What now?

41
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,280
Are you going to lock me back in the Ice Prison?

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,240
No.

43
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,840
No one can imprison you in the Ice Prison again.

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
No one.

45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,310
But Xie Xuechen,

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,590
Sang Qi...

47
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,560
he's forcing me to help him find the Chaos Pearl.

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,710
Come with me to the Snow City first.

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,190
I'll figure out a way to remove the Heartstring.

50
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,360
Mr. Xie, you'd better not

51
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,000
force her to go to the Snow City.

52
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,560
Otherwise,

53
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,710
the Heartstring left in her soul by His Grace

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,120
will immediately take her life.

55
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,360
You've even managed to cultivate a projection?

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,280
Did you really think

57
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,680
the Illusion Elixir could only be used once?

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Why is she here?

59
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,430
Why did Master change the plan?

60
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,560
Xie Xuechen's sword energy

61
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,510
is truly powerful.

62
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,360
The projection I carefully cultivated

63
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,600
wasted after just one use.

64
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,120
What a pity.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,190
Desire Demon, that fool...

66
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,830
how could she lock me here?

67
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,040
This is Xie Xuechen's Cage of Greed.

68
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,000
Why would I end up

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,040
in his Cage of Greed?

70
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,070
He truly lives up to the Lord of the Snow City.

71
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,750
His thoughts are always tied to this mountain.

72
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,270
Fine,

73
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,950
since I'm here,

74
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,750
I might as well see what his greed

75
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,600
looks like now.

76
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,070
Stop it!

77
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,950
Father!

78
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,160
I gave you Klicks

79
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,870
so you could protect the world with your sword.

80
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,310
But...

81
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,430
you've disappointed me.

82
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,270
I sent you to retreat at the Snow Cliff

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,750
to purge your mind of distractions.

84
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,430
You've disappointed me again.

85
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,920
Do you still remember

86
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,600
what you once promised me?

87
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,630
"If I cannot strengthen my faith,

88
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,390
I will never descend the mountain."

89
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,160
Since you know your mistakes, why not correct?

90
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,190
In the past,

91
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,480
humans didn't have spiritual channels.

92
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,160
We couldn't cultivate spiritual power.

93
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,950
We could only look up to the Divine Clan

94
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,070
and pray for their protection.

95
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,560
Spiritual channels are a gift from the Divine Clan.

96
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,360
You were born with ten spiritual channels,

97
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,560
favored by heaven and earth,

98
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,600
yet you let personal feelings

99
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,070
disrupt your sword's resolve

100
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,430
and your faith!

101
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,750
I don't understand.

102
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,680
Father,

103
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,630
I truly don't understand.

104
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,310
I'm willing to die for the people of the world.

105
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,640
I can protect all the people

106
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,560
for a hundred years, a thousand years...

107
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,190
Why can't I also love one person?

108
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,360
Hopeless.

109
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,680
She is your desire,

110
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,270
and also your inner demon.

111
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,870
Kill her.

112
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,270
It's just an illusion,

113
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,750
yet you can't bring yourself to destroy it?

114
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,670
Or perhaps,

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,550
you'd rather stay trapped in this illusion?

116
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,480
No.

117
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,030
I won't kill her.

118
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,630
If I can't let go,

119
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
then I won't.

120
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,790
She has never been my enemy,

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,550
nor an obstacle to the righteous path I seek.

122
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,790
So,

123
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,270
am I your inner demon?

124
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
It's always been you.

125
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,550
If you're here,

126
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,960
does that mean

127
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,510
this is your Cage of Greed as well?

128
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,720
Then,

129
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,440
am I also your inner demon?

130
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,720
I remember now.

131
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,510
Only two people who are each other's desires

132
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,440
can enter the same Cage of Greed.

133
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,720
Is that true?

134
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,240
Xie Xuechen

Moments ago, Desire Demon's projection appeared.

She mentioned

159
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,030
Sang Qi had planted Heartstring

160

in Mu Xuanling's soul.

161
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,200
After we broke free from the Cage of Greed,

162
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,440
this is how she ended up.

163
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,870
I tried passing spiritual power,

164
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,750
but it won't go in at all.

165
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,510
In her soul?

166
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,670
The Heartstring

167
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,080
Sang Qi planted before

168
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,600
was located in her heart vein.

169
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,270
But now, it seems

170
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,750
the location has changed.

171
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,670
You share the same spiritual source with her.

172
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,510

173
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,390
for any problems.

174
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,390
It's done.

175
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,840
She doesn't have spiritual essence.

176
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,240
Her spiritual platform

177
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,670
is too important for her.

178
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,200
I didn't dare to forcibly erase it

179
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
and could only temporarily seal it.

180
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,270
If I hadn't allowed Sang Qi to take her,

181
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,150
she wouldn't have suffered like this.

182
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,480
Is that gray mole on her eyelid

183
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,600
also a mark of the Heartstring in her soul?

184
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,870
Does she have anything else on her body?

185
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,390
No, nothing else.

190
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
why did you order me

191
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,360
to lock the Saintess in with him?

192
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,600
Because

193
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,150
they would share the same cage.

194
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,360
I

195
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,360
want Xie Xuechen

196
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,960
to know this.

197
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,480
So,

198
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,270
the Saintess also loves Xie Xuechen?

199
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,000
But why would she...

200
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,910
Even if you recall something,

201
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,910
as long as the Disillusion Water remains in your body,

202
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,600
you'll feel that piercing pain again,

203
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,870
and once more forget all your emotions.

204
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,390
Xie Xuechen,

205
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,670
who believes Mu Xuanling loves him,

206
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,150
and Mu Xuanling, who no longer loves Xie Xuechen...

207
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,480
Good disciple,

208
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,630
Isn't this plan

209
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,200
far more brilliant than yours?

210
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,750
Xie Xuechen...

211
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,600
Miss Mu.

212
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,670
Mu Xuanling.

213
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,750
Xie Xuechen.

214
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,910
Xie Xuechen.

215
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,670
Xie Xuechen!

216
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,780
It's fine now.

217
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,390
Without breaking the Disillusion Water,

218
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,120
how can she possibly feel love?

219
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,750
The Heartstring has been sealed.

220
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,150
It's fine now.

221
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,000
Now Xie Xuechen and I

222
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,120
are in love with each other.

223
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,440
You enter my tent alone

224
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,000
while he's away.

225
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,480
Is that proper?

226
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,790
Or perhaps

227
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,240
our Mr. Nan prefers it this way?

228
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,750
Last night,

229
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,270
you deliberately led us

230
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,240
to discover the Heartstring,

231
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,030
didn't you?

232
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,320
How strange.

233
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,120
It always seems

234
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,080
that deceiving you

235
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,240
is harder than deceiving Xie Xuechen.

236
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,440
You're even willing

237
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,720
to endure piercing pain just to deceive him.

238
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,840
If I can fool Xie Xuechen,

239
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,440
what does a little pain matter?

240
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,450
But I didn't expect

241
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,320
Desire Demon to show up.

242
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,550
Perhaps Master thought the act wasn't convincing enough.

243
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,960
After such suffering,

244
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,120
Xie Xuechen will certainly

245
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,030
never leave me alone again.

246
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,480
Otherwise,

247
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,750
he'd surely send me back to the Snow City.

248
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,390
And that's not part of my plan.

249
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,670
Looking at you now,

250
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,750
you seem quite unfamiliar.

251
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,510
This is the real me.

252
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,600
The one before was just a disguise.

253
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,830
You've kept it a secret for me,

254
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,960
not telling Xie Xuechen.

255
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,750
I'm touched.

256
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,110
To me,

257
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,700
Xie Xuechen is nothing more

258
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,110
than a key to finding the Chaos Pearl.

259
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,400
But you're different from others.

260
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,270
You're clever.

261
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,310
You saw through me at first glance.

262
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,680
When we first met,

263
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,880
I thought you were a threat.

264
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,440
But now,

265
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,030
I've changed my mind.

266
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,790
Perhaps

267
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,440
we can become closer friends.

268
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,110
Right?

269
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,880
You removed the barrier.

270
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,160
Does that mean you trust her completely now?

271
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,310
She's indeed different from before

272
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,440
and still has some suspicious aspects.

273
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,880
But I want to trust her.

274
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,750
What if she causes trouble again?

275
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,240
If she causes trouble

276
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,000
right in front of me,

277
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,640
then it would be my failure.

278
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,680
You're just like your sword,

279
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,030
always charging forward.

280
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,110
It seems there's no outcome

281
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,110
that's unbearable.

282
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,960
I should leave now.

283
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,480
But as for Mu Xuanling...

284
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,680
You don't need to worry about her.

285
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll take good care of her.

286
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:41,830
Got it.

287
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,030
I'm leaving.

288
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,420
[Rejuvenation Pavilion]

289
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,880
Master is so peculiar.

290
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,640
There must be more secrets hidden.

291
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,880
It's probably related to the Chaos Pearl.

292
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,000
I need to inform Xie Xuechen soon.

293
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,920
- Sir. - Sir.

294
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,720
No,

295
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,790
I can't go directly.

296
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,680
If the Mirage Palace's disciples see me,

297
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
they'll surely report it to Master.

298
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,070
What's so fascinating to peek at?

299
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,240
Haven't you gone back to the Dark Abyss with Sang Qi?

300
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,310
My friends and loved one

301
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,200
are all in the human realm.

302
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,640
Of course, I came back.

303
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,880
There's no way Sang Qi would let you return so easily.

304
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't believe it.

305
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,030
Naturally, my heart was with Xie Xuechen,

306
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,400
so I risked my life to come back.

307
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,240
I considered you a friend,

308
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,720
but you can't even trust me a little.

309
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,680
Friend?

310
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,920
At most, we're just

311
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,200
on greeting terms.

312
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,510
I showed you a bit of respect,

313
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
and you got all proud.

314
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,960
I must've been overthinking it.

315
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,310
If you want to be friends with me,

316
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,400
I won't stop you.

317
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,400
But I'll tell you this,

318
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,920
don't try anything tricky.

319
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,690
Otherwise,

320
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,960
I'll pound you like this, punch by punch,

321
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,270
- until you're a pig head! - Xie Xuechen will leave.

322
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,720
Hurry up!

323
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,960
No...

324
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,550
wait a moment!

325
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,200
Wait a moment!

326
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,830
Wait!

327
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,720
I can't go over there.

328
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,350
If I go over

329
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,350
and the Mirage Palace's people discover me,

330
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,350
Master won't spare me.

331
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,960
I'm begging you...

332
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,790
The Mirage Palace's disciples

333
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,200
are all patrolling the outer circle.

334
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,350
Otherwise, how would I show up here?

335
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,920
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

336
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,750
Xie Xuechen!

337
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,160
Miss Gao, you sneaked here.

338
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,920
You must've found something.

339
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,030
Follow me.

340
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,160
This matter

341
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,790
must be related to Saint Miaohua.

342
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,110
In other words,

343
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,920
the former master of the Mirage Palace,

344
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,720
Saint Miaohua,

345
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,160
made an agreement with Mr. Gao.

346
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,880
Saint Miaohua

347
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,400
forced your mother to marry Mr. Gao,

348
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,310
using her Primal Celestial Maiden physique

349
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,310
to nurture the Chaos Pearl.

350
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,750
But they didn't say

351
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,110
that Saint Miaohua

352
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,350
replaced the real Chaos Pearl.

353
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,240
If the Chaos Pearl

354
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,640
is not in the Mirage Palace,

355
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,440
then why would Su Ningzhen be so frightened

356
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,790
that she passed her power to Miss Gao?

357
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,240
Unless,

358
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,110
she was frightened by our Mr. Xie.

359
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,960
But,

360
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,920
they did mention the real Chaos Pearl.

361
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,030
It's just that

362
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,110
they didn't say where it is.

363
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,310
When I left the palace,

364
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,960
I went straight to find Saint Miaohua overnight.

365
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,480
I heard that after Saint Miaohua

366
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,110
stepped down as Master,

367
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,000
she wandered the world,

368
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,640
and was never seen again.

369
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,200
It turns out, she's still near the Mirage Palace.

370
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,750
When I was young,

371
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,960
I secretly followed Master

372
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,830
to the woods near the Mirage Palace.

373
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,310
There was a cave there.

374
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,400
When Master discovered me,

375
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,550
she was mad

376
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
and immediately took me away.

377
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,000
Later, Master told me

378
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,720
that Saint Miaohua lived there.

379
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,240
Back then, she had fallen gravely ill.

380
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,270
After passing the position

381
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,310
to my master,

382
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,510
she hid herself away there.

383
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,790
Master kept this a secret

384
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,350
to prevent anyone from disturbing her.

385
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,030
However,

386
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,310
when I went to the cave this time,

387
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,880
I discovered

388
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,270
that Master had lied to me.

389
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,300
[Saint Miaohua]

390
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,070
Who are you?

391
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,640
Madam,

392
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,480
it's me, Qiumin!

393
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,550
Gao Qiumin.

394
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,880
Back then, you and Master

395
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,270
brought me

396
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,160
from Moonlight Heights.

397
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,750
You are that child...

398
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,440
What...

399
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,000
what is going on here?

400
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,160
Naturally, it's the work of my dear disciple.

401
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,270
Her sister died.

402
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,920
She was disturbed by endless nightmares

403
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,270
and unable to sleep.

404
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,200
Only by occasionally

405
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,480
coming to see me like this

406
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,200
can she find peace of mind.

407
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,790
What do you know,

408
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,030
and why have you come?

409
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,550
I want to ask you where the Chaos Pearl is.

410
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,640
The one in the Snow City

411
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,720
was found to be a fake?

412
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,400
No wonder she passed her power to you.

413
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,240
Did you hide the Chaos Pearl?

414
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,680
Then where is it now?

415
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,920
No one hid the Chaos Pearl.

416
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,680
It's just that no one can find it.

417
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,640
"No one hid the Chaos Pearl.

418
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,310
It's just that no one can find it."

419
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,110
What did she mean by that?

420
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,750
I don't know either.

421
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,880
And I've never seen

422
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,550
Master hide anything.

423
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,920
Perhaps

424
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,960
the Chaos Pearl

425
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,110
truly isn't within the Mirage Palace.

426
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,310
During the conversation

427
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,310
between Madam Su and the Elder,

428
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,880
they mentioned there are clues from back then

429
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,750
in Moonlight Heights.

430
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,110
If they don't want others

431
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,000
to know the truth,

432
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,750
then something from the past

433
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,400
might hold the key

434
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,750
to finding the Chaos Pearl.

435
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,880
At the time, I was very young,

436
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,720
so I don't remember much.

437
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,110
And my father

438
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,830
never allowed me into my mother's room.

439
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,310
We have to investigate Moonlight Heights.

440
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,440
We must hurry.

441
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,270
I snuck out of the Mirage Palace.

442
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,480
If Master finds out,

443
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
she'll surely send people after me.

444
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,920
You don't need to...

445
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,600
Of course, I'll go with you

446
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,830
to Moonlight Heights.

447
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,400
There might be danger.

448
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,590
And the Heartstring within you

449
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,960
might cause changes.

450
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,240
Hasn't the Heartstring already been sealed?

451
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,510
Besides,

452
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,110
I've mastered the Jade Vault Technique.

453
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,720
If there's any danger,

454
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,880
all the more reason for me to fight alongside you!

455
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,830
Moreover, with Nan Xuyue absent,

456
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,880
if the Heartstring causes trouble,

457
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,550
who but you can keep me in check?

458
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,350
You wouldn't want me to stir up trouble again,

459
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,030
would you?

460
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,110
Let's go.

461
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,550
Wait...

462
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,110
when did Mu Xuanling

463
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,110
start practicing the Jade Vault Technique?

464
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,680
Isn't that Xie Xuechen's technique?

465
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,960
And what is Heartstring?

466
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,750
What's the danger?

467
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,310
Wait, you two! Hold on for me!

468
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,920
Can't anyone explain this to me?

469
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,550
Mister, turn the pages faster!

470
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,110
Faster!

471
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,310
Bao,

472
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,550
I've been flipping through these for days.

473
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,440
Can I take a break?

474
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,480
But I haven't

475
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,110
seen my father in so long.

476
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,350
I'm really scared

477
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,790
that I'll forget what he looks like.

478
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
Didn't you say

479
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
you've never seen your father before?

480
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,240
I'm scared my mother

481
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,480
will forget what he looks like.

482
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,310
Alright!

483
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,880
Bao, don't cry.

484
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,720
I will definitely help you find him,

485
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,350
okay?

486
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,680
Next volume.

487
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,270
Time to eat?

488
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,400
Mister,

489
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,750
can you help me search for my father

490
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,640
a little longer, please?

491
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,510
Bao,

492
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:44,960
look...

493
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,920
I have really flipped

494
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,640
through every single page.

495
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,750
There's no Fu Cangli

496
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,110
in the Jade Sky Palace.

497
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,680
Then where's my father?

498
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,550
I miss my father.

499
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,830
- I want to find my father! - Bao...

500
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,350
- Bao, listen to me. - Please keep looking.

501
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,640
Okay?

502
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,240
- Bao... - I want to find my father!

503
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,510
Maybe there's another way.

504
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,920
Father, I'm begging you!

505
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,550
Just let me use the Blood Mirror.

506
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,000
Once I help Bao find her father,

507
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,750
I'll return it to you immediately.

508
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,350
You don't care

509
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,790
about the family business,

510
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,350
nor do you focus on your cultivation.

511
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,400
As the Young Lord,

512
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:36,960
you spend all your time

513
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,030
hanging around a little Spirit Clan girl.

514
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,680
How disgraceful!

515
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,480
Bao is just a little girl

516
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,920
who traveled all this way to find her father.

517
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Since I promised to help her,

518
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,000
I must keep my word.

519
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,400
So what?

520
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,240
Why did she end up here?

521
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,550
Honestly!

522
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,350
Her father is called Fu Cangli,

523
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,030
said to be

524
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,510
the richest human cultivator alive.

525
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,110
I think he might

526
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,510
be connected to our Jade Sky Palace.

527
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,830
What's her father's name again?

528
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,070
Fu Cangli.

529
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:10,790
Father,

530
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,160
do you know him?

531
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,240
No.

532
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,480
I've never heard of him.

533
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,960
You've been flipping through family records

534
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,750
and name registries recently.

535
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,000
Was it to look for her father?

536
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,720
That little girl

537
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,440
is from the Spirit Clan.

538
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
Her father's a human cultivator.

539
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,110
Obviously,

540
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,960
he married a Spirit Clan wife.

541
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,210
Do you know

542
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,160
where their family usually lived?

543
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,750
How would I know?

544
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,000
I didn't ask that much.

545
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,160
Bao just said

546
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,480
her father left years ago

547
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,400
and never came back home.

548
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,600
So, Father,

549
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,720
we really need to help her.

550
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,110
If we can't find him here,

551
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,720
then give me the Blood Mirror and I'll look outside.

552
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,480
No way!

553
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,920
Why not?

554
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,590
It's just a Blood Mirror.

555
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,030
Let me borrow it,

556
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,640
right?

557
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,270
Right.

558
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,240
Dear, you...

559
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,440
Bring it out.

560
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,160
Bring it out!

561
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,400
The Blood Mirror.

562
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:14,790
Thank you, Mother!

563
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,240
You always know how to care for people.

564
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,240
Here...

565
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:25,720
How does that feel?

566
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:26,880
Comfortable?

567
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,680
Let me massage you a bit more.

568
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,570
The Blood Mirror...

569
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,200
Thank you, Mother.

570
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:47,960
Bao!

571
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,400
Dear,

572
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,270
why did you have to lend it to him?

573
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,680
You've used the Blood Mirror before.

574
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,480
Aside from what Lansheng saw,

575
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,720
you couldn't see anything else.

576
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,400
The Blood Mirror

577
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,440
requires blood from a close relative

578
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,310
to work.

579
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,790
That's why fate is like this.

580
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,400
If someone can't be found,

581
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,000
they simply can't be found.

582
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,110
And those meant to return

583
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,110
can't be stopped.

584
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,400
Let them go.

585
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,830
Maybe

586
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,200
they'll get some results.

587
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,070
Will this treasure

588
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,400
really help me find my father?

589
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,550
This mirror is called the Blood Mirror.

590
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,790
My father obtained it

591
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,400
from an evil cultivator.

592
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,680
This evil cultivator practiced

593
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,790
blood sacrifice techniques.

594
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,960
He used his own blood as a medium,

595
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,510
making others drink it.

596
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:42,880
Then, with this Blood Mirror,

597
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,440
he could gain the vision

598
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,880
of those connected to his bloodline.

599
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,510
He could see what they saw.

600
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,550
I was curious once.

601
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,920
I dripped my own blood on it,

602
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,000
and ended up seeing

603
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,110
what my mother was seeing.

604
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,350
Then, if I drip

605
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,510
my own blood on it,

606
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,790
can I see my father then?

607
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,310
No.

608
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,770
You'd only see

609
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,960
what he's currently seeing.

610
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,790
Who are these three people?

611
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,240
I can't see clearly.

612
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,750
Why does it feel like I'm being watched?

613
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,310
It must be an illusion.

614
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,270
Could your father

615
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,480
be trying to follow them?

616
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,590
Is it possible

617
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,550
he plans to rob them?

618
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,060
My father has tons of treasures.

619
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,460
Why would he rob anyone?

620
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,400
The spiritual herbs around them are quite rare.

621
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,960
I've heard they only grow near Moonlight Heights.

622
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,480
Moonlight Heights?

623
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,670
Take the Blood Mirror.

624
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,400
Let's go.

625
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,320
Let's meet your father.

626
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,840
[Moonlight Heights Town]
Fresh vegetables!

627
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,550
[Clothing Shop]
Homegrown vegetables!

628
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,510
Here you go!

629
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,110
Sir,

630
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,150
want some vegetables?

631
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,710
No, thanks.

632
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,710
Buns!

633
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,400
Buns!

634
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,510
This place

635
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,030
didn't use to be this desolate.

636
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,030
Buns!

637
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,550
Hot buns!

638
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:49,920
Excuse me, sir.

639
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,070
May I ask

640
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,190
why this town is so deserted?

641
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,550
Do you know there used to be a manor

642
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,190
called Moonlight Heights here?

643
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,550
It's said that years ago,

644
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,360
a group of demons came here

645
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,760
and slaughtered everyone

646
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,880
in that manor.

647
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,250
Even the cultivators there

648
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,360
were all wiped out.

649
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,710
The town was affected too.

650
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,110
Everyone said

651
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,840
this place was cursed,

652
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,510
so too many people died here.

653
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,510
And since then,

654
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,800
no one would come to protect us anymore.

655
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,070
So,

656
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,070
those who could leave, left.

657
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,030
Sir,

658
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,960
then why do you

659
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,150
still stay here?

660
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,320
Me?

661
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,190
I was born here.

662
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,150
If I leave,

663
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,320
where would I even go?

664
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,800
Want some?

665
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:38,880
No, thank you.

666
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,030
Alright.

667
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,070
Take care.

668
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,670
After my master was taken away,

669
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,760
she never returned to this place.

670
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,200
I didn't expect...

671
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,480
You didn't kill those people.

672
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,320
What you should do is avenge them,

673
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,360
not to feel sad.

674
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,480
Is she...

675
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,630
comforting me?

676
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,960
Stop wasting time

677
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,150
on pointless sorrow.

678
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:03,590
Let's go.

679
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,320
Let's head to Moonlight Heights first.

680
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,510
Hi, there!

681
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,400
- Xuanling! - It's been a while!

682
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,670
Mr. Fu!

683
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,440
Fu Lansheng!

684
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,880
Xuanling, I've missed you so much!

685
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,840
You've finally come back,

686
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,880
Xuanling...

687
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,110
I missed you too.

688
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,480
If only you could sniff out where the Chaos Pearl is,

689
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,510
that would be even better.

690
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,400
How did you know we were here?

691
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,110
Funny enough, it's a short story.

692
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,800
Mister,

693
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,370
I've made a new discovery. Look!

694
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,000
We used the Blood Mirror

695
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,800
and found out that Bao's father was following you.

696
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,510
So we came along.

697
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:37,760
Why would

698
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,230
Bao's father follow us?

699
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,190
No idea.

700
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,040
Later, when we used the Blood Mirror again,

701
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,030
we couldn't see anything.

702
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,150
I suspect he used some method

703
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,400
to block the artifact's detection.

704
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,670
Your father

705
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,190
sure is mysterious.

706
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,440
So what are your plans now?

707
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,960
The Blood Mirror doesn't work anymore,

708
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,670
but following you

709
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,440
might help us find Bao's father.

710
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,760
You still haven't found her?

711
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:09,800
No.

712
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,190
I've already sent more people

713
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,440
to search the roads

714
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,840
from Mirage Palace

715
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,480
to Moonlight Heights.

716
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,110
Had I known this would happen,

717
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,410
I should've locked her up in this room!

718
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,510
But can you lock her up forever?

719
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Once suspicion takes root,

720
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,400
there will be no peace.

721
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,710
I just visited the back mountain.

722
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,110
Qiumin has met with Saint Miaohua.

723
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,880
She's becoming more and more disobedient lately.

724
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,000
Let her meet, then.

725
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,880
For that woman,

726
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,070
the most important thing is Mirage Palace.

727
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,190
She won't reveal anything to her.

728
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,760
Right now, the most important thing

729
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
isn't finding Qiumin.

730
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,510
Forget it.

731
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,030
That place can't be left as it is.

732
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,110
Send people with celestial artifacts

733
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,110
to Moonlight Heights

734
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,670
and destroy the entire house

735
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,110
where my sister lived.

736
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,190
Understood.

737
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,710
Why are you so curious

738
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,920
about the past?

739
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,360
Some things

740
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,000
are better left buried.

741
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:55,300
[Moonlight Heights]

742
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,280
Miss Gao.

743
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,400
Miss Gao.

744
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,710
What's wrong?

745
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,710
It's nothing.

746
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,000
I just recalled some things

747
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,920
from the past.

748
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,670
Let's search my mother's room first.

749
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,030
There might be clues there.

750
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,440
I never imagined

751
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,000
this place would end up like this.

752
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,920
You also experienced what happened back then.

753
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,920
Seeing all this,

754
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,840
doesn't it scare you?

755
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,960
I barely remember

756
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,030
what happened back then.

757
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,630
Barely remember?

758
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,760
You used to hold hatred pretty well.

759
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,590
Now, I can barely remember.

760
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,440
Isn't that a good thing?

761
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,000
This is my mother's room.

762
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,920
This is actually the first time

763
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,800
I've been inside her room.

764
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:42,590
Bao,

765
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,400
it's dusty here.

766
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,320
Wait outside for us.

767
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:44,880
Alright.

768
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:50,760
Let's split up and search.

769
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,440
Strange.

770
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,840
It doesn't look like anyone lived here.

771
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,840
Could someone have packed up

772
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,550
your mother's belongings?

773
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:10,920
Impossible.

774
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,290
When I was little,

775
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:13,710
my father would stay here all afternoon whenever came.

776
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,960
He never let anyone

777
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,150
come near my mother's room.

778
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,030
This array was set up by some master.

779
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,190
We have similar locking arrays in the Jade Sky Palace.

780
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,190
They're used to protect precious artifacts

781
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,030
and spiritual herbs.

782
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,070
Unless you know how to break the locking array,

783
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,150
there's

784
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,380
absolutely no way

785
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,360
to open this door.

786
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,190
I...

787
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,400
I don't know how to break it.

788
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,440
Step aside.

789
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,030
The secret is right in front of us.

790
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,480
Let's see.

791
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,710
There's such a deep secret passage

792
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,920
hidden beneath my mother's room!

793
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,550
My father never told me about this.

794
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,190
It seems that Gao Fengxu

795
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,480
kept quite a few secrets

796
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,190
even from his own daughter.
