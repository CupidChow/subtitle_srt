00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,860
[Episode 3]

18
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,560
Sir,

19
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,480
we've arrived.

20
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,310
But why have you come here?

21
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,150
Last year, I once cast a fortune.

22
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,870
It foretold that today,

23
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,120
I would reunite with an old friend here.

24
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,560
But I don't know

25
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,710
if she still remembers me.

26
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,120
Xie Xuechen,

27
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,750
Are you leaving me here to roast like meat?

28
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,870
I must find someone to help Miss Mu.

29
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,680
Miss Mu!

30
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,120
- I found the smartest person - Bao...

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,710
in the entire world to save you!

32
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,750
In your eyes,

33
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,360
it seems everyone is smart.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
Shackle of Delicacy...

35
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,590
You recognize this array?

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,960
The Shackle of Delicacy binds but does not kill.

37
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,590
It is an array of mercy.

38
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,590
Mercy?

39
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,190
This array is forged with blood.

40
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,400
Its faint golden light suggests

41
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,870
the creator possesses

42
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,910
immense power.

43
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,280
If one intended to kill,

44
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,630
why use an array?

45
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,150
If one intended to create an array,

46
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,400
why use blood?

47
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,190
It seems the creator must be in a terrible situation,

48
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,080
forced to use a desperate measure against his enemy.

49
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,680
Miss, you must be extraordinary.

50
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,910
Indeed, that's a clever one.

51
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,630
Sir, please help her.

52
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,800
Miss Mu is a good person.

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,360
She had a fight with her friend,

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,120
so she's trapped here.

55
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,800
If you help her,

56
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,590
I'll share half of my treasures

57
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,750
with you.

58
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,520
Alright.

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,680
May I ask, Miss,

60
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,310
why did your friend trap you here?

61
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,030
I once saved him,

62
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,680
risking my life

63
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,000
to pull him out of danger.

64
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,870
Afterward,

65
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,960
we fought the enemy together,

66
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,560
advancing and retreating as one,

67
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,240
and narrowly escaped death many times.

68
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,800
But I never expected

69
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,920
that over a small misunderstanding,

70
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,120
he would accuse me of harming someone

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,800
and take such cruel action against me.

72
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,870
Sir, do you not believe me?

73
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,120
Not at all.

74
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,070
If you say so,

75
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,390
then I shall believe you.

76
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,360
Would you be willing to provide some guidance?

77
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,560
The interplay of Yin and Yang forms the Four Symbols,

78
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,120
and the Shackle of Delicacy binds even the spirits from all directions.

79
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,040
It seems he is quite skilled.

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,240
This Shackle of Delicacy is ever-changing.

81
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,310
Moving forward,

82
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,880
you must follow my instructions step by step

83
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,800
to escape the array.

84
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,430
Step one:

85
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,890
Earth generates Fire in the second position,

86
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,680
originating from the Vermilion Bird.

87
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,800
South, Fire, Vermilion Bird...

88
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,270
This array is based on the Hetu and Luoshu.

89
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,630
Judging from the Hetu and star positions earlier,

90
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,950
south...

91
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,870
should be...

92
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,720
this way.

93
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,830
Earth generates Fire in the second position,

94
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:26,870

Earth generates Fire in the second position,

98
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
and Heaven completes it in the seventh.

99
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,920
Generating in the second and completing in the seventh...

100
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,600
Seven...

101
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,310
It should be nearby.

[Seven]

103
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,600
Earth generates Metal in the fourth position,

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,070
originating from the White Tiger.

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,510
West, Metal, White Tiger.

107
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Earth generates Metal in the fourth position,

108
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,830
and Heaven completes it in the ninth.

109
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,740
[Nine]

110
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,680
This person's origins are unknown.

111
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,630
If he begins to doubt me

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,310
after breaking the array...

113
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,160
Sir...

114
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,750
Only one final step remains.

115
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,920
Miss,

116
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,720
are you perhaps thinking of

117
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,680
where to attack me?

118
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,630
Yes!

119
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,800
I was just about to cut your neck,

120
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,000
so you wouldn't have to suffer anymore.

121
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,750
I have no interest in meddling in others' grievances

122
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,440
or engaging in fights and killings.

123
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,120
However, if I can unlock the Shackle of Delicacy,

124
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,680
I can naturally trap you back inside.

125
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,360
Why are you just like my friend,

126
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,510

127
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,510

130
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,510
The final step:

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,040
Two and four are the shoulders,

132
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,920
six and eight are the legs,

133
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,480
and five is the center.

134
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,190
The Shackle of Delicacy will be broken.

No, that's wrong.

139
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,190
Five as the center...

140
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,750
That doesn't mean looking for "five."

141
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,720
Rather,

142
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,750
it means retrieving "ten and five."

143
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,580
Ten and five together form the center.

144
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,200
It should be...

you look so beautiful now!

Who exactly are you,

149
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,550

Mu Xuanling.

153
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,360
Is it

154
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,030
the Mu meaning wood?

155
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,030
The Mu meaning dusk.

156
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,000
Mr. Nan, your carriage

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,410
seems ordinary from the outside,

158
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,930
but I didn't expect

159
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,480
it to be so large inside.

160
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,840
Using arrays to expand space...

161
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,120
Mr. Nan, you're indeed

162
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,550
the foremost expert of arrays today.

163
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,920
It's said that in our time,

164
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,510
only two people were born with an extra sense.

165
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,080
One is Xie Xuechen,

166
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,000
the other is you, Mr. Nan.

167
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,030
Your talent is extraordinary,

168
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,840
capable of divining the past and future.

169
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,790
Even my mother once said,

170
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,510
Mr. Nan

171
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,080
is the smartest person in the world.

172
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,270
She also said nothing can escape

173
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,270
your notice.

174
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,790
Is that true?

175
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,720
That was all in the past.

176
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,390
I've long lost my ability to foresee.

177
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,150
So now, in this world,

178
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,960
I know no more than anyone else.

179
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,150
Then how did you know

180
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,080
it was Xie Xuechen

181
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,550
who trapped me in the Shackle of Delicacy?

182
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,720
To be honest,

183
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,510
the Shackle of Delicacy

184
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,120
were created by Xuechen and me

185
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,550
in our youth.

186
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,080
Thus, in this world,

187
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:10,960
besides me,

188
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,550
he is the only one who knows it.

189
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,200
You and Xie Xuechen are friends?

190
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,240
For someone as aloof as him

191
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,720
to have a friend?

192
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,670
Aren't you also friends

193
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,120
with Xuechen?

194
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,320
Then, what you said earlier...

195
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,840
Yes!

196
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,630
He and I are, of course, friends.

197
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
Xie Xuechen has faced great hardships.

198
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,720
Though he was unkind to me,

199
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,790
I cannot abandon him.

200
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,150
Why not...

201
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,910
I understand.

202
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,480
It's better to resolve the small misunderstanding between friends,

203
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,390
isn't it?

204
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,150
If that's the case,

205
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,630
you can come with me

206
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,840
to Greenview Heights.

207
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,670
By chance,

208
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,840
Xuechen will also be there.

209
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,390
You know Xie Xuechen will be at Greenview Heights?

210
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,630
Given his current situation,

211
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,150
he likely has no other choice.

212
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,670
That's not hard to guess.

213
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,000
It's just a matter

214
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,510
of whether you're willing to come along.

215
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,270
That's exactly what I intend.

216
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,360
I want to go too!

217
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,650
Why would you go?

218
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,680
You should go home

219
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,550
and stop worrying your mother.

220
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,790
But

221
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,360
I still need to repay the favor.

222
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,390
Also,

223
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,060
if I want to find my father,

224
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,550
I must learn some real skills.

225
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,320
I want to follow you to train!

226
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,440
You've already helped me,

227
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,720
so let's not talk about favors anymore.

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,870
If you want to learn skills,

229
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm not the one to teach you.

230
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:30,870
Besides,

231
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,390
I have other things to do

232
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,240
and can't take you along.

233
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,890
Miss Mu...

234
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,480
Mr. Nan,

235
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,480
may I...

236
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,870
visit your home?

237
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,080
I'm very well-behaved!

238
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,790
I won't cause trouble or steal food.

239
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,550
Just give me

240
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,080
a small place to stay.

241
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,510
If there's no small place, it's fine.

242
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,390
I'll...

243
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,790
just find a hole and sleep there.

244
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,630
How about it?

245
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,480
Mr. Nan, don't look at me.

246
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,790
I'm not responsible for her.

247
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,240
Since she's asking you,

248
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,600
it's your decision to make.

249
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,150
Then let's invite Bao

250
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,320
as my little guest.

251
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:20,960
What do you say?

252
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,120
Great! Thank you, Mr. Nan!

253
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,480
Miss Mu!

254
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,870
Miss Mu!

255
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,630
Miss Mu!

256
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,150
Actually,

257
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,030
I once cast a fortune.

258
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,150
It foretold that today,

259
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,720
I would reunite with an old friend here.

260
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,750
I've waited a long time,

261
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,960
almost thinking I wouldn't see her.

262
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,600
And now, have you seen her?

263
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,580
[Moonlight Heights]

264
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,120
Sir, enjoy your meal.

265
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,720
That's Nan Xuyue of Greenview Heights?

266
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,440
I heard he was born with an extra sense

267
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,630
but was ambushed,

268
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,790
destroying three of them.

269
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,200
Now he's disabled.

270
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,150
Yes, how pitiful.

271
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,550
I see him sitting in the courtyard day after day.

272
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,320
Such a genius, fallen so low.

273
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,840
How can he endure it?

274
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,240
His father is seeking healers everywhere.

275
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,720
Now he's turned to our master.

276
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,390
But whether our master

277
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,150
will lend the Chaos Pearl to save him...

278
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,790
Why are you sitting here,

279
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,910
not moving at all?

280
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,510
I can no longer cultivate.

281
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,120
And my legs are broken.

282
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,600
I'm in a bad mood.

283
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,390
But it doesn't seem

284
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,720
like you're very sad.

285
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,550
You just seem lonely

286
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,670
and bored.

287
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,320
I'll be your friend.

288
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,600
How about it?

289
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,030
I heard that liking someone is precious.

290
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,360
If you share a little of your candy

291
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,840
with me,

292
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,670
I'll share a little bit of my liking

293
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,960
with you.

294
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,320
How about that?

295
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,930
Here, one for you.

296
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,440
Thank you!

297
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,360
A whole plate of candy

298
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,200
for just

299
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,750
a tiny bit of liking...

300
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,440
What a stingy little girl you are.

301
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,120
I've seen her.

302
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,200
But she's already forgotten me.

303
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,720
Feng Yao, let's return.

304
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,790
Yes, sir.

305
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:09,540
[Greenview Heights]

306
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,460
[Greenview Heights]

307
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,920
Please wait here.

308
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,960
He should arrive shortly.

309
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,310
Miss Mu,

310
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,110
this pastry is delicious!

311
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,830
Try some!

312
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,780
It's really good!

313
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,350
Delicious.

314
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,720
As long as you like it, Miss.

315
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,480
Mr. Nan, have you known Xie Xuechen

316
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,640
for long?

317
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,840
About...

318
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,790
over ten years, I think.

319
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,280
Then you must know

320
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,350
a lot about him.

321
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,840
That depends on which aspects you mean.

322
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,920
Sir,

323
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,350
Mr. Xie has arrived.

324
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Mr. Xie!

325
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,070
Since you're here at my place now,

326
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,640
take off the hairpin.

327
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,480
Turns out you're so handsome, Mr. Xie!

328
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,640
It's been a long time

329
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,960
since our last meeting.

330
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,750
Why does it feel

331
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,720
like you're not happy to see me?

332
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,160
You seem happy to see me.

333
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,270
But...

334
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,720
why did you bring her here?

335
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,070
Miss Mu said

336
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,110
there's a misunderstanding between you two.

337
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,770
Do you believe it?

338
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,400
Of course not.

339
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,310
You're still such a busybody as always.

340
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,920
Why did you follow us here?

341
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Is there something you want to say?

342
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,750
Indeed, there is.

343
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,310
Xie Xuechen,

344
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,160
you scoundrel!

345
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,830
Miss Mu might still be angry.

346
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,080
Now may not be the best time to talk.

347
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,550
Why not rest first,

348
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,920
then resolve the misunderstanding when she's calmed down?

349
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,830
What do you think?

350
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,640
Bao.

351
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,550
Miss Mu.

352
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,240
Greenview Heights truly lives up to its fame

353
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,920
for mechanisms and arrays.

354
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,400
The rocks and plants here

355
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,830
seem randomly placed,

356
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,070
but they hide arrays everywhere.

357
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,180
No wonder Mr. Nan feels confident

358
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,750
letting us wander freely.

359
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,350
Feng Yao,

360
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,270
if an enemy acted recklessly

361
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,350
here at Greenview Heights,

362
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,240
would he die instantly?

363
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,590
So, Miss,

364
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,720
please don't act rashly.

365
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,830
What are you implying?

366
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,240
I'm a good person!

367
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Do you know who she is?

368
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,030
A Spirit Clan member with demonic powers.

369
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,510
There aren't many of them left.

370
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,880
Given her age,

371
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,510
I could probably guess.

372
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,270
Since you guessed, why bring her here?

373
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,480
Because you used the Shackle of Delicacy.

374
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,030
Sit.

375
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,640
Using blood as a sacrifice

376
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,160
to set a killing array isn't hard,

377
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
but you chose to only trap her.

378
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,830
That shows you didn't want to kill her.

379
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,350
That's one reason.

380
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:12,960
And the second reason?

381
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,110
The second reason is Bao.

382
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,400
She's naturally sensitive.

383
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,550
She won't approach truly wicked people

384
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,960
who carry the karma of murder.

385
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,550
The fact that Bao likes Miss Mu so much

386
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,440
proves she isn't a bad person.

387
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,590
You should know that too.

388
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,680
Calm down.

389
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,830
Since she's the Saintess of the Dark Abyss,

390
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,070
instead of letting her run loose outside and cause trouble,

391
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
it's better to keep her under your watch.

392
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,110
That was the right decision.

393
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,590
How about you?

394
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,200
How's your body holding up?

395
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,160
When I was trapped in the Lava,

396
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,030
she gave me a medicine to take.

397
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,270
It temporarily restored my spiritual power,

398
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
but for the next ten days,

399
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,240
I couldn't use any power at all.

400
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,510
She told me

401
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,480
about how she saved you,

402
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,550
but I didn't expect

403
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,590
she'd use Half-Day Glory on you.

404
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,510
Half helpful,

405
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,960
half troublesome.

406
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,880
Interesting.

407
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,880
Interesting?

408
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,240
Oops, I misspoke.

409
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,270
What's so funny?

410
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,400
Is there a remedy?

411
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,760
With your Jade Vault Technique,

412
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,790
your healing ability is already superior.

413
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,900
After ten days,

414
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,400
your full power will return.

415
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,030
I can't wait that long.

416
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,070
Is it because

417
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,310
the Dark Abyss is still moving?

418
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,350
Ancient texts mention a method

419
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,480
of drawing runes with spirit ink.

420
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,590
It can speed up recovery of spiritual power.

421
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,590
Want to try it?

422
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,070
Yes.

423
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,750
How long will it take to prepare

424
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,590
a teleportation array

425
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,640
from Greenview Heights to Snow City?

426
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,960
Spanning thousands of miles,

427
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,030
it's different from other arrays.

428
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,060
It'll take a day to set up.

429
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,920
A day?

430
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,590
Alright.

431
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,640
Let me borrow your paper crane for communication first.

432
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,110
Alliance Leader,

433
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,160
Sang Qi has joined forces with a traitor within the Immortal Alliance,

434
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,030
planning to steal the Chaos Pearl.

435
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,550
Please be cautious.

436
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,310
I'll return as soon as I can.

437
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,550
Earlier,

438
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,750
I contacted the Alliance's secret guards.

439
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,680
[Temple of Divine Execution]
The five sects of the Immortal Alliance

440
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,060
only know that Xie Xuechen entered the Immortals Array

441
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,000
and hasn't emerged since.

442
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,400
They know nothing else.

443
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,200
Xie Xuechen escaped

444
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,720
but he did not immediately return

445
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,830
to Snow City.

446
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,550
That suggests two possibilities.

447
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,720
The first possibility

448
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,030
is that Xie Xuechen suspects the five sects

449
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,110
of the Immortal Alliance.

450
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,110
He knows that the ambush in the Immortals Array

451
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,920
suggests a traitor

452
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,110
within the five sects.

453
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,880
The second possibility

454
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,680
is that he hasn't yet recovered

455
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,750
his full strength,

456
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,480
so he can't return to Snow City

457
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,960
thousands of miles away

458
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,720
or even

459
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,640
to contact

460
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,830
the nearest sect.

461
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,070
Given Xie Xuechen's character,

462
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,880
if he had recovered his strength

463
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,920
and confirmed there's a traitor among the five sects,

464
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,920
he'd immediately return to the sect

465
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,160
and wipe out the traitor.

466
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,790
Therefore,

467
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
it's very likely

468
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,790
he's still severely injured.

469
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,640
Continue training your projection clones

470
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,960
and locate their whereabouts.

471
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,000
Understood.

472
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,130
Do you know who the traitor is

473
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,370
within the Immortal Alliance?

474
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,360
Not yet.

475
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,640
That's why I need to return to Snow City soon

476
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,000
to uncover the traitor

477
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,490
and protect the Chaos Pearl.

478
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,130
Did your journey into the Dark Abyss

479
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,160
reveal anything?

480
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,000
Others may not know you,

481
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,590
but I do.

482
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,880
With your personality,

483
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,480
you'd fight to the death

484
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,070
before getting captured.

485
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,510
For you to be caught in the Dark Abyss,

486
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,750
there's only one explanation:

487
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,200
you planned it.

488
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,440
Six thousand years ago,

489
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,830
the first Immortal Alliance devoted all its power

490
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,200
to set up the Immortals Array on the Two Realms Mountain,

491
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,590
stopping the Dark Clan's invasion.

492
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,790
Since then, the Dark Clan couldn't enter the human realm,

493
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,830
and humans

494
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,720
couldn't enter the Dark Abyss.

495
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,000
No one knows what lies within the Dark Abyss.

496
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,160
Without understanding the enemy,

497
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,640
how can we hope to win?

498
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,370
So, before you went to repair the barrier,

499
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,270
you had already made up your mind.

500
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,750
If the repair succeeded,

501
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,000
you would retreat in glory.

502
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
If it failed,

503
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,480
you'd let them

504
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,790
capture you

505
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,480
to gather intelligence on the Dark Abyss.

506
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:44,880
Am I right?

507
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,240
That's why you released

508
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,350
those Ice Fireflies

509
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,920
that only live a day but can send images.

510
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,750
Those little fireflies are impressive.

511
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,440
They even managed to gather intelligence on Sang Qi.

512
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,030
It's precisely because they spotted Sang Qi

513
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,820
[Temple of Divine Execution]

514
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,960
that something seems off.

515
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,240
Why?

516
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,400
Sang Qi's power is remarkable.

517
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,680
Even if he's injured,

518
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,030
he would have noticed

519
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,110
that the fireflies were spying on him.

520
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,200
Unless

521
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,880
Sang Qi is pretending.

522
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,400
He wants others to believe

523
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,590
he's gravely injured.

524
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,270
But why?

525
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,070
Because his true intentions remain unclear,

526
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,860
I went to the Temple of Divine Execution

527
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,110
as soon as my spiritual power returned.

528
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,350
If speculation doesn't work,

529
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,070
capturing and killing him directly

530
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,160
is the best solution.

531
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,830
It's a pity

532
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,240
I miscalculated the effects of Half-Day Glory.

533
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,780
I didn't expect my spiritual power

534
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,920
to only last for an hour.

535
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,680
Xie Xuechen,

536
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,550
did you realize you were gambling with your life?

537
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,310
What if you had died in the Dark Abyss?

538
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,720
Then it would've just been a life lost.

539
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,040
At least the Immortals Array has been repaired.

540
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,750
"The path of a sword cultivator

541
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,700
isn't one that lasts long."

542
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,440
Now, I believe this saying.

543
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,680
Xuyue,

544
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,310
there's something else I find odd.

545
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,750
How did Sang Qi obtain the Illusion Elixir?

546
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,680
The Illusion Elixir?

547
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,370
Six thousand years ago,

548
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,580
when Phoenix Mountain collapsed,

549
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,920
the Phoenix Herb necessary for the elixir

550
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,550
was wiped out overnight.

551
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,520
How could anyone

552
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,680
still make the Illusion Elixir?

553
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:32,960
Xuyue,

554
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,640
I have a faint feeling

555
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,440
that the crack in the Immortals Array

556
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,400
is just the beginning.

557
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,270
Behind all this,

558
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,590
someone is planning a grand scheme.

559
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,200
With so many unanswered mysteries,

560
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,550
have you considered

561
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,160
using Miss Mu to uncover the truth?

562
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:03,880
I have.

563
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,400
I guessed it.

564
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,750
If you didn't want to,

565
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,590
how could she have possibly threatened you?

566
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,110
It's because you want to figure out

567
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,920
what kind of person she is,

568
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,350
what her true intentions are,

569
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,030
and why she's so obsessed with you.

570
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,360
Am I right?

571
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,050
Yes.

572
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,790
I even thought about using her

573
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,030
to deal with the Dark Abyss and Sang Qi.

574
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,680
But then you trapped her in the Shackle of Delicacy

575
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,110
and chose to part ways with her.

576
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,000
Did you change your mind?

577
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,830
Using a woman to investigate

578
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,070
goes against my faith.

579
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,640
Besides,

580
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,480
she's a clever person.

581
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,480
If I use her to investigate Sang Qi and the Dark Abyss,

582
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,790
she'll use me to spy on the Immortal Alliance too.

583
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,750
Who benefits more

584
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,480
remains to be seen.

585
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,110
Yet earlier,

586
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,310
you still went back to find her,

587
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,350
didn't you?

588
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,920
You trapped her in the Shackle of Delicacy

589
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,010
and then headed here first.

590
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,550
Logically, you should've arrived before her,

591
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,310
but you arrived late.

592
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,550
And seeing her here,

593
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,830
you weren't surprised at all.

594
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,240
You just asked

595
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,790
why I brought her here.

596
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,200
That means you already went back

597
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,960
and knew that I had unlocked the Shackle of Delicacy,

598
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,030
right?

599
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,480
The Spirit Detector is still glowing.

600
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,290
There must be a Spirit Clan member nearby. Check carefully!

601
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:23,960
Understood!

602
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,560
Look in those bushes over there!

603
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,500
The Spirit Management Bureau...

604
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,520
My mother said that if you go there,

605
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,790
they'll put a Spirit Lock on you,

606
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,880
enslaving you under human control

607
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,920
for the rest of your life.

608
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,070
But if you don't register with them,

609
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,720
you won't be recognized as a good demon.

610
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,160
And regardless of whether you're good or evil,

611
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,200
others can kill you without consequence.

612
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,200
Mu Xuanling is a Spirit Clan member.

Xuyue...

622
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,480
Xuyue,

623
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,440
she said she wants to turn over a new leaf

624
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,750
and start fresh.

625
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,030
Do you believe her?

626
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,830
You neither dare to trust her

627
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,310
nor have the heart to kill her.

628
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,310
Then do as you think best.

629
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,600
Find out for yourself

630
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,920
what kind of person she really is

631
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,510
and what she truly intends to do.

632
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,930
Bao.

633
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,240
As for me,

634
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,350
I have important matters to attend to.

635
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,260
The road ahead won't be safe,

636
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,280
and the cultivation techniques I practice

637
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,140
aren't ones you can learn.

638
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,900
Once Xie Xuechen and I leave,

639
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,270
you should head home too.

640
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,510
If you're determined to find your father,

641
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,200
you can ask Nan Xuyue to help you.

642
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,310
It's the same, isn't it?

643
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,200
But I like you,

644
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,270
and I want to stay with you.

645
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Looks like I need to tell you the truth.

646
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,110
I'm

647
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,640
a villain from the Dark Abyss,

648
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,400
specializing in eating little beasts like you that wander alone.

649
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,240
Fried, stir-fried, steamed, boiled,

650
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,480
grilled, or roasted...

651
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,510
there are countless ways

652
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,270
to cook you!

653
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,440
I know you're not bad.

654
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,750
I can feel it.

655
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,830
Besides,

656
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,480
you have treasures on you.

657
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,830
I can absorb

658
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,110
their aura to cultivate.

659
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,110
It won't take up your time to teach me.

660
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,480
Don't think this will make me agree.

661
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,140
After Greenview Heights,

662
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,510
let's part ways.

663
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,800
Mr. Xie told you not to follow him,

664
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,290
but you didn't listen either.

665
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,000
I...

666
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,520
You're so young,

667
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,880
yet your tongue is quite sharp.

668
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,920
Miss Mu,

669
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,550
you're clearly mad at Mr. Xie,

670
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,750
so why are you looking for him?

671
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,960
Is it for revenge?

672
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,000
I've spoiled him too much before.

673
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,720
When I get the chance,

674
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,030
I'll definitely make him...

675
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,750
like this...

676
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,640
and like that...

677
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,030
What exactly is "this and that"?

678
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,000
Kid,

679
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,160
don't ask too many questions.

680
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,510
Actually, Xie Xuechen isn't bad.

681
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,790
But after all, we're on opposite sides, good and evil.

682
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,270
I keep bothering him.

683
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,110
So for someone as aloof and upright as he is,

684
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,790
it's normal for him

685
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,200
to not accept it at first.

686
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,550
Miss Mu,

687
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,590
what you're saying sounds so familiar.

688
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,410
It's just

689
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,300
like how my mother complains about my father

690
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,300
never coming back.

691
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,660
And then later,

692
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,880
she'd explain, saying,

693
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,680
"Your father

694
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,350
must've run into some trouble

695
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,960
and can't come back for now."

696
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:14,960
Miss Mu,

697
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,030
you said back in the Shackle of Delicacy

698
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,240
that you had something very important

699
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,510
that you didn't tell Mr. Xie.

700
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,400
What is it?

701
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:25,780
Bao,

702
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,980
let me ask you a question.

703
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,050
Do you believe

704
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,480
in coming back to life?

705
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,790
My mother says,

706
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,750
except for the Dark Clan, who don't die,

707
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,270
Spirits and Humans

708
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,440
are simply dead when they die.

709
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,590
Dead is dead?

710
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,640
To come back to life,

711
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,240
it would take a miracle.

712
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,920
But the Divine Clan abandoned Humans long ago.

713
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,790
Even the Celestial Ladder is closed.

714
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,070
There hasn't been a Deity in the world for thousands of years.

715
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,240
So, where would a miracle come from?

716
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,720
That's why

717
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,480
my mother says

718
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,670
to protect your own life,

719
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,590
because you only get one.

720
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,780
It's not shameful to be a coward

721
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,710
if it keeps you alive.

722
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,670
Your swordsmanship is powerful.

723
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,070
[Powerful swordsmanship]
Your array mastery is powerful.

724
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,070
[Powerful array mastery and powerful skills to annoy others]

725
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,440
Your skills to annoy others is powerful too.

726
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
Seems like it went smoothly.

727
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,940
The Half-Day Glory

728
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,840
leaves you powerless for ten days.

729
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,650
Only after those ten days

730
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,810
will you start to regain power.

731
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,510
But these runes work differently.

732
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,760
Starting now,

733
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,920
you'll recover a little power each day.

734
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,550
If you maintain proper meditation,

735
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,860
you'll

736
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,440
regain full strength in five days.

737
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,630
Xuyue,

738
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:37,960
thank you.

739
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,550
No need to thank me.

740
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,220
Just take better care of your life,

741
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,540
and I'll be satisfied.

742
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,220
Sir, something's happened!

743
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,370
Miss Gao,

744
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,120
what's up?

745
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,050
Mr. Nan,

746
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,590
we've encountered...

747
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,510
Mr. Xie...

748
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,280
The Mirage Palace received word

749
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,400
that you repaired the Immortals Array

750
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,400
but have yet to return.

751
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,400
I specifically brought people to look for you,

752
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,760
and here you are.

753
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,190
Mr. Xie, are you well?

754
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,440
We'll discuss my matters later.

755
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,540
Did something happen to you?

756
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,370
My fellow disciples and I

757
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,570
were attacked by demonic cultivators

758
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,840
at a nearby staging post.

759
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,230
We barely escaped,

760
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,360
but on our way back to the Mirage Palace,

761
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,590
we were ambushed again.

762
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,280
It must've been those demonic cultivators' allies.

763
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,030
Mr. Nan,

764
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,320
two of my junior brothers are dead,

765
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,110
and I was separated from my junior sister.

766
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,150
I remembered Greenview Heights was nearby,

767
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,630
so I came seeking aid.

768
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,080
Mr. Nan, could you send someone

769
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,740
to rescue my junior sister, Cui Wanwan?

770
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
Rest assured, Miss Gao.

771
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,280
It's fortuitous that Mr. Xie is here.

772
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,190
My master has a message for you.

773
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,280
Shall we go somewhere private to talk?

774
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,150
Alright.

775
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,880
No need!

776
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,400
Miss Gao is already injured

777
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,230
and should not move around.

778
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,360
You can speak here instead.

779
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,320
I'll go

780
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,030
prepare a room for you, Miss Gao.

781
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,360
What message

782
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
did your master leave for me?

783
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,230
My master said

784
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,550
that over the past six thousand years,

785
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,670
the Immortals Array has developed cracks multiple times.

786
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,230
Repairing the barrier

787
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,190
is the responsibility of successive Alliance Leaders.

788
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,530
This time, since Alliance Leader Xie is in seclusion,

789
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,800
the task fell to the strongest in the Alliance,

790
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,030
you, Mr. Xie.

791
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,190
Not only are you the most capable,

792
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,550
but your sense of duty is unmatched.

793
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,940
If you were to succeed the position of Alliance Leader,

794
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,840
the Immortal Alliance would thrive even further.

795
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,710
So,

796
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,630
someone like you...

797
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,190
if not dealt with early,

798
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,800
will inevitably become a major threat!

799
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,670
Being squeezed into such a small body

800
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,150
is really uncomfortable!

801
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,280
The protective barrier of Greenview Heights

802
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,920
is quite impressive.

803
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,320
If not for this method,

804
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,710
I wouldn't have been able to get in!

805
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,190
Xie Xuechen,

806
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,000
it's been two days,

807
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,030
and I still want to kill you just as much.

808
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,000
You think you can?

809
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:52,670
Miss Mu!

810
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:53,480
I feel

811
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,400
something scary has entered!

812
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,980
Stay inside the room.

813
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,720
Don't go out.

814
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,460
You killed Desire Demon, didn't you?

815
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,630
Alright then,

816
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,900
let me take

817
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,710
your head back

818
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,630
to calm her down!

819
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,320
You shouldn't have come here.

820
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,670
What, are you afraid I'll die?

821
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,140
Could you not flirt in front of me?

822
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,550
Anger Demon, listen to me.

823
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,880
What happened before

824
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,190
isn't what you think.

825
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,710
I...

826
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,230
I'm not listening!

827
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,610
Before I came,

828
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,920
Desire Demon and Ignorance Demon warned me about you.

829
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,360
They said

830
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,880
you're the most two-faced and deceitful person,

831
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,280
and I shouldn't believe a word you say!

832
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,690
That's not true!

833
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,920
Don't listen to their nonsense.

834
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,150
My character

835
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,670
is the most genuine and trustworthy.

836
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,280
Your spiritual power hasn't recovered yet.

837
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,630
I'll try to hold him off.

838
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,630
You should run first.

839
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,300
I hate it the most when people whisper

840
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,340
in front of me!
