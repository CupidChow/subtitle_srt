[Episode 20]

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,150
The most fierce sword energy

19
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,230
is not about ruthless.

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,920
It's sentimental.

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,950
The energy of Hongmeng shredded chaos

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,150
and created yin and yang, sky an earth.

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,000
That is the most astonishing energy

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
that has ever seen since the world was born.

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,310
But it is

26
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,590
not for destroying.

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,280

Ningxi.

48
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,450
Where is she?

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,040
When you attacked Moonlight Heights,

50
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,510
I buried her in the Starfall Valley

51
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,120
to protect her remains.

52
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,750
I never had the courage to visit her.

53
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,890
I've hated you for 20 years,

54
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,950
and I just realized today

55
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,430
that we both loved her deeply.

56
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,190
But you deserve to see her

57
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,800
one last time more than me.

58
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,270
She lies

59
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,390
under the nameless tomb.

60
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,000
Master.

61
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,480
Master.

62
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:22,920
Master.

63
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,600
Master, don't scare me like that.

64
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,040
Master, you are fine, right?

65
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,950
I'll return your spiritual power to you, Master.

66
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,830
Master. Here's your spiritual power.

67
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,560
Master.

68
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,950
It won't work.

69
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,190
Master.

70
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,830
I've run out of spiritual power

71
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,120
and my spiritual channel has lost vigor.

72
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,000
Being able to transfer

73
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,870
all my power to you before I die

74
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,360
gives my death meaning.

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,270
I don't want it, Master.

76
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,270
I don't want any of that.

77
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,720
I just want you to be with me.

78
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Qiumin.

79
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,950
Keep it close.

80
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,950
The Hossu Sword

81
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,190
is a heritage of Mirage Palace.

82
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,720
It's yours now.

83
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,510
Don't let my hopes for you be in vain.

84
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,720
I don't want it, Master.

85
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,220
Master. I don't want it.

86
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,160
I don't want anything.

87
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,240
Please stay with me.

88
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,160
I'm not mature enough.

89
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,000
I need your guidance.

90
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,360
Give it to me

91
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,750
when I'm qualified.

92
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,870
Silly girl.

93
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,720
People have to grow up.

94
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,600
Promise me

95
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,800
that no matter what happens,

96
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,480
hold it tight.

97
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,600
I don't want it, Master.

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,480
I just want you to be well.

99
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,560
You can't leave.

100
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,070
Ningxi,

101
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,920
are you here to pick me up?

102
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,160
I was wrong.

103
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,510
Will you forgive me, Ningxi?

104
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,560
Don't be afraid.

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
I will protect you forever.

106
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,430
We will never be apart.

107
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,950
Master.

108
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,870
Master.

109
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,120
Master.

110
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,120
Master.

111
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,720
Master.

112
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,750
Ningxi.

113
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,200
Let's go home.

114
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,630
How is she?

115
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
She will live.

116
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,440
It won't be long before she wakes up.

117
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,390
But your condition…

118
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,630
Nan Xuyue.

119
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,720
I'll ask you again.

120
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
What is affecting her

121
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,320
other than Heartstring?

122
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,440
The Disillusion Water.

123
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,440
It makes people forget love and hatred.

124
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,120
So, that's the secret you told me about?

125
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,120
You can see that her temperament is twisted

126
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,320
and all she thinks about is serving evil.

127
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,600
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

128
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,720
How do you know that she didn't drink it willingly?

129
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,240
How do you that she wasn't trying to forget you?

130
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,550
For the whole time,

131
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,550
hasn't she gone through enough pain

132
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,120
for you?

133
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
What if she just wanted to be free?

134
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,120
Let me tell you the answer.

135
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,270
She never wanted to forget you.

136
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,720
She doesn't remember that she drank the Disillusion Water.

137
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,030
All she remembers is that she works for Sang Qi.

138
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,200
That means her memories were tampered with.

139
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,080
The reason why she keeps feeling

140
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,030
the heartache

141
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,320
is because the Disillusion Water

142
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,030
can make people deny sentiments,

143
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,150
but not remove them completely.

144
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,480
Each time she feels the heartache

145
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,360
is the proof that she loves you.

146
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,000
That's also why I'm jealous of you.

147
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,750
In that case,

148
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,460
why are you telling me this now?

149
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,510
I just don't want to become a hateful person

150
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
that even I, myself, would despise.

151
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,750
She's training in the path of sentiments,

152
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,960
yet the Disillusion Water is of the path of detachment.

153
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,030
The medicine

154
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,320
is conflicting with her faith.

155
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
That means

156
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,550
the stronger she is,

157
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,670
the more dangerous her situation is.

158
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,600
To save her,

159
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,720
we have to detoxify the Disillusion Water.

160
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,550
It sounds like

161
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,120
you know how to undo it.

162
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,510
There is one thing

163
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,150
that counters the Disillusion Water.

164
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,120
What is it?

165
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,870
Lotus of Life.

166
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,240
It grows on the Ethereal Jade Island,

167
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,550
in the Waterless Land

168
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,390
of the Phoenix Perch Forest of the Dark Cloud Mountain.

169
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,200
It will be found by Disillusion Grass.

170
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,600
Disillusion Grass

171
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,840
can make people numb people's sense of sentiments and desires.

172
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,550
The seeds of the Lotus of Life

173
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,390
are the most bitter thing in the world.

174
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,240
Two plants grow together and counter each other.

175
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,030
The bitterness of the seeds of the Lotus of Life

176
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,600
can detoxify the Disillusion Grass.

177
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,000
I will take her

178
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,960
to Dark Cloud Mountain when she wakes up.

179
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,720
One more thing,

180
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,670
don't tell her about this just yet.

181
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,000
The Disillusion Water is still working,

182
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,480
so even if she wakes up,

183
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,360
she's still unsentimental

184
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,600
and hostile toward you.

185
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,870
The more you say,

186
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,840
the more defensive she gets,

187
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
making it even harder to cure her.

188
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,240
Nan Xuyue.

189
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,630
I suddenly realized

190
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,840
that I don't know you that well.

191
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,030
I told you.

192
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,790
Ten years have passed.

193
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,510
People change.

194
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,440
So, it wasn't just me

195
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,270
who changed over the last ten years.

196
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,670
You've changed as well.

197
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,030
Everyone

198
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,600
and everything changed.

199
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,910
Nothing remains constant in this world.

200
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,910
For example,

201
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,480
I told you the truth today,

202
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,720
but that doesn't mean I gave her up.

203
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
If I want to fight with you over her,

204
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,270
what are you going to do?

205
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,390
You don't have the chance anymore.

206
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,150
I will keep her close.

207
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,120
I hope you will.

208
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:25,580
[Mirage Palace]

209
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,150
Excuse me.

210
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,080
Where is Gao Qiumin?

211
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,000
After the funeral,

212
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,320
fellow sect members asked Miss Gao

213
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,200
to go to the main hall

214
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,630
for important business.

215
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,240
Over there.

216
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,670
How dare you sit on the leader's chair.

217
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Gao Qiumin, your behaviors are not up to the code of the sect.

218
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,360
Everyone in Mirage Palace

219
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,080
has complained about you over the years.

220
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,960
We will never accept you

221
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,840
as the madam.

222
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,510
Do you all agree with that?

223
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,390
Gao Qiumin.

224
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,870
Since we are already in this situation,

225
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,870
I'll be straight with you.

226
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,150
We are no boot-lickers.

227
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,670
Our master

228
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,320
is a relative to you.

229
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,120
She favored you and spoke for you all the time.

230
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,790
If we offend you,

231
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,320
there will be severe punishment.

232
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,390
We were brought to heel by the situation.

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,720
Our master

234
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,270
has passed away.

235
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,270
Things should return to how they are supposed to be.

236
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,480
Someone like you

237
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,630
cannot be the leader of Mirage Palace.

238
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,270
Every word you say sounds righteous.

239
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,930
Yet it's nothing but an excuse

240
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,310
for trying to steal this position.

241
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,160
Madam Su has just left us,

242
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,590
and you are already trying to bring a fellow member down.

243
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,480
Mr. Fu.

244
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,000
You haven't known

245
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,270
Gao Qiumin for long.

246
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,310
How can you know what she's like?

247
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,920
I know she's a good person.

248
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,880
As a member of the Jade Sky Palace,

249
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,750
I shouldn't get involved in Mirage Palace's affair.

250
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,880
However, as Miss Gao's friend,

251
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,110
I'd like to ask you

252
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,400
do you truly not know

253
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,590
who she truly is

254
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,110
after so many years together with her?

255
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,960
Is her arrogance all you remember,

256
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,440
but all her changes are neglected?

257
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,830
Has she never helped you

258
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,000
and put in her efforts for you?

259
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,720
Mr. Fu.

260
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,830
You are our guest,

261
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,310
and that's all you are.

262
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,200
If you meddle with Mirage Palace's internal affairs,

263
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
we'll have to ask you to leave.

264
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:53,830
Enough!

265
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,480
I, Gao Qiumin, have never begged anyone.

266
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,310
I'm not interested in being the madam as well.

267
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,640
You can choose

268
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,160
a qualified leader for Mirage Palace

269
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,310
as you wish.

270
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,480
Let's go.

271
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,830
You know

272
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,830
that they said all those things

273
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,750
for the power.

274
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,270
[Su Ningzhen, the Ninth Madam of Mirage Palace]

275
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:24,830
It's okay.

276
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,110
I know

277
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,920
that I'm unpredictable,

278
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,030
overbearing,

279
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,590
and always a bully.

280
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,440
That's not true.

281
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,110
You are kind in your nature.

282
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,480
You are always helping the weak.

283
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,200
Who are you referring to?

284
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,270
Me.

285
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,480
How are you weak?

286
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,640
I am not good enough.

287
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,480
It's just that I thought

288
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,750
they were forgiving

289
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,030
because we are a family.

290
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,790
Maybe I don't know

291
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,200
how to treat my family.

292
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,070
All my relatives

293
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,030
have bad tempers.

294
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,160
So do I.

295
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,590
Whether I was in Moonlight Heights or Mirage Palace,

296
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,000
people have always

297
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,110
criticized me

298
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,270
for not being smart enough

299
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,160
or powerful enough.

300
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,270
I've always let them down.

301
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,070
I understand it now.

302
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,490
Their spoiling

303
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,920
and help

304
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,110
were because I was a…

305
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,000
I…

306
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,240
Never mind.

307
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,640
No one truly likes me

308
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,920
in this world.

309
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,350
You don't know how to get along with people

310
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,010
because you were never

311
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,310
been treated well.

312
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,480
That is not your fault.

313
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,400
Why not forgive yourself?

314
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,160
You just have to stop being annoying.

315
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,960
Anyway,

316
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,830
I think of you as a friend.

317
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,030
It has nothing to do with your status.

318
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,550
Honestly.

319
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,440
Even if you are the old self.

320
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,640
If those people say mean things to you again,

321
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,790
I will say things back!

322
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,200
There.

323
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,200
Don't cry.

324
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,070
Do you want a friendly hug?

325
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,550
No!

326
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,640
Miss Gao.

327
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,790
Come with me to Jade Sky Palace.

328
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,790
Fu Lansheng,

329
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,350
even if I can't stay in Mirage Palace,

330
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,450
I'm not homeless.

331
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,680
I don't need your pity.

332
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,310
I'm not pitying you.

333
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,960
Isn't it common to invite a friend

334
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,110
to visit my home?

335
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,240
Is it?

336
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,270
Of course!

337
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,030
Besides, Jade Sky Palace is a huge place.

338
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,790
You can make yourself at home there.

339
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,750
I don't mind sharing it with you.

340
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,200
No need

341
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,830
to share it with me.

342
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,550
But

343
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,160
visiting your home

344
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
is in the picture.

345
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:39,920
So,

346
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,070
we have an agreement.

347
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,920
Miss Gao.

348
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,070
Mr. Xie.

349
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,480
Miss Gao,

350
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,200
I need to

351
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,070
talk with you in private.

352
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,510
Do you need me to help you

353
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,510
with things in Mirage Palace?

354
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,000
No.

355
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,590
They don't like me

356
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,270
and I don't like them either.

357
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,510
They can fight for the leadership

358
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,350
of Mirage Palace however they want.

359
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't want it.

360
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,270
If you need,

361
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,400
you can come to Snow City.

362
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,720
That's not necessary.

363
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,270
Now you know that Mu Xuanling is the Chaos Pearl,

364
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,200
there's more reason for you to protect her.

365
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,440
If I'm in Snow City,

366
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,850
she'd be annoyed seeing me,

367
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,880
and vice versa.

368
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,590
I'm a liability to you anyway.

369
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,030
About the fact that Mu Xuanling is the Chaos Pearl,

370
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,480
only herself,

371
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,720
you,

372
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,830
me, and Sang Qi know about it.

373
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,240
I was thinking

374
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
if you'd tell

375
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,200
others about it.

376
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,510
Now I know

377
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,790
that you won't.

378
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,720
I will.

379
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,980
I… I didn't say anything because

380
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,640
I want something on her

381
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,890
so that when she sees me,

382
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,920
she'd be scared.

383
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,640
Those who say stubborn words

384
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,110
have the most tender heart.

385
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,270
My heart is nothing tender.

386
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,590
Anyway,

387
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,880
thank you.

388
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,750
I can't open the barrier.

389
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,960
Just get in.

390
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,790
You are sneaking into my room

391
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,160
behind Xie Xuechen's back again.

392
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,070
Do you have news for me?

393
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,550
Sang Qi went back to the Dark Abyss.

394
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,030
I heard that the gate to the Temple of Divine Execution has been closed since,

395
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,310
and he never showed his face after.

396
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,270
I'm surprised to learn

397
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,960
that Su Ningxi is the reason Sang Qi hates humanity so much.

398
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,110
That's good.

399
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,000
Now that he's with Su Ningxi all day long,

400
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,160
it would be less trouble for the Immortal Alliance.

401
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,590
It's just that Mirage Palace

402
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,680
has suffered a great loss.

403
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,030
What a pity.

404
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,200
If we see things that way,

405
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,310
their scheme

406
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,790
ruined my master's life.

407
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,310
Everyone was just getting their vengeance.

408
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,160
No one owes the other side anything.

409
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,680
I know

410
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,350
you hate people who discriminate

411
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,350
the Spirit Clan.

412
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,480
But you were not a person

413
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,070
who'd be blinded by hatred.

414
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,400
I also know

415
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,400
that you must be having

416
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,960
mixed feelings right now.

417
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,720
Don't worry.

418
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,480
Things will be

419
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
clear soon.

420
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,550
What do you mean?

421
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,070
This jade token

422
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,030
in scripted with my defense array.

423
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,110
If you are ever in danger,

424
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,310
this can take impact for you

425
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,160
even when facing the Ultimate Jade Vault Technique.

426
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,440
This is an unparalleled artifact.

427
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,310
You are just giving it to me like that?

428
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,200
It's just a piece of artifact.

429
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,680
There's nothing "unparalleled" about it.

430
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,400
It's worth something only when it can

431
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,920
offer protection to the one I care about.

432
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,550
Just keep it.

433
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,030
Go.

434
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,510
This time,

435
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,680
I'm going to give them a piece of my mind

436
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,240
regarding the food in the ice prison.

437
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,400
I'm not taking you to the prison.

438
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,000
Where to?

439
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,540
[Ethereal Jade Island]

440
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,160
Xie Xuechen.

441
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,790
Why did you

442
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,200
bring me to the Ethereal Jade Island?

443
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,270
This is on the route to the Dark Cloud Mountain.

444
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,030
What are we doing there?

445
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,680
To find a flower.

446
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,590
What flower?

447
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,960
The Lotus of Life.

448
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,880
Mr. Xie, are you already thinking about immortality

449
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,480
at such a young age?

450
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,720
Don't tell her about this just yet.

451
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,000
The Disillusion Water is still working,

452
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,510
so even if she wakes up,

453
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,350
telling her will make her more defensive,

454
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,790
making it even harder to cure her.

455
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,920
Yes.

456
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,400
Why are you bringing me?

457
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,720
Who knows

458
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,160
where are you going to run off to?

459
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,880
The Ethereal Jade Island is a territory of the Spirit Clan.

460
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,240
The Spirit Clan of the East Sea is disobedient

461
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,440
and rough.

462
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,790
Don't go poke them.

463
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,110
We'll get back right after getting the Lotus of Life.

464
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,350
If you get yourself in trouble,

465
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,310
you will deal with it.

466
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,240
If I call you

467
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,640
Mr. Xie here,

468
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,720
will the lords of the Spirit Clan

469
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,070
swarm in here

470
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:21,790
to kill you?

471
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
They don't have the nerve.

472
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,160
And they are not capable.

473
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,640
Mr. Xie is always so confident.

474
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,510
I'm trying to cover up my sword energy

475
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
to keep a low key.

476
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,880
You are the problem.

477
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,480
Don't bring trouble to the Spirit Clan of the East Sea.

478
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,240
Are you hungry?

479
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,310
No.

480
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,830
Please enjoy. Here.

481
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:47,880
Thank you.

482
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,680
What are you looking at?

483
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,480
Eat.

484
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,200
Members of the Spirit Clan are better than human beings.

485
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,830
They are not hypocrites.

486
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,000
They are showing their figure generously,

487
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,830
and I'm showing my appreciation.

488
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,200
What's wrong with that?

489
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,510
Let's talk about you.

490
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,830
Which one do you prefer?

491
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,110
The sweet rabbit girl

492
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,350
or the pretty Serpent Spirit?

493
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,920
Don't worry.

494
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,790
We are far from Snow City.

495
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,920
You can fool around a little.

496
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,030
I will keep your secrets.

497
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,030
What do you say?

498
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,030
There's nothing wrong with keeping quiet.

499
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Dark Cloud Mountain is a dangerous place

500
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,590
after dark.

501
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,720
Finish food

502
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,920
and rest.

503
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,510
We will be on the road early in the morning.

504
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,750
Come.

505
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,830
Human cultivator,

506
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,070
do you need a room for the night?

507
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,830
We are fully booked today.

508
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,880
But

509
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,970
I have a huge room

510
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,160
with a comfortable bed.

511
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,730
Cultivator,

512
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,480
do you want to stay with me?

513
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,680
It will be free.

514
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,680
Madam She,

515
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
you have set your eyes on a human being again.

516
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,510
Is there something wrong

517
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,590
with the Fox Clan?

518
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:55,920
You know,

519
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,310
I like descent and clean human beings.

520
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,590
They are not like fox spirits like you,

521
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,200
knowing no shame.

522
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,680
That's why we are a match.

523
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,550
Take a walk!

524
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,440
Girl, are you a couple

525
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,680
with this cultivator?

526
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,750
Yes.

527
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,270
Oh, you can't talk.

528
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,440
What a pity.

529
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,200
That's fine.

530
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,330
My place

531
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,000
is not playground

532
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,350
for you.

533
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,310
You can leave,

534
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,680
but you will have to leave your shrinking pocket here.

535
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,200
The Spirit Clan of the East Sea has passed its prime time.

536
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,240
A tiny snake can rule a land.

537
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,270
Cultivator,

538
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,550
if you can accept this member of the Spirit Clan,

539
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,960
why not me?

540
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,720
That's okay.

541
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,070
I don't mind that you are a human being.

542
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,920
I can enjoy you all the same.

543
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,640
Can you stop talking?

544
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,200
This one is not for you to mess with.

545
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,480
You deal with her.

546
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,640
Why not do it yourself?

547
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,110
You are more than sufficient

548
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,830
to deal with a tiny serpent.

549
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,750
Or

550
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,110
do you want to keep being mute?

551
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,270
I'll do it!

552
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,350
So, you…

553
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,160
Charge!

554
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,200
Wait!

555
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,550
The Spirit Clan

556
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,200
worships power.

557
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,160
I was being stupid to offend you.

558
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,240
Quick.

559
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,720
Prepare a top-notch room.

560
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,240
Two rooms.

561
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,510
One room.

562
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,200
It will be too small for two people.

563
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,880
No, it won't.

564
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,400
Our top-notch room

565
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,590
is really big.

566
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,270
You won't find it too small.

567
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,030
Come with me.

568
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,960
I have questions.

569
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,920
You have quite the freedom with your actions.

570
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,510
You must have been running this place for long.

571
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,310
Do you know about a place called

572
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,350
Phoenix Perch Forest in the Dark Cloud Mountain?

573
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,070
What are they doing there?

574
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,570
That place is covered in miasma,

575
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,480
and is full of rare animals.

576
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,550
Among them, some cause death,

577
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,550
and some cause illusion.

578
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,830
They are quite brutal.

579
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,570
No one dared to travel there in years.

580
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,420
Get me a map.

581
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
All right. Leave it to me.

582
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,400
Waiter!

583
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,160
Yes.

584
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,240
This way, please.

585
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,200
Please.

586
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:52,750
Madam She,

587
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,000
why are you doing his bid

588
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,160
after getting hit by them?

589
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,830
Are you really in love with him?

590
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,240
You don't get it.

591
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,400
Snakes

592
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,720
knows when to bow and when to stand up.

593
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,030
I should have been more cautious.

594
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,680
I thought that was just a common cultivator in the golden essence stage.

595
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,160
He caught a girl from the Spirit Clan and was hiding here.

596
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,880
Who would have thought

597
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,350
that he's a master in the spiritual form level?

598
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,260
That the Serpent Spirit

599
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,510
was so vulnerable.

600
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,960
[Waterless Land]
Maybe I'm just too good.

601
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,420
[Gigantic Stone]

602
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,830
Do you really think so?

603
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,030
Are you saying

604
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,830
that I'm not good?

605
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,510
You said it.

606
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,070
I didn't say anything.

607
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,830
Why didn't I just kill you

608
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,400
when we were in the Lava?

609
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,160
As I recall it, you said

610
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:52,920
that you like me too much to do that.

611
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,830
You can take the bed.

612
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,830
I'll just meditate here.

613
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,550
I'm a prisoner.

614
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,510
How can I take the bed?

615
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,230
I would be grateful

616
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,960
if given a chair.

617
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,190
You know that you are a prisoner.

618
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,230
You should behave.

619
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,000
Is this your payback?

620
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,030
I pulled your leg

621
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,800
when your spiritual channel

622
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,000
was sealed off,

623
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,400
and now you are

624
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,960
getting back at me even worse.

625
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,440
I can't believe that the leader of the Immortal Alliance

626
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,800
is such a vindictive person.

627
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,400
Is that how you see me?

628
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,670
Or what?

629
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,190
Am I wrong?

630
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,440
Do you remember

631
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,760
what you did to me?

632
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,920
So,

633
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,360
do you want me to pay you back

634
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
and be vindictive for that?

635
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:08,920
Or

636
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,710
you would just behave.

637
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,670
I don't need you to pay me back.

638
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,400
I'll go to bed.

639
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,630
You are the lofty leader of Snow City

640
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,880
and the Immortal Alliance.

641
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,710
You carry the justice of the world on your shoulders.

642
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,670
Why waste your energy on me?

643
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,710
If you feel offended about my intrusion

644
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,550
when we first met,

645
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,360
I apologize.

646
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,190
Please stop messing with me.

647
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,320
What is he doing here?

648
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,880
Is he really here

649
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,320
for the medicine of immortality?

650
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,710
Nan Xuyue gave me the jade token before this trip.

651
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,440
Is it because

652
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,800
he knew where Xie Xuechen

653
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
would be taking me?

654
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,760
Are you having trouble falling asleep?

655
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,000
Have my behaviors recently

656
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,070
made you feel strange?

657
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,800
That's my fault.

658
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,840
But there's one thing that I should be clear about.

659
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,550
I have never tried to mess with you.

660
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,880
Not before,

661
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,150
not now.

662
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,510
Sure.

663
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,480
Mr. Xie is a decent man.

664
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,150
You are forgiving and generous.

665
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,760
I've been thinking too much.

666
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,070
Rest well, then.

667
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,280
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

668
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,030
Young Master.

669
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:27,670
Yes.

670
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,760
Father. Mother.

671
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,550
We are back.

672
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,840
I'm Gao Qiumin.

673
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,440
Nice to meet you, Mr. Fu, Elder Duan.

674
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,070
No need for such formality.

675
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:36,920
Sit, please.

676
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,230
I heard

677
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,440
that Madam Su left.

678
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,550
It happened so quickly

679
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,180
that we couldn't have gotten there in time to pay our condolence.

680
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,280
Please forgive us for that.

681
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Is everything okay in Mirage Palace?

682
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,630
Elder Duan, thank you for your concern.

683
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,440
Everything is well.

684
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,030
Speaking of which,

685
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,360
Miss Gao is Madam Su's direct disciple.

686
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,710
Now that she has passed away,

687
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,110
there must be a lot of things

688
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,030
to be taken care of in the palace.

689
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,030
How come you…

690
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,190
My seniors are taking care

691
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,800
of things in the palace.

692
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,070
Mother!

693
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,030
I was worried that Qiumin might be upset.

694
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,030
That's why I asked her to visit us.

695
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,360
Stop saying that.

696
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,510
In that case,

697
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,510
you should entertain our guests well.

698
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,070
Miss Gao.

699
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,280
Stay in Jade Sky Palace for some time.

700
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,400
You always work hard on your cultivation.

701
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,550
You might be a good influence

702
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,800
to Sheng.

703
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,510
Sheng,

704
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,880
this is the day

705
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,510
that the five business managers report their accounts.

706
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,710
Go deal with it.

707
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,000
Don't keep them waiting.

708
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,670
Am I right, Miss Gao?

709
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,800
We should let

710
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,460
Butler Huang

711
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,570
arrange a room in your yard

712
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,620
for Miss Gao to settle down.

713
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,800
All right. I'll take her to my yard first.

714
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,400
Come on.

715
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,800
The managers have been waiting for 2 hours now.

716
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,590
Go!

717
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,400
Don't let me keep you.

718
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,630
Please excuse me.

719
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,110
I'll go!

720
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,960
Elder Duan,

721
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,230
what was that about?

722
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,710
Honey!

723
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,670
Honey!

724
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,590
Honey,

725
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,550
didn't you try to set her up

726
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,480
with Sheng?

727
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,030
Why did you give her the cold shoulder today?

728
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,840
Gao Qiumin

729
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,320
has clearly lost power

730
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,230
and is abandoned by Mirage Palace.

731
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,320
So?

732
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,510
Are you abandoning her as well?

733
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,480
Abandon?

734
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,670
Even if she's not in a good place,

735
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,510
she's still from a prestigious family

736
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,480
and was born with nine apertures.

737
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,400
She's more than enough for our silly boy.

738
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
What are you thinking?

739
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,320
Abandon?

740
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,510
So, why the cold shoulder?

741
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,480
I heard

742
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,360
that the mother-in-law

743
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,510
has to show her daughter-in-law

744
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,360
some authority.

745
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,070
How did I do?

746
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,440
When has she ever agreed

747
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,920
to be your daughter-in-law?

748
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,360
What's not good about being my daughter?

749
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,610
Even if she wants the moon in the sky,

750
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,880
I'd still get it for her.

751
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,030
It should be up to her will!

752
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:08,840
Yes!

753
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,760
You did good!

754
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,720
- Our Young Master… - Try and get me!

755
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,110
- Stop there! - has always been good to the servants.

756
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,630
Stop running!

757
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,150
So,

758
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,710
- Got you! - the maids here are mercurial.

759
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,550
She beat me!

760
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,960
Who are you?

761
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,760
Are you also brought here by Young Master?

762
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,400
Where is he?

763
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,630
Are you Young Master's new friend?

764
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,070
You are stunning!

765
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,880
I agree with her.

766
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,840
You are so beautiful.

767
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,240
He has been

768
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,140
quite the playboy.

769
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,110
The accounts

770
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,400
are the most boring.

771
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,110
A few million tael

772
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,190
makes no difference

773
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,360
when put in

774
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,550
the general account.

775
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,360
Young Master, you are a blessed person.

776
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,230
Leave the trivial matters

777
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,460
to men who are not blessed

778
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,400
like us.

779
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,480
Mr. Zeng manages all the silk business.

780
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,150
If you are not blessed,

781
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,190
is there anyone in this world who is?

782
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,920
That would be you, Young Master.

783
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,670
I heard

784
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
that you came back

785
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,510
with a beautiful girl from Mirage Palace.

786
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,320
People say

787
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,590
that she was born with nine spiritual channels.

788
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,710
That makes us

789
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,000
envy you.

790
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,960
Yes.

791
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,510
You are quite resourceful.

792
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,320
I wonder what Miss Gao

793
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,760
is doing right now.

794
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,840
Is she fighting with people in my yard?

795
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,760
I need to head back and check things out.

796
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,510
I can't afford anyone to offend her.

797
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,150
Master.

798
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,860
Take care, Young Master.

799
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,110
Take care, Young Master.

800
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:45,670
Oh, right!

801
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,840
Thank you for your efforts lately.

802
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,880
That's okay.

803
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,230
No wonder the accounts

804
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,440
are not detailed enough.

805
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,360
You know what?

806
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,840
Mr. Wang will be

807
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,000
managing the silk business with you

808
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:57,920
in case

809
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:58,800
you don't have enough energy.

810
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,320
Yes.

811
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,150
Young Master.

812
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,440
Young Master was

813
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,510
quite timid when he was young.

814
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,360
A grasshopper

815
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,840
once got onto his foot,

816
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,770
and he just

817
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:08,630
stood still there

818
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,280
with tears running down his face.

819
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,070
He was so cute!

820
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:11,550
Really?

821
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:14,800
Your turn.

822
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,440
- That's nice. - So nice.

823
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,000
It's beautiful.

824
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,360
That's true.

825
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,720
Young Master.

826
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,320
Young Master.

827
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,150
- Young Master. - It took you long enough.

828
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,710
Why I'm hearing

829
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,480
bad things about me once I get back?

830
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,630
It's nothing.

831
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,190
We are one family.

832
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,590
One family.

833
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,880
We'll leave Young Master

834
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,110
and Qiumin to talk.

835
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:40,880
Please excuse us.

836
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,040
See you.

837
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,840
- See you. - Let's go!

838
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,840
- Come on. - Hurry up.

839
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,000
I thought you'd feel uncomfortable.

840
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,710
In such a short time,

841
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,150
you've joined the family.

842
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,480
Of course!

843
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,000
They are good to me.

844
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,800
I feel happy being with them.

845
00:42:59,320 --> 00:42:59,960
It's mainly because of

846
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,320
my beauty.

847
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,800
I am an outstanding person.

848
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,440
Yes.

849
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:07,630
That's true.

850
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,070
Ling Yan told me

851
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,190
that they are Spirit Clan members

852
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,230
saved by you.

853
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,040
They were nice to me

854
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,070
because you've always been nice to them.

855
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:19,670
Right?

856
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,230
Sort of.

857
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,630
Thank you.

858
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,360
Why are you thanking me?

859
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,110
My mother was weird,

860
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,110
yet you are not mad at me,

861
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,150
and I feel glad for that.

862
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,320
I won't.

863
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,480
You told me

864
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,480
that being a kind person

865
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,510
is kind.

866
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,960
Stop there!

867
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,400
You are being so nice all of a sudden.

868
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,960
I suspect that you

869
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,110
are possessed or something.

870
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,510
I'm living under your roof now.

871
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,510
I should say nice things.

872
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,920
Is this how you should be for living under my roof?

873
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,190
I'm living under your roof.

874
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,480
It's how things should be.
