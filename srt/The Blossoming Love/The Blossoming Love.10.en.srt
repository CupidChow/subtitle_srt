00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,630

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,400
Gao Qiumin,

35
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,800
you didn't do it on purpose.

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,030
Don't feel guilty.

37
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,120
Don't.

38
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,150
She's given her heart to someone

39
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,910
who doesn't value it.

40
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,750
Miss Gao is engaged to Mr. Xie,

41
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,240
yet Mr. Xie

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,680
seems to be entangled with Miss Mu.

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,590
What a mess.

44
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,430
Miss Gao.

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,710
I heard there was a Dark Clan sighting in the city,

46
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,150
so I came to help.

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,710
Are you all right,

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,120
Miss Gao?

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,630
The one she loves has fallen for someone else.

50
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,710
Of course she's not all right.

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
What a stupid question.

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,120
Did he see me

53
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,150
mistakenly helping the Dark Clan?

54
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,910
How embarrassing.

55
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,520
I can't let him spread this around.

56
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:27,910
No.

57
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,680
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Fu.

58
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,310
I didn't expect things

59
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,910
to turn out this way either.

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,430
Please don't mention this to anyone.

61
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,470
Of course she wouldn't want others to know

62
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,910
that her fiancé betrayed her.

63
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:44,870
Don't worry.

64
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,710
I won't.

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,680
My lips are sealed.

66
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,430
But perhaps you should also

67
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,080
ask Mr. Xie and Miss Mu

68
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,840
to keep a lower profile.

69
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,910
Is he suggesting

70
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,730
I find a way to silence

71
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,600
Mu Xuanling and Xie Xuechen?

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,590
I see your point, Mr. Fu.

73
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,750
Thank you for the advice.

74
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,680
I'm glad she understands.

75
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,560
It's impressive how she can

76
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,360
face something like this

77
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,600
without crying or causing a scene.

78
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,800
He ran away?

79
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,390
That can't be right.

80
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,720
If he had the strength,

81
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,190
he would've broken free long ago.

82
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,920
He wouldn't have been trapped by the curse for so long.

83
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,160
It seems

84
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,800
someone helped him escape.

85
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,830
My spiritual apertures are damaged.

86
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,630
I can't cultivate spiritual power.

87
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,120
I knew she couldn't cultivate spiritual power,

88
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,240
but I didn't realize she couldn't even absorb it.

89
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,600
It does hurt a lot.

90
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,240
How many years and how many times

91
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,240
have demonic power inflicted pain

92
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,800
on you?

93
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,510
You transferred the injury

94
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,830
caused by the curse to yourself?

95
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,920
Xie Xuechen,

96
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,430
I didn't give you that bracelet

97
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,560
for you to use it like that.

98
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,480
With the Jade Vault Technique protecting me,

99
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,830
I'll recover quickly.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,920
But she wouldn't be able to handle it.

101
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,180
I didn't expect you

102
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,920
to have a soft spot for someone.

103
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:43,920
What are

104
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,270
your true feelings for her?

105
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,630
I brought her to Snow City

106
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,040
and made her a disciple here.

107
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
It's my responsibility to protect her.

108
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,310
Is it just responsibility

109
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,920
or is it something more?

110
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,600
Take care of her for me.

111
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,750
She'd rather you stayed here.

112
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,390
But I

113
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,830
can't stay here just for her.

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,360
Isn't it exhausting falling

115
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,750
for someone like him?

116
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,440
Xuechen,

117
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,600
the Jade Vault Technique

118
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,870
may have fast healing effects,

119
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,670
but the injuries caused by the curse are severe,

120
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,670
and the pain is real.

121
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,630
Why did you

122
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,840
transfer them from Mu Xuanling

123
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,910
to yourself?

124
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,670
What do you think of her after watching her

125
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,790
these past few days?

126
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,630
She's rebellious

127
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,790
and doesn't follow the rules.

128
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,150
She's about to rack up ten demerits.

129
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,480
I don't think

130
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,030
she's fit to be a disciple of Snow City.

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,670
Hand me the demerit records.

132
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,440
[One demerit to Mu Xuanling for violating the rules]

133
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,340
[One demerit to Mu Xuanling for skipping a class]

134
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,800
[One demerit to Mu Xuanling for cooking without permission]

135
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,580
[One demerit to Mu Xuanling for violating the rules]

136
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:25,870
Xuechen,

137
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,790
what are you...?

138
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,600
I didn't ask you to watch her

139
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
just to record demerits.

140
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,630
Judge a person by their heart.

141
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,000
- But she's from the Spirit Clan. - That doesn't make her any different.

142
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,670
Perhaps starting with her,

143
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,440
the Immortal Alliance

144
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,200
will have more and more

145
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,120
Spirit Clan disciples.

146
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,440
Humans and spirits have been at odds for millennia.

147
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,840
What you're trying to do

148
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,630
won't be easy.

149
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,150
But it's possible,

150
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,120
isn't it?

151
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,030
It is.

152
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,840
The Dark Clan member in the city haven't been found yet.

153
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,000
Order a citywide search.

154
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,270
Leave no corner unchecked.

155
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:05,840
Understood.

156
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,670
Is this

157
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,000
Xie Xuechen's room?

158
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,240
Mu Xuanling!

159
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,200
Xie Xuechen,

160
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,270
it hurts.

161
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,240
I know.

162
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,750
So I was right.

163
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,120
It really was him

164
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,270
who carried me back.

165
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,870
So it takes a near-death experience

166
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,600
to get this kind of treatment.

167
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,600
Miss Mu,

168
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,360
what are you doing?

169
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,360
It's you.

170
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,550
Where is

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,630
Xie Xuechen?

172
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,030
The Dark Clan has infiltrated the city.

173
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,840
As the Lord of Snow City,

174
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,600
he has to deal with it.

175
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,550
He asked me to take care of you.

176
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,720
I thought you'd be upset

177
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,270
he wasn't here.

178
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,480
Why would I be upset?

179
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,080
I don't expect him

180
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
to stay by my side.

181
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,390
Where's Bao?

182
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,960
I sent her back to her quarters.

183
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,510
To avoid terrifying her,

184
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,670
I put her to sleep

185
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,960
with a Calming Spell.

186
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,060
I told her this journey

187
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,270
would be dangerous

188
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,510
and warned her not to follow me,

189
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,790
but she wouldn't listen.

190
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,790
Thank you.

191
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,320
The Xuantian Sect's Curse

192
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,390
isn't so terrible after all.

193
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,390
I barely feel any pain now.

194
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,320
You don't feel pain

195
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,150
because someone else is suffering it for you.

196
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,720
Xuechen transferred

197
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,550
all your injuries

198
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,840
onto himself.

199
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,630
My injuries

200
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,750
are mine to bear.

201
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,080
Who asked him to transfer them?

202
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,870
I'll go find him.

203
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,510
Your external wounds may have healed,

204
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,870
but the internal damage caused by the curse is still there.

205
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,150
You still need to rest.

206
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,360
Besides,

207
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,790
confronting him now

208
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,960
won't change anything.

209
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,720
I haven't repaid

210
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,000
what I owe him,

211
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,270
and now there's another debt.

212
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,750
Did he do it on purpose?

213
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,510
Oh well,

214
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,030
I'll repay the debts slowly.

215
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,440
Maybe this is the bond I need

216
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,320
to stay by his side forever.

217
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,030
Love

218
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,790
is truly powerful.

219
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,240
It can make you defy your instinct

220
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,750
to avoid harm and seek benefit.

221
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,670
Living

222
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,200
never meant much to me.

223
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,720
I never

224
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,150
saw death as a big loss.

225
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,320
After all,

226
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,080
no one really cared about me.

227
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,870
But in just one day,

228
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,270
he taught me

229
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,360
how to feel joy

230
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,750
and pain.

231
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,080
I won't let you get hurt again.

232
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,080
Never say it doesn't hurt again.

233
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,550
I'll take you away from here.

234
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,550
From now on, you'll see

235
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,120
dazzling fireworks at every Timekeeper Festival.

236
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,030
Everything will be all right

237
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,790
when you open your eyes.

238
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,840
He made me understand

239
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,910
the meaning of life and death.

240
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,840
Mister!

241
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,240
Though we spent only one day together,

242
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,270
it was enough to sustain me

243
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,870
through ten years

244
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,750
of darkness and pain

245
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,120
in the Dark Abyss.

246
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,000
It seems you're just

247
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,240
clinging to that one day.

248
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,960
But ten years have passed,

249
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,910
and he doesn't even remember it.

250
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,600
Do you care

251
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,790
about the man he is now,

252
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,120
or the man he was that day?

253
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,480
Are your feelings for him

254
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,200
gratitude or love?

255
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,080
What does it matter?

256
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,630
Either way, Xie Xuechen is the one.

257
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,440
That's all I need to know.

258
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,960
It's just like how you feel close to me

259
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,390
because

260
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,600
of a brief encounter in the past.

261
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:10,590
[Swirling Snow Pavilion]

262
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,790
She's devoted her life

263
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,030
and death to him.

264
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,640
How enviable.

265
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,680
It's a shame

266
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,960
we couldn't eliminate that Dark Clan member this time.

267
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,920
By the time Xuan Xin arrived,

268
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,310
he'd already disappeared.

269
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,830
Maybe

270
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,720
someone helped him escape.

271
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,920
Not necessarily.

272
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,480
It's possible that he

273
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,440
possessed someone in time

274
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,590
and avoided being cursed.

275
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,310
To escape the curse,

276
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,010
he would've had to

277
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,960
hide deep within the inner demons of a powerful cultivator.

278
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,160
Who could it be?

279
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,240
It could be a high-ranking disciple,

280
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,270
an elder,

281
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,510
or even a sect leader.

282
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,640
But the protective barrier around Snow City

283
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,640
didn't react at all.

284
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,590
How did he

285
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,880
infiltrate so silently?

286
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,310
No one-way array can breach

287
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,240
Snow City's protective barrier.

288
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,640
Unless

289
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,920
someone inside the city helped form

290
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,640
a two-way array,

291
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,440
there's no way he could have entered.

292
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,750
Are you saying

293
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,590
someone in the city

294
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,680
collaborated with him?

295
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,680
Do you have a way

296
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,200
to expose the Dark Clan member?

297
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,510
There is a way.

298
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,350
The Dark Clan relies on inner demons to possess others.

299
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,030
Xuantian Sect has techniques

300
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,920
to observe one's faith.

301
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,400
We could examine everyone

302
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,790
to identify those afflicted by inner demons.

303
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,640
Leave this to Xuan Xin.

304
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,440
He's always been

305
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,480
perceptive and sharp.

306
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,000
Then I'll entrust

307
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,640
this task to you, Xuan Xin.

308
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,070
But a full-scale investigation

309
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,510
might alert our target.

310
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,440
I'll use the Dark Clan infiltration as an excuse

311
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,110
to bring forward the Alliance Leader election

312
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,270
and gather everyone in the Hall of Integrity.

313
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,240
During the meeting,

314
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,440
you can discreetly observe

315
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,960
everyone's faith

316
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,790
to identify those with inner demons.

317
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,750
That sounds like a good plan.

318
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,790
Sir,

319
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,880
I'd like to discuss

320
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,790
the task further with Mr. Xie.

321
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,720
Is there something on your mind, Xuan Xin?

322
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,720
Yes,

323
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,720
Mr. Xie.

324
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,880
That Dark Clan member was subdued by the curse,

325
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,720
but when I went to find him,

326
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,160
he had vanished.

327
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,550
When the sect leader mentioned it just now,

328
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,480
your expression changed.

329
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,070
Does this matter

330
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,480
involve you?

331
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,240
Why didn't you ask earlier?

332
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,160
Since you didn't

333
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,400
want the sect leader to know,

334
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,790
I thought

335
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,160
it was better to speak with you privately first.

336
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:32,960
Yes,

337
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,030
I was involved.

338
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,030
I rescued a Spirit Clan member.

339
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,790
She once cultivated demonic power,

340
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,400
so the curse harmed her too.

341
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,480
But she isn't

342
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,750
the Dark Clan member we're after.

343
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,310
I see.

344
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,750
Do you trust her, Mr. Xie?

345
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,750
I do.

346
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,000
I trust her.

347
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,400
In that case,

348
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
I know what to do.

349
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,680
You're not planning to purge her?

350
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,310
That's quite different from most

351
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,550
Xuantian Sect cultivators.

352
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,440
I judge people by their character.

353
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,790
You're truly insightful.

354
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,110
This room is as cold and lifeless

355
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,510
as its owner.

356
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,680
Why don't I

357
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,480
surprise him a little?

358
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,510
Now this looks much better.

359
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,000
Xie Xuechen is in for a shock

360
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,310
when he comes back.

361
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,720
Ling.

362
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,240
Ling.

363
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,110
Ling.

364
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,350
The Dark Abyss?

365
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,550
How is this possible?

366
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I was just in Snow City.

367
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,920
It's only an illusion.

368
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,880
No need to be alarmed.

369
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,720
Master?

370
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,750
Master,

371
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,160
you're in the Dark Abyss,

372
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,270
and I'm in Snow City.

373
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,400
How did you bypass Snow City's barrier

374
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,980
and summon me into this illusion

375
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,030
from so far away?

376
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,490
You've always been

377
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,400
a troublemaker.

378
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,070
As a precaution,

379
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,480
I placed a spell

380
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,750
on your heart long ago.

381
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,030
It has a lovely name:

382
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,030
Heartstring.

383
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,830
It's like a thread that binds our hearts together.

384
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,550
With it, summoning you into an illusion

385
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,310
is no trouble at all.

386
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,400
So, Master,

387
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,590
you tampered

388
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,750
with me

389
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,400
without my knowledge?

390
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,480
Master,

391
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,960
can't there be

392
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,510
a little trust between us?

393
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,680
I believe

394
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,510
trust

395
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,680
must

396
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,350
be earned.

397
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,590
I still remember every word

398
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,270
of the plan you proposed that day.

399
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,200
For someone unafraid of death,

400
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,160
keeping him locked up is pointless.

401
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,750
Master,

402
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,550
why not try my plan?

403
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,350
I'll rescue him,

404
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,510
stay close to him,

405
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,720
gain his trust,

406
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,480
and lull him into letting his guard down.

407
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,790
Then I'll find a chance to seize the Chaos Pearl

408
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,550
and destroy the Immortal Alliance.

409
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,720
Here's the Half-Day Glory.

410
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,030
Take it.

411
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,140
And now,

412
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,680
what have you accomplished?

413
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,480
I've rescued him,

414
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,510
stayed close to him,

415
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,590
gained his trust,

416
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,440
and lulled him into letting his guard down.

417
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,790
I've already accomplished so much.

418
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,880
Don't try to fool me

419
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,640
with clever words.

420
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,590
You've spent

421
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,640
far too much time

422
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,200
on Xie Xuechen.

423
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,070
It makes me wonder

424
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,440
if you've

425
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,830
betrayed me.

426
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,440
How could I?

427
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,590
Master, you saved me from the Immortal Alliance's blade,

428
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,310
taught me demonic techniques,

429
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,440
gave me power,

430
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,960
and granted me status in the Dark Abyss.

431
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,000
I would never betray you.

432
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,750
Good.

433
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,070
Then prove it.

434
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,640
How do you want me to prove it, Master?

435
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,920
Bring back the Chaos Pearl.

436
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,640
Then,

437
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,880
kill Xie Xuechen.

438
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,720
Seeing that look on your face,

439
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,720
I'm

440
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,640
truly disappointed.

441
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,880
Let me remind you of something.

442
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,310
Your demonic power requires you

443
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,720
to temper your body with demonic energy

444
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
in the Dark Abyss at least once a month.

445
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,960
If you fail to do it,

446
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,350
the power

447
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,750
will backfire on you.

448
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,830
With your damaged spiritual apertures,

449
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,790
you won't be able to take it.

450
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,920
You'll die from an internal explosion.

451
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,350
No wonder you agreed

452
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,510
to my plan

453
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,030
so easily back then.

454
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,960
You have a backup plan,

455
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,920
and your trump card

456
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,590
is my life.

457
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,440
What,

458
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,480
are you willing to throw away

459
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,830
your own life for Xie Xuechen?

460
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,920
Of course not.

461
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,160
Spirits live for thousands of years.

462
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,480
The world is vast,

463
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,830
and there are countless men.

464
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,410
Why would I

465
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,160
throw my life away for just one man?

466
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,400
I was just having fun with him.

467
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,790
Rest assured, Master.

468
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,750
I'll complete the mission.

469
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,510
I'll retrieve the Chaos Pearl

470
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,270
and kill Xie Xuechen.

471
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,070
Good.

472
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,030
I'll be waiting.

473
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,640
But it's hard

474
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,350
to act alone.

475
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,750
Master,

476
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,140
are the Ignorance Demon and people from the Decaying Immortal Pavilion

477
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,550
in Snow City right now?

478
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,830
Where are they?

479
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,070
Let them lend me a hand.

480
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,070
Do you want their help,

481
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,920
or are you planning

482
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,960
to eliminate them all at once?

483
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,640
If you don't trust me, Master,

484
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,440
just take my life now.

485
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,400
Don't be upset.

486
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,920
We've been master and disciple for ten years.

487
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,830
As long as you complete the mission,

488
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,790
nothing will change.

489
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,200
Remember,

490
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,160
we were born in the darkness.

491
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,830
Don't deceive yourself into thinking you can live in the light.

492
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
I learned this truth

493
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,960
the hard way

494
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,790
20 years ago,

495
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,110
and it cost me an arm.

496
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,350
Ling,

497
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,790
I hope you'll

498
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,750
understand it too.

499
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,310
Now go.

500
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,830
Complete your mission.

501
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
I'll be waiting for you at home.

502
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,400
Even the slightest pretense makes a show fake.

503
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,270
Then I'll devote myself to it fully.

504
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,030
Here's the Half-Day Glory.

505
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,030
Take it.

506
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,880
My act is flawless,

507
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,720
so even Master has been fooled.

508
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:48,720
Master,

509
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,480
thank you for capturing him.

510
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,310
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known

511
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,480
he was still alive.

512
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,310
It's been ten years.

513
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,510
Now we're reunited in the Dark Abyss.

514
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,880
Hello,

515
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,400

Mu Xuanling,

550
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,550
I'm here to apologize.

551
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,000
No,

552
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,030
that's too arrogant.

553
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,160
She'd probably beat me up for that.

Xuanling,

555
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,400
about what happened today, I misunderstood you,

556
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,550
and you got hurt because of me.

557
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,680
I'm sorry.

558
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,790
That won't work either.

559
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,510
Mu Xuanling

560
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,590
is so proud.

561
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,960
If she sees me being this submissive,

562
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,830
she'll definitely make fun of me.

563
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,270
Mu Xuanling,

564
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
I know you

565
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,790
caught me in the wrong today,

566
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,750
but don't forget

567
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,350
I've got something on you, too.

568
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,400
If you keep my secret,

569
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,680
I'll keep yours.

570
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:08,920
Deal?

571
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,640
What do you think I'd say?

572
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,440
Why are you back so late?

573
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,030
I've been waiting here for ages.

574
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,830
Aren't you going to ask me

575
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,920
why I waited so long for you?

576
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,200
I'm in a foul mood,

577
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,920
and I feel like taking it out on someone.

578
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,270
If you don't leave now,

579
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,720
I'll kill you.

580
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,030
Why are you like this, Mu Xuanling?

581
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:41,590
I

582
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,110
came here to apologize!

583
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
I was wrong.

584
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,400
I misunderstood you today.

585
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,350
This is my favorite artifact.

586
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,270
It can create beautiful dreams.

587
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,480
I'm giving it to you.

588
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,310
Also,

589
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,110
I brought back your sword, too.

590
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,310
Let's just forget what happened today.

591
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,590
Please don't tell anyone about it.

592
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,450
So you're just scared

593
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,820
I'll tell people you accidentally helped

594
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,160
the Dark Clan and ruin your reputation.

595
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,590
You're not really sorry.

596
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:08,880
You're just

597
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,350
apologizing for your own good.

598
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,200
Mu Xuanling,

599
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,110
don't forget

600
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,640
I've got dirt on you, too.

601
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,750
I could tell everyone that you're...

602
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,160
a Spirit Clan member cultivating demonic power.

603
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,690
Go ahead.

604
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,830
Tell everyone.

605
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,790
Tell them right now.

606
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,440
Are you insane? You'll die!

607
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,030
Ending things sooner isn't so bad.

608
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,550
Are you done talking?

609
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,750
If so, leave.

610
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,110
Stop annoying me.

611
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,270
Mu Xuanling,

612
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,270
I'm just worried about you.

613
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,640
Xuanling,

614
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,050
that horrible woman

615
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,530
waited outside for two hours.

616
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,680
She kept muttering to herself,

617
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,550
practicing how to apologize to you.

618
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,400
It was so satisfying to watch!

619
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,680
Xuanling, what's wrong?

620
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,640
Bao,

621
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,150
if I die

622
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,190
one day,

623
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,590
go to the Jade Sky Palace

624
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,840
with Fu Lansheng, all right?

625
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,510
Why would you die, Xuanling?

626
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,480
Did that

627
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,280
Dark Clan member hurt you today?

628
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,000
I'll go find you spiritual herbs right now.

629
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,400
No,

630
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,590
I was just joking.

631
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,000
I just thought,

632
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,510
since the Master of the Jade Sky Palace is surnamed Fu,

633
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,070
maybe your father really is there.

634
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,320
I'll look for my father,

635
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,800
but you can't die, Xuanling.

636
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,840
You can't!

637
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,280
Bao,

638
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,230
the Spirit Clan has long lifespans,

639
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,280
but everyone dies eventually.

640
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,360
You need to learn

641
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,760
to face it.

642
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,670
That's still a long, long way off.

643
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,070
Let's not talk about it now.

644
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,840
It's bad luck!

645
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,360
All right.

646
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,760
It's been a long day.

647
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,440
I'm dying for some rest.

648
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,070
Let's go to bed.

649
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,000
No more talk about death!

650
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,400
I'm exhausted.

651
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,110
Time to sleep.

652
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:58,760
Okay.

653
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:00,940
Unbelievable.

654
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,360
I went to apologize,

655
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,480
but she was so rude to me!

656
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,440
Qiumin, what's wrong?

657
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,000
Did someone upset you?

658
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,710
Of course not.

659
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,880
I'm the Young Madam of the Mirage Palace, after all.

660
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,320
Stop making baseless assumptions.

661
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,110
Right, right.

662
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,000
You're absolutely right.

663
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,550
It's late.

664
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,670
Go get some rest.

665
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,110
She's always so high and mighty.

666
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,320
She really thinks she's the center of the world.

667
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,360
Exactly.

668
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,670
At the end of the day,

669
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,190
she's just an orphan

670
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,670
whose entire family has been wiped out.

671
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,800
If Master didn't favor her,

672
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,880
no one would care about her.

673
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,280
Let's go.

674
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,110
That's not how a Snow City disciple

675
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,030
should handle a sword.

676
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,190
Then teach me.

677
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,230
Sure.

00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,340

If it can bloom in the human realm,

695
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,510
so can you,

696
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,960
Mu Xuanling.

697
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,190
Xie Xuechen,

698
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,110
which is more important to you,

699
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,110
the Chaos Pearl or me?

700
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,400
Of course it's you.

701
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,760
Then if I stole

702
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,960
the Chaos Pearl one day

703
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,320
and helped Sang Qi bring the Dark Clan into the human realm,

704
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,760
would you kill me?

705
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,550
No.

706
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,630
I'd never raise my sword against you.

707
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,840
What if the Immortal Alliance wanted to kill me?

708
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,190
I wouldn't let them.

709
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,360
Then you'd become their enemy.

710
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,280
Then so be it.

711
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,150
Xie Xuechen,

712
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,590
do you love me?

713
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,110
I do.

714
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,190
Deeply.

715
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,380
♪Through life's highs and lows, my smile stays true♪

716
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,140

00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,020
♪Because you've stayed the same♪

718
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,920
The real Xie Xuechen

719
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,800
would never say something like that.

720
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,800
It's all in my head.

721
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,710
It's just a dream

722
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,550
that will never come true.

723
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,760
Master.

724
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,840
What

725
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,760
brings you here

726
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,400
so late at night?

727
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,710
I spoke with Fajian earlier

728
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,240
and learned

729
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,510
that you'd be observing faith in the Hall of Integrity tomorrow.

730
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,510
That's right.

731
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,280
Faith observation requires

732
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,670
a significant amount of spiritual power.

733
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,920
Here's a seal I've created.

734
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,630
It will assist you with the task.

735
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,760
Take it.

736
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,320
But won't using it

737
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,360
drain your spiritual power, Master?

738
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,590
You're my disciple,

739
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,840
raised and taught by me.

740
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
It's my duty

741
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:52,800
to protect you.

742
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,320
With the Dark Clan

743
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,670
lurking in Snow City,

744
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,480
your priority is to protect yourself

745
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,230
and give them no chance to harm you.

746
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,590
Thank you, Master.

747
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,580
[Hall of Integrity]

748
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,920
As you probably all know,

749
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,230
a Dark Clan member infiltrated Snow City yesterday,

750
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,190
and he remains at large.

751
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,960
With danger looming,

752
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,440
we can no longer delay

753
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,110
the election of a new Alliance Leader.

754
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,800
I've gathered you here today

755
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,000
to propose that we

756
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,030
choose a new leader immediately.

757
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,110
Does anyone

758
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,230
have a candidate in mind?

759
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,400
My stance remains unchanged.

760
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,590
I believe

761
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,880
I am the most suitable

762
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,710
for the position.

763
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,590
Sending the Chaos Pearl to the Mirage Palace?

764
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,030
We might as well skip the trouble

765
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,400
and hand it over to the Dark Abyss directly.

766
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,000
Is the Jade Sky Palace

767
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,480
interested in the position too?

768
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,920
Besides wealth and treasure, what else

769
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,630
does it have to offer?

770
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,930
Or do you

771
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,070
plan to bribe Sang Qi?

772
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,230
Who

773
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,710
do you suggest, Mr. Xie?

774
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,000
I believe

775
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,150
Saint Fajian, with his virtue and standing,

776
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,070
is the best candidate.

777
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,000
Thank you, Mr. Xie,

778
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,800
but I am not the right choice.

779
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,630
Please consider someone else.

780
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,550
Don't decline, Fajian.

781
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:57,920
No one in the Immortal Alliance

782
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,760
is more qualified than you.

783
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,670
I agree.

784
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,880
Saint Fajian's virtue and standing

785
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,110
make him

786
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,440
the ideal leader.

787
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,230
Osprey Island

788
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,630
nominates Saint Fajian

789
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,400
as the Alliance Leader.

790
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,280
If Saint Fajian

791
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,480
were to lead,

792
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,070
the Jade Sky Palace would fully support him.

793
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,630
Please accept the position, sir.

794
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:38,920
The Mirage Palace

795
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,190
has no objections.

796
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,710
Since everyone has such confidence in me,

797
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,280
I will not decline.

798
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,800
Congratulations, sir!
