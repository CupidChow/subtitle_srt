16
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,860
[Episode 31]

17
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,430
This Graceful Palace is beautiful, no doubt,

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,360
but I haven't seen Zhao Ming

19
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,710
for several days.

20
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,590
Is he really that busy?

21
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,150
The Saint Emperor's time belongs to the people.

22
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,510
Of course, he's busy.

23
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,790
Didn't you say

24
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,960
you're the one he can't live without?

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,750
Why are you so free, then?

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,910
I...

27
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,710
I have important duties to attend to!

28
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,680
What important duties?

29
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,470
Well...

30
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,840
important duties

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,840
can't be casually spoken about.

32
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,400
Don't you understand?

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,280
If you're bored,

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,710
I've got a way to entertain you.

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,120
What's the new game this time?

36
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,520
Dice betting.

37
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,120
It's all about the thrill.

38
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,750
The rules are simple.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,870
Do you understand them?

40
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,360
One round, and you'll get it.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,840
However,

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,960
you need to bet something valuable.

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,430
This is my most precious possession,

44
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,190
yesterday's peach blossom pastry.

45
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,400
I've been saving it until now.

46
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,800
Then,

47
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,480
I'll bet it.

48
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,190
This is far too precious.

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,150
Just use something ordinary to bet.

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,120
For instance,

51
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,740
the jewelry box

52
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,280
that the Saint Emperor gifted you a few days ago.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,590
Your Majesty,

54
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,680
you haven't slept in days.

55
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,710
Why not rest for a while?

56
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,430
It's fine.

57
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,080
He Zhou visits the Graceful Palace daily.

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,150
The Chaos Pearl shows nothing unusual

59
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,960
or any strange activity.

60
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,960
Although it is an ancient artifact,

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,400
it has taken human form now

62
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,150
and should be treated as such.

63
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,680
Understood.

64
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,750
Pearl is pure,

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,360
and He Zhou is loyal.

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
They're a good match as companions.

67
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,120
Come on,

68
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,920
a little gambling is harmless fun.

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,720
Bet big, win big. Bet small, win small!

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,950
Small... it's definitely small!

71
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,190
- Quick, open it! - Three, two, one, open!

72
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,720
You bet small, but it's big.

73
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,240
These hairpins

74
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,510
are mine now.

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,800
How about it?

76
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,510
Still playing?

77
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,560
One more round!

78
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,600
One more round!

79
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,310
I love your straightforward style!

80
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,310
Don't lose heart.

81
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,600
Play a few more rounds,

82
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,190
and I'll teach you properly.

83
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,560
Why not teach me, too?

84
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,270
Your Majesty...

85
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,240
Zhao Ming!

86
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,000
Pearl.

87
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,640
- Sit. - Why is the Saint Emperor here?

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Why didn't you warn me?

89
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,600
Let's begin.

90
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,830
Your Majesty,

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,310
is this really appropriate?

92
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,190
Just go ahead.

93
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,000
This is my bet.

94
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,240
Is it sufficient?

95
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
Don't blame me for being weak-willed.

96
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,920
Your Majesty bet too much!

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,750
Let's begin.

98
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,390
It's all gone.

99
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm done playing.

100
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,680
Pearl,

101
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,390
have you learned it?

102
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,160
Pearl hasn't learned it.

103
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,720
So, let's continue.

104
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,360
Your Majesty,

105
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,070
this isn't fair.

106
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,360
I've already lost everything.

107
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,120
It's fine.

108
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,870
Next month's allowance

109
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,750
can be advanced for your bets.

110
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,070
Didn't you say a little gambling is harmless fun?

111
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,680
I still want to learn.

112
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,480
A gamble is a gamble.

113
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,240
Big or small, it's harmful!

114
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,040
Pearl, don't pick up bad habits.

115
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,800
I, He Zhou,

116
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
swear off gambling starting today.

117
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,680
I'll never involve Pearl again.

118
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,480
Yan,

119
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,190
issue the order:

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,830
From today onward,

121
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,480
gambling is banned in the palace.

122
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,040
Understood.

123
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,160
You may leave now.

124
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,070
Understood.

125
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,920
Pearl,

126
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
keep these winnings safe.

127
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,950
Don't let He Zhou trick you again.

128
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,700
It's not He Zhou's fault.

129
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,770
These days,

130
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,800
he's always been keeping me company.

131
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,160
When I was still a pearl,

132
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,510
I could see you anytime.

133
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,310
But now that I'm human,

134
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,950
it's hard to even catch a glimpse of you.

135
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,510
It's something I'm not used to.

136
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,480
That's my oversight.

137
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,120
You've just taken human form.

138
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,480
There must be many things you're adjusting to.

139
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,830
But if you stick with He Zhou for too long,

140
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,360
he could misguide you.

141
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,560
I'll find you a teacher

142
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,190
to teach you reading and writing.

143
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,560
How does that sound?

144
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,190
A teacher?

145
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,600
The essence of sunlight and moonlight

146
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,950
is indeed beneficial for refining spiritual pills,

147
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,630
but the process is lengthy.

148
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,830
Recently, I've discovered

149
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,480
another kind of vital energy in this world

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
that can accelerate the process of refining spiritual pills.

151
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,120
Sir,

152
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,030
I'm sorry for being late

153
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,630
and keeping you waiting.

154
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,640
It's fine.

155
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,840
A brief wait is nothing,

156
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,510
as long as you've arrived.

157
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,440
Zhao Ming said you're the most learned scholar

158
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,750
in all of Dongze.

159
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,690
What's more, you offered

160
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,720
to teach me yourself.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,870
Thank you, Sir.

162
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,550
No need for such formality.

163
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,960
It makes us seem distant.

164
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,270
Hearing this from you puts me at ease.

165
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,200
It's all He Zhou's fault for scaring me,

166
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,720
saying I must act with utmost respect

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,050
or risk getting my palms struck

168
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,440
with a ruler by the teacher.

169
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,750
But I think

170
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
you make me feel very approachable.

171
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,390
What's the saying for that?

172
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Like meeting an old friend at first sight.

173
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,510
Like meeting an old friend at first sight?

174
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,510
Did you recall

175
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,510
an old friend

176
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,630
or a familiar place?

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,960
Sir, you must be joking.

178
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,120
I'm just a pearl of Zhao Ming.

179
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,790
How could I have old friends?

180
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,600
Let's begin the lesson.

181
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,760
Today,

182
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,000
we'll start with some basic characters.

183
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,360
[Human]
This character is pronounced as "ren" (human),

184
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,240
which is also your current identity.

185
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,000
"Ren."

186
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,740
[Human]

187
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,670
This character is simple

188
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,670
and easy to remember.

189
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,360
This character is pronounced as "tian" (heaven).

190
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,030
[Heaven]
Here's how you can remember it:

191
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,510
"Heaven" has two extra horizontal lines compared to "human."

192
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,320
One line stands above "human,"

193
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,240
[Heaven]
and the other confines "human."

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,720
"Tian"...

195
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,750
Why is it so domineering?

196
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,550
That's the order of the world.

197
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,510
Heaven is always above humanity.

198
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,630
Humanity is subjected to heaven.

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,240
Then I don't like heaven.

200
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,000
It makes people suffer,

201
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,080
and it keeps Zhao Ming too busy to spend time with me.

202
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,240
Companionship among humans

203
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,630
lasts just decades at most.

204
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,030
Only those from the heavens

205
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,320
can share eternity with heaven.

206
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,080
That kind of companionship

207
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,790
is truly everlasting.

208
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,290
But even if the time together lasts long,

209
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,200
what's the point?

210
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,330
If two people stay together

211
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,360
but feel unhappy,

212
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,510
isn't that kind of companionship

213
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,240
a source of pain?

214
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,440
Sir.

215
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,510
I made these pastries with the kitchen staff.

216
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,000
I brought them over just for you to try.

217
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,750
Sir,

218
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,270
why are you upset today?

219
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,870
Is it because I'm too slow at learning characters?

220
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Or do you think I'm stupid?

221
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,150
I'm not upset.

222
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,480
You have a sharp mind

223
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,550
and grasp things quickly.

224
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,480
How could you be stupid?

225
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,840
I'm glad you're not upset, Sir.

226
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,280
So tomorrow,

227
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,790
will you still teach me characters?

228
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Now that you're human,

229
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,750
finding simple and pure happiness

230
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,270
is a blessing in itself.

231
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,550
Open this.

232
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,720
This jade pen is for you.

233
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,510
Heaven controls humanity,

234
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,960
but with a pen in hand,

235
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,080
one can write their own destiny.

236
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,390
Thank you, Sir.

237
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,240
Well then,

238
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,960
I'll take my leave.

239
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,960
Don't forget to try the pastries.

240
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,480
Why did you gather these items?

241
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,390
What are they for?

242
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,380
Why do people use flowers

243
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,150
on so many different occasions?

244
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,320
Weddings, funerals,

245
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,750
and offerings to the deities...

246
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,000
these seemingly unrelated events

247
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,670
are all connected by flowers as tokens of emotion.

248
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,840
Flowers...

249
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,960
to us, they are either black or white,

250
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,750
with only slight differences in form.

251
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,440
But in the eyes of mortals,

252
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,360
flowers are vastly distinct,

253
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,790
vividly colorful,

254
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,080
each carrying its own meaning.

255
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,510
Every time I look down from the sea of clouds,

256
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,670
I see children's faces light up with joy

257
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,550
just from eating one.

258
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,000
A simple pastry

259
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,790
can bring them happiness.

260
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,750
Yet, we cannot feel that.

261
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,600
To us,

262
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,320
all food is tasteless.

263
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
We've never experienced all kinds of flavors

264
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,270
or the longing tied to them.

265
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,200
Why, then, should we feel sorrow?

266
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,870
The logic is clear:

267
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,390
if we've never had it,

268
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,080
there's no longing tied to it.

269
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,750
We, as divine artifacts,

270
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,750
may share heaven's longevity

271
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,480
and enjoy the respect of the deities,

272
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,910
but we are no more than tools of Hao Tian.

273
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,120
Our lives are less colorful than those of mortals.

274
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,030
Hao Tian bestowed divine power upon us,

275
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,910
but it came with absolute fairness.

276
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,630
We are forbidden to favor anything.

277
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,270
What we gain

278
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,240
is destined to come at a price.

279
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,510
Yet,

280
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,360
we can't taste flavors,

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,080
see colors,

282
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,320
smell the fragrance of flowers,

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,870
or understand emotions.

284
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,870
For tens of thousands of years,

285
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,910
every day has been the same.

286
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,480
Fate,

287
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,750
don't you find it boring?

288
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,080
All things in this world

289
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,000
are bound by cause and effect.

290
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,750
This is the price of being an artifact.

291
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,270
Will the next ten thousand years

292
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,000
or even a million years

293
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,630
be the same?

294
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,480
It's fate.

295
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,670
We must remain loyal to Hao Tian.

296
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,550
Sir,

297
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,150
just now, outside the hall,

298
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,390
Miss Pearl said

299
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,000
this was her first time making pastries.

300
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,910
How do they taste?

301
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,360
Very sweet.

302
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,510
But,

303
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,840
Miss Pearl said

304
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,150
today's batch

305
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,150
was supposed to be savory.

306
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,390
Is that so?

307
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,720
The recipe for these pastries is unique.

308
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,870
It's a tradition from my homeland.

309
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,600
So, it's something from your homeland.

310
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,960
No wonder you treasure it so much.

311
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,480
Come,

312
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,000
have a taste yourself.

313
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,390
Thank you, Sir.

314
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Tasting this pastry

315
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,840
has made me suddenly homesick.

316
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,320
Luckily, there are people from my homeland

317
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,200
in the palace to keep me company.

318
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,960
Zi Chen,

319
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,960
I'd like to consult you on a question.

320
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,720
I don't dare.

321
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,790
How could I deserve to be consulted

322
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,640
when you know everything?

323
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,000
Please, just ask.

324
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,550
If you had someone from your homeland,

325
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,350
and you were supposed to take her back there,

326
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,270
but that place was full of restrictions,

327
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,000
cold and desolate.

328
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,880
There's no freedom,

329
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,440
and no joy.

330
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,240
And she faced

331
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,200
the constant threat of being sacrificed.

332
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,590
If that were the case,

333
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,440
would you still take her back?

334
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,720
Homeland is supposed to bring happiness.

335
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,270
If returning

336
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,440
meant misfortune,

337
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,350
then don't go back.

338
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,310
Sir...

339
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,070
Did I...

340
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,030
say something wrong?

341
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,240
It's nothing.

342
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,350
You may go now.

343
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,110
Understood.

344
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,160
Oh, and...

345
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,720
the pastries...

346
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,790
Thank you, Sir.

347
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,220
[Graceful Palace]

348
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,000
Zhao Ming,

349
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,270
you're here.

350
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,640
It's been a few days.

351
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,270
I came to see how your studies are progressing.

352
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,790
Of course, I've been diligent.

353
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,720
Here's a new character I've learned.

354
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,480
The teacher said,

355
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,110
"Sun on the left, moon on the right,

356
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,480
both bring light, making "ming."

357
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,960
He teaches well.

358
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,060
But my understanding

359
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,200
is a little different.

360
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,680
Like the sun's brilliance,

361
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,640
like the moon's gentleness,

362
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,400
"sun" and "moon" together

363
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,200
make the "ming" in Zhao Ming.

364
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,790
Your interpretation

365
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
is also reasonable.

366
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,270
[Ming]

367
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,920
How do you think my writing looks?

368
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,400
Your writing is good,

369
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,310
but...

370
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,880
the parts are a bit distant.

371
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,400
Distant?

372
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,240
Then I'll make it closer!

373
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,110
Zhao Ming,

374
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,480
am I considered a beauty?

375
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,000
Does that mean I'll have a tragic fate?

376
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,400
I heard they say beauties have tragic fates.

377
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,070
No.

378
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,110
You will live a long, long life,

379
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,680
longer than mine.

380
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,750
Longer than yours?

381
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,510
What's the point of that?

382
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,680
I'm your pearl,

383
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,270
so I should always stay with you.

384
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,510
I exist because you exist,

385
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,640
right?

386
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,550
No,

387
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,510
you don't exist because of me,

388
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,920
and your purpose

389
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,350
isn't tied to me either.

390
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,160
Time is long,

391
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,640
with gains and losses coming and going.

392
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,110
Someday,

393
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,480
you'll find your own path

394
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,920
and your own purpose.

395
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,160
My own path,

396
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,310
my own purpose...

397
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,030
It's okay.

398
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,680
There's no rush to figure it out now.

399
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,550
The future is long.

400
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,460
I may not know

401
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,920
what my path is,

402
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,270
but I know yours.

403
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,400
You're the Saint Emperor,

404
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,240
with the world on your mind.

405
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,400
[Heaven]

406
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,830
So your path is the Emperor's Way.

407
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,480
The Emperor's Way is not what I seek.

408
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,590
What I want

409
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,310
is to be a man of courage,

410
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,750
unbound by heaven,

411
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,590
protecting humanity,

412
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
and breaking through heaven itself.

413
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,060
[Man]

414
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,690
The teacher said

415
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,720
"heaven" has two extra strokes over "human,"

416
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,270
firmly trapping it beneath.

417
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,510
But under your pen,

418
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,830
humanity can break through heaven?

419
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,270
Man makes his own destiny.

420
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,240
Zhao Ming,

421
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,680
I don't fully understand.

422
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,270
What exactly

423
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,070
is humanity?

424
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
Humanity is both simple

425
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,160
and complex.

426
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,620
[Human]

427
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,480
It seems weak at first glance,

428
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,400
but it can possess great strength.

429
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,110
Just looking at it on paper won't reveal its essence.

430
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,880
To understand humanity,

431
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,680
you must use your heart.

432
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,920
Heart?

433
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,720
To understand a person,

434
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,790
you can't only look at their appearance.

435
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,270
You must also see their inner self.

436
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,310
Look at what they say,

437
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,350
and at what they do.

438
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,550
See their strengths,

439
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,550
but also their weaknesses.

440
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,160
See how they treat themselves,

441
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,550
and how they treat others.

442
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,310
Observe their grace in good times,

443
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,110
and their choices in adversity.

444
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,240
Humanity

445
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,510
cannot be explained in a few words.

446
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,440
If you wish to understand it,

447
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,270
I will take you to see it carefully in the future.

448
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,720
Your Grace,

449
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,880
we've searched the human realm for a long time

450
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,790
but still haven't found the divine child.

451
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,350
The prophecy gives limited clues,

452
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,440
making the search

453
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,310
like finding a needle in a haystack.

454
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,790
If you ask me,

455
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,400
even if the prophecy is true,

456
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,940
are we, so many deities,

457
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,510
unable to defeat a single divine child?

458
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,720
The Book of Fate governs all cause and effect.

459
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,070
If it reveals a prophecy, it will become destiny.

460
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,590
Failing in your task

461
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,550
and now trying to argue?

462
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Your Grace, calm your anger.

463
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,460
Our travels across the nations

464
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,310
have not been entirely fruitless.

465
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,750
Dongze stands as the world's leader,

466
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,310
with all nations and tribes

467
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,830
under its governance.

468
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,830
The ruler of Dongze, Zhao Ming,

469
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,310
is exceptional,

470
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,510
a man of unparalleled brilliance.

471
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,160
If we can bring Zhao Ming under your command,

472
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,110
the search for the divine child

473
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,590
would greatly benefit.

474
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,070
Regarding the prophecy of the divine child,

475
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,200
I suddenly have a theory.

476
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,830
The so-called birth of the divine child

477
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,320
might have occurred ten years ago,

478
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,000
at the very moment when the Book of Fate

479
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,070
revealed the prophecy.

480
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,240
Why not

481
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,860
start searching

482
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,880
among the children born at that time?

483
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,160
That makes sense.

484
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,790
Continue searching the lower realms,

485
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,830
and send another divine edict to Dongze,

486
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,550
instructing Zhao Ming

487
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,720
to offer up the children.

488
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,510
But Your Grace,

489
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,200
so many children were born at that time.

490
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,350
What if...

491
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,080
what if we can't identify the divine child?

492
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,030
Then kill them all.

493
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,810
Leave no one alive.

494
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,900
In the year of Cang Hao,

495
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,550
three thousand children

496
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,750
were born.

497
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,480
Summon them as divine servants.

498
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,200
Sir,

499
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,440
is this a newly descended divine edict?

500
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,000
The year of Cang Hao...

501
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,270
Isn't that ten years ago?

502
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,720
That year,

503
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,480
the heavens were torn open.

504
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,240
Placing humanity on the brink of extinction.

505
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,550
The late emperor

506
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,790
also perished in that crisis.

507
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,880
Sir,

508
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,000
what should we do now?

509
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,510
As an advisor,

510
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,640
upon receiving a divine edict,

511
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,510
it is my duty to report it to the Saint Emperor.

512
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,750
How to decide

513
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,550
is up to the Saint Emperor.

514
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,110
Nonsense!

515
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,510
The deities now even target children.

516
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,130
They use the guise of divine servants

517
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,440
to force humanity into sacrificing those children.

518
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,920
With just a so-called divine edict,

519
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,750
they want to take three thousand lives.

520
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,880
As long as I, Zhao Ming, live,

521
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,510
I will never bow to the deities.

522
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,400
Sir, please destroy the tortoise shell.

523
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,160
From today onward,

524
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,550
Dongze will no longer accept any divine edicts.

525
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,750
Your Majesty,

526
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,030
have you made your mind?

527
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,680
The deities are merciless,

528
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,240
and their oppression worsens.

529
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,510
Now,

530
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,350
we must hasten to find a way to resist the deities.

531
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,200
The power gap between humans and deities

532
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
makes resistance

533
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,590
like bringing a knife to a gunfight.

534
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,880
But I believe

535
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,350
humanity can triumph over heaven!

536
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,960
Then may Your Majesty

537
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,720
achieve your wishes.

538
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,030
What are you doing here?

539
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,640
Bad He Zhou,

540
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,960
you scared me again!

541
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,370
Did you already buy

542
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,310
the new storybooks for me?

543
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,160
I got these rare editions

544
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,110
through countless connections

545
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,200
and Herculean efforts!

546
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,720
So,

547
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,070
don't you think I deserve a little extra for the trouble?

548
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,680
I think

549
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,270
your bracelet looks pretty nice.

550
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,400
I already paid you for the storybooks.

551
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,960
You're trying to trick me again.

552
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,750
Well, it's your fault for learning so quickly,

553
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,200
reading three books a day!

554
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,610
I might run my legs off

555
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,790
to keep up with your demands!

556
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,400
Besides,

557
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,270
this batch of storybooks

558
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,880
is different from the mythology you've been reading.

559
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,240
These ones

560
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,270
are about love stories.

561
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,270
Love stories?

562
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,350
Don't tease me.

563
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,350
Have you all had your fill?

564
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
How about a story?

565
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,270
- Yes! - Let's hear it!

566
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,070
Today's story

567
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,070
is perfect for all of you.

568
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,160
It's about

569
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,240
a poor fisher girl

570
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,750
falling in love with a prince in disguise

571
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,750
and eventually becoming a royal consort.

572
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,310
Next,

573
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,880
let's invite the palace's well-read

574
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,030
and story-loving Pearl

575
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,640
to share this tale with us.

576
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,350
- Yes! - Great!

577
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,510
Listen closely now.

578
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,010
A long, long time ago,

579
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,720
there was a kind-hearted fisher girl.

580
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,160
While out fishing,

581
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,730
she accidentally rescued

582
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,380
a badly injured man.

583
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,600
The fisher girl's elder sister

584
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,720
found out about this

585
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,200
and warned her,

586
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,130
"Never pick up men randomly

587
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,640
from the roadside,

588
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,440
especially injured ones.

589
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,310
They'll bring misfortune."

590
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,160
But the fisher girl thought it over

591
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,960
and said,

592
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,400
"I didn't pick him up by the roadside.

593
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,270
I fished him out of the sea!"

594
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,350
Pearl always brings laughter and joy.

595
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,280
What do you think?

596
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,220
Since she was here,

597
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,510
this once-quiet Everbright Palace

598
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,480
has become full of life.

599
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,030
Indeed.

600
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,350
The servants all adore her.

601
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,030
Would you like to go in and see?

602
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,720
If I go in,

603
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,030
they won't enjoy themselves as much.

604
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,000
Let's take care of business first.

605
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,070
Over the years,

606
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,440
I've traveled far and wide,

607
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,270
researching ways to resist the Divine Clan.

608
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,920
It is said that only something greater than them

609
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,400
can suppress them.

610
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,840
One such thing are two ancient artifacts,

611
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,160
the Book of Fate and the Chaos Pearl.

612
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,680
The other

613
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,720
is the Jun Tian Sword,

614
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,790
born of the energy of the chaos.

615
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,240
You've searched three times yourself

616
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,200
following this map,

617
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,310
and every time, the end leads to an empty void.

618
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,510
There is no sword at all.

619
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,750
Could it be

620
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,830
that the map is wrong?

621
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,160
No,

622
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,110
the map must be true.

623
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Each time I reach the destination,

624
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,480
I can feel the intense sword energy.

625
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,000
Perhaps my approach is wrong,

626
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,440
so the Jun Tian Sword remains hidden.

627
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,510
Yan,

628
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,960
seek out the best swordsmiths.

629
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,550
See if they might uncover something new.

630
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,000
Understood.

631
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,400
If the Jun Tian Sword cannot be found,

632
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,400
won't you truly consider

633
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,720
using the Chaos Pearl against the Divine Clan?

634
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,750
The Chaos Pearl has already mended the heavens,

635
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,920
bearing the weight of the world once.

636
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,790
Now that it's no longer functional,

637
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,300
I'd rather let it

638
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,830
live a simple and happy life as Pearl.

639
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,270
As for opposing the Divine Clan,

640
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,590
that is my responsibility.

641
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,830
Besides,

642
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,960
if the Divine Clan descends to the human realm,

643
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,930
their divine power will be restricted.

644
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,960
Even in direct confrontation,

645
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,440
I can still match them

646
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,440
with my power.

647
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,550
But you've already lost a drop of your blood essence,

648
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,200
and the methods you seek only weaken you further.

649
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,590
It's just a single drop of blood essence.

650
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,480
I'm far from weak.

651
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,360
How dare Zhao Ming

652
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,920
destroy the divine edict!

653
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,920
I might as well kill him outright!

654
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,550
If it were so easy to kill him,

655
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,440
why wait until now?

656
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,350
Zhao Ming was born with divine channels.

657
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,640
He's the only human capable of cultivating divine power.

658
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,220
He is the leader of the human race,

659
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,520
respected and supported by all.

660
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,530
He carries an endless flow

661
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,920
of sovereign fortune,

662
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,830
making it impossible to kill him directly.

663
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,240
Moreover,

664
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,720
the divine order must be upheld.

665
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,480
If you use divine power in the human realm,

666
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,880
your strength will be significantly reduced.

667
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,830
Mortals are driven by desires and emotions.

668
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,920
Zhao Ming

669
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,200
must have a weakness.

670
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,720
His weakness isn't within himself.

671
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,790
It's in maintaining the peace of the world.

672
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,510
If he refuses the divine edict,

673
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,920
do you think the other nations

674
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
will also dare to defy it?

675
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,310
It's better to stir chaos in the human realm

676
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,590
and send him a warning.

677
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,480
When unrest shakes the world,

678
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,240
I want to see how Zhao Ming

679
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,160
remains above it all.

680
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,200
Exactly.

681
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,920
You and I are deities of desire,

682
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,200
masters of manipulating the human heart.

683
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,640
If we descend divine edicts upon the nations

684
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,830
and tempt them to fight over resources,

685
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,680
war will inevitably break out.

686
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,110
Countless mortals

687
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,880
will perish in battle.

688
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,260
Zhao Ming

689
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,510
will have no choice but to submit!

690
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,730
Then get it done at once.

691
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,880
I want to see

692
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,680
Zhao Ming weakened,

693
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,750
his sovereign pride shattered.

694
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,000
Within half a month,

695
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,400
all the nations have gone to war.

696
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,960
Something suspicious is at play.

697
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,880
Indeed.

698
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,190
Even Xilin State, which has always been wary of war,

699
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,400
has suddenly fallen into chaos.

700
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,360
What is the situation on the borders?

701
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,710
After your orders,

702
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,840
the border soldiers have raised their guard.

703
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,000
However, many refugees are running to Dongze,

704
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,000
placing significant pressure on us.

705
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,130
The world is meant to be united,

706
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,670
with no divisions between us and them.

707
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,590
He Zhou,

708
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,650
issue an order

709
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,280
to take good care of these refugees.

710
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,440
Additionally,

711
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,460
starting today,

712
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,920
beginning with Everbright Palace,

713
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,960
all living expenses shall be kept simple,

714
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,400
Use the savings to support the refugees.

715
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,030
Understood.

716
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,440
Yan,

717
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,630
investigate this chaos immediately

718
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,150
and uncover the cause behind it.

719
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:58,960
Understood.

720
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,220
[Everbright Palace]

721
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:36,480
Come in.

722
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,190
Sir.

723
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,550
What brings you here?

724
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,280
Can you tell me

725
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,800
about Zhao Ming's past?

726
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,800
Why do you ask?

727
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,510
Although Zhao Ming is warm and kind,

728
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,480
there's always a mysterious feeling

729
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,650
about him.

730
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,840
Lately,

731
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,400
even his smiles carry a hint of sorrow,

732
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,230
as if there's

733
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,510
an invisible chain holding him down.

734
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,150
That's why I want to know

735
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,320
what he has been through

736
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,030
and what burdens he carries.

737
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,980
[Dongze]

738
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,110
This contains the story of Dongze's current dynasty,

739
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,800
which is also Zhao Ming's biography.

740
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,670
Ten years ago,

741
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,840
Dongze's former emperor perished in a heavenly crisis.

742
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,000
Zhao Ming, still a youth,

743
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,760
took on the immense responsibility

744
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,320
of the entire realm.

745
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,400
Born with divine channels,

746
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,280
he is brave and skilled in battle.

747
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,670
Before coming of age,

748
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,110
he led armies to the battlefield,

749
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,760
defeating invasions from other nations

750
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,400
and stabilizing the state.

751
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,150
Zhao Ming governs diligently for his people,

752
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,670
earning deep love from his subjects.

753
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,440
The world aligns with his rule.

754
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,110
The people honor him

755
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,710
as the Saint Emperor.

756
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,150
With humanity oppressed by the Divine Clan,

757
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,510
Zhao Ming swore an oath

758
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,190
to protect the people,

759
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,590
even if it meant sacrificing his life.

760
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,800
So,

761
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,440
what binds Zhao Ming

762
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,670
is not a single chain,

763
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,000
but the weight of all the people in the world.

764
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,960
Everyone calls him the Saint Emperor,

765
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,550
but behind that noble title

766
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,070
lies their admiration and reliance.

767
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,400
They all depend on him,

768
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,230
but who can he depend on?

769
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,030
He must be so tired.

770
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,280
Rather than calling him Saint Emperor,

771
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,440
I'd rather call him Zhao Ming,

772
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,760
his true self.

773
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,090
Everyone should

774
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,110
bear the consequences of their choices.

775
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,480
This is the destiny he chose for himself.

776
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,920
Destiny?

777
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,550
Today,

778
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,800
I will teach you the character "Zhao."

779
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,590
"Zhao,"

780
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,840
on the left is the "sun,"

781
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,480
[Zhao]
shining like the noonday sun,

782
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,840
bringing light to all beings.

783
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,440
Above is a "blade,"

784
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,080
and below is a "mouth,"

785
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,510
symbolizing the danger

786
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,920
of living on the edge of death.

787
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
Sir, are you saying

788
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,710
that Zhao Ming will die?

789
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,190
The Saint Emperor was born with divine channels

790
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,320
and is destined to share heaven's longevity.

791
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,590
How could he die?

792
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,630
I've spoken too much today.

793
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Fate is mysterious,

794
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,480
not something we can easily reveal.

795
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,030
You scared me!

796
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,190
As long as Zhao Ming is fine, I'm relieved.

797
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,760
You're so knowledgeable,

798
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,400
always saying things too profound for me to understand.

799
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,070
I have one more profound question

800
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,630
to ask you, Sir.

801
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,320
Go ahead.

802
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,760
What is love?

803
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,710
In storybooks, the woodcutter and the Divine Saintess fell in love.

804
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,550
Even when they turned into stone,

805
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,070
unable to be together,

806
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,760
they felt no regret.

807
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,110
I want to know, what exactly is love?

808
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,360
Is love a desire or a driving force?

809
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,320
In your opinion,

810
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,280
what is love?

811
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,440
Why is it that when humans have love,

812
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,400
their lives become bustling

813
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,710
and full of warmth?

814
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,480
If we could also have love,

815
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,880
wouldn't the divine realm

816
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,590
be less cold and desolate?

817
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,480
You and I were created as divine artifacts,

818
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,360
meant to follow Hao Tian's will.

819
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,110
To question love

820
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,480
is to begin the path to destruction.

821
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,150
Alright,

822
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,630
then I won't ask anymore.

823
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,590
Anyway, you're by my side.

824
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,440
As long as the sun rises and sets

825
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,110
and the universe endures,

826
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,280
Fate,

827
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,590
we will always be together.

828
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,510
I don't know what love truly is.

829
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,880
All I know is that love...

830
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,150
belongs only to humans

831
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,110
and not to the Divine Saintess.

832
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,190
If a divine saintess loves,

833
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,630
she will be punished by the heavens.

834
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,030
So,

835
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,030
even being a divine saintess isn't easy.

836
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,150
What if...

837
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,070
you're also a celestial pearl

838
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,960
that fell from the heavens?

839
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,510
How could I be a celestial pearl?

840
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,920
I'm just an ordinary pearl

841
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,030
in Zhao Ming's hands.

842
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,400
As long as I can see him every day,

843
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,360
stay with him every day,

844
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,400
I'm happy.

845
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,880
But you're a pearl,

846
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,360
and he's human.

847
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,710
You're destined to be separated one day.

848
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,710
No, we won't.

849
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,000
Look,

850
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,230
in the storybooks,

851
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,230
the woodcutter may have turned to stone,

852
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,710
but his heart still loved the Divine Saintess.

853
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,320
Nothing can truly separate them.

854
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,710
Just like me and Zhao Ming,

855
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,230
as long as I keep him in my heart,

856
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,000
we will never be apart.

857
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
No matter what happens,

858
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,880
I will stay by his side, forever.

859
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,000
