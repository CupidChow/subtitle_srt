[Adapted from The Blossoming Love on com.duyao.poisonnovelgirl by Sui Yu Er An]

17
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,860
[Episode 11]

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,510
Since everyone values us so much,

19
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,120
I won't decline any further.

20
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,480
The Xuantian Sect will do its utmost

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,000
to safeguard the Chaos Pearl.

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,710
Congratulations, Alliance Leader.

23
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,230
Now that the new leader has been chosen,

24
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,040
all sect leaders,

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,350
please bring the jade tokens to the Pearl Tower

26
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,760
tomorrow at noon.

27
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,310
At that time,

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
The Snow City will transfer the Chaos Pearl

29
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,630
to the Xuantian Sect for safekeeping.

30
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,360
My master's wish to become the Alliance Leader has fallen through,

31
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,960
so she must be furious.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,310
I'd better avoid her for now

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,120
and wait until her anger cools off.

34
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,030
As for the mistake I made in helping the Dark Clan,

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,470
Mu Xuanling and Xie Xuechen

36
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,280
haven't revealed it.

37
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,470
They do have some sense of loyalty.

38
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,280
Heartbroken in love,

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,030
strong in public,

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,430
tears in private...

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,080
Miss Gao is truly enduring.

42
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,840
Miss Gao.

43
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,280
Oh, Mr. Fu.

44
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,470
What brings you here?

45
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,240
Well, I accidentally

46
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,890
got some sand in my eyes.

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,930
How embarrassing for you to see that.

48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,520
Using sand as an excuse

49
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,000
to hide her sorrow,

50
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,840
she clearly doesn't want others to look down on her.

51
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,870
I shouldn't expose her.

52
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,470
No worries.

53
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,400
Let me blow it for you.

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,030
Don't move. It will be fine.

55
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,430
This time you're smart enough

56
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,630
to understand what I mean.

57
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,310
Saint Fajian

58
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,610
may look young,

59
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,680
but he's actually over 500 years old.

60
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
He's quite advanced in age.

61
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,870
Only by making him the leader

62
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,800
can our son

63
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,080
inherit the position sooner.

64
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,520
Such simple calculations,

65
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,910
you don't need to remind me.

66
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,680
Good boy!

67
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,120
How did they get tangled up together?

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,390
It's only been a few days,

69
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,270
and our son's flirting habit is back.

70
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,560
Who allowed you to criticize my son?

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,560
He can flirt with whoever he wants.

72
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,040
All right.

73
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,600
But, dear,

74
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,310
our house is already filled with beauties.

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,630
Isn't that enough for you?

76
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,600
If this keeps up,

77
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,430
my Jade Sky Palace

78
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,480
might as well be renamed

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,070
"The House of Blossoms."

80
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,190
That only proves our son's charm.

81
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,430
Feeling better now?

82
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,870
A bit better.

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,720
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

84
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,720
Didn't I act convincingly enough?

85
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,000
By the way...

86
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,920
My eye makeup...

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,270
It isn't messed up.

88
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,800
You still look stunning.

89
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,430
About yesterday...

90
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,950
did you resolve it?

91
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,360
You mean the matter with Mu Xuanling?

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,830
I gave her an artifact,

93
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,560
so things should be settled

94
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,560
according to reason.

95
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,800
A single artifact

96
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,800
can sever love and affection.

97
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,870
Indeed, eternal love is a myth.

98
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,680
But speaking of which,

99
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,040
Gao Qiumin really meets the standards

100
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,480
of a young mistress.

101
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,390
Too bad she's already spoken for,

102
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,560
engaged to Mr. Xie, isn't she?

103
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,040
Speaking of our son,

104
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,920
how could he flirt her

105
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,000
right under Mr. Xie's nose?

106
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,040
If they find out,

107
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,510
the Jade Sky Palace will be disgraced.

108
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,510
This child...

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,750
So what?

110
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,950
Don't say they're not married yet,

111
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,510
even if they were, divorce is always an option.

112
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
And what's wrong with remarrying?

113
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,310
Wait, are you implying something?

114
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,190
Why does this sound

115
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,310
like a hint directed at me?

116
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,190
Have you been planning

117
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,310
to divorce me all along?

118
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,920
I never thought about it before,

119
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,830
but now that you mention it...

120
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,430
Duan Xiaorong, you...

121
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,240
Alright, you're highly skilled.

122
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,390
Good for you!

123
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,310
Fine,

124
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,040
let's see who outlives the other.

125
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,800
When you're old and bedridden,

126
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,560
I'll...

127
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
I'll cut off your medicine!

128
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
Miss Gao, no need to be upset.

129
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,600
If Mr. Xie has wronged you,

130
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,360
then there's no reason to cling to that engagement.

131
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,750
Just find someone better.

132
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,800
Wait a second!

133
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,040
Who are you saying I'm engaged to?

134
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,510
Miss Gao, no need to deny it.

135
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,600
I understand everything.

136
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,600
You're engaged to Mr. Xie,

137
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,390
but he's fallen for Miss Mu instead.

138
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,960
It's truly heartbreaking.

139
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,760
Stop!

140
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,830
Don't talk nonsense!

141
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
Who said I'm engaged to Xie Xuechen?

142
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,600
I was wondering

143
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,820
why you've been acting so strange

144
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,800
and constantly talking to me.

145
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,310
Let me tell you, Mr. Fu,

146
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,190
I'm not engaged to Xie Xuechen!

147
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,950
He can like whoever he wants.

148
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,000
It's got nothing to do with me.

149
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,750
Don't make wild guesses!

150
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,010
Besides, Xie Xuechen

151
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,190
isn't some reckless playboy.

152
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,040
It's not nice to talk

153
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,040
behind his back.

154
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,070
How dare you!

155
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,310
What lovely weather today,

156
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,070
sunny and bright!

157
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,160
Quite pleasant.

158
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,040
So, are you saying

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,390
that the leaders, elders, and trusted disciples

160
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,950
of every sect in the Alliance all have inner demons,

161
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,310
making it impossible to tell

162
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,160
who has been possessed by the Dark Clan?

163
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,800
Including the sect leaders,

164
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,190
my master,

165
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,630
and even...

166
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,040
you, Mr. Xie.

167
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,270
Regarding this conclusion,

168
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,240
I can't determine if it's true or not.

169
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,600
Since yesterday until today,

170
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,160
have you noticed anything unusual?

171
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,920
Unusual?

172
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,950
Yes.

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,830
What kind of unusual?

174
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,160
I don't want to jump to conclusions

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,800
and would rather investigate further.

176
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,750
Do you think he will find anything?

177
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,870
Probably not,

178
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,030
but it doesn't matter.

179
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,080
After all, today's meditative observation

180
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,960
is meant to make those in the shadows think

181
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,840
we've run out of options.

182
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,390
Still, I'm a little curious

183
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,390
does our Mr. Xie

184
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,080
truly have inner demons?

185
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,080
You weren't in the Hall of Integrity earlier,

186
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,000
so I'm also curious

187
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,600
does Mr. Nan have inner demons as well?

188
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,910
Tomorrow is the handover of the Chaos Pearl.

189
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,550
Are you ready?

190
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,720
There's no perfect plan in this world,

191
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,630
only our best effort.

192
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,750
As always...

193
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,270
don't die.

194
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,390
Master.

195
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,480
You've never cared

196
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,550
about material things since childhood.

197
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,080
Even if your clothes were torn,

198
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,790
you wouldn't think to mend them.

199
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,610
If I weren't here,

200
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,600
who would look after you?

201
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,270
What is it?

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,790
Do you have something to say?

203
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,080
Yes.

204
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,550
Then sit down and speak.

205
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,910
Master, was the seal you gave me last night

206
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,030
really just a seal?

207
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,390
You little rascal,

208
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,840
are you doubting your master now?

209
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,150
When you have doubts in your heart,

210
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,960
you must clarify them.

211
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,390
Otherwise, once doubt arises,

212
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,480
even the strongest dam

213
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,670
can collapse overnight.

214
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,270
This is something you taught me.

215
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,600
I didn't teach you how to annoy me, though.

216
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,510
To answer your question,

217
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,630
the seal is just a seal.

218
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,510
No tricks were involved.

219
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,750
If the seal truly is just a seal,

220
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,670
then what is your obsession, Master?

221
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,280
If you must know my obsession,

222
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,480
it is simply to see our sect leader

223
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,910
become the Alliance Leader.

224
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,720
Now that my wish has come true,

225
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,630
there's nothing left to dwell on.

226
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,790
Do you believe

227
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,240
my words?

228
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,480
I do.

229
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,910
Sometimes, though, I feel

230
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,750
I've taught you to be too pure,

231
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,390
making you

232
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
easily deceived.

233
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,360
But a lesson learned from failure is still worthwhile.

234
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,480
Among all my disciples,

235
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,030
only you

236
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,080
have achieved detachment

237
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,360
without consciously striving for it.

238
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,840
Detachment brings freedom from inner demons.

239
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,870
Xuanxin,

240
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,240
your level

241
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,840
has already surpassed mine.

242
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,440
[Hall of Heritage]

243
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,550
Since the new Alliance Leader has been chosen,

244
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,960
the Chaos Pearl will be handed over tomorrow.

245
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,750
Though you've only been in the sect a short time,

246
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,000
the upcoming threat

247
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,910
of the Dark Clan

248
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,910
requires us to strengthen our defenses.

249
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,320
Tomorrow,

250
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,510
you will accompany me to the Pearl Tower

251
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,670
and guard it together.

252
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,000
- Understood!- Understood!

253
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,030
All right,

254
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,030
you may all leave now.

255
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,720
See you, Elder.

256
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,440
Mu Xuanling.

257
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,030
Look at yourself,

258
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,960
lost in thought.

259
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,480
Did you bother Mr. Xie again in the middle of the night?

260
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,870
What should I do with you?

261
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,560
Don't think that just because he protects you,

262
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,600
I won't criticize you.

263
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,440
These are dangerous times,

264
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,240
and threats are everywhere.

265
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,270
Mr. Xie is busy,

266
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,000
so can't you restrain yourself?

267
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
Besides, you've got a heavy workload.

268
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,600
Stop wasting time thinking about nonsense.

269
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,510
Got it?

270
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,240
Got it.

271
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,690
Hearing it is one thing,

272
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,840
but doing it is another.

273
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,390
Now go get some proper rest.

274
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,270
You'll need your energy.

275
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,200
As a disciple of the Snow City,

276
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,200
you can't be so tired!

277
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,150
Xuanling!

278
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,100
Senior.

279
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,150
Xuanling,

280
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,960
I wanted to talk to you earlier,

281
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,790
but Elder Cang was there.

282
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,790
What's the matter?

283
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,960
We're carrying out the mission tomorrow,

284
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,480
and the enemy remains hidden.

285
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,750
Who knows what might happen?

286
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,910
So, stick close to me tomorrow.

287
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,840
If anything happens,

288
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,870
I'll protect you!

289
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,150
By the way,

290
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,630
this is an artifact I've saved up.

291
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,840
It strengthens shields.

292
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,390
Be sure to keep it with you.

293
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,150
If I'm not mistaken,

294
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,790
you're younger than I.

295
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,670
But I joined the sect earlier than you.

296
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,550
You're the junior sister.

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,550
Why did you join the Snow City?

298
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,440
More than ten years ago,

299
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,980
the barrier of the Immortals Array

300
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,960
developed a crack,

301
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,510
and the Dark Clan emerged,

302
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,390
killing my entire village.

303
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,240
So,

304
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,440
you cultivate to seek revenge?

305
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,270
No.

306
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,150
Before they died, my parents said,

307
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,390
"Don't live with hatred."

308
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,200
Hatred can also nurture the Dark Clan.

309
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,480
Let's not talk about this anymore.

310
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,670
I need to go prepare.

311
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,200
You should go get ready too.

312
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,600
Tomorrow is a big day.

313
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,720
Take care.

314
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,510
I'm off.

315
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,860
[Hall of Heritage]

316
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,960
What a worthless artifact,

317
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,600
though it's kind of cute.

318
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,240
So, it turns out Miss Gao has no interest in Mr. Xie,

319
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,120
and they're not even engaged.

320
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,670
I was even advising her

321
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,840
not to be upset

322
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,600
over Mr. Xie's closeness with Miss Mu.

323
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,790
In her eyes,

324
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,390
I must look like a complete fool.

325
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,360
You seem to care so much.

326
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,870
Could it be

327
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,000
that you want to be friends with Miss Gao?

328
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,200
The more friends,

329
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,320
the better.

330
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,240
You're so kind to every girl.

331
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,720
No wonder Master Fu says

332
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,630
you're a playboy.

333
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
He says that about me?

334
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,480
Back in the day, he relied on his handsome looks

335
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,200
to flirt with everyone.

336
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,240
But you,

337
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,440
after all these years,

338
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,240
are you still searching for that dream girl?

339
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,320
Maybe...

340
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,080
I've already found her.

341
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,600
You have?

342
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,870
Which girl is it?

343
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,200
It's just a feeling.

344
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,960
I haven't confirmed it yet.

345
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,200
Once you confirm, tell me immediately.

346
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,200
Why are you

347
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,750
even more anxious than I am?

348
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm just curious!

349
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,670
Come on,

350
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,870
don't keep me waiting too long!

351
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,440
I don't want to wait too long either.

[Swirling Snow Pavilion]

353
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,160
The moon isn't even full tonight.

354
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,960
What are you doing out here?

355
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,400
When did you get here?

356
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,350
Since the moon rose.

357
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,480
Have you been here the whole time?

358
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,350
Yes. I was thinking about something

359
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,160
but unable to figure it out.

360
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,480
What were you thinking about?

361
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,680
Today, I went down the mountain

362
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
to a nearby town

363
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,400
and sat in a teahouse by the street

364
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,830
all afternoon.

365
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,790
Why?

366
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,790
I wanted to see

367
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,640
the world you're so determined to protect.

368
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,750
And how was it?

369
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,550
After sitting there all afternoon,

370
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,590
I saw thirty-two couples walk by,

371
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,200
but only a few held hands.

372
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,110
Why were you looking at other ladies?

373
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,550
Five of them were arguing.

At the food stalls,

375
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,880
there were 123 customers in total.

376
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,590
Nine children buying candied fruit skewers

377
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,920
and ten elderly people visiting the pharmacy.

378
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,830
The jeweler next door was a bit shady,

379
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,590
selling the same hairpin

380
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,880
to one customer for sixty wen,

381
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,360
then to the next

382
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,310
for ninety wen.

383
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,110
And then there was a gambling den nearby.

384
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,830
[Casino]

385
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,180
Lots of people coming and going,

386
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,000
but only a few left as winners.

387
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,700
[Fortune Casino]
Three people who lost everything

388
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,550
were thrown out.

389
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,590
If you've lost everything, don't come back!

390
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,110
There was also a petty thief

391
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,550
who stole someone's life savings.

392
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,590
People came and went on the streets,

393
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,830
but no one stepped forward

394
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,920
to help him in his despair.

395
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,240
Xie Xuechen,

396
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,240
I think it's not just you,

397
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,640
the whole human world is utterly boring.

398
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,830
Day after day,

399
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,960
people hustle

400
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,960
and bow their heads just for a few coins.

401
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,720
The so-called promises of love

402
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,510
fall apart under the weight of daily struggles.

403
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,590
Most couples grow to resent each other.

404
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,320
Desires run wild,

405
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,880
and greed knows no bounds.

406
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,830
Even knowing it's a trap,

407
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,920
people still jump in willingly.

408
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,110
Good people

409
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,070
don't always live to a ripe old age

410
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,750
to enjoy family blessings.

411
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,400
Bad people don't always get

412
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,400
the punishment they deserve.

413
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,480
In short,

414
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,920
the world is harsh, favoring the strong over the kind.

415
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,200
The numb refuse to awaken,

416
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,680
and those who awaken might not change.

417
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,310
Even those who change might not gain anything,

418
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,750
and those who gain

419
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,000
forget to cherish it.

420
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,160
So, this is the conclusion you've reached after an afternoon?

421
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,640
The human world is dull, cold,

422
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,240
and trivial?

423
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,720
And it deserves its fate.

424
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,580
Don't think I'm not aware

425
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,880
of what you and Nan Xuyue are planning.

426
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,240
You're in the open,

427
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,440
while the Dark Clan and the Decaying Immortal Pavilion hide in the shadows.

428
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,400
If you don't seize the initiative,

429
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,310
you'll always remain passive.

430
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,240
So,

431
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,640
you want to use the Chaos Pearl handover

432
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,000
to lure the enemy into the open,

433
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,240
don't you?

434
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,640
Yes.

435
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,070
This time, Ignorance Demon will come.

436
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,030
He's the cruelest of the Three Demons,

437
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,880
and a tough opponent.

438
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,830
Tough or not, we have to face it.

439
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,960
Xie Xuechen,

440
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,680
will the Immortal Alliance

441
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,030
be stable after tomorrow?

442
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,830
No.

443
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,640
Will the human world become better?

444
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,550
No.

445
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,440
Then why are you still charging ahead?

446
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,590
Why not just let them fend for themselves?

447
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,160
Do you think

448
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,110
the human world is a chaotic mess?

449
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,310
Obviously.

450
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
But amidst the chaos,

451
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,920
haven't you seen even a sliver of hope?

452
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,830
Just a tiny bit.

453
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,350
What's the point of such fragile hope?

454
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,070
Even a sliver of hope

455
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,270
is reason enough not to give up.

456
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,680
Just like that day

457
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,240
when I brought you back here.

458
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,240
Didn't you say

459
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,790
you wanted to leave the Dark Abyss

460
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,920
and live an ordinary life?

461
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,750
It's because I believed in that hope

462
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,590
that I brought you back to the Snow City.

463
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,960
Here,

464
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,960
you can live like an ordinary person,

465
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,030
train with them,

466
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,400
enjoy life,

467
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,030
without killing and looting,

468
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,270
brewing poison with flowers,

469
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,750
or sleeping with a blade at your side.

470
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,030
Belief

471
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,750
makes it possible.

472
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,070
Mu Xuanling,

473
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,550
you can't understand the human world in half a day.

475

Then we'll have to wait until tomorrow.

The succession ceremony begins!

532
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,350
After my father's passing,

533
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,240
the Immortal Alliance was left leaderless,

534
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,880
and the people have been restless.

535
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,440
The five sects jointly decided

536
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,640
that Saint Fajian of the Xuantian Sect

537
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,270
would assume the position of Alliance Leader.

538
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,110
Saint Fajian,

539
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,310
please.

540
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,590
I was a close friend of the late Alliance Leader Xie Daocheng,

541
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,400
and deeply understood that Leader Xie

542
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,830
was devoted to the welfare of the people.

543
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,830
He worked tirelessly to ensure the stability

544
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,920
of the Immortal Alliance.

545
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,400
Henceforth,

546
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,680
I will devote myself wholeheartedly

547
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,350
to continuing to prioritize the people's welfare,

548
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,480
upholding the prestige of the Immortal Alliance,

549
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,070
and solidifying its foundation.

550
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,240
On behalf of the Snow City,

551
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,350
I congratulate the new Alliance Leader.

552
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,960
Allow me to unlock

553
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,310
the seal on the Pearl Tower for you.

554
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,400
Please follow me.

555
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,200
All you need to do is place the tokens inside,

556
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,960
and the artifact will activate,

557
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,310
allowing you to retrieve the Chaos Pearl.

558
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,510
I had originally thought this tower

559
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,510
was merely a container for the Chaos Pearl,

560
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,480
but it turns out

561
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,590
the tower itself is an artifact.

562
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,480
Indeed.

563
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,060
My father knew

564
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,590
there were those who desired the Chaos Pearl,

565
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,440
swearing to throw the world into chaos.

566
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,550
To ensure its safety,

567
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,400
he poured all his knowledge

568
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,070
into transforming the entire tower into an artifact.

569
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,920
Xuanling, look!

570
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,640
That's the Chaos Pearl!

571
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
It's my first time seeing it too.

572
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,790
It's so beautiful.

573
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,160
Truly worthy of being an ancient divine artifact.

574
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,400
The Chaos Pearl has left the Pearl Tower.

575
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,030
The enemy watches from the shadows.

576
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,270
This is not a place to linger.

577
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,200
We shall

578
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,650
escort the Chaos Pearl

579
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,480
back to the Xuantian Sect,

580
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,160
and secure it in the Eternal Stone Cave.

581
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,000
It will be kept safe without fail.

582
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,160
Sir, don't worry.

583
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,350
Nan Xuyue!

584
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,590
Everyone, remain calm.

585
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,550
This is the Lofty Cloud Array,

586
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,170
specially devised by Mr. Nan for today.

587
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:37,830
Whether it's the Dark Clan

588
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,480
or a traitor within the Immortal Alliance,

589
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,110
they cannot escape it.

590
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,720
Mr. Xie,

591
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,830
what is the meaning of this?

592
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,160
The day I entered the Immortals Array to repair the barrier,

593
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,920
I was ambushed by a pre-planned trap set by the Dark Clan.

594
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,090
My father, at the Spiritual Form stage,

595
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,140
was secluded in the Snow City

596
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,000
but was silently assassinated.

597
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,830
This proves that among the Alliance's top cultivators,

598
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,830
there is a traitor colluding with the Dark Abyss.

599
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,160
Now, with the Dark Clan invading,

600
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,480
their location remains hidden.

601
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,270
Someone must be helping them hide.

602
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,070
Their goal is the Chaos Pearl.

603
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,790
Even if they have stayed still until now,

604
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,960
they will surely act today.

605
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,200
Sir, please recite the curse

606
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,000
with your disciples

607
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,750
to first eliminate the Dark Clan.

608
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,240
The curse?

609
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But I also bear demonic energy...

610
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:26,880
No.

611
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,920
Xie Xuechen did this on purpose.

612
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,720
Another open scheme,

613
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,200
luring the enemy out.

614
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,070
If he were in the Dark Abyss,

615
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,960
he'd make a fine strategist.

616
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,030
Mr. Xie's reasoning is sound.

617
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,030
However,

618
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,750
my disciples recently used the curse

619
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,030
for an extensive search

620
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,590
but found no trace of the Dark Clan.

621
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,920
Trying again now

622
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,790
may yield the same result.

623
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,160
That is precisely why I asked you all

624
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,790
to gather here.

625
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,030
Within this Pearl Tower,

626
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,760
my father set a mechanism against the Dark Clan.

627
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,480
With the Pearl Tower as the array's core,

628
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,240
the Lofty Cloud Array

629
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,750
can amplify the power of the curse

630
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,200
several times over.

631
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,000
Sir,

632
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,030
please recite the curse.

633
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,400
Fine.

634
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,480
Ignorance Demon!

635
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,750
Senior!

636
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,160
Miss Mu!

637
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,110
Among us,

638
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,630
Saint Fajian has the most steadfast faith.

639
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,190
No one could have imagined

640
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,320
that even he would fall prey to your Dark Clan invasion.

641
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,110
A steadfast faith?

642
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,800
Cultivators of the Immortal Alliance

643
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,440
often believe that high cultivation equates to a stable faith.

644
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,480
You are wrong,

645
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,800
completely wrong!

646
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,030
Fajian harbors an obsession with eliminating demons.

647
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,440
But with his advanced age,

648
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,510
he increasingly worries

649
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,880
about dying before fulfilling his lifelong wish.

650
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,180
The more he rushes to succeed,

651
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,280
the more unstable his faith becomes.

652
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,550
He himself has realized this,

653
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,710
however,

654
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,630
it is too late.

655
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,400
He can no longer resist the demonic influence!

656
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,550
You think that by controlling Saint Fajian,

657
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,800
you can seize the Chaos Pearl?

658
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,360
Fajian has five centuries of cultivation.

659
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,890
Aside from you,

660
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,000
no one here is his match.

661
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
But what a pity,

662
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,900
you, the once-greatest sword cultivator,

663
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,590
now possess less than forty percent of your power.

664
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,670
Once I finish off you fools,

665
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,800
taking the Chaos Pearl will be effortless!

666
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,030
Xie Xuechen!

667
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,550
Miss Mu!

668
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,000
Miss Mu!

669
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,170
Miss Mu!

670
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:26,960
Miss Mu...

671
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,480
Why is the demonic energy

672
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,840
suddenly fluctuating within her body?

673
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,960
Yinian!

674
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,710
- Are you okay? - Mr. Xie.

675
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,190
Senior has fallen into demonic possession,

676
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,700
and I am powerless to stop him.

677
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,000
The sect leaders

678
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,840
should be able to handle him.

679
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,000
Mr. Xie,

680
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,880
your spiritual power has not fully recovered.

681
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,380
It's better to hide

682
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,150
inside the Pearl Tower for now.

683
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,590
Today,

684
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,110
life and death are unpredictable,

685
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,440
but the Chaos Pearl

686
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,590
must never fall into the hands of the Dark Clan.

687
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,190
I'll escort the Chaos Pearl back to the Xuantian Sect.

688
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,110
The Eternal Stone Cave there

689
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,630
can block all evil influences.

690
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,760
It will ensure the Chaos Pearl's safety.

691
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,480
Do you think this battle

692
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,760
is a guaranteed loss for the Immortal Alliance,

693
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,080
which is why you speak

694
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,070
such self-contradictory words?

695
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,190
Mr. Xie,

696
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,630
what do you mean?

697
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,550
It was Saint Fajian who discovered the Dark Clan

698
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,220
and instructed Xuanxin to lead disciples

699
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,550
in a city-wide search using the curse.

700
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,550
This proves he had not fallen into demonic possession at the time.

701
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,880
Given Saint Fajian's cultivation level,

702
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,710
it would have taken Ignorance Demon

703
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,590
far more than a moment to possess him successfully.

704
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,760
Thus,

705
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,800
there's only one possibility.

706
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,030
On that day, a powerful cultivator

707
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,860
willingly allowed Ignorance Demon to hide within him

708
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,070
and later helped Ignorance Demon.

709
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,320
Now it seems clear...

710
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,280
it was you, Saint Yinian.

711
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,360
Your spiritual power has not fully recovered.

712
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,440
So what if you figured it out?

713
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,510
You've suspected me for some time, right?

714
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,880
Not exactly.

715
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,800
It was Ignorance Demon's exposure today

716
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,110
that helped me

717
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,510
piece it together.

718
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,070
You guessed right.

719
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
The night before, I debated with Senior.

720
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,710
He noticed something unusual about me.

721
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,980
But I was prepared,

722
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,640
binding him with an array

723
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
and letting Ignorance Demon ambush him,

724
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,320
slowly influencing his inner demons.

725
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,880
It took an entire night

726
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,440
to finally possess him.

727
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,400
So,

728
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,190
you were also the one who opened the two-way array

729
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,110
to let Ignorance Demon into the Snow City that day?

730
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:55,920
Yes.

731
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,510
You killed my father?

732
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,150
Why?

733
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,880
You should know,

734
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,400
even in death,

735
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,150
he would never hand over

736
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,440
the Snow City's token.

737
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,880
But only with his death,

738
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,030
the position of Alliance Leader would become vacant.

739
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,360
The Alliance Leader...

740
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,130
just for the position?

741
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:22,630
Yes!

742
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,320
I wanted Senior to become the Alliance Leader.

743
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,150
So, when Saint Fajian refused,

744
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,920
you had Ignorance Demon possess him

745
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,440
to make him agree on his behalf?

746
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,800
If Senior were conscious,

747
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,880
he would never agree to become the Alliance Leader.

748
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,150
This was my only option.

749
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,670
Mr. Xie, you are a reasonable man.

750
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,320
The Immortal Alliance has already lost today.

751
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,670
The Chaos Pearl is in my hands now.

752
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,760
Why not open the barrier

753
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,480
and save your life in exchange?

754
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,670
Do you think I fear death?

755
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,480
If you didn't fear death,

756
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,400
why waste so many words with me?

757
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,400
Naturally, to make you reveal more.

758
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,760
Since I've set this trap today,

759
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,960
do you think I'd use the real Chaos Pearl?

760
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,280
When retrieving the Chaos Pearl earlier,

761
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,710
I had already prepared a brilliant light.

762
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,190
You used the brilliant light as a distraction,

763
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,230
swapping the real for a fake

764
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,480
to deceive me?

765
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,710
Perhaps you didn't know,

766
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,960
but the Greenview Heights has a type of spirit bead

767
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,960
called the Amplifying Bead.

768
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,960
You...

769
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,110
you let everyone hear our conversation?

770
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,010
After all this guessing,

771
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,360
the traitor turns out to be Yinian!

772
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,400
So what if you all know?

773
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,770
Xie Xuechen's spiritual power is less than forty percent.

774
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,010
With just a few of you,

775
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,640
you cannot stop me.

776
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,030
Stop wasting time.

777
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,840
Let's settle this quickly!

778
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,480
Father! Mother!

779
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,360
- Don't come near! - Master!

780
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,760
Boundless Mountain!

781
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,920
That's Fajian's ultimate move, Boundless Mountain.

782
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,670
Once unleashed,

783
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,480
