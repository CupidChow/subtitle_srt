18
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,150
Master told me to let him go.

19
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,200
So that

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,510
he owes me one for saving his life.

21
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,560
Now I can follow him

22
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,640
in search of a chance to get a token of the Immortal Alliance.

23
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,680
That doesn't add up.

24
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,230
If His Grace did order this,

25
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,150
why sent us to pursue him?

26
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,000
To make it look real.

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,920
How else can I make Xie Xuechen believe me?

28
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,510
He's not

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,000
some stupid low-ranking member of the Dark Clan.

30
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,680
Since you are already here,

31

try to trap him for the time being.

32
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,360
I will intervene

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,400
at the right time to save him.

34
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,430
In that case,

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,680
he'll owe me one more life.

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,310
On the other hand,

people's desire

38
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,150
is always about fortune, sex, and fame.

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,840
I'm a little curious about the desire

I've made a mistake.

55

Were you looking for that little snow cat?

56
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,710
It will never come to the Snow Cliff again.

57
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,030

though snow cats are demonic animals,

in danger.

103
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,950
Since your goal of cultivation

104
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,270
is to think for all lives in the world,

105
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,630
the thought focused on your sword

106
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,920
should be forward.

107
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,120
You shall forget about life and death.

108
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,430
You can't love one person or one object

109
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,680
more than others in the world.

110
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,870

Because he has no desire or greed.

No desire or greed.

115
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,920
How is that possible?

116
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,430
His cultivation

He sees fame as nothing but fog.

119
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,040
Additionally, he has been forced to work

120
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,310
on the way of detached.

121
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,800
If he doesn't even care

122
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,920
about his life,

123
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,750
what desire could he possibly have?

124
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,800
Desire Demon,

can your Cage of Greed

show more memories?

127
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,510
Like his memories

128
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
ten years ago?

129
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,510
Saintess,

130
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,510
this is the Cage of Greed.

131
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,190
Things not related to greed…

132
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,800
cannot be displayed.

133
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,480
In that case,

134
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,800
you are doing no good here.

135
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,270
Saintess,

136
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,950
what is this?

137
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
Haven't I been

138
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,070
obvious enough?

139
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,510
You are going to kill me.

140
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,950
We could just

141
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,430
put on a show for Xie Xuechen.

142
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,920
There's no need to kill me.

143

If you kill me,

144
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,830
my true form will know.

145
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,800
Oh, you don't know.

146

The Illusion Elixir has a defect.

147
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,600
What is it?

148
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,390
You'll see

149
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,040
when you die.

150
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,920
You have betrayed the Dark Abyss.

151
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,160
Mu Xuanling, you…

152
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,390
I can't believe that Mr. Xie,

a master in the spiritual form level,

154
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,160
would snatch the trophy of a lady.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,920
That's not right.

156
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,950
A lady.

157
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,720
Why didn't you think

158
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,830
about right and wrong

159
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,390
when you were threatening me?

160
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,190
Fine.

161
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,120
You can have it.

162
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,600
You can keep everything

163
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,430
that I have.

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,800
You are dead.

165
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,070
No, you are.

166
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,680
How did that happen?

167
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,750
How could I know?

168
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,830
You don't know?

169
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,430
Why should she know?

170
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,750
I mean,

171
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,160
she was there when she died, shouldn't she know?

172
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,480
Who would know? You?

173
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Clearly, something is wrong

174
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,560
with the Illusion Elixir.

175
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,390
True forms only know

176
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,430
the projections are dead.

177
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,270
We don't know what happened before that

178
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,870
or who killed

179
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,870
the projection.

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,040
If I get the name

181
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,950
of the cultivator who made the elixir,

182
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,720
I will eat him alive!

183
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,680
Stop it.

184
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,000
Save

185
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,630
your big words.

186
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,070
You were so confident

187
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,950
and tough

188
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,070
before you went out.

189
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,100
You said you would get Saintess

190
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,070
and Xie Xuechen back.

191
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,310
And how did that go?

192
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,800
If you are so good,

193
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,550
why don't you go?

194
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,030
When I'm able to summon my projection,

195
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,340
you don't need…

196
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,890
We don't know

197
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,000
whether Desire Demon was killed by Xie Xuechen

198
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,270
or Saintess,

199
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,600
but we do know

200
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,000
that one of them attacked for a kill.

201
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,030
There's no need to hold back

202
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,240
when we see them again.

203
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,600
Aren't you worried that he might

204
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,120
remember what happened when he wakes up?

205
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,600
He's just an ordinary human.

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,320
What if he's so scared that he loses his mind?

207
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,270
He won't.

208
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,200
After being possessed by a member of the Dark Clan,

209
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,120
he won't know anything when he wakes up.

210
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,870
Even if someone tells him

211
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,200
or he tries countless times to recollect,

212
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,840
he still won't remember.

213
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,320
You know quite well about that.

214
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,080
Have you

215
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,270
been possessed by a member of the Dark Clan before?

216
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,150
Mr. Xie,

217
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,360
I did take an arrow

218
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,320
for you earlier.

219
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,080
Though it happened in the illusion,

220
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,870
it still hurts.

221
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,200
You are not even asking about my injury.

222
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,150
How about

223
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,790
you let me consume the demonic essence

224
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,200
of Desire Demon?

225
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,670
I can gain some power.

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,320
What do I get

227
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,390
from you gaining power?

228
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,870
Is it possible to talk some sense into you?

229
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,270
Where are you going?

230
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,200
Greenview Heights, right?

231
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,910
There are only

232
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,840
two major locations nearby.

233
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,360
One is the Mirage Palace,

234
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,030
and the other one is the Greenview Heights.

235
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,790
Mirage Palace

236
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,240
is one of the five sects of the Immortal Alliance,

237
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,510
but you haven't identified

238
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,440
the traitor yet.

239
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,960
You will not travel there considering the situation.

240
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,570
Though the Greenview Heights

241
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,150
is not a part of the Immortal Alliance,

242
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,360
they are widely known

243
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,320
for their sophisticated arrays.

244
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,390
I even heard that the owner of the Greenview Heights

245
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,000
invented a teleporting array

246
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,030
that could send someone to thousands of miles away in an instant.

247
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,130
You want to use the teleporting array

248
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,320
to get back to the Snow City quickly,

249
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,240
right?

250
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,150
Miss Mu,

251
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,490
I, Xie Xuechen,

252
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,510
am not an ungrateful man.

253
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,870
You saved me.

254
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,670
For that, I should thank you.

255
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,120
But we are not the same kind of people.

256
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,440
If you keep following me,

257
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,150
there will be a fight between us

258
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,360
when I get my spiritual power back.

259
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,600
It's better for us

260
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,600
to separate our ways here.

261
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,360
You should know that there's a saying

262
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,080
that all roads lead to the same destination.

263
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,240
If a road becomes my obstacle,

264
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,080
I'll wipe the road

265
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,080
off the map.

266
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,790
Why do you have to haunt me like this?

267
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,080
What do you want?

268
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
What if I tell you

269
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,790
that I want to start a new life and follow your lead?

270
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,270
Do you think it's a happy life working for Sang Qi?

271
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,240
Members of the Spirit Clan are mostly

272
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,550
driven off or enslaved by humans.

273
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,510
I had to obey him.

274
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,360
I have been wanting

275
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,550
to leave that place for a long time now.

276
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,000
Things are interesting

277
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,150
when I'm with you.

278
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,910
Being a common person

279
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,630
is actually nice.

280
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,630
You could just get rid of your demonic power

281
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,630
and be a common person.

282
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,150
My spiritual apertures are damaged.

283
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,080
I can't gain spiritual power.

284
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,870
The demonic power

285
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
is the only thing I can rely on.

286
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,080
However,

287
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,200
if I would get rid

288
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,840
of my demonic power for you

289
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,630
and become a common person,

290
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,240
will you protect me?

291
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,960
Do you think I would buy it?

292
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,440
Either way,

293
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,960
you don't have the power to fight me right now.

294
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,910
I'm also

295
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,720
looking for an answer.

296
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,720
Before that,

297
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,480
you have to stay by my side.

298
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,360
Mr. Xie.

299
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,150
They may have the Illusion Elixir,

300
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,960
but we have the Anti-illusion Hairpin.

301
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,720
The Desire Demon can summon projections now.

302
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,910
Ignorance Demon and Anger Demon can't be too far behind.

303
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,870
Our journey ahead is not optimistic.

304
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,600
To avoid being detected by the Demon Array,

305
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,480
we need more than hiding our energy.

306
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,610
The Anti-illusion Hairpin

307
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,030
masks one's face.

308
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,630
When others see you,

309
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,360
you'd look

310
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,270
so ordinary

311
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,390
that they will forget you in an instant.

312
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,360
I have one as well.

313
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,550
They are a pair.

314
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,390
Put it on for me.

315
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,200
Such a difficult man.

316
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,300
[He'd steal the horse and leave me behind]

317
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
[when I'm being so gentle. Difficult.]

318
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,870
How many members of the Dark Clan have you killed?

319
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,600
Quite a lot.

320
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,200
That's less than my kills.

321
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,270
What are you writing?

322
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
Your habits and preferences.

323
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,870
I heard

324
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,960
that two have to be intimate

325
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,630
to spend their lives together.

326
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,120
Why are you always so defensive?

327
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,840
Since we met,

328
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,480
all I've been doing is helping you.

329
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,750
To be intimate.

330
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,630
Then what?

331
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,030
Take a walk!

332
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,910
The minds of cultivators

333
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,960
are crystal clear and indestructible.

334
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,030
Once their inner demons are triggered,

335
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,600
they'll become mortals.

336
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,910
Even with sufficient spiritual power,

337
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,960
they'd be powerless when facing

338
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,720
members of the Dark Clan.

339
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,960
Maybe

340
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,960
that's what you want.

341
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,320
Do you really not know

342
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,720
what I want?

343
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,200
We've been staying together for a while now.

344
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,080
You have never asked

345
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,510
which spirit clan I belong to.

346
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,550
Don't you want to

347
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,240
know me better?

348
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,480
I'm not asking.

349
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,870
You are going to tell me anyway.

350
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,030
I'm a Viny Spirit.

351
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,720
As a child,

352
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,030
half of my face

353
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,670
was covered in vine-like demon patterns.

354
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,840
This half.

355
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,150
A prominently

356
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,320
large area.

357
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,720
People usually don't forget

358
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,870
something like that.

359
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,440
You don't remember it even one bit.

360
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,480
What did you say?

361
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,550
Nothing.

362
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,590
Bad memory.

363
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,960
It's getting late.

364
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,750
We should find a staging post.

365
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,440
Even if you don't need rest,

366
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,640
think about the horse.

367
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,750
Think for all lives in the world.

368
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,160
That horse is one of them.

369
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,270
Xie Xuechen.

370
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
I'm also one of them.

371
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,460
[Relaxation Inn]

372
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,080
Make yourselves at home.

373
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,110
Coming!

374
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,570
Waiter, two more pots of liquor here.

375
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,590
Yes.

376
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,830
Sir, here's your liquor.

377
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,880
Owner,

378
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,750
two rooms, please.

379
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,510
Madam,

380
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,680
I'm so sorry.

381
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,880
We are nearly fully booked today.

382
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,640
There's only

383
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,110
one room left.

384
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,440
Could you

385
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,750
share a room

386
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,880
with your servant?

387
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,640
No.

388
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,090
Do come back!

389
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,510
How about you stay

390
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,240
with my staff?

391
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,000
Great.

392
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,680
What's great about that?

393
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,440
How bad is your eyesight?

394
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,110
He's my husband.

395
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,590
I'm sorry for the abruptness.

396
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,790
Please accept my apology.

397
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,750
Waiter.

398
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,750
Take our guests to the Premium Room 1.

399
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,830
Yes.

400
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,070
Madam and sir, this way, please.

401
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,070
Please.

402
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,070
They are a strange couple.

403
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,030
The guy seems to be forced.

404
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,480
Is he held hostage?

405
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,680
That guy may seem weak,

406
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,720
but he looks spirited.

407
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,240
Though I can't feel his spiritual energy,

408
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,000
he should be a good fighter among the common people.

409
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,030
That woman

410
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,550
looks ordinary.

411
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,110
She can't hold him hostage.

412
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,000
I heard that there are a lot of demons nearby.

413
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,000
Maybe…

414
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,920
Brother,

415
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,000
you are worrying too much.

416
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,830
They are just two common people.

417
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,030
They don't have the demonic energy.

418
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,960
I heard

419
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,350
that this place has a rough custom.

420
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,640
Women would force guys

421
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,510
to be their husbands.

422
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,880
That woman is clearly

423
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,160
from a well-off family.

424
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,750
That man may look ordinary,

425
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,030
but he has a great figure,

426
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,110
and he looks spirited.

427
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,200
There must be something special about him.

428
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,790
That's why you are the sophisticated one.

429
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,110
Mr. Xie,

430
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,160
there is something special about you.

431
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,590
Take care, sir.

432
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,070
Madam. Sir. This is your room.

433
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,200
The Premium Room 1.

434
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,000
[Premium Room 1]

435
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,480
This way.

436
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,960
Judging from the patterns

437
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,070
on the cultivators' clothes,

438
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,200
they must be from the Mirage Palace.

439
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,680
What are they doing here?

440
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,550
Is there

441
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,680
a high-ranking cultivator of the Mirage Palace here?

442
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,550
Mr. Xie,

443
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,030
are you thinking about sending them a message?

444
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,400
What do you want?

445
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,070
Are you worried that I may silence you once and for all?

446
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,030
Isn't that your intention?

447
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,440
Maybe.

448
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,640
Maybe not.

449
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,310
Your worrying is not baseless.

450
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,030
I'm not a good person.

451
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,000
You are not a person.

452
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,920
There's demonic energy.

453
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,000
I've hidden mine well.

454
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,530
Take care of our guests!

455
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,510
Take care, sir.

456
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,590
Ladies, welcome.

457
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,340
[Gao Qiumin, Young Lord of the Mirage Palace]

458
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,030
Miss Gao!

459
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,000
- Miss Gao! - Miss Gao.

460
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,920
It's been a while.

461
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,880
- Please sit down. - It's her.

462
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,240
This humble dish is on the house.

463
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,590
Enjoy.

464
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,590
Thank you.

465
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,680
Miss Gao,

466
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,720
we've been waiting for you to come back.

467
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,830
Lu and I

468
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,960
have checked the east side.

469
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,720
We didn't find anything.

470
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,070
Have you

471
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,160
spotted any abnormality?

472
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,240
[Cui Wanwan]
Mr. Song.

473
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,480
[Disciple of the Mirage Palace]
You have no idea.

474
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,000
A member of the Spirit Clan sneaked up on Miss Gao and me.

475
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,480
Which Spirit Clan?

476
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,240
Are you hurt?

477
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,830
Miss Gao is talented

478
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,820
and skillful.

479
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,040
Who would be able to hurt me

480
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,350
with her there?

481
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,240
Oh, right!

482
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,590
This is the one.

483
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,240
This little bold demonic animal.

484
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,510
Miss Gao said

485
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,240
that this is a Treasure Sniffer, one of the ten rare animals.

486
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,920
It has the best hearing

487
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,200
and nose.

488
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,510
They can find

489
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,640
any treasure.

490
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:57,920
Give it to me.

491
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,030
Here.

492
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,680
Miss Gao and I

493
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,790
ran into it.

494
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,590
There's no way to tell where this little guy

495
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,000
got so many treasures.

496
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,160
Those are all rare sacred relics.

497
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,790
Tell me about it.

498
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,440
Little mouse,

499
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,720
you've stolen so many valuables.

500
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,400
The Spirit Management Bureau will not let you off

501
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,750
if they catch you.

502
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,880
Miss Gao,

503
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,830
you seem to adore

504
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
the Treasure Sniffer a lot.

505
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,590
Are you going to make it a spiritual animal?

506
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,920
The Treasure Sniffer is a rare animal,

507
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,920
but it seems quite weak.

508
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,310
It can't help you in combat.

509
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,880
I don't think it can make a good spiritual animal.

510
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,790
I, alone,

511
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,920
am enough to face enemies.

512
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,350
What do I need a spiritual animal for?

513
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,830
Miss Gao is right on point.

514
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,270
I heard

515
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,960
that Mr. Xie of the Snow City

516
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,030
roam the world

517
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,000
with just his sword.

518
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,440
He never needed the help of a spiritual animal.

519
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,310
Miss Gao and Mr. Xie

520
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,720
are both talented cultivators.

521
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,110
We cannot hope to compare with you.

522
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,000
Agreed.

523
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:47,960
All right.

524
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,550
We have business here.

525
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,830
Let's take a rest

526
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,480
and get back to searching.

527
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
- Yes. - Yes.

528
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,830
Little mouse,

529
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,200
look at your golden ears.

530
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,240
You are so cute.

531
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,200
Treasure Sniffers are timid.

532
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,720
Their gallbladders may break

533
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,790
if scared and causing death.

534
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,680
Look at its ears.

535
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,000
The more they shake, the brighter they are.

536
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,310
That may seem beautiful,

537
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,790
but it is the sign of gallbladder breaking.

538
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,960
Who's there?

539
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,110
Who is it?

540
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,070
Over there!

541
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,510
What is this?

542
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,400
They are coming up

543
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
to deal with us.

544
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,480
That's your problem.

545
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,270
We are in no condition

546
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,070
to draw boundaries.

547
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,880
What are you doing?

548
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,000
Work with me!

549
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,750
Who are you?

550
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,880
Why did you barge into my room?

551
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,400
I'm sorry.

552
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,160
Sorry.

553
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,200
Leave!

554
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:52,920
Let's go.

555
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,940
Come on.

556
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,720
Close the door!

557
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,830
They don't have the energy of the Spirit Clan.

558
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,400
Get up!

559
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,070
No.

560
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,640
What if

561
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,640
they are still listening

562
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,240
outside?

563
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,590
We are already in this situation.

564
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,880
How about

565
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,680
we go along with it?

566
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,030
Let me go!

567
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,350
Haven't you had enough fun?

568
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,640
No.

569
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:37,920
The three of you

570
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,070
search the perimeter.

571
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,000
We might get struck by the Spirit Clan tonight.

572
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,110
We will keep looking

573
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,590
for Xie Xuechen first thing tomorrow morning.

574
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,200
Yes, Miss Gao.

575
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,960
Let's go.

576
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,550
So, you are the one they are looking for.

577
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,790
In the Mirage Palace, there's only one woman

578
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,440
with high status

579
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,640
named Gao.

580
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,880
The once Young Lady

581
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,510
of the Moonlight Heights

582
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,440
and the current

583
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,720
direct disciple of the Mirage Palace,

584
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,960
Gao Qiumin.

585
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,960
So what?

586
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,880
I heard that

587
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,400
she has a marriage arrangement with you.

588
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,400
Lying in bed with me

589
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,550
under your fiance's nose.

590
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,440
Isn't that exciting?

591
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,110
She's not my fiance.

592
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,680
Are you explaining to me

593
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,960
so that I won't be annoyed?

594
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,830
Xie Xuechen.

595
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,640
We should be a couple.

596
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,310
I will treat you better than her.

597
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,640
I've never seen a person

598
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,110
as shameless as you are.

599
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,200
You've got half of it.

600
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,240
I'm not a person,

601
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,550
but I am a little shameless.

602
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,640
A little?

603
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,720
Mr. Xie, your heart

604
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,480
is beating really fast.

605
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,030
Is that because of me?

606
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,440
Do you have feelings for me now?

607
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,240
Yes.

608
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,310
The feeling of killing you.

609
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,720
All right.

610
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,790
That's still a kind of feeling.

611
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,070
You will

612
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,480
remember me, at least.

613
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,960
What I fear

614
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,200
is that you won't remember me.

615
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,420
[Relaxation Inn]

616
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,440
Treasure Sniffer.

617
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,240
Didn't you run off?

618
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,310
What are you doing back here?

619
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,310
Do you smell treasure on me?

620
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,640
Miss!

621
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,350
You can talk!

622
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,830
Can you transform into a human form?

623
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,720
I…

624
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,270
I just learned how to do it.

625
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,460
[Bao]

626
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,880
You are a cute young girl.

627
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,160
Come.

628
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,640
Get up.

629
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:48,720
Sit.

630
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,070
Where are your parents?

631
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,350
My father has left

632
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,070
and my mother is at home.

633
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,270
Did you sneak out?

634
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,880
Don't be afraid.

635
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,070
He won't hurt you.

636
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,510
I just want to find Father.

637
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,750
I didn't do anything bad.

638
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,070
Don't take me to the Spirit Management Bureau.

639
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,550
Mother said

640
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,790
that Father

641
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,160
was the richest cultivator in the world.

642
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,510
He left

643
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,880
all those valuables to me.

644
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,440
I didn't steal anything.

645
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,200
I swear.

646
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,750
The richest sect would be

647
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,550
the Jade Sky Palace.

648
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,680
Is your father

649
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,750
the lord of the Jade Sky Palace?

650
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,590
Don't knock it.

651
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,750
What's your father's name?

652
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,200
Fu… Fu Cangli.

653
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,920
Mister, do you know my father?

654
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,790
The family name of the lord of the Jade Sky Palace is Fu.

655
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
But I've never heard

656
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,920
of someone named Fu Cangli from the Jade Sky Palace.

657
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,720
What's your name?

658
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,110
Bao.

659
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,480
Have you never registered at the Spirit Management Bureau?

660
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,550
Mother said that they would

661
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,030
put a spirit lock on me,

662
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,160
and I would be controlled by humans.

663
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,510
I will be a slave for my whole life.

664
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,480
Mother said that it's not right.

665
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,880
I heard that you've been in seclusion for years,

666
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,400
and you seldom left Snow City.

667
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,020
It seems that you don't know the situation

668
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,070
of the Spirit Clan very well.

669
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,720
The oppression humans put on the Spirit Clan

670
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,720
is worse than ever.

671
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,440
Members of Spirit Clan

672
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,830
who are registered at the Spirit Management Bureau

673
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,750
will become slaves for humans.

674
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,070
They will be beaten, scolded, killed,

675
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,960
and be sold as the owners want.

676
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,480
They will never have freedom.

677
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,000
Those who are not registered

678
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,070
are not deemed as good demons.

679
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,440
They are killable

680
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,680
regardless of their behaviors.

681
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,790
That's the rules

682
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,000
that humans set on their own.

683
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,790
How unreasonable?

684
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,510
How shameless?

685
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,590
Shall I take you home?

686
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,640
I've lost all my valuables.

687
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,030
I've lost all the valuables

688
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,960
my father left.

689
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,680
I can't go home like this.

690
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,270
There, there.

691
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,960
Don't cry.

692
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,160
I'll get them back for you.

693
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,750
All right?

694
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,310
Gao Qiumin is quite powerful.

695
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,480
Don't look for trouble.

696
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,240
Gao Qiumin

697
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,640
robbed Bao.

698
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,160
I'm just helping her to get her things back.

699
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,400
It's how it should be.

700
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,270
Since this is a misunderstanding,

701
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,000
just explain to them.

702
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,240
Do you think they would believe us?

703
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,590
Do you think they won't turn Bao

704
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,640
to the Spirit Management Bureau?

705
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,110
Mr. Xie, you are a human.

706
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,920
I understand that you'd speak for humans.

707
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,240
But I am from the Spirit Clan.

708
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,510
I will fight for justice for my kind.

709
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,510
You have your own ideas of right and wrong.

710
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,350
I'm not trying to persuade you.

711
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,310
Just stay out of my way.

712
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,440
Where are they?

713
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,400
Miss Gao,

714
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,240
what…

715
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,830
I sensed that something was not right.

716
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,960
Why would a couple

717
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,790
wear shoes when they are in bed?

718
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,590
It was clearly a cover-up.

719
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,590
Thanks to the intelligence of Miss Gao,

720
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,070
your cover was blown.

721
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,790
Miss Gao, you are incredible.

722
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,750
I told you to be patient.

723
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,590
You should have taken off my shoes

724
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,720
before taking off my clothes.

725
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:44,510
You see?

726
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,480
That has caused misunderstanding.

727
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,110
Remember it next time.

728
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,400
Things like that

729
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,350
require patience.

730
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
But

731
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,240
I do like your way.

732
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,160
Stop with the disgusting talk.

733
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,400
Do not try to fool me

734
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,070
with your words.

735
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,200
This is the day

736
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,830
that you will be captured

737
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,640
with the Treasure Sniffer.

738
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,750
Get them!

739
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:24,880
You…

740
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,790
Who is it?

741
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,240
It's so late. People need to sleep!

742
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,240
I'm sorry.

743
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,030
Demonic cultivator!

744
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:49,790
Get them!

745
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,200
A human and a demonic cultivator

746
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,350
colluding together

747
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,880
can never be a good thing.

748
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,550
I'm going to

749
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,160
take your heads today.

750
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,400
Miss,

751
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,440
we have no evil intentions.

752
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,400
Save your words.

753
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,920
I've long heard

754
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,590
the Array of Flowery Edges of the Mirage Palace.

755
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,960
If it is

756
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,440
your lord, Su Ningzhen, who's here,

757
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,590
I might be intimidated a little.

758
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,400
As for you…

759
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,030
Miss Gao!

760
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,920
Miss Gao!

761
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,840
This demonic cultivator is very powerful.

762
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,630
Let's go!

763
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,230
Trying to leave?

764
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,630
A spirit slave

765
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,440
with a face full of disgusting demon patterns.

766
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,840
How dare you come out and scare people with that?

767
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,590
Steward!

768
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,710
Go.

769
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,590
Get her an iron mask.

770
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,480
She will not scare anyone again.

771
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:02,760
Yes.

772
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:15,920
Hurry up.

773
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,440
Give her

774
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,360
- Her Ladyship's clothes. - Give it back!

775
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,320
Her Ladyship is of high status.

776
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,710
To die in her place

777
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
is the biggest glory

778
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,230
for a slave like you.

779
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,960
Big Brother!

780
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,550
You are stopping me.

781
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,150
You've won.

782
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,920
Let them go.

783
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
And if I don't?

784
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,710
I won't let you kill anyone.

785
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,000
Go!

786
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,000
They were trying to kill you

787
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,760
and I protected you.

788
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,510
They can't fight back now.

789
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,320
You don't have to kill her.

790
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,000
Why do you insist?

791
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,590
Because this is who I am.

792
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,000
How come she could try to kill me,

793
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,280
and I can't kill her?

794
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
Is someone only worthy

795
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,920
of protection when you want to offer it?

796
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,320
Are all the decisions only right when you approve of them?

797
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,150
Miss Gao, this is our chance.

798
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,550
I don't feel right

799
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,280
about leaving someone to die.

800
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,320
We can't save him anyway.

801
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,230
Since he dared to strike the demonic cultivator,

802
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,550
he must know what he was doing.

803
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,510
Let's go back to the sect and report this.

804
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,230
Come on.

805
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,550
You are using your blood as a sword.

806
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,360
Do you want to protect her so much?

807
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,920
I've said it.

808
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,190
I won't let you kill anyone.

809
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,320
You have no spiritual power right now.

810
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,550
Even if you summoned the blood sword,

811
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,710
I can still defeat you easily

812
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,510
in countless ways.

00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,180

00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,260

831

The blood sword was a distraction.

832
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,030
This trap is your true intention.

833
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,190
You pretended to fight with me

834
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,710
and used your blood

835
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,070
to set up this trap.

836
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,920
The blood of a spiritual form cultivator

837
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,000
is the purest spiritual material.

838
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,440
You must have spilt your blood secretly

839
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,760
when you were fighting with me

840
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,880
and created this trap step by step.

841
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,030
Have you been showing your weakness

842
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,070
and tolerated me all this time

843
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,480
for this moment?

844
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,070
You could have set up a killing array.

845
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,150
Why make it merely a trap?

846
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,190
You saved me.

847
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,670
I'm paying you back

848
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,070
by not killing you.

849
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,070
Should I thank you

850
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,590
for your virtue of being grateful?

851
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,880
Why didn't you use your demonic power?

852
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,480
If you did…

853
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,710
You'd be dead already.

854
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,800
You are severely injured

855
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,710
and without the protection of spiritual power.

856
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,590
You are no match for my demonic power.

857
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,710
You hurt people with demonic power

858
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,840
while I save people with my array of blood.

859
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,480
We are destined to be different.

860
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,190
Let's put an end

861
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
to this charade.

862
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,440
I kill people with demonic power

863
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,670
while you kill people with your sword.

864
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,240
What's the difference

865
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,140
between these two?

866
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,230
If I do want to kill you,

867
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,920
you'd already been dead.

868
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,230
You are using my kindness.

869
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,670
Xie Xuechen.

870
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,710
You really left.

871
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,150
Xie Xuechen!

872
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,150
I…

873
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,070
I have something important

874
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,800
to tell you.

875
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:58,960
Come back.

876
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,670
Miss Mu!

877
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:06,760
Bao!

878
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:07,550
I…

879
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,150
I will get you out right away!

880
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,280
Bao!

881
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,190
Don't touch that.

882
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,070
It won't work.

883
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,590
Miss Mu,

884
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,960
you can break

885
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,800
that Array of Flowery something,

886
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,070
but not this one?

887
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,920
An array can consist of four elements

888
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,030
which are guarding,

889
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,510
trapping,

890
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:31,710
killing,

891
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,030
and uniqueness.

892
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,840
The more elements

893
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,550
an array contains,

894
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,550
the less power each element gets.

895
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,480
The Array of Flowery Edges

896
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,510
has all four elements,

897
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,480
making it easy to break.

898
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,230
But this Shackle of Delicacy

899
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,630
is the best trapping array in the world.

900
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,360
It focuses only on trapping,

901
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,670
making it hard to break.

902
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,550
What if

903
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,480
the Spirit Management Bureau is here?

904
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,480
You…

905
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,510
I…

906
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,840
I will get help now!

907
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,960
I've checked this array.

908
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,710
The Shackle of Delicacy

909
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,150
is designed based on Hetu and Luoshu.

910
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,840
It's unpredictable.

911
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,400
It won't be broken easily.

912
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:16,840
Bao!

913
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,190
Bao?

914
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,760
Did she really go to get help?

915
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,320
Xie Xuechen.

916
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,110
The only reason you went to lengths to protect her

917
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,760
was that she's a human.

918
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,030
Did I choose

919
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,590
my clan?

920
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,400
A pair?

921
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,670
What good does that do?

922
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,420
[Feng Yao]

923
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:43,670
Sir,

924
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:44,590
we are here.

925
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,440
What are we doing here?

926
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,400
An old divination result

927
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,190
pointed out that I would meet

928
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,360
an old friend here today.

929
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:55,840
I'm just not sure

930
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,030
