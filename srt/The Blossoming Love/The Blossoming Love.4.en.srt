18
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,820
I'll take care of him.

19
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,070
I'll do it. Stay out of the way.

20
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,840
Go back

21
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,680
You are no part of this.

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,870
I will deal with him.

23
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,240
I said I will.

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,590
Are you going to keep this up forever?

25
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,150
What's going on?

26
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:36,750
You…

27
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,400
What did you do?

28
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,190
Miss Gao is injured

29
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,080
and having trouble moving.

30
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,280
Let's talk here.

31
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,080
I will

32
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,710
prepare the room for Miss Gao.

33
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,030
You stayed behind

34
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,870
to keep me busy

35
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,080
and get more time for the array to form.

36
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,430
How did I get exposed?

37
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,750
The moment you started talking.

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,300
How is that possible?

39
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,150
What did I do wrong?

40
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,480
Well,

41
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,120
why would I tell you?

42
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,000
Beats me.

43
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,590
Shall we give you the answer

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,120
so that you know

45
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,000
how to improve next time?

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Silly.

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,710
Even you are calling me that now.

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,910
Xuyue.

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,630
Suppress.

50
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,560
With the rune as the base

51
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
and the spirit ink painting,

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,870
this fan holds another realm.

53
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,400
The show in the realm must be good.

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,960
It's a pity

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,080
that I don't get to see it.

56
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,560
How long can the fan constrain him?

57
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,630
Not long.

58
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,430
What did I do wrong?

59
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,750
So, he's going to get out.

60
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,680
What is this place?

61
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,950
That's because

62
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,750
he will merge with the painting

63
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,360
and become a part of it.

64
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,360
That means

65
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,750
he will be without life.

66
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,390
You are good.

67
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,800
The tacit between you two

68
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,040
makes me jealous a little bit.

69
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,560
I'm also curious.

70
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,560
What did Anger Demon say that exposed him?

71
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,600
Enlighten us.

72
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,870
You…

73
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,070
You…

74
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,040
He…

75
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,270
He doesn't want to say it just yet.

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,720
He will tell you

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
when he does.

78
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,360
He carried her!

79
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,800
Do you believe that he carried her?

80
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,800
Yes.

81
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,560
Why did I bother to help him?

82
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,120
Mr. Nan,

83
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,570
is it too late

84
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,680
to release Anger Demon?

85
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,580
Maybe you should cool yourself.

86
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,480
Calm down.

87
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,800
Is the marriage arrangement

88
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,270
between those two real?

89
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,750
Based on my knowledge,

90
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,600
it's just a rumor in the Immortal Alliance.

91
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,430
Miss Gao was born in Moonlight Heights.

92
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,870
As the daughter of the leader of the Immortal Alliance,

93
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,120
Gao Fengxu,

94
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,000
she has great natural talent.

95
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,270
Years ago,

96
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,360
someone proposed

97
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,830
that there should be a marriage

98
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,000
between Moonlight Heights and Snow City.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,390
It was just a joke.

100
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,310
The more people talk about it,

101
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,680
the more genuine it gets.

102
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,680
Ten years ago,

103
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,950
Sang Qi's troops attacked Moonlight Heights.

104
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,800
Xuechen happened to be there

105
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,630
and saved Miss Gao.

106
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,820
A lot of people think

107
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,120
that they will end up together.

108
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,830
Ten years have passed,

109
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,600
and that still hasn't happened yet.

110
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,560
That battle

111
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,890
was a massacre on Moonlight Heights.

112
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,540
Miss Gao was the only survivor.

113
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,240
Su Ningzhen, the lord of the Mirage Palace

114
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,270
and aunt to Miss Gao,

115
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,070
accepted her as a disciple

116
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,600
and taught her everything she knew.

117
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,950
She's also a rigorous teacher.

118
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,240
So,

119
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,190
she has been so busy with cultivation

120
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,270
that she didn't have time for romance.

121
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,000
That, I don't know.

122
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,630
It's just that

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,120
based on my observation,

124
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,380
I don't think

125
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,390
they are as close as the rumor.

126
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,680
So,

127
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,510
Anger Demon was wrong

128
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,060
to show caring to Xie Xuechen

129
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,920
at the beginning.

130
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,000
I, for one, have never heard

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,160
Miss Gao adress Xuechen

132
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,140
as Mr. Xie.

133
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,680
But

134
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,560
I don't think

135
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,040
Xie Xuechen entered the spiritual form level ten years ago.

136
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,800
How did he

137
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,950
survive the massacre of Sang Qi's troops

138
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,430
while saving someone.

139
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,390
Ms. Mu, are you curious about it?

140
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,830
It's a legendary story.

141
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,600
People always

142
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,950
want to hear it.

143
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,310
I don't know.

144
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,750
Sometimes,

145
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,480
if the hero doesn't say anything,

146
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
no one knows the truth.

147
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,120
All I know

148
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,830
is that he went into seclusion on the Snow Cliff afterward.

149
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,630
Seven years later,

150
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
he made an unprecedentedly shocking sword swing

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,240
on the peak of the Snow Cliff

152
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,070
and entered the spiritual form level.

153
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,040
That's when his seclusion ended.

154
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,480
You don't know that either.

155
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,670
Mr. Nan,

156
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,670
did you find this?

157
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,360
It's Xie Xuechen.

158
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,390
He went back for me.

159
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,600
Forgive me

160
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,720
if I'm being presumptuous,

161
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,480
but I have a question.

162
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,030
Ask away.

163
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,840
What's your angle

164
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,600
for trying to get close to Xuechen?

165
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,120
Because I like him. What else could it be?

166
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,600
You don't mind Miss Gao anymore.

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,080
Xie Xuechen doesn't like her anyway.

168
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,910
It sounds like you are sure

169
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,200
that Xuechen will fall for you.

170
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,320
If it's hard for him,

171
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,390
he doesn't have to fall for me.

172
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,910
He can keep guarding the world

173
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,240
while I stay by his side.

174
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
There's something else I need to do.

175
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,080
Please excuse me.

176
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,960
Is that

177
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,790
giving without asking for equal return?

178
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,000
You are dead.

179
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,550
Maybe

180
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,360
not yet.

181
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,670
You are not dead.

182
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,510
Then Xie Xuechen is dead.

183
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,270
Or is it Mu Xuanling?

184
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,240
I think they are also both alive.

185
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,600
So, what did you do exactly?

186
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,360
Was it

187
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,510
just a sunbathing trip for you?

188
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,270
It's good that you are alive.

189
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,870
Ask your projection to come back.

190
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,000
I can't do that?

191
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,000
What is that supposed to mean?

192
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,840
I don't know what happened.

193
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
I just sense

194
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,790
that he's in

195
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,440
an empty

196
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,240
and quiet place,

197
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,240
repeating one sentence.

198
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,440
What's the sentence?

199
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,510
What did I say?

200
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,510
What did you say?

201
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,030
Not me. Him.

202
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,910
He's saying,

203
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,510
"what did I say?"

204
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,750
So, what did he say?

205
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,120
I don't know.

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,270
Who made this stupid elixir?

207
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,720
I don't think the elixir is to blame this time.

208
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,960
I just don't know.

209
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,720
After losing two projections in two days,

210
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,630
not only we didn't achieve anything,

211
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,600
but we also don't know anything.

212
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,870
If His Grace hears about this,

213
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,440
we will follow the projections' steps.

214
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,200
Then why are you wasting our time?

215
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,670
Where is your projection?

216
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,080
What did I say?

217
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,120
I'll be ready soon.

218
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,200
What did I say?

219
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,600
I gave you Klicks

220
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,000
along with the fate

221
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,120
of the world.

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,630
Yet you

223
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,040
used it to kill your allies

224
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,240
and committed this serious crime.

225
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,510
You

226
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,840
are not worthy of this sword.

227
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,440
But…

228
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,740
But I don't remember anything.

229
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,550
That doesn't mean it didn't happen.

230
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,200
I've told you countless times

231
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,270
that you can't be sentimental.

232
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,240
You thought that I was forcing you

233
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,360
and defied me constantly.

234
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,120
Now that the truth is right under your nose.

235
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,440
If you could have been detached

236
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,320
and put your desires aside,

237
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,630
how could the Dark Clan member has the chance to use you

238
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,910
and possess you?

239
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,200
Now,

240
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,120
your hands

241
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,240
and sword

242
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,550
are covered in the blood of our allies.

243
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,750
How are you supposed to

244
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,320
focus on your faith?

245
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,750
With more power,

246
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,030
you face a greater risk of creating severe disaster

247
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,510
once you take the wrong turn.

248
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,750
No one knows about this right now.

249
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,370
You just stay here and reflect on what you did.

250
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,120
Collect your thoughts. Be responsible.

251
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,150
I hope

252
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,910
I won't regret

253
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,240
my decision today.

254
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,030
I'm not leaving the mountain

255
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,750
until my faith is solid.

256
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,320
Xie Xuechen!

257
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,840
You are up.

258
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,440
What is this place?

259
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,630
How did I get here?

260
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,000
You were possessed by the Dark Clan

261
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,750
and came to Greenview Heights.

262
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,870
Possessed?

263
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,240
All I can remember

264
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,720
is that I was attacked on my way

265
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,510
back to Mirage Palace.

266
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,240
The next thing I remember is waking up here.

267
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,720
What did I do?

268
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,480
Nothing.

269
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,240
It's solved.

270
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,320
The hateful Dark Clan members,

271
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,960
always sneaking up on people.

272
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,080
I will kill every one of them

273
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,840
that dares to show their faces.

274
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,440
So, that's how it feels like

275
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,630
to be possessed by the Dark Clan.

276
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,910
I don't remember

277
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,270
what I've done at all.

278
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,910
I have to hear about it from someone else.

279
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,330
Did I do something

280
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,670
that has consequences, right?

281
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,600
No.

282
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,120
Oh, right!

283
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,960
My companion, Cui Wanwan…

284
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,550
Don't worry.

285
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,480
Mr. Nan has sent someone to find her.

286
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,200
Thank you.

287
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,960
You should rest.

288
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,480
Xie Xuechen!

289
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,390
Master sent me to find you.

290
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,320
I couldn't have said no.

291
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Since you are all right,

292
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,550
my task is finished.

293
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,600
I know.

294
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,320
Thank you.

295
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,000
That's sour!

296
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,480
It's a beautiful night.

297
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,790
Why do you look so sad?

298
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,480
I just got some fruit.

299
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,390
Try them.

300
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,080
Why are you here instead of healing?

301
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,910
Are you worried about me?

302
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,120
That's not what this is.

303
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,960
I just don't like owing someone.

304
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,000
That brutal Anger Demon

305
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,480
hits harder than Desire Demon.

306
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,510
Judging from your status,

307
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,240
your spiritual power is coming back.

308
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,720
What are you planning now?

309
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,870
What could I do?

310
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,000
I just want to ask a question.

311
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,030
Can I

312
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,630
go to Snow City with you?

313
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,240
Don't reject me just yet.

314
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,070
There's still time.

315
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,310
You can sleep on it.

316
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,200
Keep in mind

317
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,920
how I helped you today.

318
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,440
Why didn't you tell me

319
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,880
that you went back for me?

320
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,160
Why did you go back?

321
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,240
Whatever it is,

322
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,240
you did go back.

323
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,480
That's all I need.

324
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
Xie Xuechen.

325
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,400
I hereby announce

326
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,750
that all between us is forgiven and forgotten.

327
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,480
I'm tired.

328
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,920
I'll go have a rest.

329
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,070
You should stop watching the moon.

330
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,750
The more time you spend here, the worse you feel.

331
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,400
Have a fruit

332
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,200
and get a good sleep.

333
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,510
Nice dream.

334
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,920
Friends share burdens.

335
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
Xuanling!

336
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,070
I miss you so much!

337
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,310
And

338
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,980
that horrible thing

339
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,400
doesn't seem so scary now.

340
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,740
That's because he was locked up.

341
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,350
Xuanling.

342
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,550
How come you look

343
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,400
so

344
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,640
much more happier

345
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,160
after your errand?

346
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,270
Do I?

347
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,160
What happened?

348
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,720
It's Feng Yao's signal.

349
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,960
It's from

350
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,790
Mirage City!

351
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,270
Did something happen to the Mirage Palace?

352
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,240
Firework colors

353
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,400
carry different meanings.

354
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,590
The magenta color

355
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,640
means enemy attack.

356
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,750
Is it the Dark Clan?

357
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,480
That's one possibility.

358
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,750
But it's not the only one.

359
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,830
The traitor in Immortal Alliance.

360
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,260
Traitor?

361
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,640
Instead of guessing,

362
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,200
we might as well check things out ourselves.

363
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,400
Pardon me.

364
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,440
Young girl, you are…

365
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,920
She's my cousin.

366
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,000
Ling.

367
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,070
A distant relative.

368
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,510
Yes, Cousin.

369
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,000
Nice to meet you.

370
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,270
There's no time to waste.

371
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,400
Let's set off to

372
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Mirage City in a stick of incense.

373
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,200
I'm coming with you.

374
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,440
You…

375
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,880
How can I not go

376
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,830
when my cousin is going?

377
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,200
I can't feel at ease.

378
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,830
You can wait here.

379
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,960
If you don't want to take me along, fine.

380
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,400
I will

381
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,830
get there by myself.

382
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,590
Travel together, then.

383
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,200
Let's go get ready

384
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
and meet up in a stick of incense.

385
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,030
Later.

386
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,030
Xie Xuechen.

387
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,550
I should remind you.

388
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,350
Gao Qiumin saw us in the inn.

389
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,350
Your Jun Tian Sword was exposed.

390
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,200
You'd better hide it.

391
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,680
If she recognizes your sword,

392
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,350
I'll have to fight with her again.

393
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,200
I don't mind that,

394
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,790
but it will end badly for her.

395
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,960
Hiding the sword is easy now that I have my spiritual power.

396
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,790
You are the problem.

397
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,030
You have to follow me

398
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,790
and I can't do anything about that.

399
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,550
But I'm digging my heel in the ground.

400
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,400
Behave!

401
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,550
I will.

402
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,640
Su Ningzhen, the lord of the Mirage Palace,

403
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,200
is the one who hates the Spirit Clan the most in the whole Immortal Alliance.

404
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,590
If you don't want to die,

405
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,960
hide your identity.

406
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,920
And if you cause trouble again,

407
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,480
I'm not helping you.

408
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
Even if it's a life-and-death situation.

409
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,740
[Mirage Palace]

410
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,580
[Mirage Palace]

411
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,780
[Hall of Lively Spring]

412
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,240
My lord.

413
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,030
What's the situation?

414
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,590
We can't find the person.

415
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,200
Searching is still ongoing.

416
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,750
The security of the palace is tight.

417
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,250
How did the member of the Spirit Clan member get in,

418
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,550
steal the Sect Leader's Token,

419
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,830
and get out?

420
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,420
[Su Ningzhen, Lord of Mirage Palace]

421
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,830
I knew this would happen.

422
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,160
Never let your enemies get too close.

423
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,790
We should have eliminated the Spirit Clan.

424
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,310
The city is in lockdown.

425
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,200
[Zai Xi, Elder of Mirage Palace]

426
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,510
The Spirit Clan member was injured.

427
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
There's no escaping.

428
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,590
My lord, no need to be anxious.

429
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,440
Getting the Sect Leader's Token back

430
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,960
is just a matter of time.

431
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,750
Master.

432
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,920
Master Zai Xi.

433
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,920
I'm back.

434
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,240
Qiumin,

435
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,350
a cultivator from the Greenview Heights

436
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,270
sent Wanwan back

437
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,400
and mentioned that you were attacked

438
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,070
and injured.

439
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,310
Master, don't worry about me.

440
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,440
I'm fine.

441
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,000
It's just that I got the fireworks message

442
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,750
which says there has been an enemy attack.

443
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,960
We got back right away.

444
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,160
We?

445
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,200
Xie Xuechen, Nan Xuyue, and me.

446
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,790
Oh, and Nan Xuyue's cousin.

447
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,240
We got back to Mirage City together.

448
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,480
Where are they right now?

449
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,000
As we were getting into the city,

450
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,920
the security was so strict

451
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,920
that we could only get in,

452
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,920
but we can't get out.

453
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,160
I asked about the reason and learned

454
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,030
that the Sect Leader's Token was stolen.

455
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,510
They said that the thief is still at large.

456
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,440
So, we made another plan.

457
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,400
Out of the way! Out of the way!

458
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,400
Move aside!

459
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,440
Let's go check things out over there.

460
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,460
- Yes. - Clear the path!

461
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,530
Move aside!

462
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,210
This way!

463
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:53,790
Move aside!

464
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,740
- Hey, come here. - Is that…

465
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,830
Thank you for your spirit ink rune.

466
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,790
It got me through the search of the Spirit Management Bureau.

467
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,000
Why didn't Bao

468
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,270
insist on coming with you this time?

469
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,070
She did.

470
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,040
I told her

471
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,240
that Gao Qiumin

472
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,440
and the Spirit Management Bureau would be there.

473
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,070
She quit that thought right away.

474
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,240
She said that she'd wait for us at the Greenview Heights

475
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,270
and wished me a nice trip.

476
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,790
How much spiritual power have you restored?

477
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,070
Less than 20 percent.

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,070
Less than 20 percent?

479
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,750
Why did you suggest

480
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,070
that we make our moves

481
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,160
without any help from Mirage Palace?

482
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,720
Mirage Palace is making big moves.

483
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,590
It's hard for them to find anything.

484
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,720
We'll investigate in secret.

485
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,310
We might get some results.

486
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,440
Besides,

487
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,200
it doesn't take too much strength

488
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,480
to find someone who's lurking.

489
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,070
Five tokens can open the Pearl Tower.

490
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,790
Losing the token of the Mirage Palace

491
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,640
is just the beginning.

492
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,360
In that case,

493
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,210
give them some space.

494
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,440
But

495
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,160
if they are making any moves,

496
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,240
you need to let me know right away.

497
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,720
Do you understand?

498
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,640
Yes, Master.

499
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,830
Oh, right!

500
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,110
The reason why Xie Xuechen went missing

501
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,510
is that he was ambushed by Sang Qi

502
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,510
and taken to the Lava.

503
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,200
Sang Qi's target is the Chaos Pearl.

504
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,070
Sang Qi!

505
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,140
I should have

506
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,830
finished him off once and for all.

507
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,240
That despicable Spirit Clan member

508
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,590
brought massacre

509
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,830
to  the Moonlight Heights for the pearl,

510
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,790
leaving you all alone.

511
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,880
Now he's trying to get back on his feet.

512
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,880
Qiumin,

513
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:50,920
you should hate him.

514
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,590
One day, you will kill him.

515
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,550
Kill him!

516
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,660
You have to!

517
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,920
Master! My hand…

518
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,640
My lord.

519
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,790
I lost my head.

520
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,930
That was my fault.

521
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,110
Take Qiumin for treatment.

522
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,510
Let's go.

523
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,030
She's all grown up.

524
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,030
She looks more and more like my sister.

525
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,590
Yet she's no match for my sister.

526
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,400
My sister has never

527
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,750
been such an embarrassment

528
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,750
and allowed someone to hurt her so badly.

529
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,640
[Rejuvenation Pavilion]

530
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,830
The wound is not deep.

531
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,880
It will take just one day or two to heal.

532
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Thank you, Master Zai Xi.

533
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,070
It has been a long trip for you.

534
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,270
Rest.

535
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,880
That hurts!

536
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,110
Come in.

537
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,750
Qiumin, it's me.

538
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,070
Stop pretending.

539
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,250
I was scared.

540
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:33,790
I might…

541
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,440
Wanwan,

542
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,960
what happened to your hand?

543
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,400
Nothing.

544
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,590
It's just a bony crack.

545
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,880
I have gotten treatment

546
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,350
and will recover in a month.

547
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,070
Don't worry, Qiumin.

548
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,400
Okay Sit.

549
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,410
I'll get you some tea.

550
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,200
Sit.

551
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Have some tea.

552
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,110
Thank you.

553
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,480
This time,

554
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,550
I was saved and escorted back by Feng Yao

555
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,510
from the Greenview Heights

556
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,880
I was up the whole night,

557
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,920
worrying something might have happened to you.

558
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,070
But

559
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
seeing you all safe and sound,

560
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:09,920
I feel relieved.

561
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,790
Qiumin, what happened?

562
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,200
How were things?

563
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,070
The member of the Dark Clan

564
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,350
possessed me.

565
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,580
If I catch him,

566
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:19,960
I…

567
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,960
Possessed by the Dark Clan?

568
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,640
Keep it down.

569
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,110
Do you want to

570
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,590
let everyone know

571
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,200
about my shame?

572
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,550
So…

573
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,560
How did that happen?

574
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,760
That doesn't matter.

575
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:37,850
Anyway,

576
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,010
I am embarrassed in front of others.

577
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,750
But I'll say this.

578
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,350
If I see that demon again,

579
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,480
I will get my revenge.

580
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,960
I heard

581
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,480
that it was Mr. Xie

582
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,510
who sent you back.

583
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,400
No.

584
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,110
Nan Xuyue

585
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,960
and his cousin

586
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,920
came along.

587
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,590
Qiumin,

588
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,270
why try so hard to explain?

589
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,890
Mr. Xie

590
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,000
is one of the best men,

591
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,550
and you share a connection.

592
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,720
Do you really

593
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,720
feel nothing for him?

594
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,160
The others believe the rumor,

595
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,920
but shouldn't you know me better?

596
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,000
Cui Wanwan!

597
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,200
All right.

598
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,200
Well, Xie Xuechen

599
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,480
is a nice guy.

600
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
He did save me

601
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,960
when I was a child.

602
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,240
I am grateful.

603
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,590
It's just that people always say

604
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,750
something like

605
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,880
I can't stop thinking about him

606
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,250
and adore him.

607
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,160
That I will marry no one but him.

608
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,490
The worst one

609
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,420
is about

610
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,860
the union of the beauty

611
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,790
and the hero.

612
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,720
But

613
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,070
I am beautiful.

614
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,590
You are the most beautiful girl.

615
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,510
Right?

616
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,520
I was born with nine apertures.

617
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,590
Just one less aperture than him.

618
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,680
I will make it to the top of the human clan

619
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,510
with my sword by myself.

620
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,750
But…

621
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,750
Qiumin,

622
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,030
I don't want to kill your passion.

623
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,880
It's just that

624
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,200
about the statement of "with your sword by yourself,"

625
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,960
you are here,

626
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,000
but your sword

627
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,790
is missing.

628

Qiumin, run!

629
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,110
That sword was not handy.

630
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,590
I always wanted to replace it.

631
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,920
It has been a while.

632
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,880
Come with me.

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,720
This is the Sword of Vitality.

634
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,440
This will be my sword.

635
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,200
If I see that demon again,

636
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,960
I will slay her with this sword.

You chose

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,880
not to visit the Mirage Palace first

640
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,830
because of Su Ningzhen, right?

641
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,590
All the high-ranking members of the five sects of the Immortal Alliance

can be the mole.

643
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,790
I can't rule out the possibility that Su Ningzhen

644
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,920
carried out an inside job.

645
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,400
I need to be sure.

Aren't you tired?

Don't you think

00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,960
that you should leave us?

654
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,000
Even so,

I can't help myself to eavesdrop.

And if you can deal with that,

00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,590
I wouldn't be able to help myself to follow you.

659

Why complicate things?

I just want to help.

661
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,000
The communication between people and spirits

662
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,110
requires trust.

663
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,830
Mr. Nan,

664
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
do you have any relics that offer insurance?

665
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:38,920
Yes.

666
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,510
Is it necessary?

667
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,790
Someone needs to be assured.

668
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,640
Makes sense.

669
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,880
Here are two wristbands.

670
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,920
They are bonded.

671
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,000
One manipulates the other.

672
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,680
If Ms. Mu wears it

673
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,690
and misbehaves,

674
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,080
Xuechen could wear the other one,

675
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,160
activate it,

676
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,790
and you'll be so painful

677
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,750
that you can't move an inch.

678
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,690
This is exaggerating.

679
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,590
I have no intention to control you.

680
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,070
Why don't you…

681
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,640
It's similar to the Spirit Lock in a way.

Though it's more appealing.

692
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,240
was injured, right?

693
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,400
Yes.

694
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,200
I heard that the Spirit Clan member was not bad.

like ripples.

702
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,830
the injury will get worse.

00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,740
a few pharmacies in the city.

705
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,920

00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,960
to walk into the trap.

Lord Su ordered a city lockdown

708
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,480
and sent people to guard all the pharmacies.

709

If the Spirit Clan member approached one of them,

710
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,440

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,360
How come you

763
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,190
are always so handsome regardless of what you wear?

764
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:25,880
Take this.

765
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,110
What kind of expression is that?

766
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,880
You are the back-rubbing worker Xie.

767
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,630
Being so cold to customers

768
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,920
will cost you your wages.

769
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,070
Let's try to fit in.

770
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,670
Places like this

771
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,280
have all kinds of people.

772
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,030
They are here for the relaxation.

773
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,230
They won't be as forgiving to you as I am.

774
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,550
You need to adjust your attitude.

775
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,070
Do you need me to show you

776
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,190
how to make people comfortable?

777
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,070
I think you are doing this on purpose.

778
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,150
I never said that I wasn't.

779
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,280
You are the one

780
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,190
who wanted to come here.

781
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,230
You'd better find something.

782
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,800
See you later, Xie.

783
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:29,960
Nice.

784
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,150
What do you think? Comfy?

785
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:31,880
It has been a while since had one.

786
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,330
You have chosen quite a nice place.

787
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,340
[Ladies]

788
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,110
Come on. Lie down.

789
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:37,580
All right.

790
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,920
He can't get out of here

791
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,360
or buy medicines.

792
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,510
His only choice

793
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,880
is to use the hot spring of fire element

794
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,630
to control the damage caused by Lord Su.

795
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,230
So,

796
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,400
we are likely to find him here.

797
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,560
When Lord Su

798
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,770
was facing the Spirit Clan member last night,

799
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,920
she hit the back side of the left shoulder.

800
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,630
It must have left a mark.

801
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,230
According to Lord Su,

802
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,280
it was dark last night.

803
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,670
She didn't see if it was a "he" or "she."

804
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,070
She didn't see.

805
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,440
We'll know after our investigation.

807
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,190

00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,060
Someone here? I've been waiting for so long.

812
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:37,860
Hurry up.

813
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,150
You are it?

814
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,760
You are so small.

815
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:41,880
Hurry.

816
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Watch what you are doing!

817
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,440
Give me a message.

818
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,820
You look quite strong,

819
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,000
but you lack strength.

820
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,000
Harder.

821
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,590
That's more like it.

822
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,030
Young fellow.

823
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,110
You shouldn't slack off

824
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,800
when you are working.

825
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,840
Are you trying to kill me?

Again.

827
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,510
Give me a shoulder rub.

828
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,380
Tell me

829
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,360
if you feel uncomfortable.

830
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,360
This is good.

831
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,480
Sister,

832
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,590
you may look small,

833
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,510
but you have

834
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
a lot of strength.

835
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,000
I will find you again next time.

836
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,440
Do find me next time.

837
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,630
Don't worry.

838
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,630
I will ask for you.

839
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,000
Miss, do you need…

840
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:14,550
No.

841
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,630
Don't you want to try?

842
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,550
I'm quite skillful.

843
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,480
I said no.

844
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,800
If I'm not doing my job,

845
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,630
my boss will cut down my wages.

846
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,590
I won't charge you extra fees for this.

847
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,480
Why not give it a go?

848
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,920
What do you want?

849
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,800
Where did that come from?

850
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,520
I'm just a servant.

851
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,660
What could I possibly want?

852
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,800
It's just that

853
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,150
people don't meet

854
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,110

855
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,550
I'm asking this for someone else.

856
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,510
Who hired you?

857
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,150
Where is the thing

858
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,760
that you stole?

859
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,030
You got rough quickly.

860
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,550
Don't you want to talk?

861
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,590
If you can give me the token,

862
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,800
I will keep your whereabouts a secret

863
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,590
since you are from the Spirit Clan.

864
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,100
A snake demon!

865
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,190
It's a nice place,

866
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,800
right?

867
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,450
Not bad.

868
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,190
- What's wrong with you? - Can't you see?

869
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,630
- Snake! - There's a snake!

870
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,210
So, you don't have the token.

871
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,540
To come to a place like this,

872
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,710
you must have hidden the token somewhere else.

873
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,110
