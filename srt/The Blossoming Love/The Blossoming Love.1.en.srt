00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,790
The Chaos Pearl is an ancient divine treasure,

192
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,360
holding the power of chaos.

193
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,670
The five sects of the Immortal Alliance guard it closely.

194
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,870
Now,

195
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,510
it is stored in the Pearl Tower of Snow City.

196
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,320
To unlock the Pearl Tower,

197
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,120
the tokens of the five sect leaders are required.

198
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,870
You imprisoned Xie Xuechen,

199
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,630
wasn't it to force him to reveal

200
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,080
the location of the tokens

201
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,150
and open the tower to retrieve the pearl?

202
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,390
You're smart.

203
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,960
But you've only guessed half of it.

204
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,670
Someone else desires the Chaos Pearl.

205
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,360
Since both sides

206
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,910
have something the other wants,

207
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,870
it's only natural to exploit that.

208
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,870
When you visited Xie Xuechen,

209
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,910
what were you trying to gain?

210
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,630
When I visited Xie Xuechen,

211
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,440
it was, of course, to find out

212
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,000
the location of the tokens

213
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,480
and relieve you of this burden.

214
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,270
So, you're saying

215
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,790
you were gravely injured

216
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,320
while hunting Xie Xuechen

217
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,550
that day.

218
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,080
Have you recovered?

219
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,000
Why are you suddenly

220
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,150
concerned about me?

221
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,360
Your kindness in raising me

222
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,960
is never forgotten.

223
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,030
I've always been thinking

224
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,910
of how to repay you.

225
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,790
You haven't done anything unnecessary, have you?

226
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,390
Of course not.

227
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,630
Your Grace,

228
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,630
Xie Xuechen is attacking here!

229
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,080
No need for you to act.

230
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,720
Focus on your recovery in seclusion.

231
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,120
I'll handle him.

232
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,840
Go ahead.

233
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:28,960
Jun Tian!

234
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,840
Where is Sang Qi?

235
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,910
It seems we are fated,

236
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,510
meeting again so soon.

237
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,790
It's you.

238
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,840
I'm Mu Xuanling, the Saintess of the Dark Abyss.

239
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,440
Young Lord,

240
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,030
please guide me well.

241
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,360
Young Lord...

242
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,480
Are you looking for me?

243
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,000
Why are you in such a hurry, Young Lord?

244
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,030
Could it be that you can't forget

245
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,510
that kiss in the Lava?

246
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,880
You really have no sense

247
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,670
of cherishing beauty, do you?

248
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,780
♪Forging a sword with blood to pierce the dark night♪

249
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,140
♪Defying fate, rewriting destiny♪

250
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,260
♪Through fiery resolve♪

251
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,780
♪Cleaving the heavens♪

00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,940
♪Unyielding to the storm♪

253
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,780
♪Bearing the scorching weight of the world♪

254
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,980
♪Risking everything for humanity♪

255
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,780
♪In this moment of rebirth♪

256
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,900
♪Burning through this lifetime's blossoms♪

257
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,390
You shouldn't be here.

258
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,840
If you don't leave,

259
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,720
your spiritual power will run out.

260
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,960
This move

261
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,590
seems to resonate with me.

262
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
Then, Mr. Xie,

263
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,130
why not take me hostage and escape together?

264
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,030
They say

265
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,790
one day as a couple means a lifetime of gratitude.

266
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,720
Since I kissed you once,

267
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,310
shouldn't that count

268
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,070
for at least ten days of gratitude?

269
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,830
Young Lord,

270
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,640
you show no mercy at all?

271
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,640
What did you feed me in the Lava?

272
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,400
Why do you treat me as an enemy?

273
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,270
To save you,

274
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,480
I even sacrificed my innocence.

275
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,400
At the time, there were enforcers from the Dark Abyss present.

276
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,000
I couldn't explain it to you.

277
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,680
The medicine I fed you

278
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,240
is called Half-Day Glory.

279
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,000
After taking it,

280
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,350
you can quickly regain your full strength.

281
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,960
But...

282
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,590
it requires

283
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,830
a very minor price.

284
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,830
What price?

285
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,030
The effects only last an hour.

286
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,830
And now,

287
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,590
it's probably at its limit.

288
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,920
Moreover,

289
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,920
from this moment on,

290
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,880
for the next ten days,

291
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,460
you'll

292
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,240
be completely powerless.

293
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,270
Xie Xuechen!

294
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,440
Xie Xuechen,

295
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,830
now I can finally

296
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,400
kill you myself.

297
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,880
Anger Demon,

298
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,000
stand down.

299
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,110
But...

300
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,720
but I really want

301
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,680
to kill Xie Xuechen!

302
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,720
But I've been taken hostage.

303
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,640
He'll kill me!

304
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,480
So?

305
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,750
Kill!

306
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,110
Mr. Xie,

307
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,000
you can't just use me and abandon me.

308
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,750
How did you...

309
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,510
When you weren't there,

310
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,200
Anger Demon lost his will to fight.

311
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,640
He became easy to deal with.

312
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,200
But...

313
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,000
aren't you curious

314
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,830
how I escaped

315
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,400
from the Array?

316
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,790
In the Lava,

317
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,110
I realized you weren't from the Dark Clan.

318
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,110
The Dark Clan has no heartbeat,

319
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,830
but you do.

320
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,720
You and Sang Qi

321
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,640
are both of the Spirit Clan.

322
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,720
As expected of someone born with an extra sense,

323
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,440
your perception

324
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,480
is extraordinary!

325
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,200
But as the Saintess of the Dark Abyss,

326
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,960
you've also...

327
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,680
committed countless crimes...

328
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,510
Xie Xuechen!

329
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,400
Xie Xuechen!

330
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,310
If you're going to faint, don't do it here.

331
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,200
What if the bad guys catch up?

332
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,440
Xie Xuechen!

333
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,000
Bad guys?

334
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,680
Xie Xuechen!

335
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,920
- You've got the nerve to call others bad? - Xie Xuechen!

336
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,920
Mr. Xie,

337
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,350
when you were unconscious just now,

338
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,750
you called out my name.

339
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,750
Seems like you just can't forget me.

340
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,720
We've already left the Two Realms Mountain.

341
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,680
I concealed our presence along the way.

342
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,510
No one was following us.

343
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,110
Here, it's just the two of us.

344
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,510
You could shout yourself hoarse,

345
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,350
and no one would come.

346
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,160
Why did you save me?

347
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,240
What exactly are you after?

348
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,000
Naturally, it's you.

349
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,070
At first glance in the Lava,

350
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,960
I fell in love with you.

351
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,880
So I offered the rarest spiritual essence

352
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,590
to help you escape.

353
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,270
I thought an hour would be enough for you

354
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,770
to leave the Dark Abyss.

355
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,920
Who would've thought you'd act so recklessly,

356
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,160
charging straight into the Temple of Divine Execution.

357
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,440
I had no choice.

358
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,070
I had to play along

359
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,350
as your hostage.

360
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,440
For you,

361
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,640
I've practically betrayed my master and ancestors.

362
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,830
The Dark Abyss is no longer an option for me.

363
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,110
From now on,

364
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,830
wherever you go...

365
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,480
I'll follow.

366
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,070
As the Saintess of the Dark Abyss,

367
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,550
how could you betray Sang Qi?

368
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,160
We always act on our own desires,

369
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,030
not on morality.

370
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,720
What is there to betray?

371
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,750
You don't believe me?

372
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,400
Then let me tell you

373
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,510
Sang Qi's plan.

374
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,680
He's collaborating with humans

375
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,720
to obtain the Chaos Pearl.

376
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,550
You are the son of the Immortal Alliance Leader

377
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,310
and the Young Lord of Snow City.

378
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,960
He imprisoned and tortured you in the Lava

379
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,400
just to wait

380
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,880
until you were at the brink of despair,

381
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,790
so you'd reveal everything to him.

382
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,880
I said he's collaborating with humans.

383
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,070
Why aren't you surprised at all?

384
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,200
Do you know

385
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,030
within the Immortal Alliance...

386
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,880
There's a traitor.

387
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,480
So, you already know.

388
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,750
Indeed.

389
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,720
The cracks in the Array

390
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,160
needed repairing.

391
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,270
That's something widely known,

392
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,310
not a secret.

393
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,440
But the exact time

394
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,350
for entering the array

395
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,270
was only known by the Immortal Alliance.

396
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,720
The timing of Sang Qi's ambush

397
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,880
was too perfect.

398
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,880
You're so clever,

399
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,960
so you must have figured it out.

400
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,000
In fact, that day,

401
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,750
if you had abandoned repairing the barrier,

402
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,200
you could've escaped unharmed.

403
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,400
If the barrier broke, so be it.

404
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,200
Just let the Dark Clan

405
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,550
invade the human realm.

406
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,070
Is it really worth risking your life to protect it?

407
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,680
You people from the Dark Abyss

408
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,720
could never understand

409
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,480
the way of the sword cultivator.

410
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,680
Who is Sang Qi collaborating with?

411
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,960
I don't know.

412
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
I really don't know.

413
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
There's no need to lie to you.

414
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,000
The five Alliance tokens

415
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,720
are guarded by the leaders of the five sects.

416
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,110
Having only the one from Snow City

417
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,160
is useless on its own.

418
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,680
So I guess

419
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,550
Sang Qi must have another plan.

420
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,240
You see,

421
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,590
I've never held back

422
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,110
when it comes to the people I like.

423
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,510
Whether it should be said or not,

424
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,240
I've told you everything.

425
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,510
This woman's words are half-truths,

426
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,960
and must not be fully trusted.

427
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,240
The wounds on my body...

428
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,070
Of course, I treated them for you

429
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,030
and changed your clothes.

430
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,270
Mr. Xie,

431
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,830
you truly are magnificent and extraordinary,

432
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,110
blessed with natural talent.

433
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,640
Let go of me!

434
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,240
Let go of me!

435
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,720
You've lost your spiritual power,

436
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,000
while I have demonic power.

437
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,110
Knowing you can't win, you still fight back.

438
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,440
Are you playing

439
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,880
hard to get?

440
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,240
Let go of me.

441
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,310
Let go?

442
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,640
Where should I let go?

443
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,480
Here?

444
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,680
Madam.

445
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,070
Miss Mu.

446
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,220
I just heard voices

447
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,400
coming from your room

448
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,640
and thought your husband had woken up.

449
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,830
I happened to make some porridge,

450
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,070
so I brought it over.

451
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,310
Thank you, Madam.

452
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,310
It's perfect timing. We're starving.

453
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,830
My husband and I

454
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,550
have really troubled you this time.

455
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,200
No trouble at all!

456
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,200
This is a remote place.

457
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,480
You can recover here

458
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,790
without worrying about enemies catching up.

459
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,030
I heard from my son

460
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,110
that your husband is gravely injured.

461
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,180
You'd better stay here

462
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,110
and recover fully before leaving.

463
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,110
As it happens,

464
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,310
my son knows a bit of medicine

465
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,070
and can help change his bandages.

466
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,480
Thank you.

467
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:12,960
No need to thank me.

468
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,720
If you need anything, just call me.

469
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,160
Alright.

470
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,440
Ah, youth is such a blessing!

471
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,120
Stop peeking!

472
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,750
What are you peeking at?

473
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,440
Off you go!

474
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,750
Alright.

475
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,270
I admit I lied.

476
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,110
I told them

477
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,790
we're a runaway couple.

478
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,680
I'm the daughter of a wealthy family,

479
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,000
and you're a down-and-out swordsman.

480
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,270
My family

481
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,520
disapproved of our marriage

482
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,780
and sent people to hunt you down.

483
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,590
That's why they took us in.

484
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,440
Hubby,

485
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,030
do we even look

486
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,030
like a couple?

487
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,640
The one who treated my injuries

488
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,000
was the madam's son.

489
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,200
Yes.

490
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,200
I admit I didn't see

491
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,510
your majestic body

492
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,240
or help with your injuries.

493
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,160
And your clothes

494
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,460
were also changed by him, Mr. Hou,

495
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,250
at my request.

496
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
The Dark Clan is inherently malicious,

497
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,000
and the Spirit Clan are the best liars.

498
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,200
But there's one thing I said that's true.

499
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,440
Which is?

500
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,750
That I like you.

501
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,160
Now your body is injured,

502
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,240
your spiritual form is damaged,

503
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,790
and you're no different from a mortal.

504
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,550
Eating grains

505
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,880
can help restore your vitality.

506
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,880
The sooner you recover,

507
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,550
the sooner you can get rid of me, right?

508
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,440
Aren't you afraid I poisoned the porridge?

509
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,030
If you wanted to harm me,

510
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,790
why would you save me?

511
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,590
I didn't poison it,

512
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,510
but I did add something.

513
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,310
You...

514
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,160
Relax.

515
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,240
It's a tonic.

516
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,880
Get some proper rest.

517
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,680
It'll be good for your body.

518
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,720
[Ten years ago]

519
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,400
Stealing, are you?

520
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,590
Not working, huh?

521
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,880
I'll beat you to death!

522
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,830
Do you want to come with me?

523
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,640
I'm a spirit slave.

524
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,400
I must follow the steward's orders.

525
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,110
You're no spirit slave.

526
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,310
Why are you so kind to me?

527
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
I just want you to be happy.

528
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,880
Could it be...

529
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,070
that you are my long-lost father?

530
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,680
Father!

531
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,000
Don't call me father!

532
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
You won't even tell me

533
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,550
your name...

534
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,960
what should I call you, then?

535
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,480
Just don't call me father.

536
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,680
Then...

537
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,270
how about Big Brother?

538
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,110
Big Brother!

539
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,160
Don't be afraid.

540
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,350
Close your eyes.

541
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,880
When you open them again,

542
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,310
everything will be fine.

543
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,720
Good girl.

544
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,960
Listen to me.

545
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,000
Quickly...

546
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,920
Quickly unlock the Spirit Lock...

547
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,640
Sang... Sang Qi...

548
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,350
Sang Qi is coming...

549
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,640
Quickly...

550
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,680
Big Brother!

551
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,160
Is it really you?

552
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,920
But...

553
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,370
you're supposed to be dead.

554
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,940
[Void Sea]

555
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,270
In this world,

556
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,640
if people give rise to greed, anger, or ignorance,

557
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,880
inner demons will emerge.

558
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,550
The aura of these inner demons

559
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,350
gathers in the Void Sea

560
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,200
and forms the Dark Clan,

561
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,110
[Desire Demon]

562
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,160
creatures with no blood, no flesh,

563
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,830
[Ignorance Demon]
and no weaknesses.

564
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,880
[Anger Demon]
Even if shattered to dust,

565
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,880
we will eventually return

566
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,350
to the Void Sea and be reborn.

567
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,400
Humans' attempt to wipe out the Dark Clan

568
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,480
is pure wishful thinking!

569
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,350
But wishful thinking itself is also an obsession

570
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,640
that can give birth to inner demons.

571
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,790
That's my favorite part.

572
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,750
Anger Demon.

573
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,510
Why aren't you speaking?

574
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,000
I think...

575
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,750
based on my judgment,

576
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,960
the Saintess

577
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,830
must have eloped with Xie Xuechen!

578
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:51,590
Right.

579
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,160
Ridiculous.

580
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,400
Elope?

581
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,440
Don't you know

582
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,310
what kind of person the Saintess is?

583
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,160
She's nothing but sugar-coated poison.

584
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,720
She'll flatter you on the surface,

585
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,550
then stab you in the back.

586
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,830
When has she ever been sincere?

587
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,590
I bet this time too,

588
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,590
she's plotting something in her heart.

589
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,750
Enough.

590
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,590
His Grace ordered us to set up the Demon Array.

591
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,880
Let's begin.

592
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,920
Wherever there are inner demons,

593
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,750
they'll serve as our eyes.

594
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,070
Without setting up the array, we didn't realize

595
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,830
how many inner demons

596
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,240
were spreading in the world these days.

597
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,070
Humans

598
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,920
are never satisfied.

599
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,270
Their greed knows no bounds.

600
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,680
This Demon Array

601
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,830
will help us find them.

602
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,680
You're hurting me again!

603
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,590
Why are you here again?

604
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,400
We're married.

605
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,640
Doesn't that

606
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,200
just mean sharing a bed?

607
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,240
We could be anything

608
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,350
but never a married couple.

609
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,240
Alright.

610
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,720
You sleep here.

611
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,880
I'll find another spot.

612
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,920
Mr. Xie,

613
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,880
be reasonable!

614
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,830
Let go!

615
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,680
Do you think you can beat me now?

616
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,920
If I really wanted to do something to you,

617
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,440
could you stop me?

618
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,400
Be good.

619
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,680
Lie down and rest.

620
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,030
I know

621
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,720
- No anger... - the way of sword cultivators,

622
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,420
straight, unyielding.

623
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,790
- No anger... - Brave, ever forward.

624
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,740
You were born extraordinary.

625
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,750
I suppose you've never faced such humiliation.

626
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,830
If you submit,

627
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,070
it may unsettle your faith.

628
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,680
If you resist to the death,

629
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,030
your dignity might be tarnished.

630
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,070
And in the end, I'd still say

631
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,030
you were playing hard to get,

632
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,550
even more humiliating.

633
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,160
Am I right?

634
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,000
Rest assured,

635
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,350
I won't lay a finger on you.

636
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,240
If I were you,

637
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,160
I wouldn't return to Snow City now.

638
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,480
Whoever leaked your deployment

639
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,590
must hold a high position

640
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,720
in the Immortal Alliance.

641
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,250
With your powers gone,

642
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,360
if you run into them,

643
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,840
you'd stand no chance.

644
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,360
They'd undoubtedly try to kill you.

645
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,880
Xie Xuechen.

646
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,400
Xie Xuechen!

647
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,550
What exactly are you planning?

648
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,920
Do I need to tell you

649
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,880
what I'm planning?

650
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,000
But you,

651
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,280
whatever you're scheming,

652
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,360
I suggest you stop following me.

653
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,190
I know you don't want to travel with me.

654
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,280
But...

655
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,280
can you stop me from following you?

656
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
I already said

657
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,360
wherever you go,

658
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,150
I'll follow.

659
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,670
I never agreed to this.

660
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,150
Mr. Xie, you seem to have forgotten

661
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,440
I'm the Saintess of the Dark Abyss,

662
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,480
a villain.

663
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,590
I don't need your agreement.

664
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,760
I know you don't fear death,

665
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,030
but you care about the world

666
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,590
and you want to protect humanity.

667
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,000
As long as I'm willing,

668
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,670
the whole world becomes my hostage.

669
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,280
Back in the Dark Abyss,

670
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,550
I should've killed you.

671
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,000
But you missed your chance.

672
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,400
Now,

673
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,000
you're at my mercy.

674
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,480
Miss Mu!

675
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,000
Mr. Hou.

676
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,960
Miss Mu.

677
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,440
Mr. Hou.

678
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,230
Thank you for saving us.

679
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,030
I'll repay this debt

680
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,630
in the future.

681
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,280
No need for that.

682
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,070
Miss Mu,

683
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,150
this place

684
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,960
mostly breeds small ponies.

685
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,320
There's only one fine steed

686
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,280
that can travel hundreds of li a day.

687
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,360
I bought it for you.

688
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,000
But I told the merchant

689
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,670
to let me know

690
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,710
if he gets more good horses.

691
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,320
If you're not in a hurry,

692
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,320
you can wait and stay

693
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,670
a few more days.

694
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,190
Hubby,

695
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,360
what do you think?

696
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,190
Since we're eloping,

697
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,840
we might be pursued.

698
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,710
I'm afraid we'll bring trouble to Mr. Hou and the madam.

699
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,320
So, we can't stay long.

700
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,030
There's only one horse,

701
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,400
but it'll do.

702
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:13,710
Mr. Hou,

703
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,440
thank you for your efforts.

704
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,710
No need to thank me.

705
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,190
It was just a small gesture.

706
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,480
But today, I asked around at the market.

707
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,760
There's no news

708
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,710
of any martial artists nearby.

709
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,320
Our Qingshan Market

710
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,590
rarely sees outsiders.

711
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,030
If any martial artists came,

712
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,230
someone would've known about it.

713
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:31,960
Miss Mu,

714
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,670
your family

715
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,710
probably doesn't know you're here.

716
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,800
You can relax.

717
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,840
There's no need to rush off.

718
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,670
Staying a few more days wouldn't hurt.

719
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,920
If my husband says we should leave,

720
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,360
then of course I'll follow his lead.

721
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,360
Mr. Hou,

722
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,800
we have no gold or silver.

723
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,110
Take this hairpin as a small token of gratitude.

724
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,000
Thank you for your trouble.

725
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,480
Oh...

726
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,760
this is too much!

727
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,280
Just take it on the madam's behalf.

728
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,440
Thank her for me.

729
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,550
Miss Mu...

730
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,960
We've found you.

731
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,400
Desire Demon!

732
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,000
You set up the Demon Array.

733
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,510
This Mr. Hou of yours

734
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,480
has developed a desire for you.

735
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,000
Knowing it's out of reach,

736
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,710
yet unwilling to let go,

737
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,920
this has given birth

738
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,800
to an inner demon.

739
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,030
And once there's an inner demon,

740
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,880
it can be controlled.

741
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,880
So, are you blaming me

742
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,000
for being too charming?

743
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:09,960
But...

744
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,960
how did you get out?

745
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,110
She's using the Illusion Elixir.

746
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,960
This isn't her true form.

747
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,590
It's a projection.

748
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,110
During the battle at the Immortals Array,

749
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,030
we were so focused on fighting

750
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,190
that we didn't get a good look

751
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,960
at Mr. Xie's appearance.

752
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,710
Now that I see you today,

753
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,230
Anger Demon was right

754
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,440
and you are quite good-looking.

755
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,630
Fighting is exhausting.

756
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,960
Be good and come back to the Dark Abyss with me.

757
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,000
He's mine.

758
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,110
Oh, really?

759
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,360
This is bad.

760
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,230
It's Desire Demon's Cage of Greed.

761
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,280
Though Desire Demon isn't as skilled in combat as Anger Demon,

762
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,840
she's extremely troublesome.

763
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,360
This Cage of Greed

764
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,690
traps people

765
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,400
in their desires,

766
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,880
leading them to die in bliss.

767
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,030
Xie Xuechen,

768
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,670
you...

769
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:24,480
Be careful!

770
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,230
Xie Xuechen,

771
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,110
my chest hurts so much...

772
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,800
Can you check it for me?

773
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,240
You truly live up to the name

774
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,960
of the strongest sword cultivator in the world.

775
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,590
What's wrong?

776
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,000
Did I fail

777
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,510
to imitate the Saintess convincingly?

778
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,230
Or do you simply dislike her?

779
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,320
The Dark Clan has no heartbeat.

780
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,320
The one who was struck by the arrow

781
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,590
was indeed Mu Xuanling.

782
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,960
But at the moment she fell,

783
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,360
it was already you.

784
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,920
I was careless.

785
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,150
I forgot that you have

786
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,960
extraordinary perception.

787
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,630
Just relying on this substitution trick

788
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,320
can't fool you.

789
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,280
Had I known earlier,

790
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
I would've taken a human heart to use instead.

791
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,670
Such a misstep!

792
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,710
The hardest thing for people to overcome

793
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,670
is their own desires.

794
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,670
No matter how strong you are,

795
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,070
you won't escape.

796
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,110
Mr. Xie,

797
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,550
before you die,

798
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,670
enjoy this worldly bliss.

799
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Meow, where are you?

800
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,440
Meow!

801
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,360
Where is Xie Xuechen?

802
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,590
The Saintess of the Dark Abyss,

803
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,440
throwing herself in front of an arrow for a man?

804
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,510
You protect him so much.

805
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,110
Could it be

806
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,800
that Anger Demon was right?

807
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,960
Have you really fallen for Xie Xuechen

808
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,710
and plan to betray the Dark Abyss?

809
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,550
What do you think?

810
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,590
I think it's unlike you.

811
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,840
That's why I'm standing here

812
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,800
talking to you.

813
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,070
Otherwise,

814
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,150
I would've already taken

815
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,320
both of your heads back

816
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,440
to report to His Grace.

817
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,800
Report to Master?

818
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,960
Why don't you use that brain

819
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,760
that you hardly ever use?

820
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,630
If Master hadn't allowed it,

821
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
how could I so easily

822
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,030
take Xie Xuechen out of the Dark Abyss?

823
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,760
What do you mean?

824
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,320
How do you think Xie Xuechen

825
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,670
escaped the Lava Execution Ground?

826
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,840
Naturally, someone helped him.

827
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,030
The Lava

828
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,070
is guarded by eighteen layers of restrictions.

829
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,400
How could you possibly

830
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,630
have the ability to break them?

831
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,150
I don't have that ability.

832
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,590
It was Xie Xuechen himself who broke them.

833
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,280
I merely

834
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,230
gave him an elixir

835
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,920
to restore his strength.

836
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,800
Think about it.

837
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,320
How could I obtain

838
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,150
such a rare elixir?

839
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,480
It was given to you by His Grace?

840
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,070
Master instructed me to let him go.

841
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,150
That way,

842
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,510
I'd owe him his life,

843
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,590
allowing me to stay by his side

844
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,400
and wait for the chance to seize the tokens.
