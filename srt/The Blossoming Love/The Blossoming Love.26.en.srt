Why He Xianwo took her to the Dark Abyss?

We don't know why,

81

but He Xianwo is a very calculating man,

82

and everything he does

Now we know

85
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,850
that he probably created

the three-way chaos on purpose.

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,390
On the one hand,

88
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,390
he took advantage of the chaos to take Miss Gao captive,

89
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,640
and on the other hand,

90
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,600
he wanted to use the power of the Immortal Alliance

91
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,040
to seal the Dark Clan

92
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,520
so that he could carry out his real plan

in the Dark Abyss.

94
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,230
What is his real plan?

95
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,990
He wants to use the Chaos Power

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,310

97
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,790

98
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:23,960
So

99
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,900
He Xianwo thinks Gao Qiumin is the Chaos Pearl?

100
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,990
Gao Qiumin is the Chaos Pearl?

101
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,040

102
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,550

103
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,160
Gao Qiumin isn't,

104
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,190
but if He Xianwo thinks so,

105
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,160
does he

106
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,850
want to use Gao Qiumin's power

107
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,680
to repair the Celestial Ladder?

108
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,670
It was rumored that back in the day,

109
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,190
Emperor Zhao Ming plagued the world

110
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,640
and even tried to kill the immortals,

111
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:46,990
making them angry.

112
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,040
The Divine Clan didn't want to protect the Humans anymore,

113
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,640
so they cut off the Celestial Ladder.

114
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,930
Then why does He Xianwo think that with the Chaos Pearl

115
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,580
he can fix the Celestial Ladder?

116
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,110
Because it was the Chaos Pearl

117
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,080

They are the executors of the Way of Heaven

127

and are holier than the Divine Clan,

128
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,280
but the Book of Fate has never appeared in the world,

129
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,750
so the only thing that He Xianwo

131
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,960

132
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,520
But I was in the Dark Abyss for ten years.

If the legend is true,

136
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,720
the remains of the Celestial Ladder

137
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,720

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,040
and any mortal who enters

178

aren't you?

183
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,710
I told you

184
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,000
Mu Xuanling is not the Chaos Pearl,

185
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,310

00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,710
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.

190
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,360
Not gonna hurt anybody?

191
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,070
How many people have been injured or killed

192
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,590
in the war between these three clans?

193
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,820
Isn't the life

194
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,880
of the world a life?

195
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,550
I also feel sorry.

196
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,120
You're just verbally sorry.

197
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,790
You'll do anything and everything frantically

198
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,880
to open the Celestial Ladder.

199
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,040
What makes you want to go to the Celestial Realm?

200
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,920
I hear there's a never-ending celestial spring

201
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,040
at the Celestial Realm

202
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,000
and that people, without labor

203
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,740
and unhappiness,

204
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,240
live forever with spiritual energy

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,120
from the human realm

206
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,880
while the Humans experience old age, sickness, and death.

207
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,470
Even suffering from hunger

208
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,000
depends on the mercy of God.

209
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,470
I would love to go to the Celestial Realm

210
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,520
and see why things

211
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,520
are so unfair.

212
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,760
You set up the Decaying Immortal Pavilion

213
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,310
and caused chaos again and again.

214
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,920
How much blood is on your hands?

215
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,120
Now you come here

216
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,070
and pretend to be compassionate.

217
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,830
It's been fun arguing with you,

218
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,830
but I'm afraid we've run out of time

219
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,520
because your friends are already here.

220
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,310
Qiumin.

221
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,280
Fu Lansheng.

222
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,570
He Xianwo.

223
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,570
Let her go

224
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,070
He's in league with Nan Xuyue.

225
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,140
They have something up their sleeves.

226
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,820
Get out of here.

227
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,400
Get out of here.

228
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,710
Let her go.

229
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,790
Get me.

230
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,790
I'll be at your disposal.

231
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:09,710
He Xianwo.

232
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,190
It's me you want.

233
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,400
Let her go.

234
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,710
Let me take care of it.

235
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,040
His sword is at her neck.

236
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,590
No matter how fast your sword is,

237
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,040
you can't keep her safe.

238
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,070
I'm the Chaos Pearl

239
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,070
and the one who started this,

240
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,710
so I don't want to owe her.

241
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,920
It is you I trust.

242
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,640
Even if I'm captured by He Xianwo,

243
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,310
you'll be able to get me out,

244
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,000
right?

245
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,040
Mu Xuanling.

246
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,720
You and I are rivals,

247
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,940
so I've never liked you.

248
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,360
Even if you come to replace me now,

249
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,670
I won't be grateful to you.

250
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,620
Not at all.

251
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,460
Stop that nonsense.

252
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,430
Do you think I like you?

253
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,670
Piece of trash.

254
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,780
How unlucky are you

255
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,760
that you're always being held hostage?

256
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,590
I advise you to go back and learn the escaping technique.

257
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,790
If you can't beat someone, you can escape.

258
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,880
Mu Xuanling.

259
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,360
When I was little,

260
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,590
you died for me,

261
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,280
so I owe you.

262
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,360
Today,

263
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,430
I want to pay you back.

264
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,920
No.

265
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:30,920
Qiumin.

266
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,430
- Gao Qiumin. - Qiumin.

267
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,430
The Square Sword Array.

268
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,520
You can't escape.

269
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,950
You seem to have gotten cocky too soon.

270
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,880
Gao Qiumin is stupid,

271
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,550
but she's right about one thing.

272
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,070
Since I'm teaming up with Nan Xuyue,

273
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,360
how can I not have something up my sleeve?

274
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,590
Mr. Nan,

275
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,520
it's your turn.

276
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,830
Immortals Array?

277
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,760
Nan Xuyue.

278
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,360
You betrayed me?

279
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,790
I've never been loyal to you,

280
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,360
so how can I betray you?

281
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,310
Six thousand years ago,

282
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,000
the Immortal Alliance used all the power of the Chaos Pearl

283
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,640
to build the Immortals Array,

284
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,590
and now, you only have the Chaos Pearl

285
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,670
but not the Chaos Power,

286
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,000
so rebuilding the Immortals Array

287
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,920
is just a pipe dream.

288
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,520
A pipe dream?

289
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,430
You were right.

290
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,120
He is the evil cultivator

291
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,280
that Feng Xiang and I met

292
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,640
when we built the Immortals Array 6,000 years ago,

293
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,160
and he has really lived for so long.

294
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,190
He was trying

295
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,760
to seize the Chaos Pearl

296
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,160
but was seriously injured by my killing move.

297
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,830
I thought he was dead,

298
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,240
but according to you,

299
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,280
it looks like he's faked his own death to take refuge

300
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,400
and survived all these years

301
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,640
by changing his face.

302
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,430
However,

303
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,590
why did you suspect

304
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,760
He Xianwo had lived long?

305
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,830
He knows how to break the Immortals Array,

306
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,310
so I'm guessing

307
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,400
that when you built it back then,

308
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,160
he was probably snooping around

309
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,920
and learning the key to the array.

310
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,360
And not long ago,

311
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,040
he refined the Illusion Elixir.

312
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,280
The Illusion Elixir's ingredient the Phoenix Herb

313
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,790
went extinct with the collapse

314
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,190
of Phoenix Mountain

315
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,950
6,000 years ago.

316
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,710
It's true that he couldn't have gotten it

317
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,160
if he hadn't existed

318
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,640
6,000 years ago or more.

319
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,070
But what I am puzzled about is

320
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,640
that even if a human cultivator

321
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,280
reaches the Spiritual Form stage,

322
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,470
his lifespan is only a thousand years at most.

323
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,280
Feng Xiang paid such a huge price

324
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,590
to get immortality,

325
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,550
but how come He Xianwo can live for so many years?

326
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,470
Has he also seen High Cyclic Divinity?

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,590
I don't think so.

328
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,470
You've seen what it takes

329
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,160
to live forever,

330
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:23,920
but

331
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,400
I did once hear of an evil spell

332
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,640
that sucks the blood and essence

333
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,520
of others and uses their lives

334
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,710
to prolong one's own.

335
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,160
The practitioner of this spell

336
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,880
extends their own life

337
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,590
but suffers a great backlash.

338
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,710
They look normal on the outside

339
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,470
but rot like mud

340
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,000
on the inside.

341
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,760
Eventually, their bodies will explode,

342
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,520
and they will die a doubly painful death.

343
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,160
I think this guy

344
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,240
has this evil skill.

345
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,950
What on earth

346
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,360
could make someone do that?

347
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,880
Qian Guang.

348
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,120
I have one more thing to ask.

349
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,160
Today, the Dark Abyss

350
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,470
is only sealed by Sang Qi's spiritual essence.

351
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,190
I'm afraid that won't last long,

352
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,190
so I want to rebuild the Immortals Array,

353
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,760
and I've read all the ancient texts of my ancestors.

354
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,360
The most important thing is the Chaos Power,

355
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,120
but the Chaos Pearl was exhausted

356
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
6,000 years ago,

357
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,040
so is there any other way

358
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,000
to rebuild the Immortals Array

359
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,240
without the Chaos Power?

360
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
There is indeed a way

361
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,430
to rebuild it

362
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,360
without the Chaos Power.

363
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,070
It requires

364
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
that the three most powerful men

365
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,470
of spiritual power stand

366
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,240
above the doors

367
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,190
of rehabilitation,

368
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,070
life,

369
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,590
and death

370
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,310
to complete it.

371
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,550
Thanks, Qian Guang

372
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,040
Don't thank me now.

373
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,430
The Death Door is the place

374
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,120
where the calamity occurs.

375
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,880
Without the power

376
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,120
of the Chaos Pearl,

377
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,280
those on the Death Door

378
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,790
will die from the exhaustion of their spiritual power.

379
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,920
This is

380
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,750
the only solution.

381
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,320
In Snow City, Xuantian Sect,

382
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,420
Mirage Palace, Jade Sky Palace,

383
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,160
and even the Dark Abyss,

384
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,380
the older generation of Saints in the Spiritual Form stage

385
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,190
have fallen one after another,

386
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,670
so the only strongest people with spiritual power today

387
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,560
are me,

388
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,270
Mu Xuanling,

389
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,600
and

390
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,190
you.

391
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,230
So since then,

392
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,600
I have not been plotting against you,

393
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,840
and I have fallen into your trap.

394
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,840
We can't predict

395
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,430
your every plan,

396
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,400
but we know what you want in the end.

397
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,460
He Xianwo.

398
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,030
The Death Door is for you.

399
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,510
Working with Nan Xuyue

400
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,080
wasn't that difficult.

401
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,510
Nan Xuyue.

402
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,510
Do you really know

403
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,560
what he is like

404
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,320
or what he does behind the scenes?

405
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,990
Why?

406
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,600
A man who deserves to die

407
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,470
but doesn't want to

408
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,510
will struggle.

409
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,990
He or she will make one wrong step

410
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
if wavering in that struggle,

411
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,840
and then everything will be wrong from there.

412
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,750
That's what happened to me.

413
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,120
It's irrefutable.

414
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,880
Then why are you suddenly telling me everything?

415
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,920
This is He Xianwo's medicine.

416
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,360
It renews my life

417
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,950
but keeps me coerced

418
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,160
and in control.

419
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,270
Now I don't want to go on.

420
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,510
There's a price to pay

421
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,750
for wrongdoing.

422
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,670
Kill me

423
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,710
or let me do something for you

424
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,710
before killing me.

425
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,670
Nan Xuyue

426
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,360
was coerced by me

427
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,360
and in my control?

428
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,230
Is that really true?

429
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,120
You're going to die,

430
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,880
so go ahead and laugh.

431
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,230
After you laugh,

432
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,080
take all your sins to hell

433
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,560
and atone for them.

434
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,080
Start the array.

435
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,120
Your alliance

436
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,560
is just fragile.

437
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,670
Do you really think

438
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,030
what Nan Xuyue did can be ignored

439
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,920
and dismissed as nothing?

440
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,510
And you, Nan Xuyue?

441
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,950
Can you really let her go?

442
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,160
Isn't she the reason

443
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,400
you want to live?

444
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,880
This is my own business.

445
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,030
I don't need you to worry about it.

446
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,120
Nan Xuyue.

447
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,560
Nan Xuyue, think carefully.

448
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,560
If I die,

449
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,400
you won't get the medicine,

450
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,430
and you'll die too.

451
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,510
Finally,

452
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
everyone's in.

453
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,510
Everyone?

454
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,710
Nan Xuyue.

455
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,560
Open the array.

456
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,670
OK.

457
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,990
As you wish.

458
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,190
No.

459
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,800
Nan Xuyue.

460
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,030
What are you doing?

461
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,600
The array has been activated.

462
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,430
No one in the array

463
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,120
can escape.

464
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,270
All three doors are death,

465
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,120
so all three

466
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,270
will be dead.

467
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,430
What a great play.

468
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,840
Nan Xuyue.

469
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,710
Do you want to kill her too?

470
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,800
What are you planning?

471
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,160
Xuanling.

472
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,880
I love you.

473
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,190
It is you I trust.

474
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,710
Even if I'm captured by He Xianwo,

475
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,670
you'll be able to get me out,

476
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,470
right?

477
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,080
Xuanling.

478
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,670
Xuanling.

479
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,710
No.

480
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,560
Mu Xuanling.

481
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,640
Mu Xuanling.

482
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:00,710
No.

483
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,600
It shouldn't be like this.

484
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,160
Whose lover

485
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,400
always calls the other

486
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,840
by the full name like you do?

487
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,190
Call me Ling from now on,

488
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,880
okay?

489
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,560
Okay.

490
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,950
Okay.

491
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,510
As you wish.

492
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,780
♪Searching for your face in the cycles of life♪

493
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,600
Why?

494
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,400
Why is it like this?

495
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,160
I heard everything

496
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,080
you said to Xuanxin.

497
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,640
Do you really want to work with Nan Xuyue?

498
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,510
You know he can't be trusted.

499
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,100
♪Not how far the road goes♪

500
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,840
To rebuild the Immortals Array,

501
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,270
it must be activated and opened

502
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,270
by an array builder.

503
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,880
In all the world,

504
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,430
Nan Xuyue is the only one who can do it,

505
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,950
so I have no choice.

506
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,230
What if he's got something else up his sleeve?

507
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,640
From the moment I made the plan,

508
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,840
I put my own life on the line.

509
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,640
Xuanxin,

510
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,190
if I die,

511
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,320
you will be the next leader of the Immortal Alliance.

512
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,600
I hope this sudden request

513
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,640
won't give you a hard time.

514
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,800
But what about Miss Mu?

515
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,400
She has a jade token

516
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,640
from Nan Xuyue.

517
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,270
I checked that,

518
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,160
and it's a protective treasure.

519
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,990
As long as it's there,

520
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,510
Xuanling won't die.

521
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,560
I mean,

522
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,470
if you die,

523
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,930
how will Miss Mu

524
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,710
spend the rest of her life?

525
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,470
Mu Xuanling

526
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,710
was born in the human realm and raised in the Dark Abyss.

527
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,640
The world has never been kind to her,

528
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,360
but with her will,

529
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,840
she has made her way through injustice

530
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,510
and crushed all the pain and humiliation

531
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,470
under her feet.

532
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,920
She is never attached to me.

533
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,270
She is what she is.

534
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,990
Her life will not be dimmed

535
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,670
or rendered meaningless

536
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,190
by my death.

537
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:52,990
I loved her,

538
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,360
honored her,

539
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,670
and believed in her,

540
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,400
but

541
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,880
those who live

542
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,640
often suffer more than those who die.

543
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,400
I will become so selfish

544
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,600
that I'll make her the one who survived.

545
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,270
In every battle,

546
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,160
you're prepared to die.

547
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,840
You always think of everyone

548
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,120
but yourself.

549
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,560
Xie Xuechen.

550
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,840
You're so stupid.

551
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,470
You have a heart of gold,

552
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,840
and you need someone

553
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,320
to care about you,

554
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,670
so let me,

555
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,080
a demon girl, die.

556
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,470
I'm sorry.

557
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,430
You should be the one

558
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,030
to survive.

559
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,080
Xie Xuechen.

560
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,600
This time,

561
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,950
let me protect you,

562
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,230
okay?

563
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,470
It should have been me who took the hit.

564
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,840
No.

565
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,190
You won't die.

566
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,120
I won't let you die.

567
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,560
Xuanling.

568
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,030
