[Episode 22]

18
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,910
Are you still awake?

19
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,600
Have you been staying up

20
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,400
because you are worried about me?

21
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,430
Don't flatter yourself.

22
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,590
We are enemies.

23
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,470
If it weren't for String Bonding,

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,430
I'd gotten rid of you long ago.

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,680
Don't worry.

26
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,840
It's not that easy for me to die.

27
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,120
That's one more reason for me to worry.

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,960
I hope that the Lotus of Life dies

29
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,560
from the explosion caused by Feng Xiang today.

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,430
You can give up

31
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,750
and I can stop wasting my time with you.

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,240
I will try again

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,080
no matter what.

34
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,630
I hope the Lotus of Life is fine

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,460
and we will see the day

36
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,620
that we get lotus seeds.

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,630
I will be back.

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,150
What if…

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
What if you can't get back?

40
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,400
In that case,

41
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,800
the String Bonding will disappear on its own.

42
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,310
If that happens,

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,000
you can get back by yourself.

44
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,560
Why didn't you start with that?

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,710
I don't want to hear anything else.

46
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,860
I think that since Feng Xiang

47
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,910
is dead now,

48
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,310
the danger in the woods must have disappeared with her.

49
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,450
Even if there are still any,

50
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,430
I've been here yesterday.

51
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,800
I'll be fine.

52
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,150
Mu Xuanling.

53
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,800
If we are in danger,

54
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,240
don't mind me.

55
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,000
You are telling me that?

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,190
The Lotus of Life is no common plant.

57
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
It's not damaged at all.

58
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,470
Even the plants around it

59
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,560
are recovering fast.

60
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,070
The Lotus of Life.

61
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,270
The Lotus of Life!

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,430
It does exist.

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,000
Feng Xiang?

64
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,880
Saint.

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,720
You are all right?

66
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,510
Who are you?

67
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,070
We met yesterday.

68
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Don't you remember?

69
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,000
My memory is not so bad

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,610
that I can't remember things happened yesterday.

71
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,960
The Lotus of Life.

72
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,810
Life.

73
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,560
Who are you?

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,560
Who sent you?

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
What are you doing here?

76
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,120
Did Feng Xiang come back to life

77
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,650
because of the Lotus of Life?

78
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:21,950
Saint,

79
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,240
we got into this place by accident.

80
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,870
I wonder what that is?

81
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,310
You mentioned

82
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,000
that it's the Lotus of Life.

83
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,830
Absorbing the aura of the world

84
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,920
and forming the Waterless Land,

85
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,680
nothing can do that

86
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,510
other than the Lotus of Life.

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,190
Can people gain immortality

88
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,310
by taking the Lotus of Life?

89
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,410
Can they recover

90
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,930
even if they suffered

91
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,220
an unrecoverable injury?

92
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,070
Of course.

93
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,430
The Lotus of Life can give people immortality,

94
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,920
let alone physical injuries.

95
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
You are already in the spiritual form stage.

96
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,160
You will live much longer than common people.

97
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,120
Why are you after immortality?

98
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Immortality

99
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,650
is the goal of all cultivators.

100
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,850
With enough time,

101
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,420
one might break through the spiritual form

102
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,680
and ascend to a higher stage.

103
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,310
Besides,

104
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,360
I don't have much time left.

105
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,560
According to the records in the Immortal Alliance,

106
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,870
when the Dark Clan invaded the human realm,

107
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,240
the Dark Abyss kept pushing its boundary

108
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
toward the human world.

109
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,310
The top cultivator, Qian Guang,

110
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,000
mustered the power of all immortal sects

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,770
and formed the Immortal Alliance.

112
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,270
They paid a great price

113
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,920
to form the Immortals Array

114
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,800
which stopped the invasion of the Dark Clan.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,390
You are not aged.

116
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,680
You should still have hundreds of years to live.

117
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,480
Is your lifespan shortened

118
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,720
because of some severe injury?

119
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,800
That's correct.

120
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,510
But it has nothing to do with you.

121
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,310
I don't know how did you wander into this place,

122
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,000
but you don't belong here.

123
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,800
Please leave.

124
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,240
This is a place with sufficient spiritual power.

125
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,870
We want to

126
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,430
train here.

127
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,510
Find someplace far away.

128
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,240
I don't like seeing

129
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,270
strange people.

130
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,680
Are you suspecting

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,800
that Feng Xiang revived after died yesterday,

132
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,870
plus she has lived for 6,000 years

133
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,430
because she ate the Lotus of Life?

134
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,160
But why doesn't she remember anything

135
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,190
that happened yesterday?

136
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't understand that either.

137
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Maybe there is something strange

138
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,040
about the Lotus of Life.

139
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,950
When I saw her yesterday,

140
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,160
it was as if she saw the Lotus of Life

141
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,160
for the first time.

142
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,270
I even speculated

143
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,510
that she had an accident

144
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,190
that caused her lifespan to shorten.

145
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,240
She knew that she didn't have much time left,

146
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,270
so she relied on the Lotus of Life

147
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,750
to live longer.

148
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,040
She probably has guarded this place

149
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,160
for the last 6,000 years.

150
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,600
That means

151
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,600
she has attained immortality,

152
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,680
yet she doesn't know it at all.

153
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,850
She thought she needed to wait for the Lotus of Life to bloom.

154
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,310
In that case,

155
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,660
she might have tried

156
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,810
to get the Lotus of Life multiple times.

157
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,480
If she has kept any of the lotus seeds

158
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,510
which are useless to her,

159
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,880
then we wouldn't have to wait

160
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,120
for the lotus to bloom

161
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,270
or fear that we don't have enough time.

162
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,440
What do you plan to do?

163
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,320
Let's keep waiting

164
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,120
and see all the things

165
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,320
that are abnormal about her.

166
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,270
She's still there.

167
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,360
She… She disappeared!

168
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,320
Feng Xiang has disappeared!

169
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,120
How did she disappear into thin air?

170
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,120
The Dark Cloud Mountain

171
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,720
just keeps surprising us with strangeness.

172
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,120
The sun is going down.

173
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,870
If Feng Xiang is still around,

174
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,200
the spirit fog will move with her.

175
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,120
It seems that she's no longer here.

176
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,630
But she couldn't be far away

177
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:41,790
so that she could

178
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,670
get here first thing tomorrow morning

179
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,150
to get the Lotus of Life.

180
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,480
To figure this out,

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,120
we need to find her first.

182
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,720
Maybe we can find some lotus seeds

183
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,390
at her resting place for the night.

184
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,840
I'll go search for Feng Xiang's aura.

185
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,150
You wait for me in the cave we stayed.

186
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,030
Why?

187
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,750
I've been following you around for a whole day

188
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,630
and you are ditching me

189
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,320
when we are so close to the truth.

190
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,120
My eyesight is not worse than yours.

191
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,200
I'm not afraid

192
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,270
after nightfall.

193
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,290
I'm just worried about you.

194
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,080
What for?

195
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,240
Now that we've traveled so long,

196
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,630
I have to know.

197
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,630
Don't even try to exclude me.

198
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,120
Fine.

199
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,750
Let's go check things out together.

200
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,720
What is she doing here?

201
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,080
Let's get closer.

202
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,670
Is she dead?

203
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,150
She's just feeble.

204
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,390
She'll wake up when the sun is up.

205
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,720
Isn't it dangerous for her

206
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,550
to be defenseless like this?

207
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,870
Even if she dies,

208
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,960
she'll revive tomorrow.

209
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,150
Right?

210
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,440
If there are lotus seeds left,

211
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,000
where could they be?

212
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,240
He…

213
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,600
Is he a human or a ghost?

214
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,720
Qian Guang!

215
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes.

216
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,480
I am Qian Guang.

217
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,270
[Qian Guang]

218
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,390
How did you recognize me?

219
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,670
According to historical records,

220
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,200
Qian Guang was the first leader

221
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,610
who founded the Immortal Alliance.

222
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,720
He and Feng Xiang are companions.

223
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,630
They fought evils together

224
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,120
and were nightmares for the Dark Clan.

225
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,360
Yet, the two top spiritual form cultivators

226
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,840
disappeared after setting

227
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,600
the Immortals Array

228
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,790
and were never seen again.

229
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,440
The legend has it

230
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,030
that Qian Guang and Feng Xiang

231
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,510
are in love and formed a bond.

232
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,670
They were in seclusion.

233
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,270
No one has seen

234
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,200
these two saints again.

235
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,240
When I saw Feng Xiang,

236
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,120
I wondered about you.

237
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,390
Who would have thought

238
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,270
that my guess was right?

239
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,720
It has been 6,000 years.

240
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,960
If you didn't barge in here,

241
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,600
I'd have forgotten the time.

242
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,030
Sir,

243
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,750
how did you and Feng Xiang

244
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,480
get trapped in the Dark Cloud Mountain for 6,000 years?

245
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,750
Besides, it seems that Feng Xiang

246
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,840
is in a cycle.

247
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,120
Is it because of the Lotus of Life?

248
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,250
You have accurate intuition.

249
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,960
You are close to the truth.

250
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,960
Every day when the sun comes out,

251
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,040
Feng Xiang

252
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,620
would wake up here.

253
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,850
And when the sun goes down,

254
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,000
she would lose all her consciousness and memories

255
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,000
and get back here.

256
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,030
Then she'd begin

257
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,240
another repeated day here.

258
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,790
So,

259
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,270
she lived for 6,000 years,

260
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,670
yet it's just

261
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,480
one repeated day for her.

262
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,000
Is this the immortality brought by the Lotus of Life?

263
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,910
People dream about immortality.

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,080
They go to extremes for that.

265
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,960
But how can there be no cost?

266
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Feng Xiang and I

267
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,750
encountered an evil cultivator

268
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,720
who tried to steal the Chaos Pearl.

269
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,200
He seemed young and decent,

270
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,320
yet he claimed that he learned

271
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,320
an evil method that absorbs the souls of others

272
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,120
to get immortality.

273
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,320
I can't believe that someone would cultivate

274
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,000
that kind of evil method for the Chaos Pearl.

275
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,790
To achieve immortality

276
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,550
with the Lotus of Life

277
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
also requires

278
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,030
a great sacrifice.

279
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:35,790
When Feng Xiang

280
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,000
ate the Lotus of Life,

281
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,960
she didn't get immortality.

282
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,910
She entered

283
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,840
a Realm of Power Inhibition.

284
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,080
There's nothing

285
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,270
but a lofty ladder

286
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,390
in that realm.

287
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,270
The cultivators' spiritual channels will be sealed off,

288
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,510
and have to take

289
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,360
the 38,000 attacks

290
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,240
from the blade-like wind

291
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,080
and get to the end of the lofty ladder.

292
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,600
Cultivators who haven't reached the spiritual form stage

293
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,870
will be shredded into dust

294
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,000
by a mere touch of the wind.

295
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,200
Those who are in the spiritual form stage

296
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
still have to suffer from the pain of slow-slicing

297
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,910
to end up meeting

298
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,840
the High Cyclic Divinity.

299
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,150
The High Cyclic Divinity?

300
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,150
He claims to be the deity of time in the divine realm

301
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,000
and has been guarding the realm for ten thousand years.

302
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,390
He said that he was waiting for someone.

303
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,080
Maybe a human,

304
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,750
or maybe not.

305
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,960
There are…

306
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,080
still Divine Clan members in the world.

307
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,720
I heard of a legend

308
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,440
that ten thousand years ago,

309
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,360
the Divine Clan protected all living beings

310
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,150
and was worshiped by them.

311
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,910
Yet, a human emperor, Zhao Ming,

312
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,120
misguided the inner demons of human beings

313
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,150
and attacked the Divine Clan.

314
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,910
The Divine Clan put him down

315
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,720
and he was reduced to a degenerated deity.

316
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,390
He was kept under the Lava

317
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,360
and thus the Dark Clan was born.

318
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,670
The Divine Clan found human beings repellent because of that

319
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,080
and stopped offering protection to the world.

320
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,720
So, how could there

321
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,550
be a Divine Clan member who's still guarding the world?

322
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,580
When I saw him,

323
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,210
he was filled with divine power.

324
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,510
If he's not a Divine Clan member,

325
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,620
who could he be?

326
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,000
He told me

327
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,000
that Feng Xiang ate the Lotus of Life

328
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,870
and bore the pain of countless slices

329
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,440
to meet him.

330
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,480
The High Cyclic Divinity

331
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,750
claimed that he was a kind deity.

332
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,960
Whoever meets him…

333
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,440
Whoever meets me

334
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,440
can make a wish.

335
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,080
I will make the wish come true.

336
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,720
But you have to know

337
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,120
that fate has its way.

338
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,630
If you are wishing for too much,

339
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,960
fate will make you pay.

340
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,200
That's the cost of wishes.

341
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,390
The more you wish for,

342
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,000
the greater the cost.

343
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,150
Do you understand?

344
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,870
Yes.

345
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,030
I wish

346
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,000
for immortality

347
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,750
and forever youth.

348
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,510
Once your wish is granted,

349
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,000
it can never be revoked

350
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,750
no matter what happens.

351
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,830
The same

352
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,960
with the cost.

353
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Do you understand?

354
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes.

355
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes.

356
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,750
Since then,

357
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,110
Feng Xiang has been stuck

358
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,960
on the same day forever.

359
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,160
The realm of the High Cyclic Divinity

360
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,680
only opens once for an individual.

361
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:25,680
It doesn't matter

362
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,960
how many Lotuses of Life

363
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,480
she eats after that.

364
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,410
Immortality

365
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,640
is where the Divine Clan's power lies.

366
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,420
It's not for human beings to get.

367
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,820
Immortality in that form

368
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,650
is a punishment.

369
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,070
That is the cost

370
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,350
that Feng Xiang paid.

371
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,750
But you have also existed for 6,000 years.

372
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,790
So,

373
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,830
did you make a wish to the High Cyclic Divinity as well?

374
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,550
You are brilliant.

375
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,400
Yes.

376
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,720
In the second year that she left,

377
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,070
I searched the world

378
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,480
and finally found her here.

379
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,350
She was already in the cycle.

380
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,750
I tried to take her away,

381
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,400
but once the sun went gown,

382
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,920
she would be brought back here.

383
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,140
I kept her company

384
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,240
for a hundred years.

385
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,620
That was over 36,000 days and nights.

386
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,720
But whenever she woke up,

387
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,010
her memories reset,

388
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,310
and she forgot what happened the day before.

389
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,350
Humans have a short lifespan.

390
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,720
I was out of time,

391
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,350
and I didn't want to

392
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,480
leave her alone in this world.

393
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,790
So,

394
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,030
I took the Lotus of Life

395
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,480
when it was

396
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,070
mature again.

397
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,590
Eventually,

398
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,590
I met the High Cyclic Divinity.

399
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,940
A hundred years ago,

400
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,850
she also came here

401
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,400
and wished for immortality.

402
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,400
I gave her that.

403
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,200
But she's stuck

404
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,660
in the same day forever.

405
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,200
Isn't that also immortality?

406
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,590
She got what she wished for.

407
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,640
So,

408
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,030
what is your wish?

409
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,110
Can I wish for her to get rid

410
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,550
of immortality like that?

411
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,790
Wishes granted cannot be changed.

412
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,200
Otherwise,

413
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,480
I'd be breaking my promise to her.

414
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,160
Can you restore her memories?

415
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,070
That would be the jurisdiction of the High Fate Divinity.

416
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,160
He never gives back

417
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,720
what he took away.

418
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,510
You should focus

419
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,000
on a wish for yourself.

420
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,550
I'm not

421
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,960
quite patient.

422
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,440
I wish

423
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,110
I could live and die with her

424
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,000
and never be apart.

425
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,680
Granted.

426
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,790
Feng Xiang.

427
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,270
Feng Xiang.

428
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,400
Since then,

429
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,030
I have become her shadow.

430
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,880
I'm always close by,

431
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,030
yet she never knows.

432
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,550
Are you and Feng Xiang

433
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,680
a couple?

434
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,440
I owe her.

435
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,350
Back then,

436
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,310
the Dark Clan overrun the human world,

437
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,790
and I traveled around

438
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,440
to found the Immortal Alliance.

439
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,350
I heard of

440
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,310
Feng Xiang often.

441
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,160
They said that she made a name for herself at a young age

442
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,350
and that she's outstanding.

443
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,440
The Strike of Phoenix she developed

444
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,400
is a horror to the Dark Clan.

445
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,160
There were a lot of saints

446
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,100
who expressed their love

447
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,490
openly or secretly,

448
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,930
hoping to become

449
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,220
a couple in cultivation with her.

450
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,760
Yet Feng Xiang

451
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,650
was famously cruel and detached.

452
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,730
Cultivation was the only thing she cared about.

453
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,460
Romance

454
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,370
was the most annoying thing for her.

455
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,550
Having a no-good partner

456
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,160
will only delay my cultivation progress.

457
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,680
Men are always a drag.

458
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,110
You are different from them.

459
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,160
You are foolish,

460
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,500
yet you have more talents than me.

461
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,320
If you focus on your cultivation,

462
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,120
you might break through

463
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,920
the spiritual form one day

464
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,030
and achieve immortality.

465
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,000
Yet you are wasting your time

466
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,880
in fighting evils.

467
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,640
When bothered by all the trivial things,

468
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,000
you get distracted from your cultivation.

469
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,200
That slowed down your progress.

470
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,270
Your goal in cultivation

471
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,200
is to explore the limits of humanity.

472
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,240
My goal

473
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,550
is to maintain peace on this land.

474
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,160
Immortality

475
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,440
is not what I'm after.

476
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,750
I want to do as many things beneficial

477
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,350
to humanity as possible

478
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,880
in a limited lifespan.

479
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,200
So,

480
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,680
what's your answer?

481
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,960
Will you join the Immortal Alliance

482
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,000
and fight the Dark Clan with us?

483
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,720
Why would I?

484
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,550
I'm not attached to the mundane world in any way.

485
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,880
Cultivation

486
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,340
is the only thing I'm after.

487
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,680
Have you ever thought about

488
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,880
why you haven't broken through

489
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,070
the spiritual form stage

490
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
after a hundred years of cultivation?

491
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,590
Do you know the reason?

492
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,550
If you don't know the mundane world enough,

493
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,130
how can you break through the spiritual form stage?

494
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,610
If you don't do things that matter at the moment,

495
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,310
how can you achieve immortality?

496
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,720
You

497
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,590
are interesting in some ways.

498
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,590
So,

499
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,110
are you agreeing?

500
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,550
Come on.

501
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,590
I'll follow you

502
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,920
to get to know the mundane world

503
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,880
and deal with what matters at the moment.

504
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,070
You and Feng Xiang

505
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,790
are always together.

506
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,790
Are you

507
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,240
a couple now?

508
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,110
Saint Feng Xiang

509
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,830
is divine-like.

510
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,590
How can I offend her?

511
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,200
Since you don't have a partner,

512
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,180
what do you think of my sister?

513
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,370
Thank you

514
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,200
for your kindness.

515
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
I already

516
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,880
have someone on my mind.

517
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,350
By that, did you mean

518
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Saint Feng Xiang?

519
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:54,960
Yes.

520
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,440
Have you told her?

521
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,270
No.

522
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,640
During the time we were together,

523
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,590
she never expressed any interest

524
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,160
in a romantic relationship with me.

525
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,590
I thought

526
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,720
she didn't see me that way.

527
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,920
After that,

528
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,550
I got busier

529
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,790
with affairs in the Immortal Alliance.

530
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,440
Feng Xiang

531
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,880
showed up less and less.

532
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,350
Someone else told me

533
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,200
that she was in seclusion in the East Sea.

534
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,960
She didn't even tell me

535
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,160
that she was leaving.

536
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,000
Feng Xiang!

537
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,720
How's your life

538
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,510
on the Osprey Island?

539
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,510
Thank you for showing your care, Leader Qian Guang.

540
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,400
I'm fine.

541
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,400
Since you love Feng Xiang so much,

542
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,960
why didn't you tell her?

543
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,200
Is it because

544
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,070
you were angry?

545
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,720
I've never been angry with her.

546
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,480
I didn't say anything

547
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,310
because I thought I'd die.

548
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,550
When forming the Immortals Array,

549
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,200
ten saints shall each take a star position

550
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,880
and face the power of retribution

551
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,480
of the array with the help of the Chaos Pearl.

552
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,000
That's how the array can be connected.

553
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,510
In the ten star positions,

554
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,790
one of them is the death position.

555
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,920
The one who takes that position

556
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,920
will take a lethal strike.

557
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,400
I kept that position to myself.

558
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,440
I thought

559
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,920
about telling her my feelings

560
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,590
before I die.

561
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,490
Maybe she'd laugh at me,

562
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:45,960
or

563
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,960
feel annoyed.

564
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:49,920
Or, maybe,

565
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,040
she also feels something for me.

566
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,590
But what then?

567
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,790
I had no chance to survive.

568
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,880
Why bring her bad feelings?

569
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,440
The Immortals Array was a success.

570
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,200
The Dark Clan was sealed.

571
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,590
Peace was returned to the human world,

572
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,070
and I was lucky enough to survive the hit.

573
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,680
I passed out for days,

574
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,920
and when I woke up, I learned that…

575
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,680
Saint Feng Xiang was severely injured

576
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,310
and is in seclusion on Osprey Island.

577
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,640
What?

578
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,640
With Feng Xiang's power,

579
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,270
she shouldn't be severely injured.

580
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,880
Half of the saints in the other positions

581
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,030
are dead.

582
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,070
Let alone

583
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,680
the death position.

584
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,590
Even with Saint Feng Xiang's power,

585
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,960
the Thunder Trial Fire is still too much.

586
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,680
That's the karma used to slay deities.

587
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,960
It was me

588
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,310
who was in the death position.

589
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,000
Saint Feng Xiang

590
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,720
asked for the death position for herself.

591
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,920
She switched the array diagram

592
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,160
and asked me to keep that from you.

593
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,750
She said that she was more powerful than you.

594
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,810
She'd be able to

595
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,240
survive the death position

596
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,350
and complete the Immortals Array.

597
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:53,880
I'm going to her now.

598
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,440
Leader Qian Guang,

599
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,590
Saint Feng Xiang never got back.

600
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,790
Where could she be?

601
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,480
We don't know.

602
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,830
Her heart was never on the Osprey Island.

603
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,160
If she wants to leave,

604
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,510
we can't stop her.

605
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,110
So, where did she

606
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,400
put her heart?

607
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,920
Since you have no affection for Saint,

608
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,000
why act so sentimental here?

609
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,590
She risked her life to complete the array

610
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,310
and never wanted anything in return.

611
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,510
If you care about her,

612
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,610
how can you not know her affection for you?

613
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,680
She's such a proud and respected person.

614
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,930
If it weren't for her feelings for you,

615
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,540
why would she stay by your side the whole time?

616
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,040
The world sees you as a benevolent person

617
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
who takes the world on his shoulders.

618
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,510
Who knows that she…

619
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,920
For you,

620
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,240
she wasted her time

621
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,480
and delayed her cultivation.

622
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,030
Why do you think she did that?

623
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,400
Why?

624
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,960
I've never thought about that.

625
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,310
Maybe I just didn't have the courage.

626
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,350
How could I not love Feng Xiang?

627
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,030
But Feng Xiang said

628
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,880
that I was different from the others.

629
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,750
I didn't admire her or fastened onto her.

630
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,440
That's why she was willing to hang out with me.

631
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,440
If I told her

632
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,830
about my feelings,

633
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,590
I would have been no different

634
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,350
from the others.

635
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,310
I was afraid that I'd lose her.

636
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,510
Saint Feng Xiang

637
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,920
is divine-like.

638
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,590
How can I offend her?

639
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,590
Since you don't have a partner,

640
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,440
what do you think of my sister?

641
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,200
Thank you

642
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,200
for your kindness.

643
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,640
I already

644
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,960
have someone on my mind.

645
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,480
She heard my lie,

646
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,160
and I never had the chance

647
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,550
to tell her my feelings.

648
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,510
I have no chance to do that.

649
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,240
This is how the world works.

650
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,070
You don't always get

651
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,790
a second chance.

652
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,000
Qian Guang.

653
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,650
You've been guarding Feng Xiang for 6,000 years

654
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,310
and never left her side

655
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,510
I believe

656
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,160
that you value human connections.

657
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,000
If you know where the lotus seeds that were produced are,

658
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,070
please tell me

659
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,480
so that I can detoxify the Disillusion Water

660
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,420
and save someone's life.

661
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,590
People drink the Disillusion Water

662
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,880
to forget about sentiments.

663
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,510
Since she had a realization,

664
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,310
why force it?

665
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,350
If she did have a realization,

666
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,890
she doesn't need assistance to control her mind

667
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:13,840
and force herself to forget.

668
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,600
She was forced to become detached

669
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,750
and it's conflicting with her faith,

670
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,000
hurting her both inside and outside.

671
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,510
That's why she's in danger.

672
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,550
Xie Xuechen.

673
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,270
Who are you talking about?

674
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,000
What is

675
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,590
the Disillusion Water?

676
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,160
She and I were enemies.

677
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,760
We met by accident and got to know each other.

678
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,270
She risked everything to help me,

679
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,680
and I haven't gotten a chance

680
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,760
- to repay her. - The things

681
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,960
- that Xie Xuechen is talking about… - She was set up by a treacherous man

682
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,590
- are so familiar somehow. - and was forced to take the Disillusion Water.

683
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,400
- Now her life is in danger. - Is it because…

684
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,680
I'm worried that she can't wait

685
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,600
for the lotus to bloom.

686
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,480
When the lotus seeds fall, she'd be…

687
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,510
Xuanling!

688
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:55,960
Xuanling!

689
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,270
You want the seeds of the Lotus of Life

690
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,720
for me.

691
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,000
Qian Guang.

692
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,510
If it was her choice,

693
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,200
I could let go

694
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,680
as long as she could be free.

695
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,560
But you can see how she is.

696
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,070
The more she's suffering,

697
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,860
the more she's not willing to forget.

698
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,310
If we don't cure her,

699
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,440
the Disillusion Water will be lethal to her.

700
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,810
If you can tell me

701
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,550
where the seeds are,

702
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,000
I would be in debt to you.

703
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,160
I will pay you back,

704
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,550
wherever, whenever,

705
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,790
and however.

706
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,790
No need to feel that you owe me.

707
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,200
Feng Xiang got all the Lotuses of Life

708
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,590
that bloomed over the years.

709
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,200
She just doesn't remember.

710
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,030
I buried all the lotus seeds

711
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,590
that Feng Xiang left behind here.

712
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,880
Thank you, Qian Guang.

713
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,750
The seeds of the Lotus of Life

714
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,880
are also known as Worldly Bitterness.

715
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,680
The Disillusion Grass is a poison,

716
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,070
and the lotus seed is the medicine.

717
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,830
People think that becoming detached

718
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,030
and having their feelings cleared

719
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,590
is the realization.

720
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,030
But the true realization

721
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,750
is still being benevolent

722
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,590
and loving the world

723
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,460
after tasting all the bitterness of the world

724
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,400
and feeling all the sorrows.

725
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,930
That

726
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,400
is

727
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,510
disillusion.

728
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,720
Being benevolent

729
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,510
after tasting all the bitterness of the world.

730
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,750
That's the true disillusion.

731
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,030
You can have

732
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,240
the lotus seed.

733
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,750
Leave this place

734
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,400
and never come back.

735
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,310
Thank you.

736
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,160
Each lotus seed

737
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,590
represents a hundred years.

738
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,750
Qian Guang.

739
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,070
Is there anything we can do for you?

740
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,880
This is the power of divinities.

741
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,550
No one can change it.

742
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,640
I'm grateful

743
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,480
for your kindness.

744
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,480
Have you tried to communicate with the High Fate Divinity?

745
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,790
Maybe he can

746
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,400
lift the curse.

747
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,000
Curse?

748
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,880
Right.

749
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,790
This wish is no different from a curse.

750
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,920
I thought about finding the High Fate Divinity.

751
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,110
But there's only

752
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,030
the High Cyclic Divinity in the vast divine realm.

753
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,480
There were no other divinities.

754
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,550
The High Cyclic Divinity

755
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,830
is strange.

756
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,720
He's not as kind as he claims.

757
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,550
Maybe

758
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,400

884
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,280

Are you worried that I might get away?

909
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,630
Does holding one's hand

910

mean keeping someone from getting away?

911

What are you doing here?

925
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,230
It seems that you've found the lotus seed.

926
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,280
It took some effort,

927
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,510

930
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,380

for our news?

932
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,280
What brought you here?

933
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,050
I sensed the alert

934
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,700
from the jade I gave Miss Mu.

935
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,410
It seems that some sort of attack

936
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,400
triggered the array on it.

937
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,320
I was worried that something might have happened,

938
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,630
so I rushed here.

939
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,000
Alert from the jade?

940
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,120
But I didn't sense

941
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,230
that alert.

942
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,380
Maybe I have triggered

943
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,400
the array by accident.

944
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,360
It might be me.

945

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,590
