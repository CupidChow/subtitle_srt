[Episode 7]

18
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,190
Alright.

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,080
The array is complete.

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,910
It will take just ten breaths to reach the Snow City.

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,800
Let's enter the array.

22
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't forget what you promised me.

23
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,630
I promise.

24
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,470
Once we reach the Snow City,

25
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,430
I won't cause any trouble for you.

26
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,900
If I detect the scent of the Dark Clan,

27
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,080
I'll tell you immediately.

28
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,800
What's going on?

29
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,400
Someone reversed the array,

30
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,840
changing the teleportation into a killing trap.

31
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,030
Feng Yao, assist!

32
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,120
Sir,

33
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,360
the array is about to collapse.

34
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,700
- Are you okay? - Sir!

35
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,630
I'm fine.

36
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,280
No problem.

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,120
Fortunately, you've regained

38
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,440
60% of your spiritual power today.

39
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,680
Otherwise, we would have died

40
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,590
in the array.

41
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,910
There was no intrusion into the Greenview Heights.

42
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,470
How was this manipulated?

43
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,270
It must be the materials

44
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,040
for the array.

45
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,310
The teleportation array materials are already scarce.

46
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,190
Some of them were got from outside.

47
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,890
Someone must have

48
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,920
planted a killing spell

49
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,680
in the materials in advance.

50
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,870
It's...

51
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,120
it's all my fault.

52
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,750
I didn't detect

53
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,750
the killing spell's aura in time.

54
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,240
It's not your fault.

55
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,510
The killing spell was hidden from the start.

56
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,560
It's hard to detect.

57
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,190
Plus, the array requires refining the materials,

58
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,430
making it even more hidden

59
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,430
and harder to detect.

60
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,480
You're still so young.

61
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,630
If you could detect a killing spell,

62
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,750
you wouldn't need to absorb treasure energy for training.

63
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,440
We're all here.

64
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,680
You don't need to blame yourself.

65
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,920
This whole thing

66
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,070
was part of Sang Qi and the Decaying Immortal Pavilion's plan.

67
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,000
Perhaps from the Mirage Palace onward,

68
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,800
it was a two-birds-with-one-stone trap.

69
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,360
You mean,

70
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,240
when something happened at the Mirage Palace,

71
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,510
one goal was to steal the jade token,

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,270
the other was to mislead us

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,190
to give them a chance

74
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,070
to mess with the teleportation array?

75
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,390
You're the most skilled in arrays.

76
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,870
If you'd been here,

77
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,800
you'd have easily noticed the problem with the materials.

78
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,800
So, they created a huge distraction,

79
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,310
luring you away as well.

80
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,390
True.

81
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
Mr. Nan's research

82
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
on the teleportation array was no secret.

83
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,190
After you came out of the Dark Abyss,

84
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,800
you didn't go straight to the Snow City,

85
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,040
but chose to come here at Greenview Heights.

86
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,290
They must have guessed

87
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,580
that your spiritual power wasn't fully restored,

88
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,120
and wanted to use the teleportation array to go back to the Snow City.

89
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,630
It's all so cleverly connected,

90
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
a deadly trap.

91
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,430
Right now,

92
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,270
I'm more concerned about the situation in the Snow City.

93
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,720
I don't know how they will strike.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,360
The paper crane was sent a few days ago.

95
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,510
Leader Xie must have received the message by now.

96
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,310
You don't need to worry too much.

97
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,190
Since the materials are destroyed now,

98
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,870
how long will it take

99
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:16,800
to gather them again?

100
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,040
Well...

101
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,180
it might take another ten days.

102
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,600
Is there any other way

103
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,120
to quickly return to the Snow City?

104
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
Actually,

105
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,390
there is something might help.

106
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,360
The Cloud Floating Airship?

107
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,310
That's right.

108
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,480
It belonged to Fu Lansheng, the former young master of the Jade Sky Palace.

109
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,070
He lost it to me in a bet long ago.

110
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,310
I haven't used it in many years.

111
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,680
The teleportation array

112
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,040
takes just ten breaths to reach,

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,190
but this one will take a bit longer.

114
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,830
That's why I didn't consider it at first.

115
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,430
But given the current situation,

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,750
it's better

117
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,920
than flying on a sword or riding a horse.

118
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,270
It's just a small boat.

119
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,720
How are we supposed to fit people on it?

120
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,160
A boat needs water to sail.

121
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,000
We can head out now.

122
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,390
How do we?

123
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,360
The Jade Sky Palace is truly wealthy.

124
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,310
What about the Snow City's finances?

125
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,800
You pulled me out of the Dark Abyss,

126
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,430
and I didn't bring any money with me.

127
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,830
As a disciple of the Snow City,

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,950
is there an allowance?

129
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,560
Let me give you some advice.

130
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,190
When you get to the Snow City,

131
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,000
it's better to listen more and talk less.

132
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,390
If you get into trouble and anger someone,

133
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,160
I won't help you.

134
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,750
You're saying this now,

135
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,750
but during the crisis earlier,

136
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,000
who was it

137
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,920
splitting his shield to protect me

138
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,120
with only 60% of his spiritual power recovered?

139
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,600
Xie Xuechen,

140
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,160
just admit it.

141
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,190
You can't bear to see me die.

142
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,240
Not wanting you to die

143
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,680
and not letting you die

144
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,480
are two completely different things.

145
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,630
You're just stubborn.

146
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,720
Xuyue,

147
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,910
this crisis

148
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,910
is much more serious than I expected.

149
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,630
You are not from the Immortal Alliance,

150
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,150
so you don't need to take further risks.

151
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,120
Don't go to the Snow City.

152
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,150
It's too late

153
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,550
to say that now.

154
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,840
Sang Qi and the Decaying Immortal Pavilion

155
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,000
joined forces against my Greenview Heights

156
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,750
and ruined my precious materials.

157
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,840
I'll definitely

158
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,200
get back at them for this.

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,840
Otherwise, how can

160
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,080
Greenview Heights survive?

161
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,790
Xuyue!

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,910
I have a plan.

163
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,240
Since we've come this far together,

164
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,200
let's continue this journey together.

165
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,080
Miss Mu,

166
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,670
do you mind?

167
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,790
The more friends, the more support.

168
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,390
With you joining us,

169
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,600
I couldn't be more delighted.

170
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,030
That's good.

171
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:34,960
Feng Yao,

172
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,750
guard here well.

173
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
If anything happens, contact with the paper crane.

174
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,320
Understood.

175
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,390
It's getting late.

176
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,510
Let's head out.

177
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,630
Bao,

178
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,750
stop being so upset.

179
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,390
Come out.

180
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,670
If father finds out

181
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,910
I'm such

182
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,390
a useless sniffer,

183
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,210
will he abandon me?

184
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,270
Fine,

185
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,000
you've never even met your father.

186
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,790
How could you have such deep feelings?

187
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,320
A father is a father,

188
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,000
even if I've never met him.

189
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,200
If you've never met your parents,

190
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,270
do they count as parents?

191
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,870
Of course, they do!

192
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,000
Mother said Father...

193
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Ah...

194
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,910
are we... in the sky?

195
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,290
We're on our way to Mr. Xie's home.

196
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,270
Don't be scared.

197
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,080
Take a look around.

198
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,440
Isn't the moonlight beautiful?

199
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,790
I...

200
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,440
I'll wait until we land,

201
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,360
then I'll come out.

202
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,270
With your little courage,

203
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,480
you still want to follow me?

204
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,030
Yes,

205
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,910
I want to learn some skills.

206
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,790
Miss Mu.

207
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,910
Mr. Nan, you're here to enjoy the view too?

208
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,550
I must congratulate you, Miss Mu.

209
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,960
You've gotten what you wished for.

210
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,550
Thank you.

211
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,150
I've never been to the Snow City.

212
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,750
It should be quite interesting.

213
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,750
I would say,

214
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,600
because of your arrival,

215
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,960
the Snow City will become very interesting.

216
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,320
So,

217
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,380
you also find Xie Xuechen boring,

218
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:37,910
right?

219
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,030
You actually know.

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,150
It's not that he wants to be boring.

221
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,080
Those born with the extra sense

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,240
carry a lot on their shoulders.

223
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,720
They are expected to achieve much.

224
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,670
They are bound by many things.

225
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,660
Sometimes,

226
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,840
they can't even tell

227
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,640
whether what the world admires

228
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,870
is truly the person themselves

229
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,840
or merely the power they hold

230
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,480
to protect the world.

231
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,150
Mr. Nan, are you talking about Xie Xuechen,

232
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,910
or are you talking about yourself?

233
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,120
After all, you used to be someone

234
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,150
born with the extra sense.

235
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,870
Miss Mu, you're truly insightful.

236
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,630
But as you just said,

237
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,360
that was in the past.

238
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,240
Now, I've lost my three senses.

239
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,790
At most, I'm just...

240
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,320
an ordinary person who can draw symbols.

241
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,910
As the head of the Greenview Heights,

242
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,120
the top array master of our time,

243
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,960
and exceptionally intelligent,

244
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,600
if you consider yourself just an ordinary person,

245
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,960
then what are those truly ordinary people

246
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,030
supposed to think of themselves?

247
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,550
Alright.

248
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,480
I misspoke.

249
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,320
I'm just a straightforward person.

250
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,150
Please forgive me.

251
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,550
I just think

252
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,700
someone who can carve a new path

253
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,890
out of a deadlock,

254
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,750
and rise again to the peak

255
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,680
doesn't need

256
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,030
such cheap comfort or sympathy.

257
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:20,870
I don't want

258
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,260
nor do I have the right

259
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,630
to show any self-righteous kindness.

260
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,000
That kind of pity

261
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,840
is a sign of looking down on you.

262
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,270
I think you wouldn't agree

263
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,320
and would definitely not be happy.

264
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,960
Though you're from the Spirit Clan,

265
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,120
you see through people very clearly.

266
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,510
Likewise.

267
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
You're here to enjoy the view too?

268
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,600
Xuechen!

269
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,320
I'm here just getting some fresh air.

270
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,320
You're so unromantic.

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,790
In this regard,

272
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,000
you should learn from Mr. Nan more.

273
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,270
Once we reach the Snow City,

274
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,000
if you speak like this again,

275
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,920
I'm afraid you'll be expelled

276
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,870
in a few days.

277
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,240
We haven't even arrived yet.

278
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,730
Besides,

279
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,660
I only say

280
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,030
this kind of thing to you.

281
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,360
Fine.

282
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,150
Forget what I said.

283
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,510
What did you promise me?

284
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,150
Control myself.

285
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,960
I got it.

286
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,270
My mood is so bad,

287
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,750
even the moonlight isn't as beautiful now.

288
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,000
You guys talk.

289
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,550
Miss Mu really says

290
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,330
whatever she thinks

291
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,080
to you.

292
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,390
That's not always a good thing.

293
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,030
Isn't that fine?

294
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,610
Didn't you want to see through her

295
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,270
from the start?

296
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,030
I have one more thing to ask you.

297
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,360
What is it?

298
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,600
Why did you agree to take Miss Mu

299
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,670
back to the Snow City?

300
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,270
The war between humans and spirits lasted for so long.

301
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,150
Since I was young,

302
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
I've witnessed countless lives suffer.

303
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,270
Now, the war has ended,

304
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,670
but the scars

305
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,790
have never healed.

306
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,440
To this day,

307
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,480
the humans still enslave the spirits,

308
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,240
and the conflict between them has only deepened.

309
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,750
Hatred is like burning hot oil,

310
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,270
requiring countless bloodshed

311
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,600
to extinguish.

312
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,870
It's time to actively embrace the Spirit Clan.

313
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,550
It starts with allowing them into the sect.

314
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,200
And Miss Mu

315
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,600
is the first.

316
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,840
That's all?

317
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,030
Otherwise?

318
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,030
Then let it be,

319
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,550
human-spirit coexistence,

320
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,550
and a world of harmony.

321
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,440
I wish you will get

322
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,390
what you wish for.

323
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,180
[Two days later]

324
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,480
So, this is the Snow City.

325
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,960
It doesn't look like much

326
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,000
of an interesting place.

327
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,070
Interesting?

328
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,510
Once we reach the Snow City,

329
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,480
you will be an external disciple.

330
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,640
Everything must be done according to the rules.

331
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,110
The Snow City has strict rules.

332
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,640
No disciple will be tolerated for breaking the rules,

333
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,440
not even me.

334
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,030
Of course,

335
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,000
I've always followed the rules

336
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,530
and been the most obedient.

337
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,270
You know that.

338
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,900
The Snow City is very different

339
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,920
from the Mirage Palace.

340
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,070
Miss Mu,

341
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,750
you will soon realize this.

342
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,000
What's the difference?

343
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,240
The five sects of the Immortal Alliance all handle matters differently.

344
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,270
The Mirage Palace is vibrant,

345
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,200
but harsh and ruthless towards the Spirit Clan.

346
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
As for the Snow City,

347
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,830
as you can see,

348
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,550
snow-covered,

349
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,200
towering above the cold, steep cliffs,

350
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,480
pure and spotless,

351
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,310
leaving no room for any impurity.

352
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,880
Indeed,

353
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,790
the Lord of the Snow City

354
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,880
is a decisive and ruthless leader,

355
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,000
a man of unwavering fairness.

356
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,440
But it's okay.

357
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,680
If he's harsh with me,

358
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,030
I believe Mr. Xie

359
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,200
will definitely protect me.

360
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,310
Right?

361
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,740
[Snow City]

362
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,310
Welcome, Young Lord!

363
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,270
Young Lord.

364
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,380
[Elder Cang]

365
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,640
Elders,

366
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,270
it's good to see you.

367
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,920
Mr. Nan,

368
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,240
It's been many years.

369
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,720
Your elegance surpasses the past.

370
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,350
Elder Cang, you're joking.

371
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,920
Young Lord,

372
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,550
who is she?

373
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,200
This is Mu Xuanling.

374
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,750
Starting today,

375
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,480
she will be a disciple of the Snow City.

376
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,480
Naturally, she will begin

377
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,350
as an external disciple.

378
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,270
New disciples are managed by you, Elder Cang.

379
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,680
Elder Cang?

380
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,240
Should't I learn from you?

381
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,680
Young Lord,

382
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,440
this is very sudden.

383
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,420
She...

384
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,370
We will discuss her matter later.

385
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,640
I must see the Alliance Leader immediately.

386
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,440
[Elder Yu]

387
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,510
The Alliance Leader will leave seclusion tonight.

388
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,590
Please take a rest for now.

389
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,960
The Alliance Leader is still in seclusion?

390
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,680
Yes.

391
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,110
Since you left,

392
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
the Alliance Leader hasn't left seclusion.

393
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,240
You've exceeded your return deadline.

394
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
We've been very worried.

395
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,490
We wanted to report to the Alliance Leader

396
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,480
and headed to the Two Realms Mountain to find you,

397
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,030
but alas, he was in meditation.

398
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,480
We feared disturbing him

399
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,830
at a crucial moment,

400
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,200
worried he might fall into madness.

401
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,920
So, we had no choice but to wait.

402
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,790
I sent him a message via paper crane.

403
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,480
Was there no response

404
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,790
or arrangements?

405
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,590
A message?

406
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,590
No.

407
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,340
Did the message mention anything?

408
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,620
[Yongqian Pavilion]

409
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,480
Sir,

410
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,200
I, Xie Xuechen, request an audience.

411
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,720
Blood!

412
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,160
I detected the smell of blood!

413
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,310
Sir!

414
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,920
The Alliance Leader...

415
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,510
passed away.

416
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,590
The Alliance Leader...

417
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,880
passed away.

418
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,960
Sir...

419
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,310
This is impossible.

420
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,480
How could this happen?

421
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,000
This is Snow City,

422
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,350
our own place.

423
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,200
How could this happen?

424
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,640
With the Leader's Spiritual Form stage

425
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,590
and disciples patrolling outside the Yongqian Pavilion,

426
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,380
how could he have been assassinated

427
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,200
without anyone noticing?

428
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,840
Who could have done this?

429
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,590
It's our failure to protect the Alliance Leader.

430
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,640
It's all my fault.

431
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,220
Why didn't I

432
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,510
go in to check on him earlier?

433
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,960
Investigate!

434
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,480
We must find out who the murderer is!

435
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,400
Sir,

436
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,480
Sang Qi collaborated with a traitor from the Immortal Alliance,

437
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,350
attempting to seize the Chaos Pearl.

438
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,790
Be careful.

439
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,550
I will return soon.

440
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,790
Elders,

441
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,200
the death of the Alliance Leader

442
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,960
brings great sorrow to the Snow City.

443
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,070
However,

444
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,270
you are the pillars of our sect.

445
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,030
You must not collapse.

446
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,550
This is not the time for self-blame,

447
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,750
nor for despair.

448
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,480
Please, Elders,

449
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,590
lock down the Snow City

450
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,030
and send word of the loss.

451
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,920
For the rest of the matters,

452
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,510
I will make arrangements.

453
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,920
Understood.

454
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,920
This paper crane hasn't been opened,

455
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,160
but it's stained with blood.

456
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,240
It seems the Leader

457
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,160
was murdered shortly before the paper crane

458
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,000
arrived.

459
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,790
The killer came for the Sect Leader's jade token.

460
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:58,960
It...

461
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,440
it is a fake.

462
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:48,960
Sword cultivators

463
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,310
must never

464
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,550
abandon their sword.

465
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,000
You did it.

466
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,550
Yan Tong.

467
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,880
Here.

468
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,830
Guard the Alliance Leader's body.

469
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,480
Understood.

470
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,110
Where are you going?

471
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,920
He's going to check on the Chaos Pearl.

472
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,110
It seems the matter with the Mirage Palace

473
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,790
wasn't a two-birds-with-one-stone situation,

474
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,030
but a three-birds-with-one-stone.

475
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,550
The enemy's target

476
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,350
[Pearl Tower]

477
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,240
is not just the Mirage Palace,

478
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,640
not just killing Xie Xuechen,

479
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,550
but also the Snow City.

480
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,750
They set up a killing spell

481
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,640
in the teleportation array,

482
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,590
aiming to destroy the array,

483
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,680
delaying Xuechen's return to the city,

484
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,270
so they could

485
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,960
kill the Alliance Leader

486
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,680
and seize the jade token.

487
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,310
Their ultimate goal

488
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,440
is the Chaos Pearl.

489
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,920
He saved the Mirage City,

490
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,200
but failed to save his own father.

491
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,880
How guilty must he feel?

492
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,830
This is an unsolvable trap.

493
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,310
Since returning to the Snow City,

494
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,510
he hasn't had a moment of rest.

495
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,000
He keeps distracting himself with various matters.

496
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,310
If this continues,

497
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,590
he will collapse.

498
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,640
He knows the Alliance Leader's expectations:

499
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,000
the Chaos Pearl,

500
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,270
the Snow City,

501
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,110
humanity,

502
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,070
and all beings.

503
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,660
All of them come

504
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,160
before the sorrow of losing his father.

505
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,640
He can only act like this.

506
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,070
But has he ever thought of himself?

507
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,830
Mr. Nan,

508
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,960
you've known him for many years.

509
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,310
Has he always been like this?

510
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,310
Well,

511
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,510
that was a long time ago.

512
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,240
Because we were both born with the extra sense,

513
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,240
I was always compared to him.

514
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,310
But for a long time,

515
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,240
we never met.

516
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,790
Until one time,

517
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,480
a crack appeared in the Immortals Array,

518
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,790
and many from the Dark Clan were running wild,

519
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,880
causing chaos in the human realm.

520
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,000
Xie Xuechen and I

521
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,000
were both sent to the Two Realms Mountain

522
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,070
to block the Dark Clan.

523
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,830
That was our first meeting.

524
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,440
Back then,

525
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,200
he was very different from now.

526
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,590

Foolish!

537
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,400
The Dark Clan members will revive time and time again.

538
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,640
What you're doing now is meaningless!

539
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Then we will kill faster than they revive.

540
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,720

547
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:48,830
I've predicted it before.

548
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,440
So, you're the one

549
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,350
who can predict the future.

550
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,830
Why don't we have a little competition?

551
00:30:59,270 --> 00:30:59,880
I'm ahead by one point.

552
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,510
I scored one more point than you.

553
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,070
How about it?

554
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,110
Can you handle it?

555
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,400
No problem.

556
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,830
I knew I wouldn't die here.

557
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,720
I've often heard of you.

558
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,110
Are you interested in visiting the Snow City?

559
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,680
So,

560
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,660
Xie Xuechen also has moments

561
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,830
where he's quite competitive?

562
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,550
His father has always been strict with him,

563
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,830
but back then, he was full of youthful pride,

564
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,240
always rebellious.

565
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,920
He always thought

566
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,310
he should live his life

567
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,440
his own way.

568
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,110
I, too, thought

569
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,310
he could live life so freely.

570
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,000
But then, ten years ago,

571
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,400
he suddenly went to the Moonlight Heights

572
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,880
and suddenly entered seclusion at the Snow Cliff.

573
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,240
When we met again,

574
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,060
his character

575
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,160
had changed drastically.

576
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,070
Or rather,

577
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,400
he became a completely different person.

578
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,070
He became cold,

579
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,070
restrained,

580
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,550
and distant.

581
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,830
I don't know what exactly happened to him,

582
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,720
but he became the person

583
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,270
his father always hoped he would be.

584
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,620
[Half a month ago]

585
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,500
It's been ten years.

586
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,790
You've improved a lot.

587
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,000
You've become stronger than me.

588
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,030
Sir.

589
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,440
The Immortals Array is incomplete now.

590
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,280
You should go and fix it.

591
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,800
Understood.

592
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,070
When you return...

593
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,230
Well, let's talk when you return.

594
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,070
Cultivators must not have emotions.

595
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,320
They must dedicate themselves to their faith!

596
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,800
Did you forget?

597
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,070
Is your faith rooted in saving lives

598
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,070
and caring for all beings?

599
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,840
If so,

600
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,000
then you must sever all emotions.

601
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,230
If you have private favorites,

602
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,000
how can you embrace all beings

603
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,110
with great love?

604
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,400
You shouldn't favor any person

605
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,710
or anything,

606
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,070
not even yourself.

607
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,550
When you return...

608
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,920
Well, let's talk when you return.

609
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,000
In the dead of night,

610
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,510
you're practicing swordplay here at the Snow Cliff.

611
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,590
Aren't you afraid of causing a snow collapse

612
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,410
and burying the whole Snow City?

613
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,110
What are you doing here?

614
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,070
Leave here.

615
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,670
You're upset,

616
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,150
and now my bracelet is flashing with it.

617
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,400
How can I sleep?

618
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,760
I told you to leave here!

619
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,070
Xie Xuechen,

620
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,320
there's no shame

621
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,000
in showing weakness to others.

622
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,320
If you want to see,

623
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,120
I can cry for you right now.

624
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,880
Leave here.

625
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,400
I don't need your comfort.

626
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:11,880
Xie Xuechen,

627
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,190
why do you suppress yourself so much?

628
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,480
Is it because your father said

629
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,630
cultivators can't have emotions?

630
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,190
Back when we were trapped in Desire Demon's cage,

631
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,880
I saw you as a child.

632
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,070
Your father believed

633
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,190
that being heartless

634
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,760
was the only way to avoid having favorites

635
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,800
and to achieve great love.

636
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,070
I can't say he was wrong,

637
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,760
but I believe

638
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,280
the path of faith may be heartless,

639
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,280
but cultivators should value emotions.

640
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,190
If a person

641
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,320
doesn't even understand small love,

642
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,800
if their heart is left with only desolation and indifference,

643
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,070
how can they understand the true meaning

644
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,280
of all things in the world,

645
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,840
and how can they truly love all beings?

646
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,040
Just because you were born with the extra sense,

647
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,630
rare since ancient times,

648
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,230
your father

649
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,510
saw this as your destiny.

650
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,510
But, Xie Xuechen,

651
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,630
actually, no one can define your future.

652
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,330
Humans are born with emotions

653
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
and desires.

654
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,110
They must exist for a reason.

655
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,590
I am from the Spirit Clan,

656
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,190
and even I have emotions.

657
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,920
You are human,

658
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,480
how couldn't you have them?

659
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,440
If you have emotions,

660
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,290
you must release them,

661
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,440
express them.

662
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,780
Suppressing them deep inside

663
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,800
will cause problems.

664
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,000
Xie Xuechen,

665
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,000
you are just like everyone else,

666
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,670
flesh and blood.

667
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,480
You've already done enough.

668
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,150
Enough?

669
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,480
I used to refuse to listen to his words.

670
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,920
I was very rebellious.

671
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,190
And in the end, I made a huge mistake

672
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,150
that I can never undo.

673
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,360
Now,

674
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,280
I thought I had let go

675
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,620
of emotions and love,

676
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,360
but it turns out

677
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,880
his expectations were something I could never fulfill.

678
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,880
On the day I said goodbye to him here,

679
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,510
I really wanted to call him father,

680
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,070
but in the end, I didn't have the courage.

681
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,590
I am this hesitant,

682
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,920
this timid.

683
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,670
I will never hear

684
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,800
the words he wanted to say.

685
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,550
If the Alliance Leader were still here,

686
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,510
he would want to say this to you:

687
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,800
Xuechen,

688
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,480
all these years,

689
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,280
I have been very strict with you.

690
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,030
But actually, I always knew

691
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,760
how difficult it was for you.

692
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,190
From the day you were born,

693
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,880
I bound you with the responsibility

694
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,190
of the world's fate.

695
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,480
To force you to sever all emotions,

696
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,230
I even destroyed what you loved,

697
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,510
clipped your wings,

698
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,920
and imprisoned you in this small cage.

699
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,760
And all of this

700
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,510
was just to prepare you

701
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,840
for the challenges

702
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,800
you might face one day.

703
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,960
I often wondered

704
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,670
if I

705
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,630
worried too much,

706
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,760
if severing emotions was truly the only way.

707
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,800
Without my pressure,

708
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,670
you could have lived

709
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,550
freely and brilliantly,

710
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,670
soaring under an open sky.

711
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,670
Father...

712
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,400
Severing emotions and love

713
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,550
is easy to say,

714
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,710
but how many in this world can truly achieve it?

715
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,880
If even I cannot achieve it myself,

716
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,800
should I

717
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,510
have forced it upon you?

718
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,760
Xuechen,

719
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,550
I'm getting old.

720
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,440
There will be an end someday.

721
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,070
One day, I will leave.

722
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,590
Maybe my way

723
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,110
has grown outdated as well.

724
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,960
The future belongs

725
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,710
to your generation.

726
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,070
Go walk your own path.

727
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,760
I believe in you.

728
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,250
You will shoulder the responsibility

729
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,760
in your own way

730
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,400
and protect everything you need to protect.

731
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,110
Xuechen,

732
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,840
actually,

733
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,920
I'm also very timid.

734
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,670
There's something

735
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,920
I've always wanted to tell you.

736
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,280
I...

737
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
love you...

738
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,710
I love you deeply.
