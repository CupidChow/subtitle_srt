00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,360
you'll grasp it completely.

190
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,720
My name is Feng Yao.

191
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,440
F-E-N-G,

192
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,120
Y-A-O.

193
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,960
If you were to lose everything,

194
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,000
I would still stay by your side,

195
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,000
never abandoning you!

196
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,510
"If disaster strikes,

197
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,440
[Marriage Agreement]
I'll bear it myself."

198
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,750
So, it was all true.

199
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,150
You treated me with genuine love,

200
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,240
willing to kill deities and defy the heavens for my sake.

201
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,510
And yet,

202
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,840
I was trapped in those false memories,

203
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,080
blaming you for ten thousand years.

204
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,240
Pearl...

205
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,670
will you blame me?

206
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,510
How could I ever blame you?

207
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,510
Pearl!

208
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,670
You were the most sincere person in the world,

209
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,840
yet Fate forcibly rewrote your destiny.

210
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,600
You carried the hatred of world

211
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,150
and the memories of betrayal by your lover,

212
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,510
struggling bitterly

213
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,870
for ten thousand years.

214
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,550
During these ten thousand years,

215
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,480
you've endured the greatest suffering.

216
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,590
Pearl,

217
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,790
these ten thousand years felt so long,

218
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,030
long enough to blur truth and lies for me.

219
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
All I know is,

220
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,680
I once really protected the people,

221
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,070
and now, I also really hate the world.

222
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,720
But at this moment,

223
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,640
I suddenly feel lost.

224
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,830
If Hao Tian descends

225
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,750
and all beings are destroyed,

226
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,880
what kind of feeling

227
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,070
will that be for me?

228
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,270
I know that feeling.

229
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,750
Once,

230
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
I was merely a pearl,

231
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,310
believing that all things in this world

232
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,350
were irrelevant to me.

233
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,110
But then I met you.

234
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,160
As I grew closer to you,

235
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,030
I understood the meaning of this world to me.

236
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,110
For one person,

237
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,200
I was willing to protect all beings.

238
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,640
That was the strength you gave me.

239
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,270
And now,

240
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,920
I'll return this strength

241
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,110
to you.

242
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,480
In dreams,

243
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,270
in illusions,

244
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,550
I've seen you countless times.

245
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,440
This time

246
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,270
is nothing more than my delusion again.

247
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,790
My Pearl

248
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,030
will never come back.

249
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,640
No matter when,

250
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,720
I will always be by your side,

251
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,550
in your heart.

252
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,550
But in your heart,

253
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,880
there is not just me,

254
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,440
there are all living beings as well.

255
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,440
Whether it's dark thoughts

256
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,350
clouding your eyes

257
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,070
or obsessions veiling your heart,

258
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,160
whenever you feel lost and confused,

259
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,000
remember to ask your heart.

260
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,310
It will guide you

261
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,400
to find the answers you seek.

262

The one who can guide you

is not me,

264
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,880
nor anyone else.

265
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,000

it turns out I wasn't clear-headed either

When did you discover Feng Yao's identity?

309
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,960
The bond between blood relatives

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,160
is the most profound.

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,550
I had sensed it long ago,

312
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,830
but she didn't want to reunite.

313
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,920
So I chose to respect her wishes and wait.

314
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,030
But I didn't expect

315
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,880
there would never be a chance to reunite.

As long as this world

317
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,200
has someone who remembers her,

even if she's gone,

319
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,830
it wouldn't be the end.

Yet, the moment Feng Yao died,

327
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,350
I suddenly realized

00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,000
that a light phrase, a faint word

329
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,920
in the Book of Fate

330
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,720
could encompass

331
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,030
a lifetime of intertwined joy and sorrow.

332
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,590
Her blood

333
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,160
allowed me to see the world's colors for the first time

334
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,270
and made me understand

335
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,830
that even in this mortal world,

336
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,400
there are people and things

337
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,110
worth remembering deeply,

338
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,960
even if they have nothing to do with love.

00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,440
This is the sign of Hao Tian's descent.

Fate,

342
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,240
do you think threatening me

343
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,240
with burning your soul can stop my descent?

344
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,400
The Demon Lord has already glimpsed

345
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,830
the truth of ten thousand years ago,

each of your so-called rebellions

357
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,160

calmly await the end of days.

00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,440
If the Dark Abyss shows such obvious signs,

379
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,480
then the human realm must be in even graver danger.

380
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,000
Anger Demon! Desire Demon!

381
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,830
Here!

382
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,480
Quickly head to the human realm

383
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,580
and invite Fate here.

384
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:25,960
Understood!

385
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,240
Look!

386
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,830
Run!

387
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,200
Run!

388
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,350
Run!

389
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,030
Hurry, run!

390
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,000
This toxic mist can dissolve the barriers!

391
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,640
Spiritual power is completely ineffective against it!

392
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,360
Sir,

393
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,020
let's retreat!

394
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,400
Fall back!

395
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,680
Go, hurry!

396
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,350
Run!

397
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,070
All disciples of Xuantian Sect,

398
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,270
prepare to protect!

399
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,350
Senior,

400
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,030
forcing yourself to resist with spiritual form power

401
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,680
will lead to backlash from the toxic mist!

402
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,720
Even if the world is doomed,

403
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,590
we cannot give up now.

404
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,440
As long as I stand,

405
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,440
I will defend!

406
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,680
Very well!

407
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,400
The Immortal Alliance is an alliance,

408
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680
and so we should advance and retreat together,

409
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,000
sharing life and death!

410
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,240
Advance and retreat together, share life and death!

411
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,590
Everyone, get on board quickly!

412
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,400
We'll take you

413
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,720
to the cliff for shelter!

414
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,000
Don't worry, everyone.

415
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,310
There are enough airships for all.

416
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,000
After this,

417
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,200
we'll head to other places to rescue more people.

418
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,270
Bring the civilians aboard the Cloud Floating Airship!

419
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,110
Understood!

420
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,480
I never thought

421
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,440
we'd meet again

422
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,480
without swords drawn between us.

423
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,720
As enemies for ten thousand years,

424
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,790
we were meant to fight to the death.

425
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,000
However,

426
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,240
on the eve of the apocalypse,

427
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,350
there's no longer a need for infighting.

428
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,640
At the Everbright Palace ten thousand years ago,

429
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,350
you and I once played a game of chess.

430
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,480
Back then, we reached an endless situation,

431
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,480
without conclusion,

432
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,640
without a victor.

433
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,270
Why not, today,

434
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,510
play another game?

435
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,070
In the game from ten thousand years ago,

436
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,350
you played white,

437
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,000
and I played black.

438
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,880
Today, the roles seem reversed.

439
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,030
This world is never simply black or white,

440
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,030
just like the Divine Clan of that time,

441
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,960
claiming to represent the righteous path,

442
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,350
looking down from their high seat,

443
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,070
yet lacking mercy and sowing slaughter.

444
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,070
They were never worthy of being called deities.

445
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,310
So they fell into what is now the Dark Clan.

446
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,920
One thought makes a deity, one makes a demon.

447
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,750
It has always been so.

448
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,160
Whether black or white, it doesn't matter.

449
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,720
What matters is

450
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,350
I will never be a pawn,

451
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,640
nor will I ever be controlled by Hao Tian.

452
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,880
All things in this world were created by Hao Tian.

453
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,400
If you don't want to be controlled,

454
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,790
what else can you do?

455
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,640
Even the Book of Fate following his will

456
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,660
has had thoughts of defying Hao Tian, right?

457
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,880
Otherwise, you wouldn't have agreed to come here.

458
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,960
Now that you're here,

459
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,160
you may as well speak plainly.

460
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,200
This apocalypse

461
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,640
should've happened ten thousand years ago.

462
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,350
No one knows where Hao Tian came from

463
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,640
or when he appeared.

464
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,880
He is like a set of rules,

465
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,000
yet also like...

466
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,680
an eternal creator of the vast cosmos.

467
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,830
In Hao Tian's eyes,

468
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,510
order is above all else.

469
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,920
Now, the two realms are in chaos,

470
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,220
the divine artifact falls in love,

471
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,550
the four seasons are out of order,

472
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,960
and disasters are widespread.

473
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,030
Relying solely on you to act on my laws

474
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,030
is not enough.

475
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,750
Only the strongest in the world

476
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,270
can be my vessel

477
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,590
and help me descend.

478
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,550
Your Grace,

479
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,310
you actually decide to personally correct the errors

480
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,110
and save the world?

481
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,680
Rather than fixing the mistakes,

482
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,510
it's better to start over.

483
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,070
Hao Tian is so powerful

484
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,720
that he refuses

485
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,640
to repair the chaotic paths of this world.

486
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,440
When the system runs out of control,

487
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,640
he will destroy the world and rebuild it anew.

488
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,240
However, Hao Tian lacks a physical form

489
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,590
and cannot directly enter this world.

490
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,920
Only by possessing the strongest

491
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,480
can he descend.

492
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:03,920
And you,

493
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,110
or rather, Zhao Ming,

494
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,790
are the chosen vessel of Hao Tian.

495
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,110
So, ten thousand years ago,

496
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,270
you sealed me in the Lava

497
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,880
not to comply with the deities' request

498
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,030
but intentionally.

499
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,310
The day Zhao Ming ascended to slay the deities

500
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,590
was the day

501
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,030
he truly became the strongest.

502
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,920
I then took the opportunity

503
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,750
to make Zhao Ming a fallen deity,

504
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,830
sealing him in the Lava.

505
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,350
This indeed wronged Zhao Ming over the ages,

506
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,960
but it was the only way to preserve the world.

507
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,660
Do you think suppressing Zhao Ming

508
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,550
can prevent my descent?

509
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,400
The rules are set,

510
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,110
and order endures.

511
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,790
The strongest vessel is immortal.

512
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,590
No matter how it's stopped

513
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,750
or altered,

514
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,720
the strongest will inevitably rise again.

515
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,200
Until ten thousand years later,

516
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,960
Hao Tian's plan to end the world

517
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,440
would restart.

518
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,480
It seems these ten thousand years of suffering

519
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,030
have taught you a lesson.

520
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,270
You've learned to obey my will.

521
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,590
As an artifact,

522
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,160
I was meant to follow Your Grace,

523
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,750
carrying out your will.

524
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,750
That is my purpose

525
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,550
and my destiny.

526
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,960
But this time,

527
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,830
I learned to fake compliance

528
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,680
to deceive and outwit.

529
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,880
Still, despite all my schemes,

530
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,590
I couldn't stop the emergence of the strongest.

531
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,790
Crafting the rules of this world

532
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,680
yet also bound by them,

533
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,720
how absurd.

534
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,830
This world has always been absurd.

535
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,880
I prided myself on creating the world within the fan,

536
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,350
but the world we live in

537
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,510
is just like a painting within the fan.

538
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,480
All of us

539
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,750
are being indifferently observed

540
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,310
by someone outside the fan.

541
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,790
Ten thousand years ago,

542
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,030
when the heavens were torn open,

543
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,590
I helped the Chaos Pearl mend them.

544
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,790
Then I was swept

545
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,480
into another vast dimension.

546
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,200
For the first time, I saw there is another heaven

547
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,510
beyond the heavens.

548
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,830
In that space beyond,

549
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,310
I glimpsed the secrets of the world.

550
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:49,830
This world

551
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,920
is like a painting,

552
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,000
with everything controlled

553
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,480
and predetermined.

554
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,200
I saw the threads of cause and effect,

555
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,070
the origin of this world,

556
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,200
and its eventual destruction.

557
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,550
Only then did I realize our painted world

558
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,590
is as insignificant as dust.

559
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,880
I tried to change it,

560
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,230
but it was in vain.

561
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,480
So, I returned to this world,

562
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,320
because those

563
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,190
within the painting

564
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,760
can only act within it.

565
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,150
This boundless universe,

566
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,920
with origins unknown,

567
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,800
and an end unknowable,

568
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,840
is filled with mysteries we cannot realize

569
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,510
or explain.

570
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,630
I often wonder,

571
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,440
if there is a heaven beyond the heavens,

572
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,320
might there be something even greater

573
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,110
beyond that?

574
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,360
But for now,

575
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,590
Hao Tian's descent

576
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,960
is an unstoppable force.

577
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,630
Unstoppable

578
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,110
does not mean undefeatable.

579
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,960
Since you've come to discuss cooperation,

580
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,960
it means you've already planned a solution.

581
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,230
And since you invited me here,

582
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,190
it shows you too have thought of a plan

583
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,190
to resolve this crisis.

584
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,630
Let's see

585
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,440
if our ideas align.

586
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,400
Use Hao Tian to slay Hao Tian!

587
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,630
Exactly.

588
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,280
Only the strongest

589
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
can fight the strongest.

590
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,800
Only Hao Tian himself

591
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
can destroy Hao Tian.

592
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,070
I heard everything

593
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,550
you just said.

594
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,670
How could you leave me, the Keeper of Time,

595
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,230
out of the plan to slay Hao Tian?

596
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,440
Besides,

597
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,070
we've traveled this far together.

598
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,800
This mission to slay Hao Tian

599
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,480
is extremely dangerous.

600
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,630
I won't let you go alone.

601
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,510
Since we were born from chaos,

602
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,840
you've faced so much you couldn't control,

603
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,920
yet you never thought to discuss it with me.

604
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,960
You always made decisions on your own.

605
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,150
Enough.

606
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,400
Let the past

607
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,920
remain in the past.

608
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,880
From now on,

609
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,400
you'll no longer be alone.

610
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,480
And we

611
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,630
share a common goal:

612
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,880
to destroy Hao Tian.

613
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,230
I never thought

614
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,150
another game of chess after ten thousand years

615
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,280
would still lead to an endless situation.

616
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,880
This game is not between you and me,

617
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,030
but a match against Hao Tian.

618
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,880
The rules of this world were set by Hao Tian.

619
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,960
These ten thousand years of cause and effect

620
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,710
have been nothing

621
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,030
but an endless cycle of struggle.

622
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,230
You can't defeat the creator of the rules

623
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,360
by following their rules.

624
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,070
Why not overturn the chessboard

625
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,000
from now on

626
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,670
and destroy all the rules?

627
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,760
This time,

628
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,400
I will make sure Hao Tian

629
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,960
disappears completely.

630
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,480
There are three key steps to slaying Hao Tian,

631
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,670
all interconnected and without room for error.

632
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,110
First,

633
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,510
Zhao Ming and I

634
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,880
must each accept Hao Tian's descent

635
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,880
in the times of ten thousand years ago

636
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,590
and ten thousand years later,

637
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,190
transforming Hao Tian into a physical entity.

638
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,070
Then,

639
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,670
we'll combine the power of Chaos and Fate

640
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,030
to distort and merge

641
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
the two times,

642
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,960
creating a blind zone

643
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,150
beyond Hao Tian's control.

644
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,400
This will place both versions

645
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,760
of Hao Tian into the same time and space.

646
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,510
Finally, Demon Lord and Zhao Ming will fight

647
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,280
within the rule-free zone,

648
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,360
destroying the two versions of Hao Tian.

649
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,800
This plan is dangerous,

650
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,550
filled with variables,

651
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,630
yet it is the only method with a chance of success.

652
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,590
To bring about the dual descent of Hao Tian

653
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,400
and force mutual killing,

654
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,630
we'll need the versions of ourselves from both times

655
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,000
to fight side by side

656
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,590
across ten thousand years.

657
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,670
Only the temporal power of the Samsara Mirror

658
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,710
can help us communicate

659
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,920
with our past selves,

660
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,030
explain everything,

661
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,480
and agree on how to resist Hao Tian.

662
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,400
I've already returned half of the Chaos Power

663
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,590
to you entirely.

664
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,590
You can meet the Samsara Mirror directly

665
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,920
through the time swirl

666
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,760
and reclaim the temporal power.

667
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,620
♪Forging a sword with blood to pierce the dark night♪

668
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,380

Your Grace.

♪Burning through this lifetime's blossoms♪

676
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,400
Greetings, Your Grace.

677
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,510
It's been ten thousand years,

678
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,070
and you're still the same as ever,

679
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,630
unchanged in appearance.

680
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,030
It's been ten thousand years,

681
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,230
and Your Grace look as you did before.

682
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,150
Yet,

683
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,840
something is profoundly different.

684
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,920
Now, my name

685
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,190
is Mu Xuanling.

686
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:25,880
It's a name

687
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,360
I'm not unfamiliar with.

688
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,440
That day, Xie Xuechen

689
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,840
endured the trial

690
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,150
of 38,000 celestial winds,

691
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,150
reaching here

692
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,070
to save Mu Xuanling.

693
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,000
When he left,

694
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,880
did he say anything?

695
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,510
He said many things,

696
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,920
but to me,

697
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,360
it was just two words:

698
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,480
No regrets.

699
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
For the past ten thousand years,

700
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,480
I forgot where I came from,

701
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,320
forgot the existence of Your Grace,

702
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,190
and forgot who I was waiting for.

703
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,280
It wasn't until Your Grace returned

704
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,710
that I finally understood everything.

705
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,880
Thanks so much

706
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,630
for all this waiting.

707
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,920
All things in this world

708
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,110
have their purpose.

709
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
I'm honored

710
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,230
to have carried Your Grace's will,

711
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,000
existing for ten thousand years, witnessing the passage of time.

712
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,280
Now, the Samsara Mirror

713
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,230
and the temporal power

714
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,960
shall be returned to Your Grace.

715
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,320
May Your Grace fulfill your wish,

716
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,550
and may the world enjoy eternal harmony.

717
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,230
I have reclaimed the temporal power.

718
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,800
I can now control the Samsara Mirror

719
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,960
to connect two times for dialogue.

720
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,510
However, there is one condition

721
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,510
to use this method.

722
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,190
We must ensure the causality

723
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,230
of ten thousand years remain unchanged.

724
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,000
Otherwise, if anything from back then

725
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:36,880
shifts,

726
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,030
the present world

727
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,070
will collapse.

728
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,760
The Chaos Power can stabilize time and space,

729
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,190
and the power of Fate can stabilize cause and effect.

730
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,840
When the time comes, I will join you

731
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,510
to protect this world

732
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,150
from being disrupted by disorder.

733
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,480
How long can the rule-free zone

734
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,110
be maintained?

735
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,920
Even if all our divine power is exhausted,

736
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,400
it will last only one incense stick's time.

737
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,670
In other words,

738
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,360
there will only be one chance

739
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,670
to kill Hao Tian within that time.

740
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,960
If the two versions of Hao Tian kill each other,

741
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,840
the survival chances

742
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,070
of the vessels they possess will be slim.

743
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,880
If I feared death,

744
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,800
I wouldn't be standing here now.

745
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,000
Between killing Hao Tian and being controlled by him,

746
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,590
I choose the former.

747
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,030
Let's begin.

00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:11,780
