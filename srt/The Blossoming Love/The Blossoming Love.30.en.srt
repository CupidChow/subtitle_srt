00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,870
Don't force me to hate you more.

193
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,550
In fact, you've hated me for a long time,

194
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,630
but you don't even remember

195
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,910
your hate.

196
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,790

don't you duck?

208
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,750
I knew you'd be like this today,

209
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,030
but I wanted to try

210
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,960
and finish the wedding with you.

211
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,840
I was supposed to have nothing

212
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
and be alone,

213
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,240
so those who are greedy

214
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,550
must pay the price.

215
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,360
I have lied to you

216
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,790
and hurt you,

217
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,000
so this jab

218
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,550

or kill me,

226
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,440
but I hope you and I

227
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,480
are never even.

228
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,910
What a show.

229
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,270

Zhao Ming.

Xie Xuechen.

232
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,270
Isn't this the Divine Emperor of Fate?

233
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,630
I didn't realize you'd fallen into the mortal world

234
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,240
and become distracted by mundane matters and mortal love.

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This is ridiculous.

236
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,270
It seems that Xie Xuechen's soul

237
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,960
has returned to your body.

238
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,000
What did you say?

239
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,390
Why so surprised?

240
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,840
I told you.

241
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,360
Xie Xuechen is just one of my souls.

242
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,320
You devoured him?

243
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,240
It was his honor

244
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,320
to be fused with me.

245
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,030
Now it's not him

246
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
you should worry about

247
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,000
but yourself.

248
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,550
You're like this now,

249
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,630
so who can you protect?

250
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,910
I've fallen into the mortal world,

251
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,670
but I'm still Fate.

252
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,440
So ridiculous.

253
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,550
Is an immortal with a mortal heart still an immortal?

254
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,330
Your divine essence has become impure, and your power diminished.

255
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
You are no longer the Divine Emperor of Fate.

256
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Since we've been friends for 10,000 years,

257
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,840
I'll make it quick

258
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,840
to help you out.

259
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,440
You saved him?

260
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,270
How dare you?

261
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,120
I didn't save him.

262
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,870
I just didn't want you to get what you want.

263
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,480
You hurt Xie Xuechen,

264
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,960
so I will never let you go.

265
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Fate's existence

266
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,960
is a threat to you.

267
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,630
I will never let you do

268
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,600
what you want.

269
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,920
Then I'll show you

270
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,240
how I get what I want.

271
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,680
Xie Xuechen.

272
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,830
How dare you bind me

273
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,160
with Jade Vault Technique in your soul?

274
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,000
Do you think that will limit me?

275
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,030
After ten thousand years,

276
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,480
you are still with Fate,

277
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,000
but now,

278
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,830
I'm not merciful anymore.

279
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,580
[Secluded in woods and valleys]

280
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,640
Sleep.

281
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,880
Sleep well.

282
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,590
When you wake up,

283
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,510
I'll tell you everything.

284
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,880
This is the price you pay for insisting on marrying her.

285
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,110
I'll give you medicine.

286
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,750
No need.

287
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,340
Ordinary spirit medicines are useless

288
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,000
for wounds inflicted

289
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,070
by the blades of the Chaos Power.

290
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,960
Then what will cure you?

291
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,200
I'll find it.

292
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,480
I thought you said you weren't involved.

293
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,640
But I didn't say

294
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't care about your life.

295
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,880
Don't worry.

296
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,590
I won't die.

297
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,510
It's just that this wound won't heal.

298
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,000
If you can control karma

299
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,640
and see through the world,

300
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,680
why are you so stubborn about her?

301
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,480
Feng Yao.

302
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,070
Do you know how long

303
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,960
tens of thousands of years are?

304
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,310
Very few people in this world

305
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,550
are over 100 years old,

306
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,330
and cultivators live

307
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,690
at most a thousand years,

308
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,590
so I can't answer

309
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,920
your question.

310
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,070
To the immortal,

311
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,000
tens of thousands of years is a very long time,

312
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,440
long enough for the world

313
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,070
to change several times.

314
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,310
In the world of the immortal, I was very lonely.

315
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,880
During those years,

316
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,350
only she and I

317
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,510
accompanied each other.

318
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,830
Anyway, I had you by my side.

319
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,350
No matter how the sun and moon change,

320
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,790
no matter if this is the universe or the foreworld,

321
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:08,960
Fate,

322
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,680
we'll always be together.

323
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I just want to go back in time.

324
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,830
Ten thousand years is too long.

325
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,590
The world has changed too much.

326
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,310
Mu Xuanling is not the same

327
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,270
as the Chaos Pearl.

328
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,550
What about you?

329
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,960
Can you tell

330
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,350
Nan Xuyue

331
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,070
from Fate?

332
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,960
If you can't let go of her,

333
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,160
why don't you use the Book of Fate

334
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,830
to change her fate

335
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,640
in order to make her fall in love with you?

336
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,960
Because Hao Tian doesn't allow divine artifacts

337
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,750
to have love.

338
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,510
Hao Tian.

339
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,920
Fate.

340
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,920
You have spent tens of thousands of years

341
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,920
and had hundreds of centuries of punishment,

342
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,550
so do you realize your mistake?

343
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,070
Yes.

344
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,680
I shouldn't have disobeyed you back then.

345
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,920
All these years of torment

346
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
have been my own doing.

347
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,480
All things are in order

348
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,830
because they follow the laws of Hao Tian.

349
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,240
You are Fate, the divine artifact,

350
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,680
so bloodshed and injuries

351
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,550
should not happen to you.

352
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,310
Thank you, Hao Tian.

353
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The sudden appearance of the new Demon Lord

354
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,720
and the changes to Hao Tian's rules

355
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,920
will disrupt the course of the world.

356
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,590
But the Book of Fate

357
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,790
can't change a person's destiny twice,

358
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:09,880
I can't come down

359
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,510
to the world directly.

360
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,790
Fate,

361
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,200
I need you to do my will

362
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,110
and continue to accomplish

363
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,720
what you failed to do ten thousand years ago.

364
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,310
This time,

365
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,640
don't let me down.

366
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,750
Aye, Hao Tian.

367
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,720
Leader.

368
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,400
I have arranged for the injured disciples

369
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,510
of the general factions to heal

370
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,550
in quarters with the best spirit medicines.

371
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,070
Thank you, Elder Cang.

372
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,820
I've sent spiritual flowers and spiritual grass

373
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,270
from the Mirage Palace here.

374
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,640
I hope that helps.

375
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,960
Humans and spirits have made an alliance,

376
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,370
but now, it seems

377
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,720
that we are no match for the new Demon Lord.

378
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,350
Guys,

379
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,900
that new Demon Lord

380
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,400
does look similar

381
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,740
to Mr. Xie.

382
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,000
That day, Mr. Xie left this place

383
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,960
and never came back.

384
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,310
If

385
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,590
what the new Demon Lord said

386
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,750
is true...

387
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,270
No.

388
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,030
Don't get carried away.

389
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,310
That's right.

390
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,400
The most important thing

391
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,720
is to discuss what to do.

392
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,550
Regardless

393
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,550
of the new Demon Lord's origin,

394
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,160
it is now a fact that the Immortals Array

395
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,200
has been torn apart.

396
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,480
In order to prevent the Dark Clan from attacking the Humans,

397
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,160
I will lead

398
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,960
the Xuantian Sect disciples

399
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,200
to study the Exorcism Array from today.

400
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,790
I hope that all sects

401
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,240
will strengthen your protection.

402
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,240
Yes.

403
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,590
Your Grace.

404
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,590
This is the Soul-Stealing Gu of the Lava, right?

405
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,790
The Soul-Stealing Gu?

406
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,080
Isn't that the gadget

407
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,410
that He Xianwo used to turn the cultivators

408
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,370
of the Mirage Palace into puppets?

409
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,550
That gu worm

410
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,550
cost the user's life

411
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,500
and only worked

412
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,250
after the user's death.

413
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,920
Your Grace, this gu butterfly

414
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,550
looks different.

415
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,640
The gu butterfly doesn't require anything

416
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,030
to turn anyone into a demon.

417
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,200
It's amazing how powerful

418
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,160
a little butterfly can be.

419
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,240
So Your Grace,

420
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,590
when are we going to kill

421
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,030
the Immortal Alliance's cultivators?

422
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,000
Killing the Immortal Alliance is as easy

423
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,830
as crushing a bunch of ants,

424
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,160
so it's far less interesting

425
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,240
to slaughter than to torture.

426
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,400
Xie Xuechen.

427
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,310
So what if you put a limit on me?

428
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,640
I can still destroy the world

429
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,350
you want to protect.

430
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,790
It's a bit chilly in the morning.

431
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,750
Go sleep some more.

432
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,110
I only helped you yesterday

433
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,750
to deal with the Demon Lord,

434
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,590
that doesn't mean I forgive you.

435
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,550
I hate the Demon Lord,

436
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,310
as well as you.

437
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,110
I know

438
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,110
you won't forgive me,

439
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,510
but I also know

440
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,960
that you don't want everything

441
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,110
Xie Xuechen is guarding to be destroyed by the Demon Lord.

442
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,200
I have been feuding with Demon Lord for 10,000 years.

443
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,920
Since you and I have the same goal,

444
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,750
why can't we work together for once?

445
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,000
Why should I do that?

446
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,550
Because I know Demon Lord's weakness

447
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,640
and how to deal with it.

448
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,160
Weakness?

449
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,680
It's Pearl.

450
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,640
What happened

451
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,920
ten thousand years ago?

452
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,510
Things have changed.

453
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,240
You and Xie Xuechen,

454
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,310
Pearl and the Demon Lord,

455
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,510
all started by chance 10,000 years ago.

456
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,480
If you want to know the truth

457
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,480
and find a way to break it,

458
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,590
why don't you experience it for yourself?

459
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,720
I can open the Fate Array for you

460
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,590
to bring back the events

461
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,160
of 10,000 years ago

462
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,030
and let you experience them again

463
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,030
from Pearl's point of view.

464
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Would you dare?

465
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,510
Why wouldn't I?

466
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,880
I have no memories of the Chaos Pearl,

467
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,000
so the only thing I believe in

468
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,180
is the tens of thousands of years

469
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,750
you spent together.

470
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,750
Tens of thousands of years is not a long time

471
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,350
for normal people to imagine.

472
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,440
It's not you,

473
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,070
but us.

474
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,830
I'll wait for you

475
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,030
to return with the memories.

476
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,160
At the beginning of the primordial chaos,

477
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,830
Hao Tian created the world

478
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,510
and invented two divine artifacts,

479
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,160
the Chaos Pearl

480
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,200
and the Book of Fate.

481
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,310
The Chaos Pearl governs time and space,

482
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,440
and the Book of Fate governs karma.

483
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,720
Both are controlled by Hao Tian

484
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,720
and work together to keep the world running.

485
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,350
After that, there are various races and creatures.

486
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,680
Everything in the world

487
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,880
follows the law of Hao Tian.

488
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,750
Ten thousand years ago,

489
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
the Divine Clan had a civil war.

490
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,480
The evil immortal Jun Yu led a rebellion,

491
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,720
killed the faction of the good old Immortal Emperor,

492
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,680
and took over the rule of the Celestial Realm.

493
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,110
Shocked by the war in the Divine Clan,

494
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,640
the sky shook

495
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,960
and cracked,

496
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,240
bringing the three realms to the brink of collapse,

497
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,240
known

498
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,960
as the Catastrophe of Cang Hao.

499
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,920
Hao Tian ordered the Chaos Pearl to repair the heavens.

500
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,110
Eventually, the Chaos Pearl exhausted her spiritual power

501
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,590
and fell into the human realm.

502
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,250
After the Book of Fate sensed the change in the Chaos Pearl,

503
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,880
half of its soul followed her to the human world,

504
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,000
and the other half

505
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,830
manifested a prophecy.

506
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,750
The divine child is born.

507
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,310
The immortals fall.

508
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:03,980
[The divine child is born. The immortals fall.]

509
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,650
The new Immortal Emperor, Jun Yu,

510
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,880
did not understand what the divine child was

511
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,640
and asked the Book of Fate for more information.

512
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,960
But the Book of Fate was silent.

513
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,240
Jun Yu ordered Anger Demon, Desire Demon, and Ignorance Demon

514
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,200
to stir up the human world

515
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,510
and search for the divine child.

516
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,030
The Book of Fate finally found the Chaos Pearl

517
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,160
in the human realm,

518
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,880
placed it in a pond in the Humans' palace,

519
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,200
and nourished it with the Emperor's power,

520
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,830
waiting for it

521
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,480
to take human form again.

522
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,180
[10,000 years ago, Dongze Palace]

523
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,180
[Emperor Zhao Ming]

524
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,160
The pearl is quite amusing.

525
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,550
Your Majesty.

526
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,510
Your Majesty.

527
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,070
- Your Majesty. - What's up?

528
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,400
Yan has returned

529
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,880
[He Zhou]
and is waiting at Everbright Palace.

530
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,310
[Everbright Palace]
The Xilin's infestation has been resolved.

531
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,680
The king of Xilin has personally sacrificed a hundred maidens

532
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,030
to the West River

533
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,110
in thanksgiving.

534
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,440
[Yan]
The occurrence and timing of this infestation was bizarre.

535
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,110
We found out

536
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,310
that it was related to a divine edict.

537
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,000
The Divine Clan feeds on faith.

538
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,330
They create fear

539
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,310
before bestowing favors

540
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,800
and make beings bow down to

541
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,550
and worship them

542
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,510
in order to gain faith.

543
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,350
These so-called divine edicts

544
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,310
are merely the means of the Divine Clan.

545
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,830
His Majesty is the recognized leader of the world,

546
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,960
so how could the king of Xilin

547
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,550
not report the divine edict?

548
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,590
Your Majesty has always been

549
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,680
against human sacrifice,

550
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,680
so the king of Xilin did not dare to report it.

551
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,590
The plague of Xilin has been removed,

552
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,200
but the people have missed the harvest,

553
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,510
so some of the hungry have joined the bandits,

554
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,590
causing friction along the borders.

555
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,680
We need to distinguish between the people and the army.

556
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,960
We need to be prepared in advance for everything.

557
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,100
I'll reconsider

558
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,110
what happened in Xilin.

559
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,720
Thank you, Yan.

560
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,000
Get some rest.

561
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:46,830
He works hard,

562
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,370
but not as hard as Your Majesty,

563
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,550
and you haven't slept in days

564
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,160
because of government affairs.

565
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,920
It's you who wants to sleep, isn't it?

566
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,030
That's enough.

567
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,640
I don't need anyone here.

568
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:57,960
Go.

569
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,070
Thank you, Your Majesty.

570
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,750
Yan.

571
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,750
Wait.

572
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,310
We haven't seen each other for so long,

573
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,640
but is this how you treat your friends?

574
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,000
You're from Xilin,

575
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,160
and I'm from Dongze,

576
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,270
but we see each other every day.

577
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,640
By the way,

578
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,720
did you see

579
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,200
anything interesting back there?

580
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,680
Is that your only concern?

581
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,200
Have you noticed that His Majesty

582
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,510
has been under so much pressure lately

583
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,640
that he's even started playing with a pearl?

584
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,960
What does it matter to you?

585
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,400
Except in the presence of His Majesty,

586
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,830
you're always boring.

587
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:47,860
[Graceful Palace]

588
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,900
[The Saint Emperor's advisor]

589
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
The surroundings have always been good,

590
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,310
and now, so are the people.

591
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,580
[Everbright Palace]

592
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,960
Sir.

593
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,110
You're just in time.

594
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,510
Things have been turbulent lately.

595
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,720
Yan went to a neighboring country to gather some divine edict,

596
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,830
so please enlighten me.

597
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,070
I'm here

598
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,110
to congratulate Your Majesty

599
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,070
on acquiring

600
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,400
the ancient divine artifact.

601
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,030
Your ambitions are about to be realized.

602
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,880
Divine artifact?

603
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,640
The pearl in your hand

604
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,160
is the ancient divine artifact,

605
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,550
the Chaos Pearl.

606
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,400
The Chaos Power can open up the heavens and the earth.

607
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,680
If you succeed in refining it,

608
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,070
you will be able to fight

609
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,750
the Divine Clan with ease.

610
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,110
This is the Chaos Pearl.

611
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,630
Please guide me.

612
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,110
You're the only mortal

613
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,000
in the history of Humans

614
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,630
born with divine channels,

615
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,670
so your blood essence

616
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,480
can repair the Divine artifact.

617
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,590
But if

618
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,000
you lose a soul,

619
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,190
- then... - Don't worry.

620
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,630
Can you help me with this?

621
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,880
Your Majesty.

622
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,360
Please.

623
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,030
Your Majesty.

624
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,630
Don't worry.

625
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,320
After ten years in the mortal world,

626
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,440
you're finally back.

627
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:50,260
[Pearl]

628
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,630
Who are you?

629
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,030
I'm Zhao Ming,

630
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,960
I remember you.

631
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,360
Your scent

632
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,110
is familiar.

633
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,030
What else do you remember?

634
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,000
I remember

635
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,480
that I seemed to be a pearl

636
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,510
and was often held in your hand.

637
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,110
I don't remember

638
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,360
anything else.

639
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,150
If you can't remember, just give up.

640
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,880
Since you're a pearl,

641
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,000
I'll call you Pearl from now on,

642
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,030
okay?

643
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,360
Pearl?

644
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,110
I like that name.

645
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,000
What are your future plans?

646
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,280
Aren't I your Pearl?

647
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,230
It's good to be like before.

648
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,550
Now that you've taken human form,

649
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,230
it would be a pity for you to be confined to the palace.

650
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,550
Would you like to travel the world

651
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,280
and see great landscapes?

652
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,360
Will you come with me?

653
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,510
I'm afraid not.

654
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,150
I have to stay here.

655
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,000
If you don't,

656
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,960
neither do I.

657
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,670
You're the only person

658
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,920
I know in the world,

659
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,070
so I just want to stay with you.

660
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,030
Besides,

661
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,710
you have spiritual power,

662
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,960
so I won't turn back

663
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,800
into a pearl around you.

664
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,030
If you want to change your mind,

665
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,880
you can leave anytime.

666
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,840
It's late.

667
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,760
Yes,

668
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,590
it is.

669
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,670
I've had the Graceful Palace cleaned.

670
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,110
You can go and rest now.

671
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,630
It's time for you to rest.

672
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,710
You look tired.

673
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,480
Let's rest together.

674
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,670
We

675
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,670
can't sleep together.

676
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,000
Why not?

677
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,360
We slept together before.

678
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,150
You're human now.

679
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,510
Pearls can,

680
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,400
but I can't.

681
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,280
I'm not even as good as a pearl,

682
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,320
but

683
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,590
I'm not used to it

684
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,800
and can't sleep

685
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,480
if you're not with me.

686
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,440
It's late today.

687
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,590
Sleep here for now.

688
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,320
I have a lot of paperwork to finish.

689
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,440
I'm not leaving.

690
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,590
I'll stay here.

691
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,360
OK.

692
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,230
Sir.

693
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,400
It's cold tonight,

694
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
so if you want to go to the garden,

695
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,550
remember to wear a cloak.

696
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,400
I won't go there anymore.

697
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,710
You said the garden pond

698
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,480
holds the essence

699
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,760
of the sun and the moon.

700
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,400
The spiritual energy collected there

701
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,030
helps to refine the rare spiritual essence.

702
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,030
You used to go there every night,

703
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,070
but now you don't want to go.

704
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,400
Is it because your spiritual essence

705
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,360
has already been refined?

706
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,960
The essence of the sun and the moon

707
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,280
is certainly beneficial to the refining of the spiritual essence,

708
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,880
but the cycle is very long.

709
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,800
I have recently discovered

710
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,360
another essence in this world

711
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,920
that can help the spiritual essence to be refined quickly.

712
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,190
Really?

713
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,880
But alchemy

714
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,510
is about balance.

715
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,630
If we rush it,

716
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,630
we'll only void the spiritual essence.

717
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,150
Thanks for the advice.

718
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:15,760
You're right.

719
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,480
The key to alchemy is heat.

720
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,230
Sir,

721
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,070
I'll go to the alchemy room.

722
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,590
The Emperor's energy

723
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,550
is greater than the essence of the sun and moon.

724
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:30,800
Soon,

725
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,550
you'll be as good as new.
