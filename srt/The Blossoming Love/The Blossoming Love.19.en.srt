17
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,860
[Episode 19]

18
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,350
My father always told me

19
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,950
that he deeply loved my mother.

20
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,510
But my mother

21
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,070
passed away in childbirth

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,040
soon after I was born.

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
Now it seems

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,640
that might all have been lies.

25
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,540
Even my mother's remains

26
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,710
are nowhere to be found.

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,560
And my Madam...

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,030
I know she carries many secrets.

29
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,240
But after all, she's the one

30
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,750
who raised me,

31
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,680
who nurtured me.

32
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,120
I don't know whether telling Xie Xuechen

33
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,430
about her secrets

34
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,450
is right or wrong.

35
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,190
And Mu Xuanling...

36
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,710
if she truly shares my bloodline,

37
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,800
if she really

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,430
is my mother's child,

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
then should I like her,

40
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,840
or should I hate her?

41
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
I don't know either.

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,840
Did I share too much with you?

43
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,240
Not at all.

44
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,150
Sometimes saying it out loud helps.

45
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,190
And only by saying it out

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,750
can you start to solve these things one by one.

47
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,560
And once you've solved them all,

48
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,680
when you look back,

49
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,710
you'll realize

50
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,870
it's not such a big deal after all.

51
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,080
In fact, the truth

52
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,030
isn't always that important.

53
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,360
You are you.

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,590
That will never change.

55
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,000
Those who love you

56
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,680
won't leave because of it.

57
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,240
And those who do leave,

58
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,470
you don't need to care about them.

59
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,630
So, in short,

60
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,190
just be the happiest version

61
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,400
of Miss Gao.

62
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,150
I didn't expect you

63
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,000
to be so good at comforting people.

64
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,800
We're friends.

65
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,400
If you ever feel troubled,

66
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,710
just let me know anytime.

67
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,560
Friends?

68
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,470
You're only the third person

69
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,000
in my life

70
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,750
to call me a friend.

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,190
What about the first two?

72
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,310
The first

73
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,030
was my junior,

74
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,520
Cui Wanwan.

75
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,870
She stayed with me in the Palace

76
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,190
for ten years.

77
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,070
But it turned out

78
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,430
she was a spy from the Decaying Immortal Pavilion.

79
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,800
She was exposed later

80
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,680
and killed by Madam.

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,190
The second was Mu Xuanling.

82
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,430
She told me yesterday

83
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,680
that she considered me a friend.

84
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,310
But that turned out to be fake too.

85
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,630
And the third is you.

86
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,680
I swear,

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,870
I'm definitely real.

88
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,070
A true friend!

89
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,830
I believe you,

90
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,750
a true friend!

91
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,720
Your Grace.

92
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,070
What is it?

93
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,390
The Saintess and Xie Xuechen's group

94
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,160
have moved from the Moonlight Heights

95
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,360
to the Mirage Palace.

96
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,600
It seems

97
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,720
they've found something.

98
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,600
I've mastered the Jade Vault Technique,

99
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,480
and my spiritual channels are now open.

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
This is the perfect time

101
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,800
for an old reunion.

102
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,950
Grudges of all these years, old and new,

103
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,120
should be settled properly.

104
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,260
[Starfall Valley]

105
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,680
Madam.

106
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,070
Madam Su,

107
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,600
have you made your decision yet?

108
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,160
This flower beside me

109
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,360
is called Reunion Bloom.

110
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,360
It feeds on blood.

111
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,050
But if it absorbs blood

112
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,160
from close relatives,

113
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
its petals will turn black.

114
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,390
No matter the outcome today,

115
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,310
it must remain known only to us.

116
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
It must never be spread.

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,800
If you agree, make a vow.

118
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,510
Otherwise,

119
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,800
pretend I never mentioned it.

120
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,000
I agree.

121
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,830
I don't agree.

122
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,360
Mr. Xie, what do you mean by this?

123
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,950
And what do you mean by this, Madam Su?

124
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,310
This is no Reunion Bloom.

125
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,720
This is an Autumn Dread.

126
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,390
If you drip fresh blood on it,

127
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,870
you'll form a blood pact with it,

128
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,270
falling under its control,

129
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,750
and becoming its slave.

130
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,750
Though they appear similar,

131
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,270
one is a plant,

132
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,630
the other a beast.

133
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,310
Their aura is different.

134
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,720
Madam Su, you surely know this.

135
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,120
Madam.

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,870
Mr. Xie,

137
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,430
you've colluded with a demoness from the Dark Abyss

138
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,830
to ambush my Mirage Palace.

139
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,950
Don't blame me for delivering

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,240
ruthless justice.

141
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,480
She dares to attack you directly.

142
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,480
What is she trying to hide?

143
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,120
Madam Su,

144
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,240
your array can't trap me.

145
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,670
If you insist on this,

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,390
it will harm the Mirage Palace.

147
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,390
Are you sure you want to risk the Mirage Palace

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,790
for your own selfish motives?

149
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,360
Is this how a Madam shoulders responsibility?

150
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,090
I act righteously to wipe out evil.

151
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,440
How is that selfish?

152
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,000
Form the array!

153
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,390
Madam!

154
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,790
Madam Su has gone mad.

155
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,270
She's actually attacking Mr. Xie!

156
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,270
What do we do now?

157
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,840
Bao,

158
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,790
stay here.

159
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,550
Do not go outside.

160
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,440
I'll go help.

161
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,540
Nan Xuyue!

162
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,620
- Why are you here? - Quickly, drive the Cloud Floating Airship

163
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,680
over Starfall Valley

164
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,600
and block out the sunlight.

165
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,390
Block out the sunlight?

166
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,240
Su Ningzhen's power isn't enough.

167
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,360
She must draw on the force of nature

168
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,390
to face Xie Xuechen.

169
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,390
Her golden cage draws its strength from sunlight.

170
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,720
As long as the sun shines,

171
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,630
the golden cage persists.

172
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,030
The stronger the sunlight,

173
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,270
the sturdier the golden cage.

174
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,120
No wonder she scheduled the meeting for this hour.

175
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,910
She planned her ambush well in advance.

176
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,510
Madam,

177
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,550
if something happens to Xie Xuechen

178
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,790
inside our Mirage Palace,

179
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,480
how will you explain it to the Immortal Alliance?

180
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,790
Why should I explain anything?

181
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,120
As long as I get what I want,

182
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,510
that's enough.

183
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,600
Madam,

184
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,030
is your target Mu Xuanling?

185
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,000
Why is that,

186
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,550
Madam?

187
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,440
Who exactly is she?

188
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,630
Tell me, Madam!

189
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,080
Stop her!

190
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,670
Yes, Madam!

191
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,390
Madam!

192
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,750
Let me go, Madam!

193
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,910
Ultimate Jade Vault Technique!

194
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,630
Xie Xuechen!

195
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,150
Master!

196
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,080
Madam.

197
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,200
Sang Qi...

198
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,200
Mr. Xie,

199
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,910
how does the Jade Vault Technique

200
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,150
taste?

201
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,360
How is it possible

202
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,840
for you to master it?

203
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,510
Of course, it's because...

204
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,910
Ling helped me.

205
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,320
I told you.

206
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,670
We're not on the same side.

207
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,240
I stand with my master.

208
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,870
Ling.

209
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,030
Where is Su Ningxi's body?

210
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,120
She's already dead.

211
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,030
What more do you want?

212
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,360
Why did she just get to die as you say?

213
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,750
Even she's dead,

214
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,550
I'll still dig her up

215
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,750
and grind her bones to dust!

216
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,240
Don't even think about it.

217
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,600
Back then,

218
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,150
you were also among those who ambushed me

219
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,150
at the Wind Pavilion, weren't you?

220
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,720
Twenty years have passed,

221
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,510
yet you people from the Mirage Palace

222
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,870
are just as hateful as ever!

223
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,150
Sang Qi!

224
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,510
Qiumin!

225
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,480
Fool.

226
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,790
Madam!

227
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,870
Su Ningzhen,

228
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,080
you can abandon the Mirage Palace,

229
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,910
you can disregard your own life,

230
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
but this person...

231
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,840
you raised her yourself,

232
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,440
pinned all your hopes on her,

233
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,840
even

234
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,390
passed all your cultivation to her.

235
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,240
If you want her to live,

236
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,870
then tell me where Su Ningxi is.

237
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,360
She's Ningxi's daughter.

238
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,000
She carries Ningxi's bloodline.

239
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,150
Do you really want to kill her?

240
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,510
You foolish woman.

241
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,870
Su Ningxi betrayed me,

242
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,200
giving birth to this bastard with Gao Fengxu,

243
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,750
and you ask me to show mercy?

244
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,670
But...

245
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,720
you've reminded me.

246
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,910
Today,

247
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,960
I'll cut off one of her arms first

248
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,440
to avenge that strike twenty years ago.

249
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,600
No!

250
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,320
Ningxi didn't betray you!

251
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,670
The one who wounded you that day was me,

252
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,200
not Ningxi!

253
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,900
[Twenty years ago]

254
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,000
Ningzhen.

255
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,600
I'll leave soon.

256
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,390
Where are you going?

257
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,200
I promised Sang Qi

258
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,840
to go into seclusion with him.

259
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,550
But you also promised me

260
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,150
that you'd never leave me.

261
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,550
And now, for a Spirit clansman you barely know,

262
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,890
you're abandoning

263
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,870
the younger sister who's been with you since childhood?

264
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,320
Ningzhen,

265
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,750
you've grown up now.

266
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,960
You no longer need my protection.

267
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,200
I don't know when it started,

268
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,630
but now it's you protecting me instead.

269
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,910
I've trained so hard

270
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,480
just so I wouldn't hold you back,

271
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,240
so I wouldn't be like I was as a child,

272
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,960
getting you hurt while protecting me.

273
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,240
If becoming stronger means you'll leave,

274
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,400
then I'd rather stay useless forever!

275
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,830
Ningxi,

276
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,310
if you betray the Mirage Palace,

277
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,510
Madam won't let you and Sang Qi go.

278
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,550
Gao Fengxu will also send people to hunt you down.

279
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,110
Ningxi,

280
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,960
is this really worth it?

281
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,310
Ningzhen,

282
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,240
one day,

283
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,510
you'll meet someone

284
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,030
who truly enters your life.

285
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,310
I don't want that!

286
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,550
Su Ningxi dared to ally with the Spirit Clan,

287
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,440
lowering and degrading herself so much.

288
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,920
It's utterly disgraceful

289
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
to the Mirage Palace!

290
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,480
Madam,

291
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
it must have been that Spirit clansman

292
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,070
using magic to deceive my sister,

293
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,680
causing her to lose her senses.

294
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,920
Please don't blame my sister.

295
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,400
You've done well.

296
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,720
When and where are they meeting to run away?

297
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,920
Tomorrow, at the seventh quarter of the Yin Hour,

298
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,960
at the Wind Pavilion.

299
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,310
[Wind Pavilion]

300
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,070
Apply this Soul Capturing Bloom Extract

301
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,720
to your neck and cheeks.

302
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,310
Disguise yourself as Ningxi

303
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,920
to lure and kill Sang Qi.

304
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,640
The scent of Soul Capturing Bloom

305
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,200
can confuse one's mind.

306
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,480
It makes one see

307
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,900
- the person one most wishes to see. - Ningxi!

308
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,240
Even cultivators at the Spiritual Form stage...

309
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,830
You're here. That's enough.

310
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,830
...cannot resist its effects.

311
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
It was me

312
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
who disguised as Ningxi,

313
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,830
stole her Sword of Vitality,

314
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,070
and cut off your arm.

315
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,310
Form the Beast-Trap Array!

316
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,350
The Beast-Trap Array is complete.

317
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,640
Stop entangling yourself

318
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,920
- with this Spirit clansman. - Ningxi!

319
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,720
Ningxi!

320
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,750
Why?

321
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,960
Because you disgust me.

322
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,110
So...

323
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,830
everything before...

324
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,160
was all a lie?

325
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,240
From start to finish,

326
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,480
it was a trap!

327
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,640
As the Young Madam of the Mirage Palace,

328
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,830
how could I ever fall for a vile spirit like you?

329
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,160
Every word I said

330
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,000
was just to survive.

331
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,030
Who knew you'd take it seriously?

332
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,350
So I went along with it.

333
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,680
Kill this remnant of the Canglang Clan!

334
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,680
It wasn't Ningxi...

335
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,030
Madam...

336
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,960
But in the end,

337
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,400
she still married Gao Fengxu

338
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,350
- and bore this bastard! - No!

339
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,160
She didn't marry Gao Fengxu.

340
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,400
Ningxi is dead.

341
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,200
She died before the wedding.

342
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,270
Ningxi,

343
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,750
Sang Qi is already dead.

344
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,510
You should stop resisting

345
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,160
and obediently marry into the Moonlight Heights.

346
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,510
No...

347
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,640
He's not dead.

348
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,270
You cut off his arm,

349
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,550
but you let him escape, didn't you?

350
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,110
At the Wind Pavilion,

351
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,680
Sang Qi was ambushed by the five great elders and me.

352
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,750
Do you think he could have survived?

353
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,960
I know

354
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,000
you can bring the dead back to life.

355
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,590
To prevent future trouble,

356
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,550
I've already reduced Sang Qi's body

357
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,200
to ashes.

358
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,480
I only brought back this arm

359
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,510
as proof to you.

360
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,160
Ningxi,

361
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,160
as long as you behave,

362
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,070
all your past mistakes

363
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,830
can be forgiven.

364
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,640
Otherwise,

365
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,200
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

366
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,920
Madam,

367
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,550
Ningxi just couldn't think clearly for a moment.

368
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,880
I'll persuade her.

369
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,440
Ningzhen...

370
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,000
It was you...

371
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,070
You pretended to be me

372
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,640
and deceived him, didn't you?

373
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,400
Ningxi,

374
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,250
I truly did it for your sake.

375
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,960
Enough!

376
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,400
Su Ningxi,

377
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,720
in seven days,

378
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,720
people from the Moonlight Heights

379
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,070
will come here to pick up the bride.

380
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,550
If you refuse to comply,

381
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,310
I will find a way to make you submit!

382
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,480
Ningxi,

383
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,070
you're about to get married,

384
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,550
yet you're still helping me with my hair.

385
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,110
After this,

386
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,680
I won't be able to stay with you anymore,

387
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,830
nor will there be a chance

388
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,160
to have a good chat with you.

389
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,350
Try to keep your temper in check

390
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,160
and don't act too impulsively,

391
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,750
or you'll suffer for it.

392
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,440
When cultivating,

393
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,510
never be greedy for quick results.

394
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,070
Excess leads to harm.

395
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,640
If you lose control and fall into madness,

396
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,240
I won't be there to help you anymore.

397
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,110
I wanted to leave before,

398
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,200
but I just couldn't let you go.

399
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,750
I've discussed with Sang Qi.

400
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,720
Once we find a place to settle,

401
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,200
if you're willing,

402
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,000
we'll bring you there.

403
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,270
If not,

404
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,270
the Mirage Palace will still be your safe home.

405
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,210
You're diligent, driven,

406
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,510
and very obedient.

407
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,200
Among the disciples,

408
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,510
you're the most outstanding one.

409
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,640
One day,

410
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,930
Madam will surely pass her position

411
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,880
on to you.

412
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,750
I promised to always stay with you,

413
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,770
but now I have to break that promise.

414
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,480
In the future,

415
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,640
you'll have many disciples

416
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,350
who respect you

417
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,510
and love you.

418
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,680
You'll also meet someone

419
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,590
who truly understands and cherishes you.

420
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,110
But Sang Qi...

421
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,680
he has only me.

422
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,440
I can't bear to deceive him,

423
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,720
nor do I wish to abandon him.

424
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,830
Ningxi!

425
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,590
Ningxi!

426
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,680
What's wrong?

427
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,310
Someone, come quickly!

428
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,110
Don't call for anyone...

429
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,440
Ningxi...

430
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,160
Three days ago,

431
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,960
I took Fading Poison.

432
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,550
In this body of mine,

433
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,790
even seeking death

434
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,730
is difficult.

435
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,030
Promise me one last thing:

436
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,680
bury me together with Sang Qi.

437
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,960
If there's a next life,

438
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,110
I'll repay him for an entire lifetime.

439
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,590
Ningxi...

440
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,350
Ningxi!

441
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,550
I was wrong.

442
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,270
Sang Qi isn't dead.

443
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,750
He escaped, Ningxi.

444
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,880
Ningxi, don't leave me!

445
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,510
Her body

446
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,750
is filled with endless vitality.

447
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,640
Trying to end her life is nearly impossible.

448
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,640
Only Fading Poison,

449
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,590
the most poisonous thing in the world,

450
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,400
could bring her death,

451
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,270
but only after three days of unbearable pain in her heart.

452
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,830
Ningxi...

453
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,480
Ningxi...

454
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,510
Ningxi, no!

455
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,000
You're awake.

456
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Madam...

457
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,640
Where is this, Madam?

458
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,830
Where's Ningxi?

459
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,510
Su Ningxi...

460
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,070
is already dead.

461
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,070
So it wasn't a dream.

462
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,680
Ningxi really is gone.

463
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,750
Tomorrow is the wedding ceremony.

464
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,270
All sects of the Immortal Alliance will attend.

465
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,030
You'll disguise yourself as Ningxi

466
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,030
and marry Gao Fengxu.

467
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,070
But Ningxi is dead!

468
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,480
So what?

469
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,720
If people find out Su Ningxi colluded with the Spirit Clan,

470
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,440
and the immortal Primal Celestial Maiden

471
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,440
even died for love,

472
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,830
how could the Mirage Palace maintain its standing in the Alliance?

473
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,920
Ningzhen,

474
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,480
be obedient.

475
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,160
This concerns the reputation

476
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,680
of the Mirage Palace and the Moonlight Heights.

477
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,680
We can't let anyone detect the truth.

478
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,160
Ningxi is dead,

479
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,160
but we must go on living.

480
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,920
I can't do it.

481
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,960
I...

482
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,270
Madam,

483
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,000
I need to see my sister!

484
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
After the wedding ceremony,

485
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,350
I'll let you see her.

486
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,680
Otherwise,

487
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,590
you'll never see her again in this life!

488
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,790
I never knew...

489
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,110
never knew

490
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,480
everything she suffered.

491
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,160
All this time, I thought she betrayed me,

492
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,270
that she hurt me.

493
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,590
I hated her my whole life.

494
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,110
So...

495
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
Gao Qiumin

496
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,750
is Su Ningzhen's daughter.

497
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,830
The one who married Gao Fengxu back then

498
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,920
was Su Ningzhen.

499
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,510
Madam,

500
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,270
what is

501
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,110
my true identity?

502
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,920
I'd rather

503
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,030
Qiumin be my child.

504
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,480
Gao Fengxu insisted on marrying Ningxi

505
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,810
only because he desired

506
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,720
her Primal Celestial Maiden body.

507
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,070
Her spiritual channels

508
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,830
are the source of spiritual power.

509
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,250
Her womb

510
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,720
is the root of vitality.

511
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,330
She has a lifespan of a thousand years.

512
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,030
Madam...

513
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,110
- Madam! - Even after death, her vitality lingers.

514
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,790
Gao Fengxu and Miaohua

515
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,830
wouldn't even spare her corpse!

516
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,270
Gao Fengxu infused his blood

517
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,590
and the Chaos Pearl together

518
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,160
into Ningxi's body,

519
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,960
using her vitality

520
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,000
to nourish it.

521
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,160
He wanted the Chaos Pearl to accept him as its master.

522
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,550
But to his utter shock,

523
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,480
the Chaos Pearl didn't recognize him.

524
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,640
Instead, it formed a child

525
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,400
within Ningxi's body.

526
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,000
Just like a pregnancy,

527
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,480
Ningxi's belly grew day by day.

528
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,640
Until ten months later,

529
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,310
they cut her open...

530
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,310
When Qiumin was born,

531
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,550
the Chaos Pearl vanished.

532
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,720
Gao Fengxu and Qiumin had their bloodline tested,

533
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,880
confirming they were related by blood.

534
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,160
So we believed

535
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,110
that the Chaos Pearl fused

536
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,270
with his blood

537
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,030
and took human form.

538
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,200
He was overjoyed

539
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,240
and publicly claimed that Ningxi died in childbirth.

540
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,590
He created the fake pearl

541
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,400
that Miaohua eventually hid in the Pearl Tower.

542
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,510
Madam,

543
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,200
then does that mean

544
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,830
I am the Chaos Pearl?

545
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,270
Before,

546
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,070
I always thought so, too.

547
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,440
But it wasn't until yesterday

548
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,270
that I realized we were all wrong.

549
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,110
The Chaos Pearl didn't fuse

550
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,510
with Gao Fengxu's blood,

551
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,310
nor did it disappear.

552
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,440
It escaped!

553
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,590
That dazzling light

554
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,400
didn't mark Qiumin's birth.

555
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,590
It was the Chaos Pearl descending.

556
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,310
It escaped, hidden by that burst of light.

557
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,310
And all of us assumed

558
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,830
it had transformed into Qiumin.

559
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,070
Mu Xuanling

560
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,830
is the truly Chaos Pearl!

561
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,270
She and Qiumin

562
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,480
were both born from Ningxi's body,

563
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,240
thus they share a bloodline connection.

564
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,680
Qiumin also mentioned

565
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,750
that when Mu Xuanling was a child,

566
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,030
her face bore demonic patterns.

567
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,200
Those patterns are identical

568
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,880
to the sacred markings of the Chaos Pearl!

569
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,480
So...

570
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,550
they weren't demonic patterns.

571
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,030
I am the Chaos Pearl.

572
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,550
If that's the case,

573
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,000
then everything makes sense.

574
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,920
Mu Xuanling has no spiritual channels or essence.

575
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,350
The so-called demonic patterns

576
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,510
are markings from the Chaos Pearl.

577
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,680
Her demonic aura is merely the Chaos Pearl's energy.

578
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,540
No one in this world truly knows

579
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,240
what the Chaos Pearl's energy is like.

580
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
Assumptions were made,

581
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,720
mistaking her for a Spirit Clan member.

582
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,680
All these years, I've searched

583
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,590
for Ningxi's vitality in Qiumin,

584
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,830
but I never found it.

585
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,270
It turns out I was looking at the wrong person.

586
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,440
Mu Xuanling is the true Chaos Pearl.

587
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,920
She absorbed Ningxi's vitality.

588
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,970
Perhaps by capturing her,

589
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,680
we could revive Ningxi!

590
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,110
Sang Qi,

591
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,350
I know you want Ningxi to live, too.

592
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,720
Capture her.

593
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,790
This is the only hope!

594
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,510
Madam!

595
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,640
Madam!

596
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,240
Are you okay, Madam?

597
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,720
Master...

598
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,550
are you really going to hurt me?

599
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,030
Ling...

600
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,400
ten years ago at the Moonlight Heights,

601
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,310
the reason I noticed you

602
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,960
was because I sensed

603
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,000
Ningxi's aura

604
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,160
faintly in you.

605
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,720
But you're not like her.

606
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,720
What I saw in you

607
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,720
was myself.

608
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,590
If Ningxi and I

609
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,960
had a child,

610
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,960
it would probably be like you.

611
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,550
So even though

612
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,920
I knew you carried ill will towards me,

613
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,030
I never truly considered

614
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,110
hurting you.

615
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,480
Come here.

616
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,550
Sang Qi,

617
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,000
you are not a heartless man.

618
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,000
Otherwise, Su Ningxi

619
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,030
wouldn't have fallen for you.

620
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,590
Sacrificing Mu Xuanling

621
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,320
won't truly bring Su Ningxi back.

622
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,030
Do you really want to do this?

623
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,230
But what if

624
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,280
there's even a sliver of hope?

625
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,070
I don't want to

626
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,880
and cannot give up on reviving Su Ningxi.

627
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,190
This hope

628
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,070
lies with Ling,

629
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,280
with the Chaos Pearl.

630
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,070
Ling,

631
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,320
come here.

632
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,840
I won't harm your life.

633
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,280
Miracle

634
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,030
requires equivalent exchange.

635
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,480
To revive someone

636
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,670
dead for twenty years,

637
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,030
how is that easy?

638
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,740
Defying the natural order

639
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,630
will face consequences.

640
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,030
Today,

641
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,190
I won't let you harm her,

642
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,070
not even slightly.

643
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,760
No one can stop me!

644
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,780
You've gone mad.

645
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,150
So what if I have?

646
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,320
Madness is nothing

647
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,190
compared to the horrors of the human heart!

648
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,800
Xie Xuechen,

649
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,800
now my spiritual channels have opened,

650
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,440
filled with the spiritual power of Jade Vault

651
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,840
and the demonic energy of the Dark Abyss.

652
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,400
With your mortal body,

653
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,710
how can you stop me?

654
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,150
Enough talk.

655
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,920
Let's find out.

656
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Ling,

657
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,000
kill Xie Xuechen.

658
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,320
Kill him!

659
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,000
Ling,

660
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,150
kill him!

661
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,440
Mu Xuanling,

662
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
in the Snow City,

663
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,000
you can live

664
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,920
like an ordinary person.

665
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,400
Tonight,

666
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,590
I feel like I've finally seen the real human world.

667
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,760
Mu Xuanling,

668
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,230
wait for me.

669
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,880
Ling!

670
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,840
Nan Xuyue,

671
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,070
hurry...

672
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,480
take her somewhere safe.

673
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,320

do you know

694
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,510
where Jun Tian originates?

695
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,440
Jun Tian

696
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,000
is a destructive force

697
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,840
left behind at the dawn of creation.

698
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,840
It is a destructive force

699
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,710
that tore apart the cosmos.

700
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,840
Without nearing the brink of death,

701
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,440
I couldn't have comprehended

702
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,000
