[Episode 25]

17
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,870
Day after day,

18
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,950
I nurtured you with the spiritual power of my blood.

19
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,790
You used my power to recover,

20
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,280
yet betrayed me at the critical moment,

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,920
sending me here with your own hands.

22
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,840
It seems you've forgotten everything now.

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,000
Pearl,

24
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,840
how could you be here?

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,280
Emperor Zhao Ming,

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,680
you're arrogant beyond measure,

27
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,800
burdened with sins.

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,910
Today, by divine decree,

29
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,360
you are sealed under the Lava,

30
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,120
never to escape for all time.

31
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,360
When I left,

32
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,870
you said you'd wait for me at home.

33
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,800
Why are you here now?

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,560
I am the Chaos Pearl, an ancient divine artifact,

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,630
master of time and space,

36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,240
the force that upholds the world's balance.

37
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,190
how could you possibly keep me at home?

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,750
Didn't you claim you loved me,

39
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,800
wished to marry me,

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,430
and stay by my side for thousands of years?

41
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,780
That was merely to repay

42
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,240
the nourishment I received

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
from your power.

44
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,150
I was born of chaos,

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,310
with an eternal lifespan.

46
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,080
A thousand years to me

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,910
is but a fleeting instant.

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,080
But now,

49
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,240
driven by selfish ambition, you ascended to slay the deities,

50
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,190
defying heaven with reckless arrogance,

51
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,560
slaughtering innocents.

52
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,710
I can no longer indulge you like this.

53
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,680
No,

54
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,240
you are not Pearl.

55
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,240
Who are you?

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,630
As expected of a mere mortal,

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,080
your mind is inevitably consumed by greed, anger, and ignorance.

58
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,910
Even now, you deceive yourself.

59
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,590
If I am not Pearl,

60
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,410
could there possibly be a second Chaos Pearl

61
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,430
in this world?

62
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,590
The Celestial Ladder was once a bridge

63
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,000
between the human and divine realms.

64
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,750
Due to Emperor Zhao Ming's rebellion,

65
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,150
it is now abolished.

66
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,590
From now on,

67
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
humans shall have no means to ascend to heaven.

68
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,480
I was sealed underground by the Book of Fate.

69
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,040
At the same time, the Celestial Ladder collapsed,

70
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,600
giving rise to the Lava.

71
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,370
I was sealed under it for ten thousand years.

72
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,830
After ten thousand years,

73
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,870
the same face remains.

74
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,720
The more innocent it seems,

75
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,040
the more sinister it is.

76
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,950
Since you've come,

77
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,870
let me think carefully

78
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,720
how to pay you back!

79
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,800
Back then, I nurtured you with the spiritual power of my blood.

80
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,430
Today, with this blood array,

81
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,720
I shall reclaim everything

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,870
that was once mine.

83
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,510
The Chaos Pearl is the artifact of time,

84
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,720
master of temporal power,

85
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,750
capable of reversing time and the universe.

86
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,630
The Chaos Saintess of the past

87
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,160
was so lofty and unapproachable.

88
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,040
Look at you now,

89
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,630
so wretched and pitiful,

90
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,360
unable to withstand even a blood array.

91
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,750
Beg for mercy,

92
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,750
admit your betrayal,

93
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,600
confess your sins,

94
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,480
and plead for my forgiveness.

95
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,630
I am merely myself,

96
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,160
not some Chaos Saintess.

97
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I have never experienced

98
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,600
everything you claim.

99
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600
Nor do I possess

100
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,510
the divine power to reverse the universe.

101
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,240
But if you expect me to beg you for mercy,

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,950
keep dreaming.

103
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,120
Keep dreaming?

104
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,600
I truly wonder, if Xie Xuechen

105
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
saw you like this,

106
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,240
what would he think?

107
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,190
If you have any hard feelings, take them out on me!

108
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Don't drag him into this!

109
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,800
You care for him!

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,920
Now he's here.

111
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,040
Xuanling!

112
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,360
Who allowed you to come?

113
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,430
This array is dangerous.

114
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,190
Leave quickly!

115
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,430
I'll take you out of here.

116
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,360
Out of here?

117
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,630
Who exactly are you?

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,830
I am...

119
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,630
Zhao Ming.

120
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,430
You are Emperor Zhao Ming?

121
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,390
You...

122
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,950
are also Zhao Ming.

123
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,870
Back then, I ascended to the heavens with a sword,

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,830
and none of the deities could stand against me.

125
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,870
If not for the Chaos Pearl's betrayal,

126
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,390
I would have destroyed the Divine Clan long ago,

127
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,620
and would never have been sealed

128
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,800
under the Lava for ten thousand years!

129
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,190
Recently, Sang Qi's practice of the Jade Vault Technique

130
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,720
stirred demonic energy,

131
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,630
and that's how I sensed you.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,040
I then realized

133
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,510
a fragment of my soul remained in the world.

134
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,830
You and I may look alike,

135
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
but how does that prove

136
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
I am a part of your soul?

137
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,410
Jun Tian,

138
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,270
it's been ten thousand years,

139
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,870
and you've become like this.

140
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,720
Return to me.

141
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,310
This is your true form.

142
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,510
You ask how I know?

143
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,760
Because at any time,

144
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,790
I can kill you.

145
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,120
Xie Xuechen!

146
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,820
Xie Xuechen...

147
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,120
A true power needs no lies for nobodies.

148
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,080
If I say you are,

149
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
then you are.

150
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,440
You are merely

151
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,440
a tiny fragment of me, left in the human realm.

152
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,790
These twenty-some years of your life

153
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,840
are but a fleeting moment

154
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,080
to me.

155
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,200
Neither heaven nor fate,

156
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,550
and certainly not you,

157
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,150
can define me.

158
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,030
Even if you are Emperor Zhao Ming,

159
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,670
a deity of ten thousand years,

160
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,080
today,

161
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,720
I will still take her away

162
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,960
from here.

163
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,550
Jun Tian's sword energy weighs thousands of tons,

164
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,080
yet lands without damage.

165
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:33,910
Could it be

166
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,630
we are inside an illusion

167
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,670
constructed by his mind?

168
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,320
Everything before us is but an illusion.

169
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,120
In reality, Jun Tian remains in your grasp!

170
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,270
It seems you're still living ten thousand years ago.

171
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,720
Now, times have changed,

172
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,750
and so has everything else.

173
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,870
Xie Xuechen,

174
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,440
one day, you will return.

175
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,870
Is everyone alright?

176
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,120
Did any Dark Clan members escape?

177
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,360
Rest assured, Mr. Xie,

178
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,960
none of them escaped.

179
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,000
However, a report just arrived:

180
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,550
the Spirit Clan attacked several sects,

181
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,870
the Snow City,

182
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,920
the Xuantian Sect,

183
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,510
and the Mirage Palace have settled the battles,

184
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,480
but at the Jade Sky Palace,

185
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,790
the losses were heavy.

186
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,030
Father, Mother,

187
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,080
you're awake!

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,600
Sheng...

189
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,200
How are you?

190
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,120
Sheng,

191
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,360
- Are you alright? - I'm fine.

192
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,480
Mother,

193
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,480
I'm fine.

194
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,150
What's the situation at the Jade Sky Palace?

195
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,440
The Spirit Clan has been driven away.

196
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,870
The Jade Sky Palace is safe now.

197
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,550
Thank you, Mr. Xie,

198
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,510
for saving the Jade Sky Palace from crisis.

199
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,910
Both of you, please rest well.

200
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,030
I'll handle the aftermath.

201
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,910
For the remaining time,

202
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
spend it well with them.

203
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,240
Dear, here.

204
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,080
Look at you.

205
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,360
Take care.

206
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,870
How are they?

207
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,030
Master Fu and Elder Duan

208
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,260
sacrificed themselves to withstand

209
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,480
the attack from the Self-destructive Array.

210
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,080
Now their injuries are too severe,

211
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,870
and there's no saving them.

212
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,360
At this point,

213
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,440
it's merely their last spark of life.

214
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,030
Let the remaining time

215
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,840
be spent with their family.

216
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,120
Jiang Li has already been captured.

217
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,600
Let's go question him.

218
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,910
Father.

219
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,080
Sheng...

220
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
If not for saving me,

221
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,670
you wouldn't be this badly hurt.

222
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,360
It's all my fault.

223
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,270
If only I had trained harder,

224
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,790
become stronger in my spiritual power.

225
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,240
If only I had realized

226
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,600
Jiang Li's true identity earlier...

227
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,240
Foolish child,

228
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,960
this isn't your fault,

229
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,840
and you shouldn't blame yourself.

230
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,000
You've always been

231
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,150
a kind and upright child

232
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,510
since you were young,

233
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,150
always optimistic and open-minded.

234
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,840
So this time,

235
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,550
don't blame Cangli either.

236
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,480
Don't let hatred consume you.

237
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,440
It's just that...

238
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,270
the road ahead...

239
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,120
might truly...

240
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,360
be one you'll have to walk alone.

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,670
I hope

242
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,150
that you can still live

243
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,120
as happily and cheerfully

244
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,150
as before.

245
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,600
From now on,

246
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,510
we won't push you

247
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,150
to fight for the Alliance Leader's position anymore.

248
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,550
Forget about it.

249
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,440
Sheng,

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
just live...

251
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,630
according to your own wishes.

252
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,120
No, Mother...

253
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,670
I want to be with you both!

254
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,080
Mother...

255
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,670
Sheng...

256
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,440
I don't want that...

257
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,200
Don't be like this.

258
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,720
If you act this way,

259
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,910
your father and I won't rest easy.

260
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,390
I don't want that...

261
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,030
Sheng...

262
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,030
Sheng...

263
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,750
No...

264
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,870
No...

265
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,840
Sheng...

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,320
You've grown up...

267
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,840
Your father and I...

268
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,320
I don't want that...

269
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,600
... don't want you

270
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,630
to see us slowly dying...

271
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,200
Be obedient.

272
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,200
Go out now,

273
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,670
alright?

274
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,080
Lansheng,

275
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,630
just think of it...

276
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,630
as your mother and I going on a long journey.

277
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,630
I've never...

278
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,440
taken your mother on a trip before.

279
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,080
Good boy,

280
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,960
no matter how far apart we are,

281
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,720
we will always be here

282
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,910
if you need us.

283
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,150
Your father and I have lived with dignity all our lives.

284
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,000
At the very end...

285
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,910
let us leave...

286
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,240
with the same dignity.

287
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,200
Sheng,

288
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,360
don't make it hard for us

289
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,720
to leave in peace.

290
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,840
Be good.

291
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,360
Father...

292
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,510
Mother...

293
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,840
Come.

294
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:26,910
Goodbye.

295
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,240
Goodbye.

296
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,400
Just sitting here waiting to die

297
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,830
is so boring.

298
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,350
Why don't we...

299
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,000
why don't we...

300
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,000
do something?

301
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,830
Right... right now?

302
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,110
After all these years,

303
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,720
this is the first time I'm doing your hair.

304
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,880
And you dare to say that?

305
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,790
I was afraid you'd scold me if it wasn't done well.

306
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,070
Yuanting,

307
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,640
am I getting old?

308
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,920
Look,

309
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,400
I'm growing white hair.

310
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,640
No! Don't pluck it!

311
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,000
It'll grow back even more.

312
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,920
Let me hide it for you.

313
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,400
See?

314
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,880
You still look as youthful as ever.

315
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,920
In the blink of an eye,

316
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,640
a whole lifetime has passed.

317
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,160
I still remember the first time

318
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,590
the elder brought me to meet you.

319
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,590
It feels just like yesterday.

320
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,270
I knew you had great taste.

321
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,310
You must have chosen me for my looks,

322
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,830
and that's why

323
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,640
you didn't hesitate to marry me.

324
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,590
Isn't that right?

325
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,640
Actually, I saw you long before that.

326
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,750
I secretly went

327
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,510
to the Jade Sky Palace

328
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
to watch your contest.

329
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,830
During that match,

330
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,830
your senior brothers, junior brothers,

331
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,030
senior sisters, and junior sisters...

332
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,400
every one of them

333
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,590
defeated you.

334
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,310
You lost so badly.

335
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,110
It was so embarrassing.

336
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,720
But you finally chose me.

337
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,640
You really do judge people by their looks.

338
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,000
I was just curious...

339
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,720
how could someone

340
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,070
lose so miserably

341
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,830
and still smile so happily?

342
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,110
It was truly admirable.

343
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
I thought,

344
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
if I could spend my life with someone

345
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,000
as optimistic and cheerful as you,

346
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,880
how wonderful it would be.

347
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,030
Over the years,

348
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,200
we've quarreled and argued.

349
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,240
Most of the time,

350
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,400
it was you putting up with my bad temper.

351
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,510
If it had been someone else,

352
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,720
they would've walked away long ago.

353
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,240
Yuanting,

354
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
marrying you

355
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,350
was my greatest blessing.

356
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,000
No,

357
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,310
marrying you

358
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,200
was the luckiest moment of my life.

359
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,400
People say,

360
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
I married you,

361
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,030
the lioness of Hedong,

362
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,160
for political gain and alliance.

363
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,310
What nonsense!

364
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,640
They don't see how good you are.

365
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,790
Every time we're out,

366
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,030
you always protect me,

367
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,480
your useless husband,

368
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,350
and plan carefully for our child's future.

369
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,030
You are a woman

370
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,200
who dares to love, dares to hate,

371
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,340
and never cares

372
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,070
about others' opinions.

373
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,310
The more time I spend with you,

374
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,750
the more I respect you,

375
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,510
and the more I love you.

376
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,680
Sleep well.

377
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,960
Why don't you kill me?

378
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,030
If it weren't for Mr. Xie's orders,

379
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,830
I would've killed you long ago

380
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,640
to avenge my fallen people.

381
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,350
Mr. Xie.

382
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,310
We'd like to speak to him privately.

383
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,110
Understood.

384
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,550
I believe everything you've done

385
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,960
is for the Spirit Clan and Bao.

386
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,070
But why do you obey He Xianwo

387
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,720
and willingly let him use you?

388
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,400
Is Bao safe?

389
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,960
In this battle,

390
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,160
both the Humans and Spirits suffered heavy losses.

391
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,350
So many innocent lives were lost

392
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,160
in a single moment.

393
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,640
You and the Jade Sky Palace

394
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,920
shared a deep connection,

395
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,750
yet you turned on your clan,

396
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160
family against family.

397
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,920
Is this truly the outcome you desired?

398
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,480
Or...

399
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,920
do you really believe

400
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,680
He Xianwo's path is the right one?

401
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,200
He didn't manipulate me.

402
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,750
Everything I've done

403
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,720
was of my own will.

404
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,960
Why do you trust him so much?

405
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
After Xiu and I got married,

406
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,790
we had Bao.

407
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,830
I couldn't bear to see the two of them

408
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,550
fall into slavery.

409
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,830
So,

410
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,830
I decided to kill all the liars

411
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,030
in the Immortal Alliance

412
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,680
and free the Spirit Clan.

413
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,790
That day,

414
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,000
I followed a ship

415
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,070
full of spirit slaves

416
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,350
to the Osprey Island.

417
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,960
I wanted to kill their leader

418
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,030
and rescue the slaves.

419
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,790
But his cultivation was far superior,

420
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,920
and he captured me.

421
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,720
I thought I was doomed,

422
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,510
but...

423
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,640
he didn't kill me.

424
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,200
Leave.

425
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,310
Why don't you kill me?

426
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,880
I'll give you three chances

427
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,270
to kill me.

428
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
I didn't know

429
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,070
what his true intentions were,

430
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,640
but I had a feeling

431
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,400
he was different from other cultivators.

432
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,050
So, I followed him. -Greetings, Sir!

433
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,350
I wanted to see what he was planning.

434
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,070
Alright...

435
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,790
- Everyone, take a seat! -He kept his word.

436
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,880
- Have a seat. - He didn't make things hard for me.

437
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,370
Greetings, Sir!

438
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,270
He allowed me to explore freely on the island.

439
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,070
I followed him to a teahouse.

440
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,070
Thank you.

441
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,400
I discovered that inside...

442
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:15,920
Alright.

443
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,440
... everyone was from the Spirit Clan,

444
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,440
even including

445
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,830
the slaves I wanted to rescue.

446
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,720
They laughed,

447
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,960
offered gifts...

448
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,920
Here're some eggs for you.

449
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,920
Do you know?

450
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,110
Their respect and gratitude for He Xianwo

451
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,240
were genuine.

452
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,830
It turns out

453
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,130
He Xianwo bought that ship of spirit slaves

454
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,480
- Here're some foreign fruits. - to bring them

455
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,830
to the Osprey Island to settle down.

456
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,660
Sir,

457
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,030
- here are some vegetables. - He Xianwo...

458
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:37,650
Please accept them.

459
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,160
... is someone who truly treats

460
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,550
both Humans and Spirits equally.

461
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,790
I realized I had misunderstood him,

462
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,960
so I gave up my plan to murder him.

463
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,000
[Yinran Teahouse]
At that time, all I wanted was to go home.

464
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,750
But his men wouldn't let me leave the island.

465
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,400
It was then

466
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,550
I understood

467
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,590
he was serious

468
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,000
about the three murder attempts.

469
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,750
Your second attempt

470
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,680
also failed.

471
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,720
I misunderstood you.

472
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,750
I'll leave the Osprey Island.

473
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,830
It's fine.

474
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,510
You still have a third chance.

475
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,510
But I no longer want to kill you.

476
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,720
All must

477
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
pay the price

478
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,830
for their mistakes.

479
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,680
I had no choice

480
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,480
but to try murdering him again.

481
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,510
We have no ill will between us.

482
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,830
If you want to kill me, then do it.

483
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,160
Why torment me?

484
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,830
I never intended to kill you.

485
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,200
On the contrary,

486
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,270
I want to help you.

487
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,590
Help me?

488
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,920
You're clearly humiliating me!

489
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,920
You don't even know what I want,

490
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,550
so how can you help me?

491
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,270
Your real name is Fu Cangli.

492
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,440
Your father was the master of the Jade Sky Palace,

493
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,240
Fu Yuanting's elder brother.

494
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,440
Over a struggle for power,

495
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,160
your father was killed.

496
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,510
Your mother fled with you,

497
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,550
giving you a new name:

498
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,350
Jiang Li.

499
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,270
Later,

500
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,110
you married a treasure sniffer,

501
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,680
and had a daughter with her.

502
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,920
Your daughter

503
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,200
is named Bao.

504
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,550
How do you know all this?

505
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,440
Who exactly are you?

506
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,920
These past few days, you've followed me

507
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,750
all over the Osprey Island.

508
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,310
Well,

509
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,720
what do you think?

510
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,590
This place is wonderful.

511
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,640
Humans and Spirits coexist equally.

512
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,070
But ultimately, it's not my home.

513
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,920
I won't stay here.

514
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,480
What if I told you

515
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,270
I could make the whole world

516
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,350
like this Osprey Island?

517
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
You want to help the Spirit Clan?

518
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,880
But you're Human.

519
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Why are you doing this?

520
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,510
You're Human too.

521
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,880
But my family is from the Spirit Clan.

522
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,030
All beings should be equal,

523
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,790
but Humans,

524
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,270
just because they've unlocked spiritual channels,

525
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,960
think they can enslave

526
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
and oppress other beings.

527
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,110
This is wrong,

528
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,440
and it must be corrected.

529
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,590
We must also pay the price

530
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,680
for this mistake.

531
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,550
Even if that's what you believe,

532
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,110
how can the Osprey Island alone

533
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,270
stand against the Immortal Alliance?

534
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,270
Why not?

535
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,830
I've seen the Spirit warriors he's secretly training.

536
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,750
Why would that convince you?

537
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,960
Why not?

538
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,720
At that time,

539
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,310
he had already proven

540
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,310
that he would treat the Spirit Clan well.

541
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,510
I didn't care

542
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,070
what his ultimate goal was.

543
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,160
All that mattered to me

544
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,510
was Bao and Xiu.

545
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,350
For them,

546
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
I'm willing to do anything.

547
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,350
Don't use me as an excuse!

548
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,310
Bao...

549
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,520
I hate war.

550
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,810
I hate you hurting my brothers and sisters!

551
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,590
I like them.

552
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,880
Without them,

553
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,110
you wouldn't even see me alive now!

554
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,350
Bao...

555
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,370
Master Fu is dead.

556
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,620
Elder Duan is dead too!

557
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,860
Lansheng has lost his parents...

558
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,000
Is the freedom you speak of

559
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,270
just endless bloodshed

560
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,160
between the Humans and Spirits?

561
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,830
Bao likes the Humans

562
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,590
and gets along well with them.

563
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,830
But everything you're doing now

564
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,260
is pushing Bao

565
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,440
into the abyss of hatred.

566
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,790
In truth, deep down,

567
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,750
you don't care about me or Mother at all!

568
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,880
You've been out so long,

569
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,830
but all you did was kill!

570
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,110
Xuanling...

571
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,160
Bao...

572
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,200
I let you down.

573
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,720
I made you suffer.

574
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,750
But you must believe...

575
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,640
I've missed you every single day.

576
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,440
and your mother.

577
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,440
Every moment, I've longed to reunite with you.

578
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,030
It's all because I'm useless.

579
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,030
I'm useless.

580
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,350
I...

581
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,550
I just wanted to create

582
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,400
a fair and just world

583
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
for you

584
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,720
and your mother.

585
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,270
I admit,

586
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,110
the Immortal Alliance was indeed too extreme before.

587
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,070
Jiang Li,

588
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,880
if you trust me,

589
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,960
I swear here and now,

590
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,160
from this day forward,

591
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,700
no cultivator in the Immortal Alliance

592
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,720
will ever keep spirit slaves again.

593
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,920
Humans and Spirits will be treated as equals.

594
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,590
If you truly want fairness and justice,

595
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,550
if you want peace between the two clans,

596
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,270
then tell me,

597
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,030
what exactly is He Xianwo planning?

598
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,830
I don't know his full plan,

599
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,640
but I can tell you

600
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,160
he wants to use the power of chaos

601
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,590
to open the Celestial Ladder

602
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,070
and ascend to the Divine Realm.

603
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,920
Does he wish to become a deity?

604
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,590
I don't know.

605
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,200
He Xianwo has been incredibly kind to me.

606
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,510
I can't bring myself to stop him.

607
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,790
Thank you for saving my life.

608
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,720
I've seen how you treat Bao

609
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
and Miss Mu

610
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,680
as equals.

611
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,110
I trust you,

612
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,350
but I can't trust anyone else.

613
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,920
I don't believe

614
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,270
the centuries of conflict

615
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,610
between Humans and Spirits

616
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,030
can be easily resolved.

617
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,590
This is all I can tell you.

618
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,790
Besides,

619
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,000
I truly don't know where he is.

620
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,550
Sealing the Dark Abyss,

621
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
fighting the Fallen Deity,

622
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,510
and aiding the Immortal Alliance...

623
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
you haven't stopped for a moment.

624
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,510
Xie Xuechen,

625
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,150
aren't you exhausted?

626
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,280
All this way,

627
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,070
you've stayed by my side.

628
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,400
Aren't you tired?

629
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,920
Of course I'm tired,

630
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,630
but I chose you, didn't I?

631
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,280
No matter how tough or dangerous it gets,

632
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,320
you can't abandon me.

633
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,550
The Fallen Deity under the Lava is awakening.

634
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,190
I don't know if what he said

635
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:46,960
is true or false.

636
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,280
Regardless,

637
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,760
Xie Xuechen,

638
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,590
you must know...

639
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,880
that whether it's Big Brother

640
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,840
or that Fallen Deity,

641
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,630
neither of them is you.

642
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,400
In my heart,

643
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,320
you're not anyone's shadow or substitute.

644
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,110
You're the one and only Xie Xuechen...

645
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,760
and my Xie Xuechen.

646
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,920
It seems

647
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,150
like the situation is temporarily resolved,

648
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,400
but the problem remains.

649
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,800
The seal on the Dark Abyss is only temporary.

650
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,920
As long as the inner demons persist,

651
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,960
it's only a matter of time before the Dark Clan breaks free.

652
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,400
And He Xianwo...

653
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,550
No one knows his intention

654
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:49,800
or he's whereabouts.

655
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,480
He's plotted for years.

656
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,710
He must have a purpose.

657
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,400
There's no way

658
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,550
he would abandon everything without reason.

659
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,480
Mr. Xie!

660
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,440
Why are you in such a rush?

661
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,670
What's happened?

662
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,000
Qiumin has disappeared.

663
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,190
Disappeared?

664
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,590
What happened?

665
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,960
News came from the Mirage Palace

666
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,030
saying Qiumin took her people

667
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,440
to clear the battlefield and then disappeared.

668
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,190
Where could she have gone?

669
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,760
Could something have happened to her?

670
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,800
Miss Gao, you're awake.

671
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,230
This is today's new tea.

672
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,230
Come have a taste.

673
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,030
Why am I here?

674
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,760
That day at the Starfall Valley,

675
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,510
only five people remained finally.

676
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,000
Apart from the late Sang Qi

677
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,000
and Madam Su,

678
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,190
the others

679
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,710
were Xuechen,

680
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,800
Miss Mu,

681
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,110
and you.

682
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,070
In this great battle,

683
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,030
He Xianwo vanished without a trace.

684
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,880
But he has always desired the Chaos Pearl.

685
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,360
He will undoubtedly hunt down those who know about it.

686
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,230
And you

687
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,550
are one of them.

688
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,320
That's why Xuechen

689
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,190
entrusted me to secretly protect you here.

690
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,360
What's the situation

691
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,630
outside now?

692
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,320
Has the Immortal Alliance defeated the Spirit Clan?

693
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,710
The Dark Clan has joined the battle.

694
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,710
The tide has turned.

695
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,480
The Humans are in defeat,

696
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,150
suffering countless losses.

697
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,880
Right now,

698
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,550
the Chaos Pearl is urgently needed.

699
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,410
We must use its power

700
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,510
to rebuild the Immortals Array.

701
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,320
Xie Xuechen will safeguard the Chaos Pearl.

702
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,710
How to use it

703
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,000
is his decision to make.

704
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,070
Mr. Nan,

705
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,320
please take me back to the Mirage City immediately.

706
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
I can't just stand by and watch the Dark Clan

707
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,320
slaughter the human world.

708
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,070
So, you're saying...

709
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,280
the Chaos Pearl...

710
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,400
is in Xie Xuechen's hands?

711
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,970
I honestly don't know

712
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:11,840
who has the Chaos Pearl.

713
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,740
You and Xie Xuechen

714
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,840
are close friends.

715
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,110
Shouldn't you

716
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,710
be asking him instead?

717
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,550
But what if...

718
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,320
I insist on hearing it

719
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,150
from you?

720
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,550
Mr. Nan,

721
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,440
what are you trying to do?

722
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,760
Are you afraid, Miss Gao?

723
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,960
What is there for me to fear?

724
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,280
Could it be

725
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,190
you plan to harm me?

726
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,070
You're joking.

727
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,110
I simply wish

728
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,400
to invite you to admire a painting.

729
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,400
This painting of rivers and mountains

730
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,150
was casually created by me.

731
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,400
It features

732
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,800
mountains, rivers,

733
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,480
flowers, and birds...

734
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,360
But it always feels like it's missing some soul.

735
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,550
I'm uneducated and know nothing

736
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,440
about appreciating paintings.

737
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,550
I'll head back to the Mirage Palace now.

738
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,510
Nan Xuyue, what are you trying to do?

739
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,550
You seem rather anxious.

740
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,840
Why not take another nap?

741
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,070
Within the fan's realm,

742
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,190
as a figure in the painting,

743
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,710
this landscape and world

744
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,030
are yours alone to enjoy.

745
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,360
That should satisfy you.

746
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,110
Mr. Nan,

747
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,710
you seem rather unkind to a beauty.

748
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,320
You overheard earlier.

749
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,110
The Chaos Pearl is in Xie Xuechen's hands.

750
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,630
But I'm curious.

751
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,670
Sang Qi and Gao Qiumin

752
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,150
stood on completely opposite sides,

753
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,710
even as enemies.

754
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,550
Yet they both tacitly remained silent.

755
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,000
What exactly are they protecting?

756
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,320
Is it the Chaos Pearl

757
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,480
or someone else?

758
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,150
Or could it be

759
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,800
that the Chaos Pearl is this person?

760
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,760
He Xianwo,

761
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,440
give up your thoughts.

762
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,670
I've told you,

763
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,000
if you dare harm her,

764
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,360
I'll destroy you.

765
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,230
Don't you wish to visit

766
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,230
the land of dreams?

767
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,590
Between the one before me

768
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,150
and the dreamland,

769
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,590
if I cannot have both,

770
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,840
I'll protect the former.

771
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,960
Even if the one before you

772
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,510
constantly disregards your feelings

773
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,840
for Xie Xuechen's sake,

774
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,150
and even blocks your plans?

775
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:15,670
Indeed,

776
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,630
it is excellent tea.

777
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,110
The Chaos Pearl is the key to opening the Celestial Ladder.

778
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,840
As long as the ladder is repaired,

779
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,070
I can spare her life in the end.

780
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,630
But Mr. Nan,

781
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,710
don't tell me

782
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,320
you can't bear to harm her even a little?

783
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,510
What if I truly cannot bear it?

784
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,150
Then why won't you kill Xie Xuechen?

785
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,190
I've told you long ago,

786
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,510
Xie Xuechen's existence is a threat.

787
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,110
Not just to you and me,

788
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,840
but also to Mu Xuanling.

789
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,760
As long as Xie Xuechen lives,

790
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,030
Mu Xuanling will continue

791
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,960
to risk her life by his side,

792
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,670
and one day, she might die.

793
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,190
If you wish to protect Mu Xuanling,

794
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,400
why not join me

795
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,000
and kill Xie Xuechen?

796
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,030
Are you saying

797
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,440
Qiumin's disappearance

798
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,920
is related to He Xianwo?

799
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,920
Issue an Alliance Leader's decree.

800
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,590
The entire Immortal Alliance is to hunt down He Xianwo.

801
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,630
Not just a bounty,

802
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,070
I'll provide a reward of ten thousand gold.

803
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:36,590
No,

804
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,110
no matter how much gold,

805
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,960
I will find Qiumin.

806
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,800
She'll be alright.

807
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,000
Don't lose your focus.

808
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,480
Lose my focus?

809
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,590
What's my relationship with Gao Qiumin?

810
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,230
I hate her the most.

811
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,190
She better be in trouble.

812
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:03,550
Is that so?

813
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,110
Of course.

814
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,230
You don't truly hate her,

815
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,320
do you?

816
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Who really holds

817
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,590
onto childhood grudges for life?

818
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,840
Too many have already fallen

819
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,670
in this battle.

820
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,030
As for Gao Qiumin,

821
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,590
I won't allow her to die.
