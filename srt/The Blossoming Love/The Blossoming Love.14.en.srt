Thank you, Mr. Xie.

Mr. Xie,

there's one last thing.

All right.

28
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,400
I told you

29
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,030
to put on more layers

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,240
in this cold weather.

31

Why didn't you listen?

32

Master,

33
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,840
have you made up your mind?

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,870
I am different from the others.

35
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,470
I wasn't possessed by a Dark Clan member.

36
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,120
Nor was I coerced by anyone.

37

Every choice I made

38
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,470
was of my own will.

It's only right for me

40
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,710
to take responsibility for it.

41
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,030
Master, you once said I had no attachments,

42
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,470
but now I realize

43
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,360
that isn't true.

158
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,270
My brother did it.

159
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,870
He colluded with evil cultivators

160
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,550
and kidnapped me,

161
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,720
disguised as a Dark Clan member.

162

Xingye,

163
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,840
you're also my son,

164
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,510
but since you harmed your own elder brother,

165
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,080
I have

166
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,270
no choice but to do this!

167
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,240
I did conspire with others

168
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,550
to destroy his three apertures

169
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,750
and cripple his legs.

170
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,120
But what's so wrong with that?

171
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,510
If I hadn't,

172
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,240
would you have even noticed me?

173
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,270
Enough!

174
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,120
You ungrateful brat,

175
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,840
I'll kill you!

176
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,720
I told Xingye to do all this!

177
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,000
Nan Xuyue's three apertures have all been destroyed.

178
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,240
He's no longer capable of cultivation.

179
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,870
But Xingye is already at the Golden Core stage.

180
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,840
He has a chance to reach the Spiritual Form stage.

181
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,510
Are you sure you want to ruin

182
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,480
Greenview Heights' last hope for a cripple?

183
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,130
I'll atone for the sins with my life.

184
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,330
If you want to kill anyone, kill me!

185
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:54,960
Get out of my way!

186
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,460
I'll kill you!

187
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,120
Mother!

188
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,750
She took the fall for Nan Xingye,

189
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,320
bearing all the blame.

190
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,610
To this day, I still can't forget

191
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,270
the way she looked just before she died.

192
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,440
Mother!

193
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,120
She almost seemed content,

194
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,440
thinking her life was a small price to pay

195
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,390
for her son to get everything.

196
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,840
And she believed that was worth it.

197
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,360
At first, I was angry

198
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,790
at my father's favoritism and injustice,

199
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,390
but at that moment,

200
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,030
all I felt was envy.

201
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,270
I envied that my brother had someone

202
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,960
who loved him so much

203
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,120
they would gladly die for him,

204
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,550
while I was destined

205
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,320
never to meet anyone like that.

206
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,000
But then I met you.

207
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,960
You promised

208
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,270
to give me a little bit of affection.

209
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,480
Give me some

210
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,870
of your candy,

211
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,120
and I'll give you a little bit

212
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,440
of my affection.

213
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
That was just

214
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,240
an unintentional remark.

215
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,390
I know.

216
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,320
But then we met again years later,

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,360
and I saw how much you

218
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,630
loved and sacrificed for Xie Xuechen.

219
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,840
That made me realize

220
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,550
what I'd missed.

221
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,870
Nan Xuyue,

222
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,750
are you

223
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,320
in love with me or something?

224
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,270
I'm not sure either.

225
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,360
I don't know if I'm in love

226
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,030
with you

227
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,840
or if I'm just moved

228
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,510
by how devotedly

229
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,150
you love someone.

230
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,270
So, I think I should leave.

231
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,390
I should distance myself from both you and him

232
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,120
and figure out

233
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,270
how I really feel.

234
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,240
He...

235
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,000
You...

236
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,960
Let's take a walk.

237
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,480
I...

238
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,080
You...

239
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,720
Why am I feeling guilty?

240
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,720
How much did you hear?

241
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,440
Not much.

242
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,510
I arrived when you said you were in love.

243
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,390
What's that look supposed to mean?

244
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,670
Indifference

245
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,910
or anger?

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,870
Why didn't you tell me?

247
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,550
I haven't figured it out myself.

248
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,910
How could I tell you?

249
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,600
Or should I tell you

250
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,870
that I love

251
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,390
the way she loves you?

252
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,240
Wouldn't that sound strange?

253
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,240
So, I thought I should

254
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,750
step back a bit and figure things out.

255
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,000
And then what?

256
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,600
The Xie Xuechen I know

257
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,510
rarely presses others for answers.

258
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,870
Are you scared?

259
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,030
No.

260
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,150
She's crazy about you.

261
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,240
There's nothing to worry about.

262
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,550
I'll be

263
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,510
heading back to Greenview Heights soon.

264
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,550
Don't bother seeing me off.

265
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,550
By the way,

266
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,880
you'd better act fast

267
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,920
so I can stop holding onto any hope.

268
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,350
That way, nothing will change.

269
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,270
Goodbye.

[Swirling Snow Pavilion]

271
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,350
How did the conversation go?

272
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,880
Nan Xuyue's confession

273
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,480
came as a surprise to me too.

274
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,310
Are you upset?

275
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,270
No.

276
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,510
Then are we still going down the mountain today?

277
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,350
Of course we are.

278
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,350
Why wouldn't we?

279
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,440
And you said you weren't mad?

280
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,310
The Xie Xuechen I know

281
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,110
wouldn't talk like this.

282
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
If you don't want to go, then forget it.

283
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,680
I'm going!

284
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,110
I'll go even if knives are falling from the sky!

285
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,830
Are you really just walking me down the mountain like this?

286
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,510
If we get spotted,

287
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
you might get into trouble.

288
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,480
Madam Su

289
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,830
is already displeased

290
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,200
that you didn't kill me.

291
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,680
Now that my demonic power is gone,

This cliff is so high.

294
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,750
It actually makes me a bit scared.

295
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,070
But, Xie Xuechen,

296
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,510
I've thought

297
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,920
of a brilliant way to avoid being seen.

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,750
You...!

299
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,500
How's that?

300
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,720
Doesn't look like anyone saw us, right?

301
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,440
If you ever do that again, I won't catch you.

302
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,440
I just didn't want to make things harder for you.

303
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,350
A lot of people in the city know you.

304
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,680
But tonight, it's supposed to be just our time.

305
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,070
I don't want anyone disturbing us.

306
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,030
There.

307
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,310
Now, no one

308
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,160
will recognize you.

309
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,720
Let's go.

Yes!

319
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,750
- Yes! - Yes!

The knives landed perfectly around him!

324
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,030
Now, let's see if I can throw two at once!

325
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,880
It's just a trick. I can do it too.

326
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,070
Do you know that stealing the spotlight in the human realm

327
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,160
can get you beaten up?

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,830
How would you know?

329
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,160

330
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,030

You? Beaten?

Amazing!

the first snack he bought me

360
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,680
was a pastry.

00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,720
even nonsense

380
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,310
has a good chance of coming true eventually.

381
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,310
But we mortals

382
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,550
only have a few decades to live.

383
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,160
We don't have that kind of time.

384
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,000
If my predictions were wrong,

385
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,750
my stall

386
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,240
would be smashed within a month.

387
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,640
That makes sense.

388
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,590
Take, for example,

389
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,720
the legendary Greenview Heights.

390
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,510
They say the master there

391
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,160
could predict the fate

392
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,680
of all living beings.

393
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,200
Do you believe that?

394
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,000
It's nonsense.

395
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,350
If he'd truly been that powerful,

396
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,750
the Spirit Clan

397
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,240
wouldn't have been able

398
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,680
to massacre

399
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,030
Greenview Heights.

400
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,070
Miss,

401
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,480
what would you like to know?

402
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,680
My love life.

403
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,400
What are your Four Pillars of Destiny?

404
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,920
Four Pillars?

405
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't know.

406
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,510
All right then.

407
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,240
Miss,

408
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,240
toss these coins onto the table,

409
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,680
and I'll interpret the reading for you.

410
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,830
Miss,

411
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,480
you're currently caught

412
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,750
in a complicated relationship.

413
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,000
That's true.

414
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,310
So, do you think

415
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,830
this relationship will change?

416
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,350
It's hopeless.

417
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,030
Miss,

418
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,780
this relationship of yours

419
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,030
has hit a dead end.

420
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,440
I don't think it's going to work out.

421
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,750
But as the saying goes,

422
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,110
out with the old, in with the new.

423
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,200
How about this?

424
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,310
For a few more coins,

425
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,240
I can tell you about your next relationship.

426
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,510
Nonsense!

427
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,400
You're just making things up.

428
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,070
I'm not waiting until next month.

429
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,030
I'll smash your stall right now!

430
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:21,880
You...!

431
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,070
My apologies.

432
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,030
I can explain.

433
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,550
Tell me,

434
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,070
why did you try to smash his stall?

435
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,510
I didn't like his predictions.

436
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,000
He's just an ordinary man.

437
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,350
I'm ordinary too.

438
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,750
He and I

439
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,070
are evenly matched.

440
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,830
Even without your demonic power, you still can't behave.

441
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,110
That's just who I am.

442
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,920
Even 1,000 years wouldn't

443
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,270
be enough to teach me restraint.

444
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,110
So,

445
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,030
you'd better keep a close eye on me.

446
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,640
Do you like it?

447
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,170
No.

448
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,550
Really?

449
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,030
Just kidding.

450
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,680
What would you two like to eat?

451
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,510
Two bowls of plain noodles.

452
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,550
Got it.

453
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,270
Please wait a moment.

454
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:17,960
Thank you.

455
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,830
You seem familiar with this noodle stall.

456
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,960
Do you come here often?

457
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,590
I used to.

458
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,110
But it seems

459
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
the owner has changed.

460
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,440
Here, two bowls of plain noodles.

461
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,480
Thank you.

462
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,350
Thank you, miss, for helping my father the other day.

463
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,480
These noodles

464
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,790
are on me.

465
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,640
Your father?

466
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,480
Do you remember helping

467
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,030
an elderly man on the street

468
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,030
a few days ago,

469
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,680
who was sick

470
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,030
and had his money stolen?

471
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,310
Help! My money is stolen!

472
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,240
You should be glad we're in the human world.

473
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,160
Otherwise, you'd be dead now.

474
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,350
Please spare me!

475
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,480
Scram.

476
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,980
Thank you so much.

477
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,030
Sir,

478
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,220
why are you out

479
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,270
buying medicine alone at your age?

480
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,200
Don't you have family?

481
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,200
I do have a son.

482
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,510
How unfilial.

483
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,000
Miss,

484
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,350
it's not like that.

485
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,240
I've been sick for years,

486
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,440
and we've drained all our savings.

487
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,880
My son works day and night running a noodle stall

488
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,550
to pay for my medicine.

489
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,200
I didn't want to trouble him any further,

490
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,440
so I came out to buy medicine myself.

491
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,960
You're safe now.

492
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,030
That elderly man

493
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,490
is your father?

494
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,640
That's right.

495
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,960
When he came back,

496
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,070
he told me about how you

497
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,000
helped him.

498
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,440
He remembered it all.

499
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,920
Your clothes, demeanor,

500
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,590
age, and looks.

501
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,070
On behalf of my father,

502
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,400
thank you again, miss.

503
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,680
It's nothing.

504
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,680
After hearing

505
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,240
about my father's encounter,

506
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,350
my daughter said she also wanted to be a heroine

507
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,310
like you someday.

508
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:00,830
Feng,

509
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,640
come here.

510
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,350
She's too shy

511
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,790
to come greet you.

512
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,550
Miss,

513
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,400
you and your...

514
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,400
He's my husband.

515
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,800
You and your husband

516
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,750
are always welcome here.

517
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,310
Whatever you order,

518
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,160
it's on the house.

519
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,550
In that case,

520
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,820
we won't turn down your kindness.

521
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,550
No problem.

522
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,510
Enjoy your meal.

523
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,200
Let's eat.

524
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,310
Thanks to you,

525
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,000
we're getting free noodles tonight.

526
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,030
Xie Xuechen,

527
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,200
I think I saw

528
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,200
what the human world is really like tonight.

529
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,030
It's not perfect,

530
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,350
but it's

531
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,030
not that bad either.

532
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,350
Feng,

533
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,310
look, fireworks!

534
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,030
The last time I saw fireworks

535
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,480
was ten years ago.

536
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,400
Does that man really mean

537
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,400
that much to you?

538
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,110
I mean your "Mister."

539
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,680
Yes,

540
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,030
he does.

541
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,200
Then are you sure

542
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,680
you can tell him and me apart?

543
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,030
I have a simple

544
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,350
yet accurate way to tell.

545
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,160
Do you want to know?

546
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,440
Come closer.

547
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,310
I'll tell you.

548
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,550
I don't have impure thoughts about Mister,

549
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,490
but I do about you.

550
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,740
♪Like passing through the snowfalls of ten thousand years♪

551
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,300
♪I lift my gaze for a moment, your eyes shine like rivers of light♪

552
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,620
♪It feels as though we loved in a past life♪

553
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,300
♪If not♪

554
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,220
♪Why do our gazes recognize each other?♪

555
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,350
The human world is lively,

556
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,480
but the people there go to bed rather early.

557
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,920
Is midnight still early for you?

558
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,590
It's just such a pity.

559
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,960
What do you mean?

560
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,720
The journey is over.

561
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,750
The prisoner of Snow City

562
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,200
should return to her ice prison.

563
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,680
You don't have to go back.

564
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,920
Then where should I go?

565
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,830
I can't keep staying

566
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,640
at the Swirling Snow Pavilion, can I?

567
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,750
I'll arrange a place for you to stay.

568
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,550
Honestly,

569
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,440
it doesn't matter where I stay.

570
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,200
I don't care.

571
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,440
What matters is

572
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,000
what you see me as

573
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,000
if I stay.

574
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,300
♪Because our hands remain entwined♪

575
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,340
♪Because you've stayed the same...♪

576
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,550
I'm content that I

577
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,550
got to spend half a day with you.

578
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,030
But what I really want

579
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,070
is for you to give me an answer soon.

580
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,750
What exactly am I to you?

581
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,540
♪You make my heart bloom with thousands of peach blossoms♪

582
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,980
♪Through life's highs and lows, my smile stays true...♪

583
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,350
Goodbye.

584
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,740
♪Because you've stayed the same♪

585
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,500
♪The brilliance endures♪

586
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,860
♪Because our hands remain entwined♪

587
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,420
♪Because you've stayed the same♪

588
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,340
♪Being my rock, as always♪

589
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,240
You're so distracted

590
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,030
that you didn't even notice me approaching.

591
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,750
If you have something to say, Elder, say it.

592
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,440
Xuechen,

593
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,960
I've watched you

594
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,350
grow up.

595
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,790
Don't lie to me.

596
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,480
You treat

597
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,240
Mu Xuanling very differently.

598
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,750
Look at Snow City.

599
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:47,920
It seems

600
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,640
peaceful and serene at night,

601
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,960
but you know better than anyone

602
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,160
how much turbulence lies beneath.

603
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,000
It's your responsibility to protect

604
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,480
the people of Snow City.

605
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,920
One day, you'll also need to protect the Immortal Alliance

606
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,920
and the Humans.

607
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,200
You should know

608
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,960
better than me if Mu Xuanling can outweigh

609
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,030
your responsibilities

610
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,000
as the Lord of Snow City.

611
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,510
But she's never

612
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,200
done anything wrong.

613
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,440
She's even been helping me all along.

614
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,240
Elder,

615
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,400
do I really have to choose

616
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,480
between the world and her?

617
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,880
If it weren't Mu Xuanling,

618
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,590
but my father,

619
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,790
you,

620
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,720
the other disciples of Snow City,

621
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,830
or the common people down there,

622
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,510
would I still be expected

623
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,000
to abandon them in a time of crisis?

624
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,550
If one person

625
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,750
is as innocent

626
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,880
as the other 100

627
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,160
or 10,000 people,

628
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,070
how do we measure the value of a life?

629
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,510
Does sacrificing the few

630
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,790
to save the many

631
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,000
truly count as righteousness?

632
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,110
Your faith

633
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,640
is wavering.

634
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,400
Yes,

635
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,960
I have doubts.

636
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,680
The righteous path

637
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,630
has always been rugged and difficult.

638
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,360
Those who walk it must walk alone.

639
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,000
This is an ancient truth.

640
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,140
Does being ancient

641
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,030
make it right?

642
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,320
Don't worry, Elder.

643
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,880
Though I have doubts,

644
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,760
I will shoulder

645
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,550
the responsibilities I should bear.

646
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,360
The moon is high now.

647
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,600
I promised Xuan Xin

648
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,510
we'd guard the Pearl Tower together.

649
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,710
I'll head over now.

650
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,550
You...

651
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,440
Didn't you leave?

652
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,590
The human realm is truly strange.

653
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,030
You all wanted me to follow the rules,

654
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,000
but now that I have,

655
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,840
you're surprised.

656
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,320
Since you're back,

657
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,510
stay put and behave.

658
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,840
Are you leaving

659
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,510
without setting up barriers?

660
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,590
You must trust me a lot.

661
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,000
Or perhaps

662
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,000
you think I'm completely

663
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,960
useless and harmless

664
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,000
with my demonic power gone?

665
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,190
You really

666
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,880
are something else.

667
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,630
Thanks for the compliment.

668
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,880
I brought this especially for you.

669
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,110
What?

670
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,070
Your Lord paid for it,

671
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,360
so it doesn't count as a bribe.

672
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,230
Think of it as a small token of appreciation from me.

673
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,710
Thank you for taking care of me these past few days.

674
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,030
Take it,

675
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,160
Senior.

676
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,190
Well...

677
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,400
I'll take it,

678
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,360
but if you cause trouble,

679
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,360
we'll still report it.

680
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,130
Of course.

681
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,150
Let's go.

682
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,320
Goodbye, Seniors.

683
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,550
If only I could truly stay for 1,000 years.

684
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,480
But Sang Qi is after me.

685
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,760
He never gives up easily.

686
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,590
What's happening to the Sword of Vitality?

687
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,440
What's going on?

688
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,360
Could it be

689
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,880
that he's here?

690
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,760
Master,

691
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:58,840
is something wrong?

692
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:07,880
Master...

693
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,550
Stay here, all of you.

694
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,400
No one is allowed to leave.

695
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,760
- Yes, Master. - Understood.

696
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,510
When a sword shakes in its scabbard,

697
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,960
it means its master is near.

698
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,510
The Sword of Vitality was passed down to me

699
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,230
after Mother died.

700
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,670
Even Master couldn't win its acknowledgment.

701
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,880
Who could be nearby?

702
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,630
Sang Qi,

703
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,110
it really is you.

704
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,820
My sister's Sword of Vitality

705
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,880
still hasn't forgotten you.

706
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,360
Sword of Vitality?

707
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,520
Su Ningzhen?

708
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,510
Very well.

709
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,480
I'll teach you a lesson

710
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,510
and put you in your place

711
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,230
before I go take the pearl.

712
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,440
Sang Qi,

713
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,320
I'll avenge my sister.

714
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,440
Prepare to die!

715
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,670
You should've known better.

716
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,070
Although everything seems calm right now,

717
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,840
I can't shake the feeling that something's about to happen.

718
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,110
That's probably because your mind

719
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
isn't at peace to begin with.

720
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,880
Keeping a calm mind

721
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,670
isn't easy.

722
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,030
Don't worry, Mr. Xie.

723
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,440
Mr. Nan is a master of arrays.

724
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,230
Besides, you've secretly added

725
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,400
several new arrays

726
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,400
on top of the ones

727
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,400
known to the public.

728
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,440
If any Spirit Clan members infiltrate,

729
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,190
they won't be able to hide.

730
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,000
If you want to kill me, do it!

731
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,360
You have a limp?

732
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,000
Enjoying yourself

733
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,710
in the human realm, aren't you?

734
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,630
Is this how you greet your master?

735
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,320
You came after all.

736
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,400
Having spent ten years in the Dark Abyss,

737
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,760
you should know

738
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,710
what happens to traitors.

739
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,840
I considered the consequences

740
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,480
when I made my choice.

741
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,030
Of all my disciples, you were the one I was most proud of.

742
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,070
I'll give you

743
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,670
one last chance.

744
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Think carefully.

745
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,760
Will you return to the Dark Abyss with me now,

746
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,670
or

747
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,590
shall I

748
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,960
kill everyone here

749
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,760
and then take you back?

750
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,710
A Spirit clansman breached the array?

751
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,070
Why wasn't there an alarm?

752
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:12,880
Mu Xuanling!

753
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,510
Sang Qi.

754
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,030
You must be Nan Xuyue.

755
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,550
Did you set up the arrays

756
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,670
in the city?

757
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,030
Not bad.

758
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,360
I'll stay out of your plans,

759
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,070
but you must leave Mu Xuanling here.

760
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,960
I don't think

761
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,840
you can stop me.

762
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,400
Nan Xuyue!

763
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,510
Are you all right?

764
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,250
Activating the Separation Array

765
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,630
takes a bit of a toll,

766
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,150
but it won't kill me.

767
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,800
The Separation Array?

768
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,800
The fan

769
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,710
can temporarily trap Sang Qi,

770
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,590
but it's not a long-term solution.

771
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,000
Time is running out.

772
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,710
I'll set up an array immediately

773
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,230
to send you out of Snow City.

774
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,550
With Sang Qi's power,

775
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,480
he'll break free any moment.

776
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,480
Just go!

777
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,760
With your demonic power gone,

778
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,000
you're incredibly vulnerable.

779
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,960
If he takes you back to the Dark Abyss,

780
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,920
you'll either get killed

781
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,400
or face unbearable torment.

782
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,670
I'm used to it.

783
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,150
This is my destiny.

784
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,480
It has nothing to do with you,

785
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,760
and I shouldn't drag you into it.

786
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:55,960
What are you doing?

787
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,630
Let him go.

788
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:57,960
I'll return to the Dark Abyss with you.

789
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,960
Your time in the human realm

790
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,400
didn't teach you much

791
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,000
except how to become more pathetic.

792
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,510
He's not a member of the Immortal Alliance.

793
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,920
He's no threat to you.

794
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,590
Don't kill him.
