a single breath decides life and death.

You can't die.

Call upon Fate!

221
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,600
Who dares call upon me?

222
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,270
We, the Divine Clan,

223
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,150
call upon Fate!

224
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,270
Humans have worshiped the Divine Clan for generations,

225
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,360
and we have safeguarded them.

226
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,390
However,

227
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,200
now the Spirit Clan runs wild

228
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,390
in the human realm,

229
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,320
slaughtering humanity.

230
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,960
Today, we call upon Fate

231
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,670
to reform the evil spirits.

232
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,270
Today, we call upon Fate

233
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,000
to reform the evil spirits,

234
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,550
to bring an end to Spirit Clan atrocities in the human world!

235
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,840
Approved.

236
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,080
The spirits of the mortal realm,

237
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,390
unless they are weak,

238
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,960
shall perform good deeds,

239
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,440
living without conflict with humans.

240
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,080
The Book of Fate,

241
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,630
its words become law.

242
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,200
It rewrites cause and effect,

243
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,960
reordering the universe.

244
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,080
We bow in gratitude!

245
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,960
Thank you, Fate!

246
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,630
Fate,

247
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,320
you're back.

248
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,960
You observe others' destinies every day.

249
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,870
Don't you find it dull?

250
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,670
You and I were born in chaos,

251
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,840
sharing longevity with the universe,

252
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,480
transcending all realms.

253
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,840
Whether interesting or dull,

254
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,670
what does it matter to me?

255
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,440
A world of change

256
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,000
is nothing but fleeting moments.

257
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,680
Even the Divine Clan,

258
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,070
generation after generation,

259
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,070
are merely passing visitors in the Celestial Palace.

260
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,880
Only our companionship

261
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,750
is eternal.

262
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,110
Fate,

263
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,480
you will never understand love.

264
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,000
If you refuse to rewrite his destiny,

265
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,440
then I shall

266
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,510
write his fate myself!

267
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,200
Even if the Book of Fate burns

268
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,880
and the Pearl loses its light,

269
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,790
I will never yield.

270
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,550
You say I don't understand love,

271
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,550
then I shall descend to the mortal world

272
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,070
to see for myself

273
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,110
what the love you mentioned

274
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,310
truly is.

275
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,550
When that time comes,

276
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,550
you will return,

277
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,030
won't you?

278
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,920
Sir,

279
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,640
what was that just now?

280
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,070
I thought you were going to die.

281
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,440
Nan Xuyue despises the world and himself.

282
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,750
Do you think you can save him?

283
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:10,960
You...

284
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,640
Who are you?

285
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,510
I am...

286
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,750
Fate.

287
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,380
[Xie Xuechen, Jiang Li]

288
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,030
The agreement is signed, and the war is over.

289
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,270
From now on, humans and spirits shall cease fighting

290
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,920
and restore peace.

291
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,640
All of you,

292
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,790
thanks to Mr. Xie's forgiveness,

293
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,480
we've been saved from disaster.

294
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,750
I, Jiang Li,

295
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,920
swear on behalf of the Spirit Clan

296
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,200
that from this day forward,

297
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,880
all spirits

298
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,510
will create no further unrest.

299
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,680
If this vow is broken,

300
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,590
may we fall into eternal suffering!

301
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,830
If this vow is broken,

302
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,310
may we fall into eternal suffering!

303
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,590
The Jade Sky Palace also swears this:

304
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,720
From now on, humans and spirits shall be treated as equals.

305
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,920
There will be no more spirit slaves.

306
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,350
The Mirage Palace is willing to follow Mr. Xie's decree.

307
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,310
Starting today, the Spirit Management Bureau is abolished.

308
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,310
There will be no oppression against the Spirit Clan.

309
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,550
I've sent disciples to the Dark Abyss.

310
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,030
If Miss Gao and Mr. Fu return,

311
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,750
they will receive immediate support.

312
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,590
There is one more matter.

313
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,110
I hope you will all agree.

314
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,440
Previously, due to my father's death

315
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,640
and the crisis in the Alliance,

316
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,960
I took on the position of Alliance Leader in a time of crisis.

317
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,110
However, this role

318
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,030
is not one I desire.

319
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,920
Now that the Immortals Array is rebuilt,

320
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,070
the Dark Clan sealed,

321
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,510
and humans and spirits at peace,

322
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,070
I believe the position

323
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,310
should be entrusted to someone more suitable.

324
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,240
Saint Xuanxin is highly skilled,

325
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,880
pure-hearted, and virtuous.

326
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,590
In the battle against the Dark Clan,

327
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,920
he made great contributions.

328
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,000
He is admired by all.

329
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,510
I believe Saint Xuanxin

330
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,720
can lead the Immortal Alliance

331
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,110
to regain peace.

332
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,160
That day in the Hall of Integrity,

333
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,070
all sect leaders requested an Alliance Leader.

334
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,480
Mr. Xie said he was only a temporary substitute.

335
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,480
If we insist now,

336
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,200
it would be repaying his favor with disrespect.

337
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,160
Moreover,

338
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Saint Xuanxin

339
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,680
is undoubtedly qualified for this role

340
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,270
and earns everyone's trust.

341
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,550
Saint Xuanxin,

342
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,510
are you willing to take on this responsibility?

343
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,160
I, Xuanxin,

344
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,350
will not fail your trust.

345
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,350
I hope everyone will unite,

346
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,590
protect all beings,

347
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,400
and avoid repeating past mistakes.

348
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,750
Understood!

349
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,920
Now that the crisis is over,

350
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,350
I trust Xuanxin

351
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,680
will lead the Immortal Alliance to flourish again.

352
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,270
As for the Snow City,

353
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,270
I hope to entrust it to the two of you.

354
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,880
There's one thing

355
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,160
I can no longer hide from you.

356
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,590
Mu Xuanling is the Chaos Pearl.

357
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,960
Mu Xuanling is the Chaos Pearl?

358
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,240
Previously, to prevent others from targeting her,

359
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,590
I deliberately hid her identity.

360
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,720
But what I owe her,

361
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,720
what humanity owes her, is too great.

362
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,350
Ten thousand years ago, the Chaos Pearl

363
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,240
sacrificed herself to mend the heavens,

364
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,920
bearing the weight of the world's fate.

365
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,920
Six thousand years ago,

366
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,510
the Immortal Alliance used the Chaos Pearl to create the Immortals Array,

367
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,270
once again exhausting her spiritual power.

368
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,000
Throughout this journey,

369
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,200
she aided the Immortal Alliance,

370
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,350
only to be doubted repeatedly

371
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,790
and sacrificed.

372
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,310
Now, she has even died to save me.

373
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,790
I owe her my life,

374
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,070
and humanity and the Alliance owe her greatly.

375
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,480
No matter what,

376
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,790
I will repay her.

377
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,110
Besides,

378
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,440
she is the one I love.

379

00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,590
I have never met him,

568
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,230
but I slightly recall

569
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,360
that he is cold and unfeeling,

570
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,400
unlike me, who is more approachable.

571
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,590
Legends say the Divine Clan abandoned humanity,

572
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,920
cutting off all contact.

573
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,250
So why did you

574
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,880
leave the Lotus of Life to draw humans?

575
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,880
And also,

576
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,480
what is this place?

577
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,630
It's understandable that you have doubts.

578
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,280
Even I am puzzled

579
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,800
why I am the only one

580
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,150
left in this realm.

581
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,360
You don't know either?

582
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,360
Ten thousand years ago,

583
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,730
someone asked me to wait here

584
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,440
for a person.

585
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,880
But the one never told me

586
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,230
what this person

587
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,360
would look like,

588
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,760
male or female,

589
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,150
old or young...

590
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,880
I can sense the Divine Clan hasn't disappeared,

591
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,070
but where have they gone?

592
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,320
It seems something important happened long ago,

593
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,760
yet I've forgotten it.

594
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,030
But forgotten is forgotten.

595
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,480
There must be a power

596
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,630
greater than mine

597
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,550
that made me forget.

598
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,440
The Book of Fate...

599
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:40,630
Yes.

600
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,920
Perhaps it was the Book of Fate.

601
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,480
Someone used it

602
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,800
to manipulate the destiny of the Divine Clan.

603
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,710
Do you know

604
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,230
the Book of Fate

605
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,230
is an artifact of lies?

606
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,760
Its words become law,

607
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,760
and all lies it tells become truth.

608
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,960
Its power surpasses mine,

609
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,320
but equally,

610
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,590
it demands a great price.

611
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,190
No reward

612
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,360
comes without a cost.

613
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,880
If I only wish to save one person,

614
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,400
can you help me?

615
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,550
I can send you back to the past

616
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,800
to alter that person's fate

617
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,280
before her death.

618
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,800
Think carefully

619
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,400
about when and where you wish to return.

620
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,840
I will use the Cycles of Rebirth to send you back.

621
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,190
If the Immortals Array wasn't destroyed,

622
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,320
there'd be no need to rebuild it.

623
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,000
In the end, she wouldn't have died.

624
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,000
I wish to return to the moment before the Immortals Array was broken

625
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,190
to stop He Xianwo.
