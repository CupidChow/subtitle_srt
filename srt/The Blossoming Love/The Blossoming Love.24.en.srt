Thank you.

Xie Xuechen.

23
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,840
Are you okay?

24
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,280
Why am I here?

25
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,470
You don't remember?

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,680
So

27
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,630
I'm possessed by the Dark Clan again?

28
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,680
Have you thought about it?

29
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,360
If you tell me the whereabouts of the Chaos Pearl,

30
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,750
I'll open the Immortals Array for you

31
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,590
and turn that foul and sinful place

32
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,840
into a burning inferno

33
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,190
to help you fulfill your vengeance.

34
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Simple enough deal,

35
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,190
isn't it?

36
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,870
Who are you?

37
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,310
Why can you open the Immortals Array?

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,030
The Immortals Array was created by the Chaos Power.

39
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,470
Over the years, it has lost much of its power.

40
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,030
With the right measures

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,400
in the right place,

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,030
we can break it.

43
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,320
Back then,

44
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,430
I had the honor of seeing it when the Immortals Array

45
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,400
was created by the Immortal Alliance,

46
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,840
so I knew

47
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,470
where to break it.

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,360
Back then?

49
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,680
6,000 years ago?

50
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,080
No.

51
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,800
You're even more than 6,000 years old,

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
but that's

53
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,960
no longer my concern.

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,560
The Chaos Pearl was destroyed

55
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,030
by Gao Fengxu.

56
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,960
The Chaos Pearl is divine

57
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,190
and impossible to be destroyed.

58
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,020
You and I

59
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,710
don't have much time,

60
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,430
so we shouldn't waste it on this nonsense.

61
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,120
Believe it or not,

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,560

63
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,150
Good.

64
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,310
On that day, in Mirage Palace and Starfall Valley,

65
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,190
there were five people who survived at the end.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,920
You all know

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,190
where the Chaos Pearl is, right?

68
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,800
It's okay if you don't tell me.

69
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,560
You're not my only choice.

70
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,920
Okay.

71
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,120
It's time for me to carry out my plan.

72
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,240
Sang Qi.

73
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,510
You and I were allies,

74
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,950
so I may miss you

75
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,720
after you die.

76
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,190
Who is He Xianwo?

77
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,890
Why does he know the way

78
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,270
to open the Immortals Array?

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
When Feng Xiang and Qian Guang

80
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
were building the Immortals Array,

81
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,360
he was snooping around,

82
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,780
so he spied on the steps and breakthroughs

83
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,600
to build the Immortals Array.

84
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,750
How is this possible?

85
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,310
The Immortals Array

86
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,070
was built 6,000 years ago.

87
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,600
Break.

88
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,870
Nothing

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,680
in this world is impossible.

90
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
Immortals Array's barrier is broken.

91
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,160
I need to fix it as soon as possible.

92
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,870
If the Immortals Array is really opened,

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,070
will the Immortal Alliance be able to handle it?

94
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,630
The Mirage Palace and the Xuantian Sect

95
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,750
were greatly wounded in the previous battle.

96
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,630
Now, they have no leader,

97
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,600
so they are unable to cope.

98
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,380
I've heard that Jade Sky Palace alone

99
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,360
has 5,000 direct disciples

100
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,040
and over 10,000 external friars,

101
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,240
so I think

102
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,510
they can fight.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,920
Jade Sky Palace?

104
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,480
They're only looking out for themselves,

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,720
and this time,

106
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,270
they probably won't go all out against the enemy,

107
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,160
so how can we hope for that?

108
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,920
Osprey Island is the attacker,

109
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,000
so isn't Snow City the only one

110
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,830
who can fight

111
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,430
with their backs to the wall?

112
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,680
With the Spirit Clan and the Dark Clan joining forces,

113
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,510
even Snow City

114
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,950
will run out of steam in the end.

115
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,240
In this battle,

116
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,600
the Immortal Alliance will be in a very bad way.

117
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
Then why do you still have time

118
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,720
to draw here?

119
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,430
I'm just following

120
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,800
my own plan.

121
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,600
This time, the Immortals Array

122
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,190
is not rupturing externally.

123
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,040
It appears that its barrier has been opened.

124
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,890
If the rift grows

125
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,800
and the Dark Clan discovers it,

126
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,840
they'll do whatever it takes

127
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,000
to get all out.

128
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm afraid we can't stop them

129
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,480
with just you and me.

130
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,830
I'm going into the Dark Abyss.

131
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,720
Even if I can't stop Sang Qi,

132
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,310
I can earn some time to fix the Barrier.

133
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,720
You have already betrayed the Dark Abyss,

134
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,070
so they won't show you any mercy.

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,720

136
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Sang Qi never really wanted to kill me.

138

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,790
a straight road ahead.

192
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,720
Master.

193
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,000
Master.

194
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,200
Where are your ears?

195
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,200
You're awake.

196
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,390
Are you thirsty?

197
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,240
Have some water.

198
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,720
Are you hungry?

199
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,480
Want some fish?

200
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,630
Who are you?

201
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,270
What do you want?

202
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,670
What do I want?

203
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,740
You and I met in the woods,

204
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,160
and you brought me here.

205
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,360
Have you forgotten?

206
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,530
I am Su Ningxi, a disciple of the Mirage Palace.

207
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,840
The reason why you brought me here

208
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,030
is that I could heal you.

209
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,030
I am the Spirit Clan,

210
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,480
but why didn't you kill me

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,390
or send word?

212
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,040
Why would I kill you?

213
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,150
You are strange.

214
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,550
Your wound is bleeding.

215
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,000
Let me take care of that for you.

216
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,870
You're hurt too badly.

217
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,670
I'm exhausted today

218
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,150
and need a night's rest to recover.

219
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,240
She's just sleeping.

220
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,600
I didn't realize

221
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,080
you saved this rabbit

222
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,720
just to eat it.

223
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,670
It smells good.

224
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,910
The rabbit is so cute,

225
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,960
so it's really delicious.

226
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,320
Don't you think you're cruel?

227
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,790
But I have to live.

228
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,200
Can you eat other living beings

229
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,750
just to stay alive?

230
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,390
What if I eat you

231
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,480
to stay alive?

232
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,910
Then you'd better be quick.

233
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,910
Don't make me feel pain.

234
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,150
And?

235
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,000
And

236
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,390
add more cumin.

237
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,360
It'll taste better.

238
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,670
I doubt

239
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,000
you're not human.

240
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,000
I also doubt you're not a werewolf.

241
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,670
Weren't you afraid or hated me

242
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,390
when I said

243
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,510
I was going to eat you?

244
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,630
You were just trying to survive.

245
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,120
No.

246
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,910
I am the demidemon of the Spirit Clan.

247
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,630
I was born guilty.

248
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,840
I am evil,

249
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,080
bloodthirsty,

250
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,120
cruel,

251
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,720
and cold.

252
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,790
In God's mind,

253
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,150
what difference

254
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,790
does every race make?

255
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,440
Listen.

256
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,480
Grass breaks through rocks

257
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,200
and soil in order to grow.

258
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,760
Rabbits eat grass

259
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,870
to grow.

260
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,480
Beasts eat meat,

261
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,510
and people eat beasts.

262
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,480
And yet,

263
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,570
even the most powerful beings

264
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,510
on earth die,

265
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,790
are buried in the ground,

266
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,720
and become nutrients for the grass and trees.

267
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,870
Everything is born with a purpose.

268
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,030
It's not about good or evil

269
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,630
or strength.

270
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,390
Demidemon's existence

271
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,200
has an essential meaning.

272
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,270
The disdain for life

273
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,630
is not God's will

274
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,750
but the will of humans.

275
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,080
Humans need to eat

276
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,200
a lot of life to survive.

277
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,240
This rabbit that I ate is the same

278
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,160
as me who will be eaten by you,

279
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,070
but I will honor

280
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,200
every life that I eat.

281
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,110
No matter how bad it is to eat,

282
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,070
I can't waste them

283
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,310
or fail every life,

284
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,270
so

285
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,960
I'm afraid of being eaten by you,

286
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,030
but I won't hate you.

287
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,240
Maybe

288
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,480
that's why I met you.

289
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,960
Sang Qi.

290
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,880
I'm really happy to have met you.

291
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,510
You may not know

292
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,750
that actually,

293
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,000
you're very gentle.

294
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
This is the place

295
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,030
we once agreed to leave together.

296
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,270
It's still beautiful

297
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,200

This sword

300
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,510
is a witness to our love for each other

301
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
and our misunderstandings.

[Twilight Spirit Pavilion]

355
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,440
I was abandoned under the Fusang Tree on Qi Road,

356
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:40,960
so I named myself

357
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,200
Sang Qi.

358
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,880
You were Malvaviscus at the time of the demon's coming,

359
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,070
so your name

360
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,640
is Mu Xuanling.

361
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,750
Today, I accept you as my disciple.

362
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,510

Ling.

366
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,750
I noticed you

367
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,680
in Moonlight Heights ten years ago

368
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,830

00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,440

370
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,170

00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,160
If they break out of the Immortals Array,

383
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,160
we will not be able to kill them all.

384
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,680
Now,

385
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,750
we can only stop the Dark Clan

386
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,760
from coming back at all

387
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,960
by sealing the Void Sea.

388
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,550
Sealing the Void Sea

389
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,440
is not an easy task,

390
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,240
and we need to consume a huge amount of spiritual power

391
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,120
to have a chance.

392
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,180
If I use all my spiritual power,

393
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,240
I can fight them.

394
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,030
Thank you, Saint.

395
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,350
Continue to control the barriers with the curse.

396
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,920
I'm going into the Dark Abyss

397
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,960
to seal the Void Sea.

398
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,400
Mr. Xie, be careful.

399
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,160
The Spirit Clan has attacked the city.

400
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,030
Execute all the spirit slaves.

401
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,920
All of them.

402
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,000
The Master said

403
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,410
we'd just put them in the dungeon

404
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,900
and keep them under close guard.

405
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,510
If they collude with the Spirit Clan in a riot,

406
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,720
we will all die.

407
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,750
Do it.

408
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,030
Who?

409
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,510
Who are you?

410
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,480
Who is he?

411
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,350
Who is he?

412
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
You are free,

413
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,240
but

414
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,480
if you don't want this hard-won freedom

415
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,790
to disappear again,

416
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,110
I need a small favor

417
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,310
from all of you.

418
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,200
My fighters of the Spirit Clan

419
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,640
have stormed the city.

420
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,640
If you are willing to join forces with me,

421
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,270
we can pick each other up

422
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,680
and destroy Jade Sky Palace once and for all.

423
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,000
Xuanling.

424
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,960
Are you all right?

425
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,160
Yes, I am.

426
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,310
It seems you and I share a common bond

427
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,550
and have come here for the same purpose.

428
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,160
If I hadn't come here,

429
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,920
would you have used up your spiritual power

430
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,750
to seal the Void Sea again?

431
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,270
The Immortals Array is about to be broken,

432
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,480
so this is the only way to stop the Dark Clan.

433
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,790
Perhaps there is a better way.

434
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,070
Master died,

435
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,510
but he left his spiritual essence to me.

436
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,720
His spiritual essence

437
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,960
has gathered a lot of demonic energy from the Void Sea,

438
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,750
and it has the Jade Vault Technique's power,

439
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,750
so it might be able

440
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,680
to seal the Void Sea for a while.

441
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,070
If we use the Jade Vault Technique to purify Sang Qi's spiritual essence

442
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,270
and turn the demonic energy into spiritual power,

443
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,510
we can seal the Void Sea.

444
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,310
Immortals Array is damaged.

445
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,960
This is a great opportunity.

446
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,830
We can eliminate the Humans

447
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,920
before we fight for supremacy.

448
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,000
[Temple of Divine Execution]
Gentlemen of the Dark Clan, listen up.

449
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,110
Let's go.

450
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,310
It seems the Dark Clan

451
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,110
has discovered the Immortals Array is broken.

452
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,000
The barrier won't last long.

453
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,860
Let's get started.

454
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,920
Slaughter the Immortal Alliance.

455
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,200
Seize the human realm.

456
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,960
Charge!

457
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,000
Calm down.

458
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,160
Remove distractions.

459
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,510
Hold the barrier.

460
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,540
[Jade Sky Palace]

461
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,110
Honey.

462
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,310
Didn't I tell you to take our son away?

463
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,750
Why have you come here?

464
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,510
Having been married all these years,

465
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,480
I've gotten nothing

466
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,750
and suffered every day,

467
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,640
so if anything happens to you,

468
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,680
I've lost a lot

469
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,160
in the deal.

470
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,400
Is one life worth more

471
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,480
or two?

472
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,070
Can't you even do the math?

473
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,680
Sometimes, it's not the right way

474
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,510
of doing the math.

475
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,310
Careful.

476
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,510
If I'd known,

477
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,960
I wouldn't have gotten drunk on business.

478
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,440
I should have practiced.

479
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,240
It's just a deal,

480
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,960
so why so serious?

481
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,720
What if

482
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,920
it's not just a deal?

483
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,030
Fool.

484
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Father. Mother.

485
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,720
- Go after them. - Go after them.

486
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,480
Mother.

487
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,590
Sheng.

488
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,720
Help your mother.

489
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,480
The Spirit Clan has come in force

490
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,920
and is unusual,

491
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,480
so something must be wrong.

492
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,440
- I'm going to send a message... - Mother.

493
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,680
to all the sects to find out what's going on.

494
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,310
But you don't have a chance.

495
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,680
Jiang Li.

496
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,920
The Decaying Immortal Pavilion has colluded

497
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,040
with the Dark Clan to murder your kind.

498
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,460
What do you want?

499
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,350
Fu Yuanting.

500
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,960
When the Immortal Alliance set up the Spirit Management Bureau

501
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,350
and brutalized the Spirit Clan,

502
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
why didn't you fight for it?

503
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,830
The Decaying Immortal Pavilion

504
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,000
was only fixing the wrongs of this world.

505
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,070
You are all part

506
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,200
of the wrong.

507
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,240
The Spirit Management Bureau

508
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,200
was created to restrain the Spirit Clan

509
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,480
that was a danger to the Humans.

510
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,070
The Jade Sky Palace was chosen

511
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,240
as the keeper of order

512
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,590
and has run the Spirit Management Bureau for generations.

513
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,270
They have restricted

514
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,720
the Spirit Clan's freedom a little,

515
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,920
but over the years, they have kept

516
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,030
the Humans and the Spirit Clan in peace.

517
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,240
Isn't that a good thing?

518
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,240
A good thing?

519
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,550
It seems, Elder Duan,

520
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,960
that you don't think

521
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,480
what you're doing is wrong.

522
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,160
Then I would like to ask.

523
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,680
The Humans discriminate against the Spirit Clan

524
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,550
and kill and repress them

525
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,590
with impunity.

526
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,440
Does this mean that the Humans

527
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,750
are inherently more noble than the Spirit Clan?

528
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
Jade Sky Palace is like this,

529
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,790
and so is Mirage Palace

530
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,200
and the Immortal Alliance.

531
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,960
You're all glamorous on the outside

532
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,920
but rotten on the inside.

533
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,750
Where is the future of the Spirit Clan

534
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,200
if you are not destroyed?

535
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,400
Jiang Li.

536
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,790
We can talk.

537
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,240
You've treated Bao well,

538
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,590
so I don't want to kill you.

539
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,480
Get out of the way.

540
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,000
Sheng.

541
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:29,920
Sheng.

542
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,750
Brother.

543
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,070
- Sheng, get up. - Brother, get up.

544
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,270
Bao.

545
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,110
Come to me.

546
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,160
Bad guy.

547
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,590
You're not my father.

548
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,160
My father is Fu Cangli.

549
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,680
He's the richest friar in the world.

550
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,960
My mother says

551
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,290
my father is kind

552
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,240
and nice to everyone,

553
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,810
unlike you.

554
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,160
You...

555
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,720
You're Cangli?

556
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,480
Father.

557
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,350
You know Fu Cangli?

558
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,790
Who is he?

559
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,160
He...

560
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,350
What?

561
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,400
You're afraid to say it?

562
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,110
Then I'll say it for you.

563
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,360
How did the former head of Jade Sky Palace,

564
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,740
your brother,

565
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,830
my father,

566
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,640
Fu Chengzhou,

567
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,350
die?

568
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,640
If it wasn't for the chaos of Jade Sky Palace

569
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,830
due to the conspiracy

570
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,880
and you killed your brother in order to take over the throne,

571
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,880
which caused my mother and me

572
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,400
to change our names

573
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,590
and to be displaced,

574
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,680
how did I, Jiang Li, get to where I am today?

575
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,270
Father.

576
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,310
None of what he said

577
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,640
is true,

578
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,440
is it?

579
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,110
That's the truth,

580
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,750
isn't it?

581
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
Master Fu?

582
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,240
No.

583
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,680
Back then,

584
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,160
it was Fu Chengzhou

585
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,720
who killed and seized power,

586
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,400
not Fu Yuanting.

587
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,270
You...

588
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,920
You knew that?

589
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,550
I've known for a long time,

590
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,680
but you didn't want anyone to know,

591
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,110
so I was just pretending not to know.

592
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,190
Mother.

593
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
What's going on?

594
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,280
What are you hiding?

595
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,320
Honey.

596
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,130
Things are like this now,

597
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,440
so do we have to hide it now?

598
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,180
Maybe you were wrong from the beginning.

599
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,590
He deserves to know the truth.

600
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,030
Back then,

601
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,550
Jade Sky Palace was on the verge of collapse.

602
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,800
The one who worked day and night on a new artifact

603
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,480
to support the palace

604
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,520
was not Fu Chengzhou

605
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,540
but Fu Yuanting.

606
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,110
He was also the one

607
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,280
who was associated with my clan by marriage

608
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,480
and saved Jade Sky Palace,

609
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,400
so your grandfather

610
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,190
appointed him as the heir,

611
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,550
but your father was angry

612
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,070
and tried to kill his brother to seize power.

613
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,070
In the end, he was killed by your grandfather.

614
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,110
This fool,

615
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,680
to save your grandfather's

616
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,590
and father's reputations,

617
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,230
hid the truth

618
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,280
and was willing to let the world criticize

619
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,510
and misunderstand him.

620
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:05,710
Was it worth it?

621
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,590
You were young

622
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,070
when it happened,

623
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,080
and your mother didn't know the truth,

624
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,550
so she took you on the run

625
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,400
and never showed up again.

626
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,550
But Cangli,

627
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,460
do you know why your name

628
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,760
is not on the family tree

629
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,920
of The Fu family?

630
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,320
It's because your uncle

631
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,400
wanted to protect you.

632
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,150
He erased everything

633
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,320
to save you from being used by your enemies

634
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,960
and the strife from hatred,

635
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,070
but after all these years,

636
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,840
he has been waiting for you to come home.

637
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,070
You must realize

638
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,590
that Fu Yuanting is your uncle,

639
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,840
not your enemy.

640
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,920
Do you understand?

641
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,880
What's the point

642
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,880
of you telling me this now?

643
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,920
I can tell you

644
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,030
that what I am doing now

645
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,880
is not because of family hatred

646
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,510
but because the Immortal Alliance must die.

647
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,960
Do not harm them.

648
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,880
Having been with the Humans long enough,

649
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,710
you want to help them now.

650
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,920
Whatever.

651
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,030
In the future,

652
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,760
you'll understand my good intentions.

653
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,850
Whatever you want to do,

654
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,810
do it to me.

655
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,840
This has nothing to do with them.

656
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,440
You...

657
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,070
Don't hurt them.

658
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,710
Father, mother.

659
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,030
- Bao. - Bao.

660
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,480
What's going on?

661
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,630
Someone opened the secret passage's

662
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,280
self-destruct array.

663
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,710
How can we escape?

664
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,840
Once the array is opened,

665
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,590
no one can escape.

666
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,800
Jiang Li is still inside.

667
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,110
He's helped us so much,

668
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,440
but we're biting the hand.

669
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,670
Isn't that too bad?

670
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,340
As a member of the Humans,

671
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,490
Jiang Li won't represent the interests of the Spirit Clan.

672
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,000
He'll betray us sooner or later,

673
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,880
so we'd better get rid of him

674
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,030
and let him die

675
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,670
with the Jade Sky Palace.

676
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,710
They won't last long.

677
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,190
The curse barrier is the weakest here.

678
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,230
Let's work together to tear it down.

679
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,800
That's good.

680
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,670
After we break out of the barrier,

681
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,590
let's start with the Xuantian Sect.

682
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,670
Senior.

683
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,150
Immortals Array's barrier is almost destroyed,

684
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,800
so by relying on the Curse alone,

685
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,070
the spiritual power will eventually run out.

686
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,520
Once the curse barrier is broken,

687
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,280
we won't be able to stop the Dark Clan.

688
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,660
Don't think about the result.

689
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,510
Defend until the end.

690
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,710
Yes, sir.

691
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,670
The barrier has been broken.

692
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,400

escaped from the Two Realms Mountain.

712
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,110
Xuanxin and the others are still in the Immortals Array.

713
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,840
Let's go join them.

714
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,030
What's going on?

715
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,480
Something's not right with the Dark Abyss.

716
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,510
Old friend.

717
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,400
Xie Xuechen.

718
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,880
It's him again.

719
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,280
Come on, let's go.

720
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
Long time no see.

721
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,760
You...

722
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,800
You're finally here.

723
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,590
Pearl.

724
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,400
Pearl.

725
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,920
Is that you?

726
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,590
Mister?

727
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,630
No.

728
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,710
You're not him.

729
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,000
Who are you?

730
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,630
You forgot me

731
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,760
but fell in love with a part of me.

732
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,440
There are always

733
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,960
so many coincidences in this world.

734
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,920
So ridiculous.

735

When I met you,

737
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,760
you had lost all your power

repairing the sky

739
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,150
and couldn't even take human form.

I nourished you with blood spiritual power.

742
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,030
You used my power to recover,

743
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,510
but at the crucial moment, you betrayed me

744
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,320
