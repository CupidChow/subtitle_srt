- Senior! - Senior!

78
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,000
Aren't you a person of purity?

79
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,560
Even you can be consumed by inner demons.

80
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,320

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,800

88
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,680
Where is Fate?

89
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,830
Since he saved you,

90
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,430
why didn't he follow you along?

91
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,270
Where is the noble Fate

92
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,630
hiding like a coward?

93
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,400
Fate caused Xie Xuechen's death.

94
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,350
I won't walk the same path as him.

95
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,630
This time,

96
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,160
I'm here to surrender to you.

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,470
Surrender?

98
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,680
Do you think I'd believe you?

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,830
You don't have to believe me.

100
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,400
But you know very well

101
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,320
Fate is an ancient artifact.

102
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,270
You cannot kill him.

103
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,310
But with my help,

104
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,430
you can gain an advantage.

105
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,840
I now offer my own life

106
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,640
in exchange.

107
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,120
All I ask is that you spare everyone in the Immortal Alliance.

108
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,830
You?

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,480
You have no right to negotiate with me.

110
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,040
What I want is the power of Chaos.

111
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,190
Xuanling!

112
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,270
Without my willing surrender,

113
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,630
no one can take the power of Chaos from me.

114
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,800
You're asking for death!

115
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,270
If you kill me,

116
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,680
you'll never obtain the power of Chaos.

117
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,150
Release everyone in the Immortal Alliance,

118
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,190
and I'll return to the Dark Abyss with you.

119
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,800
Since you've come as promised,

120
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,360
I will spare these nobodies of the Immortal Alliance.

121
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,310
Master!

122
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,070
- Senior! - Senior!

123
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,570
Master!

124
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,620
Hand over the power of Chaos.

125
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,750
What exactly are you planning?

126
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,950
Planning?

127
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,240
Naturally, to combine the power of Chaos with demonic power

128
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,240
to achieve ultimate strength

129
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,920
and destroy this world.

130
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,390
Destroy the world?

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,600
What good does that do you?

132
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,880
Good?

133
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,310
It should be punishment instead.

134
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,600
For these ten thousand years,

135
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,630
the world betrayed and abandoned me.

136
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,840
It must pay the price.

137
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,750
But the people of today

138
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,120
are no longer the people of ten thousand years ago.

139
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,360
There's no difference.

140
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,680
Human hearts change easily,

141
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,120
but some things remain the same:

142
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,150
ingratitude,

143
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,630
selfishness, and cowardice,

144
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,310
generation after generation.

145
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,180
The Book of Fate altered your memories

146
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,280
and the memories of the world.

147
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Pearl never betrayed you.

148
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,240
And you

149
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,630
were never the Fallen Deity seeking to destroy the world.

150
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,550
You've always been Saint Emperor Zhao Ming,

151
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,880
who sacrificed everything for all beings.

152
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,910
All of this is false.

153
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,200
What is true, and what is false?

154
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,670
All I know is:

155
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,120
I've been suppressed under the Lava for ten thousand years,

156
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,790
suffering day and night.

157
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,480
I've been despised by generations.

158
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,880
And when I was in pain and despair,

159
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,910
you and Xie Xuechen fell in love.

160
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,430
I'm sick of so-called righteousness,

161
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,600
of so-called virtuous constraints.

162
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,880
When that remnant soul

163
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,270
returned to me,

164
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,720
showing me

165
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,240
your love and memories with Xie Xuechen,

166
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,840
it filled me with utter disgust.

167
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,430
Why won't you believe my words?

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,960
The truth from ten thousand years ago is as I've said.

169
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,080
Perhaps

170
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,450
I can help you

171
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,510
return to how you were back then.

172
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,390
Can you let go of everything

173
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,030
and start anew?

174
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,100
Start anew?

175
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,620
The pain, the torment, the scorn

176
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,330
of these ten thousand years

177
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,780
was all borne by me alone.

178
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,510
Let me tell you,

179
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,040
no one has the right

180
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,000
to tell me

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
to easily let go.

182
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,030
And no one has the right

183
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,960
to decide for me.

184
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,510
Remember this:

185
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,550
from now on,

186
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,000
there is no Saint Emperor Zhao Ming,

187
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,240
no Beacon of Righteousness Xie Xuechen.

188
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,360
There is only me,

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,360
the Demon Lord of Destruction.

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,270
Demon Lord,

191
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,720
please don't be angry.

192
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Actually, I'd like to transfer

193
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,600
the power of Chaos to you early.

194
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,480
But now,

195
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,320
I only possess half of the power of Chaos.

196
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,840
I must keep it

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,630
to recover the other half.

198
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,030
Where is the other half?

199
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,200
This matter cannot be rushed.

200
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,510
Spend some time with me,

201
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,510
let me see your changes,

202
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,890
and I will naturally tell you

203
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,010
where the other half is.

204
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,000
I've sealed your cultivation techniques.

205
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,030
No matter how cunning you are,

206
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,030
you can't escape the Dark Abyss.

207
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,120
Think it over carefully.

208
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,930
Reveal the location

209
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,170
of the other half soon,

210
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,270
and surrender it willingly,

211
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,320
then perhaps I may spare you.

212
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,270
Otherwise,

213
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,720
you should be well aware

214
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,080
of the tortures of the Dark Abyss,

215
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,320
and the torment of the Lava.

216
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,360
The current Demon Lord

217
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,080
is so ruthless and resolute.

218
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,480
Can he truly be purified and changed?

219
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:58,960
That's wonderful!

220
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,840
It seems the demonic energy inside him

221
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,900
is being driven out.

222
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,890
Withdraw your power!

223
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,600
Are you alright?

224
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:30,910
No major issues.

225
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,880
Fortunately, you stopped us in time.

226
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,150
But when we

227
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,150
were expelling the demonic energy from you,

228
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:36,880
this demonic energy

229
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,960
didn't fade.

230
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,480
Instead, it grew stronger.

231
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,750
This demonic energy

232
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,270
is indeed peculiar.

233
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,080
Earlier, I felt

234
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,480
the forces of good and evil

235
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,630
clashing within me.

236
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,670
The more I tried to expel it,

237
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,430
the more the demonic energy fought back.

238
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,600
It even

239
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,790
almost made me lose control of my techniques.

240
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,150
The Demon Lord is ruthless,

241
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,080
and his demonic energy is even more cunning.

242
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,360
Senior,

243
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,630
let's try again.

244
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,960
We're sure to succeed.

245
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,430
This matter

246
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,430
might not be so simple.

247
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,550
Originally, I aimed to reach the Spiritual Form stage,

248
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
enhance my Curse,

249
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
and stand against the Dark Abyss.

250
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,270
But now,

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
with the demonic energy invading my body,

252
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,430
I fear

253
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,840
hope is faint.

254
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,080
I've heard that His Grace struggles to sleep at night.

255
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,770
If we offer him this aged wine

256
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,030
from the Dark Abyss,

257
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,840
once he drinks it,

258
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,360
he'll surely fall asleep immediately,

259
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,480
and have sweet dreams all night.

260
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,790
As they say, fine wine

261
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,120
is the perfect match for a hero.

262
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,670
A perfect pair!

263
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,240
When did you, Anger Demon,

264
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,080
learn to butter up and flatter?

265
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,270
Flatter?

266
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,480
I truly admire His Grace.

267
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,550
Don't you get it?

268
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,480
Hurry up and offer the wine.

269
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,270
His Grace will definitely like it.

270
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:57,790
Right?

271
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,200
I think so too.

272
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,480
Alright, I'm off then.

273
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,430
His Grace

274
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,960
refuses to eat anything

275
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,600
and rejects any persuasion.

276
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,360
I bet Anger Demon

277
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,510
will walk out of the Temple of Divine Execution

278
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,320
with the wine untouched.

279
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,790
I don't think so.

280
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,880
I bet

281
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,970
he'll crawl out, wine and all,

282
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,080
chased away.

283
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,360
His Grace actually accepted your wine?

284
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,480
He wasn't inside the Temple of Divine Execution.

285
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,240
I just left the wine there and came out.

286
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,750
But it's strange.

287
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,790
Every time I come looking for him at night,

288
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,030
he's never there.

289
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,270
It's all Zhao Ming's fault!

290
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,910
He caused the Divine Clan to abandon humanity.

291

He made our lives unbearable!

292
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,270
Zhao Ming is an evil emperor!

He is the origin of our disaster,

He's nothing but a curse!

Exactly!

297
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,890
Just for his own selfish desires,

298
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,840
he made grave mistakes and angered the Divine Clan.

299
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,650
He was never

300
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,140
worthy to be our ruler!

Zhao Ming

302
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,030
should've died long ago!

303
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,880
Quickly, let's plead with the Divine Clan,

304
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,280
beg for their forgiveness of humanity,

305
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,260
and ask them to continue protecting us!

306
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,600
It's all Zhao Ming's fault for defying the Divine Clan!

307
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,720
It's all Zhao Ming's fault!

308
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,120
That's right, it's all his fault!

309
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,640
- It's all his fault! - It's all his fault!

Even though my body escaped the Lava,

my soul is still suppressed

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,960
by the remnants of the Lava seal.

313

Then will the mortal world improve?

No, it won't.

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,150

In your view,

379
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,080
Pack your things.

380
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,430
Prepare to leave.

381
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:49,990
Where to?

382
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,630
The Snow City.

383
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,910
The Snow City?

384
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,430
That's where the plan concludes.

385
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,390
Naturally, we should head there a bit early

386
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,040
and make proper preparations.

387
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,430
The Pearl Tower is a magical artifact.

388
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,470
Using it to expel demonic energy

389
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,390
might prove beneficial.

390
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,150
Senior,

391
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,840
you're showing signs of demonic possession!

392
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:49,760
If this continues,

393
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,150
not only will he fall into demonic possession,

394
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,320
but we'll also be consumed by the demonic energy.

395
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:54,760
Senior,

396
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,600
stay awake!

397
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,150
Don't let the demonic energy take control of you!

398
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,150
Senior!

399
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,470
Senior!

400
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,040
Hold on.

401
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,430
Hang in there!

402
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,560
In the end, my faith is unsteady.

403
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,880
I can no longer control the demonic energy within me.

404
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,080
Now the only way to give you all a chance at survival

405
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,520
is to destroy my entire cultivation

406
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,760
while my mind still remains intact!

407
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,880
Senior, stop!

408
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,470
You mustn't destroy your cultivation!

409
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,390
Soul Binding Curse!

410
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,080
Execute!

411
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,910
At the Greenview Heights,

412
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,800
a wedding and a funeral held together.

413
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,990
Divine battles shook yin and yang.

414
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,950
The Immortal Alliance has been aware of such matters.

415
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,430
So now,

416
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,040
should I address you as Mr. Nan

417
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,990
or the Divine Emperor of Fate?

418
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,560
As long as our stance aligns,

419
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,190
titles are unimportant.

420
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,670
Then what is your stance?

421
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,390
Tell me.

422
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,840
The Demon Lord is the enemy of the age.

423
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,360
All should align against him.

424
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,040
The Immortal Alliance is now at the mercy of him.

425
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,080
But as Fate,

426
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,910
only I

427
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,560
can stand against him.

428
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,190
I've expelled the demonic energy from you,

429
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,230
but your act of self-destruction

430
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,620
at the Pearl Tower

431
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,040
has severely damaged your internal channels.

432
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,040
In the coming days,

433
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
you must take spiritual medicine

434
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,430
and rest well.

435
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,990
Why do you keep looking at me?

436
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,600
I just wanted to see clearly

437
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,520
what Fate, the one who governs

438
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,470
the destinies of all ages,

439
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,840
truly looks like.

440
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,230
Nan Xuyue's appearance

441
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,670
shouldn't be unfamiliar to you.

442
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,040
I'm referring to the heart.

443
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,840
Does your heart

444
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,990
truly align with the Immortal Alliance?

445
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,140
Since you've

446
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,470
chosen to trust me,

447
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,990
then trust me entirely.

448
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,880
And you must trust only me.

449
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,190
This is a medicinal soup

450
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,670
made with our spiritual ginseng.

451
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,430
It will aid in restoring your internal channels.

452
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,190
Thank you, Miss Feng Yao.

453
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
You're so selfless.

454
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,230
To protect the Immortal Alliance from harm,

455
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,880
you were willing to sacrifice your cultivation.

456
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,390
For cultivators,

457
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,150
cultivation is the most precious thing.

458
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,280
And with such profound techniques,

459
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
were you really going

460
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,710
to give them up so easily?

461
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,630
The disaster was caused by me.

462
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,390
As the Alliance Leader,

463
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,430
I failed to protect everyone

464
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,390
and was instead infused with demonic energy by the Demon Lord,

465
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,150
nearly harming the innocent.

466
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,280
With my cultivation tainted by demonic energy,

467
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,280
it's better to destroy it entirely,

468
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,520
leaving no room for sin behind.

469
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,150
And I will not

470
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,910
allow myself to give rise to evil thoughts.

471
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,600
As for good and evil,

472
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,990
right and wrong,

473
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,150
you truly see through it all without attachment.

474
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,080
My master once said I was pure.

475
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,950
But after all I've been through,

476
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,430
I eventually realized

477
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,150
that my heart

478
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,040
still harbored attachments.

479
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,150
That is why the demonic energy

480
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,480
could disturb my techniques.

481
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,520
The problem isn't external.

482
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,670
It's within the heart.

483
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,240
You possess wisdom

484
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,110
to see through attachments.

485
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,670
Breaking through your boundaries

486
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,720
is only a matter of time.

487
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,240
Cultivation is easy to abandon,

488
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,720
but breakthroughs are hard to achieve.

489
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,040
Perhaps...

490
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,870
I just chose the simplest path.

491
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,040
Qiumin.

492
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,390
Are you alright?

493
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,950
How are you feeling?

494
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,190
I'm fine.

495
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,720
It feels like I just woke from a long dream.

496
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,350
I feel the same.

497
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,430
Those were your memories from ten thousand years ago.

498
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,520
Mu Xuanling!

499
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,590
Xie Xuechen!

500
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,240
Mr. Xie!

501
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,840
Fu Lansheng!

502
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,910
Are you alright?

503
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:22,870
I'm fine.

504
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,150
Xie Xuechen,

505
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,720
have you gone mad?

506
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:35,870
Qiumin!

507
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,670
He's not Xie Xuechen.

508
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,040
He's the Demon Lord.

509
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,800
Now your lives are in her hands.

510
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,320
The power of Chaos or their lives,

511
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,760
what will you choose?

512
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,560
I will give you the power of Chaos,

513
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,150
but not now.

514
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,840
We're deep in the Dark Abyss now.

515
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,720
If I hand over it too early,

516
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,800
it will become our death warrant.

517
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,800
Ten thousand years ago,

518
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,110
all the people betrayed you,

519
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,430
but Yan and Qingyang didn't.

520
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,430
They could have achieved

521
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,910
true freedom and happiness,

522
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,430
but they chose to return to the palace,

523
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,950
only to die in the chaos of battle.

524
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,520
You may be ruthless,

525
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,560
but I believe

526
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,760
you still value righteousness.

527
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,910
I've spared them until now

528
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,430
out of respect for the fact

529
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,720
that they died for Zhao Ming.

530
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:25,840
But

531
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,630
if you still refuse to hand over the power of Chaos,

532
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,210
I don't mind

533
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,280
letting them die once more.

534
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,760
What are you doing?

535
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,870
Since they insist on seeking death,

536
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,220
then let them taste

537
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,430
the torments of the Lava.

538
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,290
Lansheng!

539
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:46,870
Qiumin!

540
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,430
No one can survive more than three days in the Lava.

541
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,660
How could they endure it?

542
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,040
Then hand over the power of Chaos.

543
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,390
Or just leave them there.

544
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,670
Xie Xuechen survived for seven days.

545
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,350
Perhaps they can too.

546
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,040
You're toying with lives.

547
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,430
Ten thousand years ago,

548
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,720
when I cherished life,

549
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,800
the world didn't value my protection.

550
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,480
When they begged the Divine Clan for mercy,

551
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,870
bowing and confessing their sins,

552
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,680
they willingly chose

553
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,630
to have their lives toyed with.

554
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,350
Mu Xuanling!

555
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,110
Xuechen is gone,

556
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,630
but the Demon Lord has taken his soul.

557
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,720
May the ancestors of the Snow City protect us

558
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,080
and help humanity survive this crisis.

559
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,280
One crisis isn't over

560
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,590
before another begins.

561
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,460
Now the Divine Emperor of Fate

562
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,190
guards the Snow City.

563
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,870
Though he can stand against the Demon Lord,

564
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,520
his intentions are mysterious.

565
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,720
Where the Immortal Alliance's path

566
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,480
will lead?

567
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,240
We can only take it step by step.

568
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,350
If Xuechen were still here,

569
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,040
he could surely resolve this crisis.

570
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,080
Actually,

571
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,870
even now,

572
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,800
I still believe that Senior remains

573
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,840
within the Demon Lord.

574
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,630
Perhaps

575
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,670
there's still a chance to awaken him.

576
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,040
The Immortal Alliance claims to be open and upright,

577
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,150
yet you resort to such sneaky actions?

578
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,430
Are you here to surrender yourself?

579
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,190
Where is the Mr. Xie?

580
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,950
Xie Xuechen is long dead.

581
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,190
The current ruler of the Dark Abyss

582
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,110
is the Demon Lord.

583
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,430
My Senior has not perished.

584
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,630
He's merely been controlled

585
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,950
by the Demon Lord.

586
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
Stubborn fool.

587
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,870
[Temple of Divine Execution]

588
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,430
Your Grace,

589
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,520
this disciple of the Snow City

590
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,450
invaded the Dark Abyss

591
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,520
with ill intent.

592
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,240
I caught him on the spot.

593
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,190
I spared your lives that day in the Snow City,

594
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,910
and today you come seeking death?

595
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,000
Senior,

596
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,520
I know your soul hasn't been destroyed.

597
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,490
You must've had your body and mind

598
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,390
controlled by him!

599
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,640
I've come here

600
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,160
fully prepared to die.

601
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,760
Even if it means sacrificing myself today,

602
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,240
I will awaken you!

603
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,760
How utterly foolish.

604
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,800
Senior,

605
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,320
we grew up together.

606
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,670
No one knows you better than I do.

607
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,120
Since childhood, you've shouldered the world's burden.

608
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,380
Slaying evil

609
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,610
has been your lifelong ambition.

610
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,730
How can you now

611
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,400
be controlled by this vile demon?

612
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,000
Think of your father's last words.

613
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,520
Everyone in the Immortal Alliance is waiting for you.

614
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,280
The people of the world need you.

615
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,800
Wake up now!

616
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,590
Destroy this cruel and vile demon.

617
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,840
Don't let him destroy the world

618
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,390
you gave your life to protect!

619
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,010
You're asking for death.

620
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,320
Senior...

621
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,760
my life

622
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,520
was given by you.

623
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,800
When I was severely wounded,

624
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,590
you transferred your energy to me,

625
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,560
saving my life.

626
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,870
Now, if my life

627
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,430
can awaken you,

628
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,870
I...

629
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,760
will have died for a worthy cause.

630
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,760
Compared to death,

631
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,430
you may still have

632
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,350
some value in living.

633
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,480
Imprison him!

634
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,560
I've called you both here

635
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,480
to discuss something.

636
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,760
I hope to borrow the Celestial Artifact, the Black Wood Seal,

637
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,080
from the Jade Sky Palace.

638
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,840
It's a powerful tool for reinforcing arrays

639
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,760
and sealing energies.

640
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,350
What do you need it for?

641
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,350
I have my reasons.

642
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,670
No need to ask further.

643
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,320
The Jade Sky Palace does have the Black Wood Seal,

644
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,560
but

645
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,910
it is a rare treasure.

646
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,910
Only the past masters knew the location of it.

647
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,480
Now that Lansheng is gone,

648
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,670
no one knows its whereabouts.

649
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,720
By the way,

650
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,560
Bao is a Treasure Sniffer.

651
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,910
Perhaps she could find it.

652
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,350
Don't even think about using Bao!

653
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,560
I can try!

654
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,450
Bao.

655
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,090
I can try...

656
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,430
- What are you doing? - Bao!

657
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
This is a matter for adults.

658
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,910
You can't get involved.

659
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,820
Let me down. I'm going to try!

660
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,870
Lansheng, Xuanling, and Miss Gao

661
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,000
are all in danger.

662
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,430
I should

663
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,180
do my part to help!

664
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,320
Let me go!

665
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,630
As Treasure Sniffers,

666
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,520
we can not only detect treasures

667
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,720
but also tell whether a person is good or bad.

668
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
Yet with you, we can't figure it out.

669
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,050
Before, when you were Mr. Nan,

670
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,080
I couldn't tell.

671
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,240
And now,

672
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,180
as Fate,

673
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,630
I still can't tell.

674
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,000
Because fate is heartless,

675
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,670
knowing neither good nor evil.

676
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,480
Everything

677
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,670
is already destined.

678
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,950
Qiumin!

679
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,430
Qiumin!

680
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:23,560
Qiumin...

681
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,000
They say

682
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,000
no one can survive more than three days in the Lava.

683
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,560
I don't know

684
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,350
how much longer we can hold on.

685
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,760
Once, the Lava

686
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,040
was used to imprison the Fallen Deity.

687
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,670
Now that the Fallen Deity is gone,

688
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,560
the fury that lashes at us every hour

689
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,280
should be less, right?

690
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,350
Perhaps we can last longer.

691
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,240
Maybe

692
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,520
we can compete with Xie Xuechen

693
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,460
from back then.

694
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,120
Ten thousand years ago,

695
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,870
whether amidst the fire or the rebellion,

696
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,720
you protected me with your life.

697
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,840
When I fell into the time swirl,

698
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,950
you followed without hesitation,

699
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,350
ready to sacrifice your life.

700
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,120
Now, in this desperate Lava,

701
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,160
you've never thought of abandoning me.

702
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,840
I want to ask you,

703
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,320
why is that?

704
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,280
Because I love you.

705
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,350
In the war between humans and spirits,

706
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,910
there was the regret of my parents' sacrifice.

707
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,280
Ten thousand years ago,

708
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,070
there was the regret of Yan and Qingyang's tragic end.

709
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,870
Since coming out of the time swirl,

710
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,600
I've always had a voice in my heart.

711
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,640
It tells me

712
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,030
that I must hold on to the person I love in front of me.

713
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,870
I don't know when it started,

714
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,990
but when I see you smile,

715
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,390
I feel happy.

716
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,430
When I see you sad,

717
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:04,720
I feel sorrow.

718
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,870
Qiumin,

719
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,550
weather in our past or present lives,

720
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,510
I truly love you.

721
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,760
From childhood to now,

722
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,730
everyone has hoped

723
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,840
that I do everything perfectly.

724
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,760
But only you

725
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,370
have repeatedly helped me

726
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,320
in my imperfect, awkward moments,

727
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,600
even risking yourself to save me.

728
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,720
It's you who taught me

729
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,680
what it means to be loved,

730
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,760
what unconditional love is.

731
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,640
It's you who taught me to accept love

732
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,030
and to give love in return.

733
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,120
If this time,

734
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,720
we can survive this crisis,

735
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,870
from now on,

736
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,320
I'll guard and protect you.

737
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,390
It's settled then.

738
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,390
For the rest of my life,

739
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,350
I'll rely on you, my heroic lady.

740
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,470
Alright.

741
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,280
The Demon Lord is ruthless.

742
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,170
He definitely won't give up

743
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,120
until he gets the power of Chaos.

744
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,280
Gao Qiumin and Fu Lansheng

745
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,350
have been trapped in the Lava for a day.

746
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,910
If this continues, their lives may be in danger.

747
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,640
I must think of a way to rescue them quickly.

748
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,120
I heard last night,

749
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,420
a disciple from the Snow City

750
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,200
was captured by His Grace and imprisoned.

751
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,140
Yes.

752
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,610
Last night I passed by the prison

753
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,800
and heard the continuous screams

754
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,420
of that Snow City disciple.

755
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,770
It was terrifying.

756
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,980
I got so scared that I ran away.

757
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,870
With His Grace's ruthlessness,

758
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,650
I'm afraid

759
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,200
he doesn't have much time left.

760
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,120
Yan Tong!

761
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,240
Mu Xuanling?

762
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,470
How did you...

763
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,800
How did you end up here?

764
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,470
I came here willingly.

765
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,990
I want to awaken Senior's soul inside the Demon Lord.

766
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,390
Why bring this suffering upon yourself?

767
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,240
Has he

768
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,120
hurt you?

769
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,280
He hasn't hurt me.

770
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,760
He learned

771
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,120
that I have Senior's energy inside me,

772
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,120
so he locked me up here.

773
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,540
Last night,

774
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,200
he continuously injected his demonic energy into me,

775
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,640
seemingly...

776
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,430
to relieve some kind of pain.

777
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
The Demon Lord feels pain?

778
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,930
And he was using your body

779
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,010
to circulate his energy?

780
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,640
What exactly is he trying to do?

781
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,640
I don't know his intentions,

782
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,800
but when his demonic energy circulated,

783
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,410
I sensed

784
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,510
a strong Jade Vault aura.

785
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,680
This is proof!

786
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,120
I believe

787
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,280
Senior is still inside the Demon Lord.

788
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,070
His soul hasn't dissolved.

789
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,800
Given time,

790
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,910
I'm sure I can awaken him.

791
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,240
But based only on the Jade Vault aura,

792
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,910
it's difficult to draw a conclusion.

793
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,760
Before coming here,

794
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,840
I borrowed the Heart-Observing Seal from the Xuantian Sect.

795
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,390
Since our sect was taken over by the Dark Clan,

796
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,350
Senior has been studying curses,

797
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,680
creating the Heart-Observing Seal.

798
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,390
It not only reveals inner demons,

799
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,910
but also allows us to observe the true heart of a soul.

800
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,160
If I have the chance to explore the Demon Lord's true heart,

801
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,640
everything will become clear.

802
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,600
Observing heart...

803
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,240
It might be worth a try.

804
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,470
Take care of yourself.

805
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,320
Thank you, Miss Feng Yao,

806
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,430
for personally delivering the medicine.

807
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,470
It's nothing.

808
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,200
As long as you recover soon.

809
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,990
Thank you.

810
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:17,720
Try it.

811
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,990
The taste of this dried fruit

812
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,870
feels somewhat familiar.

813
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,120
Have you eaten it before?

814
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,030
It's just a feeling.

815
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,120
Eleven years ago,

816
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,950
Master saved me from an evil cultivator.

817
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,430
At that time,

818
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,660
I had already lost

819
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,870
all my previous memories.

820
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,350
What's your name?

821
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,120
Where is your family?

822
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,580
Master also thought

823
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,870
about helping me find my family,

824
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,800
but apart from the clothes I wore,

825
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,600
all I had was a bag of children's snacks.

826
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,870
The clues were too few.

827
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,320
Finding them was nearly impossible.

828
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,070
So I let it go.

829
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,120
I'm sorry.

830
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,430
I don't know why,

831
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,720
but when I see you,

832
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
I end up saying more.

833
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,470
It's fine if you don't remember.

834
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,550
Without the joy of obtaining,

835
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,550
there's no pain of losing.

836
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,950
Miss Feng Yao,

837
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,680
did you make this dried fruit yourself?

838
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,070
Yes.

839
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,840
An elder sister taught me.

840
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,600
Unfortunately,

841
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,870
she is already dead.

842
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,120
She died on a rainy night.

843
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,320
Life is unpredictable.

844
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,870
Rest well.

845
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,350
I'll leave first.

846
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,040
[Hall of Saints]

847
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,760
Yes,

848
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,670
life is unpredictable.

849
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,920
When it's time to let go,

850
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,480
then let go.

851
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,030
Your family

852
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,150
must wish

853
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,320
for your health and safety.

854
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,600
I've heard that the eldest son of the Greenview Heights

855
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,690
is highly skilled in medicine

856
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
and can save lives from the hands of demons.

857
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,560
Miss,

858
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,310
this is the only method we can try.

859
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,200
Yuan,

860
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,430
I'm going to the Greenview Heights for your medicine.

861
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,030
You must wait for me to return.

862

[Greenview Heights]

863
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,220
Here.

864
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,910
It's so bitter.

865
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,310
Try this.

866
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,870
Here.

867
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,030
Is it delicious?

868
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,800
Delicious!

869
