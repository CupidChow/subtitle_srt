17
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,860
[Episode 18]

18
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,540
There is such a long secret tunnel

19
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,310
hidden under my mother's room.

20
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,590
I can't believe that my father never told me about it.

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,440
It seems that Gao Fengxu,

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,870
has been hiding a lot of secrets

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,310
to you, his daughter.

24
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,280
This stone bed is covered by Spirit Gathering Arrays.

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,520
The only thing that does

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,590
is to absorb the aura of nature

27
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,430
for cultivators to use.

28
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,520
So,

29
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,310
my father locked my mother up in here

30
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,190
to nourish the Chaos Pearl.

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,080
I think

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,800
the truth might be even crueler.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,870
What truth?

34
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm a tuco-tuco.

35
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,240
A kid.

36
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,050
Just a filthy spirit slave without a spirit lock.

37
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,150
Take her away.

38
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,680
Madam's task comes first.

39
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,820
Prepare the sword array

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,910
and destroy this place.

41
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,680
There is no window.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,560
The sunshine

43
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,630
and noises from the outside world can't get in.

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,740
There is no trace

45
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,710
of anyone ever living here.

46
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,840
Just a stone bed covered by Spirit Gathering Arrays.

47
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,470
The size

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
doesn't even allow any movement.

49
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,120
So…

50
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:42,910
So,

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,240
this place is not for holding a living person.

52
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,710
It's for keeping a dead body.

53
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,280
Miss Gao…

54
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,430
I'm fine.

55
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,960
Go on.

56
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,150
The body of a Primal Celestial Maiden

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,120
contains endless vitality.

58
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,310
No one knows if that will disperse

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,430
as she dies.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,710
Your father visited this place often

61
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,720
after your mother passed away.

62
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,560
I think

63
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,390
he was using your mother's body

64
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,870
to keep nourishing the Chaos Pearl.

65
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,270
The Spirit Gathering Array

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,430
is to keep the vitality inside her

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,600
from stopping generating.

68
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,040
Mother!

69
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,310
Miss Gao…

70
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,600
Let me go! Leave me!

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,240
Let me go!

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
Don't kill me.

73
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,750
- Go! - Please!

74
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,000
Please!

75
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,560
Come here.

76
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,000
Don't kill me. Please.

77
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,510
Please!

78
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:02,950
Father!

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,390
Father, is it you who saved me?

80
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,310
Father!

81
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,560
Where are you?

82
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,830
Come out so that I can see you.

83
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:10,950
Father!

84
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,680
Father!

85
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,390
I want to see you.

86
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,000
Father!

87
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,070
- Father! - Bao!

88
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,830
Do you not want

89
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,040
Mother and I anymore?

90
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,800
Father!

91
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,920
Father!

92
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,190
Mr. Gao was once the leader of the Immortal Alliance.

93
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,480
Would he commit something like that?

94
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,920
When Miss Gao said

95
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
that Saint Miaohua was held captive and tortured

96
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,720
by Madam Su for years,

97
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,430
I thought that was weird.

98
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,340
If Saint Miaohua just asked

99
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,680
Su Ningxi to marry Mr. Gao

100
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,560
and forced her to nourish the Chaos Pearl,

101
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,920
why would Madam Su hate her so much?

102
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
I'm going to my mother's tomb.

103
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,870
Master said that my mother was buried with my father.

104
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,510
I will see for myself

105
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,870
if she is there.

106
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,270
If Mirage Palace still has the Chaos Pearl,

107
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,480
- then… - No matter what,

108
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,680
the truth shouldn't be buried.

109
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,120
Whoever did all evil things for the Chaos Pearl

110
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,310
should face the consequences.

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,800
The array is about to be ready.

112
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,800
Where is he?

113
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's forget about him.

114
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,870
Yes. We need to hurry up and destroy this place.

115
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,950
What's going on?

116
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,510
Let's go. This place is going down.

117
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:40,950
Come on.

118
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:42,720
Watch out!

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,160
Are you staying at your crime scene

120
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,830
so that the victims can get their revenge?

121
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,360
You are not getting out of here alive.

122
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,120
I don't have time to waste on you.

123
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,720
You are not controlled by Heartstring.

124
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,630
It's too hard to kill you.

125
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,600
I wanted to take the chance to get away,

126
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,400
and these two

127
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,440
annoying people got in my way.

128
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,720
Why did you travel with me in the first place?

129
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,240
To get the Chaos Pearl.

130
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,320
I've been telling you the truth.

131
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,870
The Chaos Pearl is still missing.

132
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,960
Why not keep lying to me?

133
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,200
I got the clue I wanted.

134
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,550
My master

135
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,240
can take over from here.

136
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,550
As for you,

137
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,270
maybe just die here.

138
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,270
However,

139
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,030
you still can't kill me,

140
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:05,960
can you?

141
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,340
Mu Xuanling.

142
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,510
Were you trying to kill me?

143
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,080
What's going on?

144
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,320
Where is Bao?

145
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,440
Bao!

146
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,080
Bao!

147
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,200
Lansheng. Qiumin.

148
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,550
Bao!

149
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,550
Why is your face bleeding?

150
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,870
Are you hurt?

151
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
That's not my blood.

152
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,320
The cultivators from Mirage Palace

153
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,840
tried to kill me.

154
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,390
My father saved me.

155
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,670
Your father.

156
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,030
Did you see him?

157
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,750
He won't come out and meet with me.

158
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,670
He got away again.

159
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,630
It seems that this little girl's father

160
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,360
is no common man.

161
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,960
Xuanling.

162
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,150
Xuanling, why are you tied up?

163
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,720
She's a bad person.

164
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,870
She should be tied up.

165
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,840
But Xuanling is not a bad person.

166
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,140
Xuanling.

167
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,480
You are not a bad person, right?

168
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,510
Yes. Bao.

169
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm not a bad person.

170
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,750
Will you help me?

171
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,840
Miss Mu.

172
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,630
Whatever you want,

173
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,670
don't trick and use a child.

174
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,030
The cultivators from Mirage Palace are dead.

175
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,200
They can't report to duty.

176
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,550
Madam Su will get suspicious soon.

177
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,910
There's no time to waste. Let's go to the graveyard first.

178
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,150
What about her?

179
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,870
I'll keep her close.

180
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,440
There's nobody in the coffin, as expected.

181
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,550
It's getting late.

182
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,240
Let's find a staging post

183
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,890
and rest for the night.

184
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,020
Mr. Xie

185
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,660
may have underestimated the power of your Jade Vault Technique.

186
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,910
I have got a lot of new information today.

187
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,010
I'm going to report to duty.

188
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,860
Xuanling!

189
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,480
See?

190
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,390
She's a bad person.

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,510
Move aside.

192
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,750
I will never let you get back to Sang Qi again.

193
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,670
Mu Xuanling.

194
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,200
You have other choices.

195
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,360
Xie Xuechen.

196
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,200
Stop lying to yourself.

197
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,030
I am the same as my master.

198
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,360
You and I are not the same kind of people.

199
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,150
You love humanity and the world.

200
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
I am a member of the Spirit Clan.

201
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,480
This world

202
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,600
has never treated me with kindness.

203
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,000
And I

204
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,600
have never loved this world

205
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,390
or you.

206
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,390
I've been lying to you

207
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,840
from the beginning.

208
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,320
I've seen your true heart.

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,480
Don't do anything that you will regret.

210
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,840
Are you really that unwilling to let me go?

211
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,720
How about this?

212
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,840
Come back to the Dark Abyss with me.

213
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,550
Use your intelligence and power

214
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,440
to eliminate Sang Qi

215
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,360
and become the new Lord of the Dark Abyss.

216
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,270
That should be easy for you.

217
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,790
In that case,

218
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,630
you've gotten rid of Sang Qi for good,

219
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,320
and we will be on the same path.

220
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,150
What do you think, Mr. Xie?

221
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,510
You shouldn't go back to that life.

222
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,790
How stubborn.

223
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,600
You are not getting away.

224
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,440
Give up.

225
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,320
What do you care?

226
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,720
Stay away!

227
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,200
Xuanling!

228
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,270
You are bleeding.

229
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,030
Bao!

230
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,320
Mr. Xie.

231
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,790
The blood…

232
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,670
Is that yours?

233
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,550
Only the blood of a direct relative

234
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,960
can activate a blood mirror.

235
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,150
It's Miss Mu's blood on the mirror,

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,270
yet Miss Gao can see.

237
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,910
You two are direct relatives.

238
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,080
You

239
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,750
are sisters.

240
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,960
How is that possible?

241
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,140
Who are you calling her sister?

242
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,550
So, Miss Mu.

243
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,530
Are you still leaving?

244
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,390
What do you think?

245
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,080
Before we get to the bottom of this, no one is leaving.

246
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,600
You first.

247
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,030
It's not like I'm intimidated.

248
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,720
I don't believe in something so ridiculous.

249
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,870
I'm not afraid.

250
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,480
See?

251
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,600
How…

252
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,960
How did that happen?

253
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:41,910
It's…

254
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,720
It's impossible.

255
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,390
This is absurd. It can't be true.

256
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,600
I am a member of the Spirit Clan

257
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,910
while she's a human.

258
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,960
How can we be direct relatives?

259
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,320
Maybe you have

260
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,000
the same mother and different fathers.

261
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,120
Don't knock it!

262
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,750
If my mother gave birth to two children,

263
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,030
how could I not know?

264
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,510
How could no one know?

265
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,030
The only explanation is that,

266
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,200
Fu Lansheng,

267
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,720
your blood mirror is not working.

268
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,000
That must be it!

269
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,080
You can say what you want about me,

270
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,750
but our artifacts always work.

271
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,640
Studying artifacts is the livelihood of Jade Sky Palace

272
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,400
for a thousand years.

273
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,510
How could we make mistakes?

274
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,390
Let me show you!

275
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,480
What's that?

276
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,750
It's not for a kid to see.

277
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,480
What are you doing?

278
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,480
What?

279
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,280
I didn't even see it clearly.

280
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,390
What is that?

281
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,760
What is it?

282
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,150
Let me go!

283
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,150
What is that?

284
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,270
- What's that? - Sorry.

285
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,030
I want to ask you guys

286
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,240
to keep this a secret among us.

287
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,320
Save my father some dignity.

288
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,480
Judging from the situation,

289
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,270
We'll have to ask

290
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,000
Madam Su about all this at the Mirage Palace.

291
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,100
[Bright Moon Inn]

292
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,620
[Decaying Immortal Pavilion]

293
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,840
They've been to the tomb in Moonlight Heights.

294
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,360
Su Ningxi's coffin

295
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,360
was empty.

296
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,840
They are traveling to Mirage Palace next.

297
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,970
Xie Xuechen might be smart,

298
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,440
but he's unlikely to think

299
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,670
that you'd come to my place

300
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,550
after leaving the Two Realms Mountain.

301
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,240
Isn't this your idea?

302
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,480
I usually get my medicine

303
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,070
on the first day of each month.

304
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,070
This month, there's still no news

305
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,110
about the medicine on the eighth.

306
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,960
You were

307
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,270
forcing me to come here.

308
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,000
All people say that Mr. Nan

309
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,270
is a warm and gentle man.

310
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,960
How come you are always so mean

311
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,480
when talking to me?

312
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,110
I have

313
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,270
saved your life, at least to say.

314
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,590
Back then,

315
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,790
your sibling born by your stepmother set you up

316
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,200
and a demonic cultivator kept you captive and tortured you.

317
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,160
I was the one

318
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,310
who saved you at the critical moment.

319
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,240
Sometimes I'd rather you didn't

320
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,830
when I think about that.

321
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,640
But you chose to live

322
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,680
on your own.

323
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,310
I didn't force you.

324
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,830
In the ten thousand years of this world,

325
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,830
there were only two people

326
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,440
born with ten spiritual channels.

327
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,550
Xie Xuechen is having a good life.

328
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
But how come you are in this bad situation?

329
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,920
You've lost nine out of ten of your vitality.

330
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,680
That one point

331
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,830
is close to nothing.

332
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,400
I'll give you a choice.

333
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,750
Take your life

334
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,200
with this sword if you want to give up.

335
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Or, if you want to live,

336
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,590
take the medicine.

337
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,270
There is one thing bad about the medicine.

338
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,920
Once you take it,

339
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,830
you will have to take it every month.

340
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,680
That's how

341
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,160
you can stay alive.

342
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,270
If you stop taking the medicine,

343
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,640
you will be dead

344
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,030
with double the pain

345
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,830
within a year.

346
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,640
If it's revenge that you want,

347
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,790
I can help you with that

348
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,310
if you are dead.

349
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,270
Have you thought this through?

350
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,960
The Spirit Clan.

351
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,110
The Spirit Clan slaughtered this place.

352
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
You knew,

353
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,440
didn't you?

354
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,510
Do you still

355
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,720
hate Xingye and me?

356
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,400
So

357
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,310
you let

358
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,030
the Spirit Clan slaughter us.

359
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,480
Xue and my brother hate me.

360
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,030
They colluded with someone

361
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,070
and destroyed my spiritual channels.

362
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,790
You led your disciples to suppress the Spirit Clan,

363
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,590
that's why they retaliated and brought massacre to this place.

364
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,960
This is my fate.

365
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,440
And yours as well.

366
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,830
It is the fate of Greenview Heights.

367
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,790
Father,

368
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,590
you are going to ruin a master

369
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,920
for a dead kid.

370
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,070
Right?

371
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
You didn't let me down.

372
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,110
From now on,

373
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,240
you are

374
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,590
the master of Greenview Heights.

375
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,720
You had your revenge

376
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,310
and met with the person you want to meet.

377
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,550
Mr. Nan,

378
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,550
where is the Chaos Pearl

379
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,270
that we agreed on?

380
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,160
I promised you

381
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,160
three wishes

382
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,110
to pay back your help.

383
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,070
Your first request

384
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,240
was to set up a killing array in Greenview Heights

385
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,640
and stall Xie Xuechen on his way back to the city.

386
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,680
The second

387
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,030
was to break the double-sided barrier in Snow City

388
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,680
and let Ignorance Demon into the city.

389
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,350
The third

390
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,270
was to leave a backdoor on the All-Seeing Jade Dragon Array

391
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,350
so that the Spirit Clan

392
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,960
can still get into the city.

393
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,550
I have done

394
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,350
all three things.

395
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,310
You didn't get the Chaos Pearl

396
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,510
is your problem.

397
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,070
I have no part in that.

398
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,880
You are helping the Decaying Immortal Pavilion

399
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,550
while assisting Xie Xuechen

400
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,830
to fight the Decaying Immortal Pavilion.

401
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,270
You are putting me in a hard position.

402
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,070
That is also your problem.

403
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,510
I don't work for you,

404
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,350
so I don't have to follow your order.

405
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,720
As for your threat of stopping the medicine,

406
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,970
to be honest,

407
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
whether you are

408
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,830
giving it to me or not

409
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,030
makes no difference to me.

410
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,440
Mr. Nan is a world-famous hero.

411
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,070
How dare I threaten you?

412
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,830
There's one thing that I don't understand.

413
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,270
Mr. Nan has been waiting for so long

414
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,270
to reunite with your old friend.

415
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,160
Are you really letting her go?

416
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,310
Don't you want to

417
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,270
take her for your own?

418
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,750
Do you need me

419
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,030
to kill Xie Xuechen?

420
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,200
That's my personal business.

421
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,830
You are no part of this.

422
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,400
I told you

423
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,550
that I wouldn't ask questions

424
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,680
about your collaboration with the Dark Abyss.

425
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,160
You

426
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,000
cannot meddle with my affair.

427
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,070
Mr. Nan, don't be mad.

428
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,070
I understand what you said.

429
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,350
I will not bother you

430
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,270
with what's happening next.

431
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,070
I will get you the medicine

432
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,110
every month on time

433
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,240
for the sake

434
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,640
of our cooperation.

435
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,640
There is one thing

436
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,880
that I'm curious about.

437
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,790
More than ten years

438
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,240
have passed,

439
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,110
and you haven't aged a day.

440
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,550
You also have

441
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,030
millennium-long treasures

442
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,310
such as the Phoenix Herb and Illusion Elixir.

443
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,160
Forgive me for intruding

444
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,960
but how old are you?

445
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,830
I stopped

446
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,030
counting my age

447
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,200
a long time ago.

448
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,960
There's no point.

449
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,000
Living for too long

450
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,880
is not necessarily a good thing.

451
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,440
The price

452
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,240
is way too painful.

453
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,270
Too painful.

454
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,880
Madam,

455
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,240
we've enquired across the Immortal Alliance.

456
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,510
We don't

457
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,000
have news on Qiumin yet.

458
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,220
You know how important she is.

459
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,270
Even if you have to travel to the Dark Abyss

460
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,200
or sacrifice thousands of people,

461
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,000
do get her back!

462
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,880
Yes.

463
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,480
Ningxi,

464
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,790
I don't have many days left.

465
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,240
If we meet in the afterworld,

466
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,960
will you blame me?

467
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,240
- Here's your money. - The world is disgusting.

468
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,580
If you knew that they would

469
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,640
become food when they grow up,

470
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,270
why bring them into the world?

471
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,510
Nice.

472
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,350
Ningzhen, run!

473
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,000
Ningxi!

474
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,590
Ningxi, I'm tired.

475
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,000
I can't keep running.

476
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,830
Rest here.

477
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,640
I'll go get you food.

478
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,510
Here.

479
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,720
How did you manage to do that?

480
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm not sure.

481
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,200
I just

482
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,880
felt its vitality

483
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,310
and gave it a shot.

484
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,530
That's wonderful!

485
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,180
We will never have to starve again.

486
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,790
They don't know what you can do

487
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,640
and tried to eat us.

488
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,070
How stupid!

489
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,550
If someone learns about this,

490
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,110
I will die even more horribly.

491
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:56,980
I know.

492
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,110
Madam,

493
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,270
this is the forest.

494
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,000
There is a location where the aura is extremely thick.

495
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,790
There could be some talented people here.

496
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,070
Ningxi, I'm scared.

497
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,400
You…

498
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,550
What do you want?

499
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,550
The body of a Primal Celestial Maiden.

500
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,110
The legend is real.

501
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,680
There are deities who reincarnate in this world.

502
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,750
Good kid.

503
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,160
How old are you?

504
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,790
What's your name?

505
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,790
I'm Xi.

506
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,200
I'm eight years old.

507
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,270
Xi.

508
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,790
I'm the Madam of Mirage Palace.

509
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,590
Will you come back to Mirage Palace with me?

510
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,350
I will accept you as my disciple

511
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,440
and teach you cultivation and spells.

512
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,750
You don't have to worry about surviving.

513
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,720
You may even achieve immortality

514
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,400
and go to any corner of the world as you wish.

515
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,590
I want to be with my sister, Zhen.

516
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,000
Ningxi, I'm scared.

517
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,920
I will protect you forever.

518
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,350
We will never be apart.

519
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,110
I failed to protect Qiumin.

520
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,160
After you left,

521
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,160
I haven't been able to do anything right.

522
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,030
Come with me to the Dark Abyss

523
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,000
and search for our young madam.

524
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,350
Elder, are we really traveling to the Dark Abyss?

525
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,160
That's Sang Qi's territory.

526
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,270
Elder, it's the young madam.

527
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,270
She's back.

528
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,030
Young Madam.

529
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,680
Young Madam.

530
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,550
Madam,

531
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,750
Qiumin is back.

532
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,270
Master.

533
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,270
What happened to your hair?

534
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,550
It's okay.

535
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,240
Mr. Xie.

536
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,880
You are back from the Dark Abyss.

537
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,200
Thanks to your prayer,

538
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,830
I will live for a little bit longer.

539
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,480
Mr. Xie, what important business

540
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,790
brought you here?

541
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,160
Things have changed in the Dark Abyss.

542
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,350
This might have something to do with Sang Qi.

543
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,000
Madam Su, may I ask you

544
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,270
to clear the room?

545
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,350
Madam Su,

546
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,790
how many children has Su Ningxi

547
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,270
given birth to?

548
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,590
What is that supposed to mean?

549
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,260
The whole world knows

550
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,680
that my sister was married to Gao Fengxu

551
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,640
and gave birth to a girl.

552
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,920
She left this world right after that.

553
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,750
I mean no offense.

554
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,800
I got an artifact

555
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,830
from Fu Lansheng

556
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,500
and a test says that Miss Gao

557
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,960
is related to Mu Xuanling.

558
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,880
Mr. Xie, how ridiculous.

559
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,960
Are you saying

560
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,310
that they are sisters?

561
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,590
My sister has only one child

562
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,000
and that is Qiumin.

563
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,880
Were you there

564
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,830
when she was in labor?

565
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,480
Of course.

566
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,310
When Qiumin was born, there were unworldly views.

567
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,750
The room was so full of light

568
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,070
that it was too bright to see.

569
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,070
Too bright to see.

570
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,790
So, you didn't actually see.

571
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,680
Mr. Xie,

572
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,000
are you trying to smudge my sister's name?

573
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,350
My sister did have a history with Sang Qi,

574
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,400
but they couldn't have had a child.

575
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,310
Back then, my sister was…

576
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,440
Master, calm down first.

577
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,550
We just want to

578
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
know the truth.

579
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,400
We are not trying to ruin my mother's reputation.

580
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,310
Madam Su,

581
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,550
forgive me for being presumptuous.

582
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,440
Gao Qiumin's talent

583
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,510
is not worthy of an unworldly view.

584
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,720
Mr. Xie and Mr. Nan

585
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,830
were born with ten spiritual channels,

586
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,270
but they didn't have

587
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,920
any unworldly view when they were born.

588
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,880
Can't you talk politely?

589
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,110
Madam Su,

590
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,590
It's easy to verify their relationship.

591
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,720
If you don't trust our artifact,

592
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,810
use Mirage Palace's methods

593
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,790
to test again.

594
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,700
I know you don't want

595
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,000
others to know about your sister's story.

596
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,590
That's why we are asking about this in private.

597
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,480
Don't you want to know

598
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,590
if your sister has another daughter?

599
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,400
Okay.

600
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,200
Let me sleep on it.

601
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,200
Do not reveal this

602
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,920
to anyone else.

603
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:50,880
Okay.

604
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,650
Su Ningzhen

605
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,680
did agree to a blood test.

606
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,350
That means something strange

607
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,920
did happen

608
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,030
when Su Ningxi was in labor.

609
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,920
That's why she's also suspicious.

610
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,760
We will know tomorrow.

611
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,030
Don't worry about it.

612
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,880
Worry?

613
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,440
I grew up with no parents by my side.

614
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,070
I'm used to being alone.

615
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,070
I've never thought of finding my family.

616
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,480
It's just that having a relationship with Gao Qiumin

617
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,110
upsets me.

618
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,440
The result better shows that there's no connection between us.

619
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,550
In that case,

620
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,840
I won't need to hesitate

621
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,360
when I kill Gao Qiumin.

622
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,480
If you don't care about families

623
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,400
and have no expectations

624
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,440
about your parents,

625
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,190
why did you give up your task

626
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,800
and come to Mirage Palace, which is most hostile to the Spirit Clan?

627
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,070
Because you will protect me.

628
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,440
How stubborn.

629
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,150
What do you care?

630
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,510
Related.

631
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,230
How are they related?

632
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,070
Why?

633
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,230
Master.

634
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,400
What are you looking for?

635
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,230
Let me help you.

636
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,140
[Dark Abyss]

637
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,320
Is it possible that she's…

638
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,550
When we were in Snow City,

639
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,480
Mu Xuanling mentioned

640
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,820
that she was a spirit slave in Moonlight Heights,

641
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,440
right?

642
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,800
She also mentioned that Gao Fengxu tried to kill her before he died,

643
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,800
right?

644
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,360
People say that she's a Spirit Clan member,

645
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,760
yet no one has seen her original form.

646
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,360
She said that her spiritual apertures were damaged.

647
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,510
She has no spiritual essence,

648
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,190
so she can't show her original form.

649
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,550
So, how do you know for sure that she's a Spirit Clan member?

650
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,360
When she was young,

651
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,330
she had demon patterns on her face.

652
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,710
Golden imprints

653
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:13,800
like runes.

654
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,880
That cannot be seen on human faces.

655
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,670
What kind of demon pattern?

656
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,630
Draw it.

657
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,110
Draw it and let me see.

658
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,480
I see.

659
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,150
This is

660
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,800
the truth about the light.

661
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,030
We were wrong.

662
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,280
All of us were wrong.

663
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:12,710
Master.

664
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
What's going on with you?

665
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,360
Master.

666
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,400
Master.

667
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,280
I'm in bed.

668
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,630
I'm getting in after 5 seconds.

669
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,630
I'm telling you that I'm in bed.

670

Five.

671
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,030
Four.

672
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,710
Three.

673
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:43,880
Two.

674
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,400
What is it?

675
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,250
We are in Mirage Palace.

676
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,150
I'm worried that you will stir things up.

677
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,670
So?

678
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,280
So, I'm going to keep you in check.

679
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,510
[Warble Hall]

680
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,880
Your mind is not clear right now.

681
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,440
I think it's better for me to watch you.

682
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,400
I was just staying in my room.

683
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,230
You barged in in the middle of the night.

684
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,190
Which one of us

685
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,030
is confused right now?

686
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:22,960
You, of course.

687
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,710
Is that you being reasonable?

688
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,110
I've tried to be reasonable.

689
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,880
Did that work?

690
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,920
Of course!

691
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,800
When you reasoned with me,

692
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,510
I felt like my mind was cleansed,

693
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,280
and I wanted to be a good person deep down.

694
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,630
What's the most important thing about being a good person?

695
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,230
Do not lie.

696
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,630
Fine.

697
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,590
Maybe I'm not that eager

698
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,400
to be a good person.

699
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,840
How about you?

700
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,000
You insisted

701
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,550
on hanging out in my room at such a late hour.

702
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,760
That's not up to a gentleman's code.

703
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,630
I am no gentleman.

704
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,960
I can be ruthless.

705
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,960
If you don't want me to knock you out,

706
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,000
stay put.

708
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,920
You know that I'm not a good person.

709
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,710
Why do you have to fancy me?

710
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,510
I don't want to tell you right now.

711
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,960
If you want to know,

712
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,000
stay by my side.

713
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,030
Don't leave.

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,030
What if

715
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,920
I do a horrible thing one day.

716
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,920
Will you still fancy me?

717
00:39:59,070 --> 00:39:59,920
Yes.

718
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,150
But I will be watching you

719
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,920
so that you won't have a chance to do that.

but his sweet words are so determined.

How strange!

00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,000
a few facts tomorrow.

Master mean today?

732
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,590
I was supposed to investigate the Chaos Pearl.

733
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,320
How come I just keep getting more mysteries?

734
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,670
I wonder if it's a good thing

735
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,230
if the whole truth comes out.

736
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,070
Miss Gao.

737
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,590
What brought you here?

738
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,920
I thought you were going to wait outside the palace.

739

Are you here to make fun of me?

740
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,960
No, of course.

741
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,760
I got you some snacks.

742
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,590
I don't want you

743
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,710
to feel sad over what happened lately.

744

Even if I want to feel sad,

745
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,590
I don't even know where to get started.

746
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,400
There are so many things

747
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,670
that I want to know

748

about my mother.

749
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,480
Did she love Sang Qi?

750
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,000
Or did she love my father?

751
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,630
If she gave up love

752

and married into Moonlight Heights,

753
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,920
has she ever been happy?

754
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,440
Did she look forward to my birth?

755
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,670
My father used to tell me

756
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,360
that he loved my mother deeply.
