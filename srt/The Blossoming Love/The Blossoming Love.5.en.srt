18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,430
Because you're from the Spirit Clan,

if you're willing to hand over the token,

20
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,280
I can keep your whereabouts secret.

It seems the token isn't with you.

22

Since she's here,

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,560
the token must be hidden

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,400
It's just an act.

the reason they are doing these things

109
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,680

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,550
- Not the person. - Next!

189
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,020
- Not the person.
- I was punished to clean the front yard.

190
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,130
[Ma Hezheng]
Next!

191
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,290
Next...

192
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,860
Senior can testify for me...

193
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,670
Madam.

194
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,390
How's Xie Xuechen's progress?

195
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,510
There were some actions in the Warmth Pavilion.

196
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,240
The Serpent Spirit who stole the token is dead,

197
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,000
but we didn't find the token.

198
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,870
Keep watching.

199
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,080
Understood.

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,080
What about Qiumin?

201
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,030
She has summoned all the disciples in the palace

202
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,400
and is questioning them one by one

203
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,000
about their whereabouts from the night before last to today.

204
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,910
She suspects

205
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,870
there's a mole inside the palace.

206
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:06,960
Yes.

207
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,000
However,

208
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,630
there are too many disciples in the palace.

209
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,480
She's making quite a stir.

210
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,600
Should I stop her?

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,670
No need.

212
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,550
Let her investigate.

213
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,550
The Mirage Palace

214
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,080
hasn't been cleaned for too long.

215
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,870
It's a good opportunity to clean it up.

216
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,440
Go tell Qiumin

217
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,320
to search every room

218
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,480
to see where the token really is.

219
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,270
Do we have to search every room?

220
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,200
Won't this

221
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,960
make the disciples uncomfortable?

222
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,750
Uncomfortable?

223
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,030
I'm not just searching rooms,

224
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,870
I'm going to search everyone's bodies.

225
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,960
Do they dare to be uncomfortable?

226
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,550
Of course not.

227
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,240
I'll go deliver the message right away.

228
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,480
Zai Xi.

229
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,790
Madam.

230
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,840
What have you been doing

231
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,150
from the night before last to today?

232
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,390
Are you suspecting me, Madam?

233
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,550
How could that be?

234
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,480
I'm just asking casually.

235
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,120
I was formulating medicine the other day,

236
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,000
but encountered some difficulties.

237
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,150
So I went to the library at night to consult the texts

238
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,750
until midnight

239
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,270
when I heard the palace alarm go off,

240
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,960
and realized the Spirit Clan had stolen the token.

241
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,440
By the time I got there, you had already injured her.

242
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
The Spirit Clan had already fled.

243
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
From yesterday to today,

244
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,270
I've been refining medicine in the alchemy room.

245
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,000
I only came out an hour ago

246
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,790
and heard about the Young Madam's actions.

247
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,320
The disciples

248
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,270
guarding the library and alchemy room

249
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,030
can confirm this.

250
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,870
I see. Go ahead.

251
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,840
What are you looking at?

252
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Your people?

253
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,910
What are you here for?

254
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,270
It's windy here.

255
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,200
I bring you some medicine to keep away the cold.

256
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,030
I don't drink wine.

257
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,390
Then I'll drink it myself.

258
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,440
This wine is quite good.

259
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,240
When I was in the Dark Abyss,

260
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,870
we never saw the light of day.

261
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,510
Though there were flowers and plants,

262
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,320
they were all soaked in demonic energy all day long.

263
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,550
The wine brewed from them

264
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,910
also carried poison.

265
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,550
We

266
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,960
often drank poisoned wine with antidote.

267
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,550
Knowing the danger,

268
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,200
but still unable to resist

269
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,320
the desire in our hearts.

270
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,360
We rushed towards it eagerly.

271
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,030
Now it's fine.

272
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
I can drink as I please.

273
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,080
I heard the tallest building ahead

274
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,960
is the Spirit Management Bureau,

275
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,790
the nightmare place for countless Spirit Clan members.

276
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,030
If it weren't for the Spirit Management Bureau,

277
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,030
this hellish place,

278
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,390
if the lord of the Mirage City

279
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,390
isn't Su Ningzhen,

280
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,150
this place actually

281
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,910
looks like a human paradise.

282
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,320
Why did you lie to Gao Qiumin today,

283
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,360
saying you couldn't defeat that Serpent Spirit?

284
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
I wasn't lying to her.

285
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,600
You were lying to Su Ningzhen?

286
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,480
No...

287
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,600
not just Su Ningzhen,

288
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,750
but the entire Immortal Alliance.

289
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,870
I don't know who the mole is.

290
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,390
I have to keep it from everyone for now.

291
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,840
Only if I show weakness

292
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,440
will the enemy think there's an opportunity.

293
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,600
Oh, our Mr. Xie

294
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,360
has learned to deceive.

295
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,550
What's this?

296
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,630
Those close to the dark are tainted.

297
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,080
Fine!

298
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,510
I've misled you.

299
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,390
But,

300
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,270
what if they believe it's true

301
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,440
and come to kill you?

302
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,200
Then let them come.

303
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,240
So our Mr. Xie

304
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,910
is really that self-confident.

305
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,150
But I guess,

306
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,870
in the face of absolute power,

307
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,080
all schemes are useless.

308
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,200
Is there so much to write down?

309
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,150
Maybe

310
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,320
you're just used to yourself,

311
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,600
but in my eyes,

312
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,790
you're still quite fresh.

313
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,720
What's wrong?

314
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,670
Are you curious about how I wrote you?

315
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,480
Want to see?

316
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,550
Not curious at all.

317
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,360
He's quite arrogant.

318
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,420
[He's pretty self-confident, and he's quite arrogant]

319
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,870
Today is the 9th of the month.

320
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,240
Sir, it's time for your medicine.

321
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,750
Alright, I'll take it soon.

322
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,120
Greenview Heights has been out of the Immortal Alliance for years.

323
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,910
You have never been interested

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,150
in the matters of the Immortal Alliance.

325
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,720
Why are you getting involved this time?

326
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,600
Is it for Xie Xuechen

327
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,360
or...

328
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,910
for that old friend?

329
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,840
Rather than saying it's for someone,

330
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,080
it's more like it's for myself.

331
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,480
I wanted something interesting.

332
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,910
I've been bored for so many years.

333
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,080
Finally, someone interesting appeared,

334
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,320
and some interesting things are happening.

335
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,320
I also want to see

336
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,270
how this story

337
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,550
ends up.

338
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,360
By the way,

339
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,960
had the token already been stolen the night before last

340
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,680
when you escorted someone

341
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,510
back to the Mirage Palace?

342
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:16,920
Yes.

343
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,720
Then when you saw Su Ningzhen,

344
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,680
did you notice anything strange?

345
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,860
At that time, the Mirage Palace

346
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,000
was busy with the search.

347
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,830
I also asked Su Ningzhen a few questions,

348
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,590
got the general idea of things

349
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,310
and left.

350
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,720
I didn't notice anything unusual.

351
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,110
Sir, are you suspecting Su Ningzhen?

352
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,030
We came here to investigate.

353
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,270
There was quite a stir,

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,550
both openly and secretly.

355
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,790
But she didn't stop us at all.

356
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,560
That doesn't seem like her style.

357
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,350
When I looked at Madam Su's expression,

358
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,110
that kind of anger

359
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,550
didn't seem like an act.

360
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,680
Speaking of something unusual,

361
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,480
it seems

362
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,750
there's really something off.

363
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,200
[Celestial Inn]

364
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,510
I've inquired about every person

365
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,590
in the Mirage Palace,

366
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,000
and verified it all.

367
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,750
I haven't found anyone suspicious.

368
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,830
And I've carefully searched everyone,

369
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,720
checked their rooms,

370
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,070
and didn't find the token.

371
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,350
Xie Xuechen,

372
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,680
are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

373
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,310
There's no mole in the Mirage Palace.

374
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,000
Are you sure

375
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,790
you've checked everyone in the palace?

376
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,120
I'm sure I've carefully checked

377
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,640
every single person.

378
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,590
I even checked Elder Zai Xi.

379
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,110
Except for my madam.

380
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,640
My madam couldn't possibly be the one.

381
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,920
There's one more person.

382
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,880
Have you checked her?

383
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,400
Who else?

384
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,240
Cui Wanwan.

385
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,590
That night when I escorted Cui Wanwan

386
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,640
back to the Mirage Palace,

387
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,200
I paid a visit to Madam Su.

388
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,480
When I left, I saw a patch of green hooked leaf

389
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,310
outside the hall.

390
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,200
I don't know much about plants,

391
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,070
But I remembered it

392
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,590
because the hooked leaf

393
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,880
looked quite unusual.

394
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,720
Also,

395
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,640
I didn't see any hooked-leaf trees nearby.

396
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,720
I was curious where it came from,

397
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,550
but that thought was fleeting.

398
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,830
At the time, I didn't pay much attention to it.

399
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,480
So what?

400
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,440
Miss Gao, you grew up in the Mirage City,

401
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,110
familiar with spiritual flowers and plants.

402
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,240
You should know better than us

403
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,350
that the Mirage City

404
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,680
doesn't have hooked-leaf trees.

405
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,240
So, it must have come from outside the city.

406
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,830
The hooked-leaf plant has many backward hooks.

407
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,000
It's easy for it to get caught on someone's clothing.

408
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,160
Before it's picked, the leaf is green.

409
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,830
Once picked,

410
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,000
it turns brown within one hour.

411
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,790
Feng Yao just said

412
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,350
the hooked leaf was green.

413
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,070
This only proves

414
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,160
that someone rushed into the city that night.

415
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,920
Even if there was that leaf,

416
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,790
it might have been left by the Serpent Spirit.

417
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,880
We've checked.

418
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,790
The Serpent Spirit entered the city four days ago.

419
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,640
If it was her,

420
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,920
the leaf would have already changed color.

421
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,240
The token's hiding place is well guarded.

422
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,000
It's impossible for that Serpent Spirit

423
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,110
to break the array on her own.

424
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,640
So, Cui Wanwan

425
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,200
must have come back to assist.

426
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,070
Miss Gao,

427
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,200
when you were attacked outside the city,

428
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,110
it was planned in advance.

429
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,880
You were possessed by the Dark Clan

430
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
and went to Greenview Heights,

431
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,440
while Cui Wanwan took the chance

432
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,160
to sneak back into the city and steal the token.

433
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,350
She tried to create an alibi

434
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,510
and clear herself of suspicion.

435
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,830
These are all your side's words.

436
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,810
Where's the evidence?

437
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,620
Where's the leaf?

438
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,580
We already told you,

439
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,110
Feng Yao didn't pay attention to it,

440
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,260
so she definitely didn't bring the leaf back.

441
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,680
Besides, even if she brought it back,

442
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,640
the leaf would have changed color by now.

443
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,310
It can't prove the timing.

444
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
You don't have any evidence,

445
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,550
and now you're just making baseless accusations.

446
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,550
Cui Wanwan has been in the Mirage Palace for ten years.

447
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,350
And everything has been fine during these ten years.

448
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,480
She couldn't have done this.

449
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,030
You've personally inquired and searched

450
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,110
and eliminated all other possibilities.

451
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,750
So what remains,

452
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,920
even if hard to accept,

453
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,880
is the truth.

454
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,400
It can't be her.

455
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,070
What's the reason for your firm belief?

456
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,750
I want to believe her.

457
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,200
Want to believe?

458
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,920
Now, it's the Mirage Palace that lost the token.

459
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,610
As the young madam,

460
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,900
you aren't thinking of retrieving the token soon

461
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,510
to make up for the Mirage Palace's mistake.

462
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,740
Instead, you plan to risk the safety

463
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,880
of the entire Immortal Alliance and Humans

464
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,270
to gamble on a bond of loyalty.

465
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,110
How generous of you!

466
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,750
Do you think

467
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,720
we're busy here

468
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,590
just to entertain you?

469
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,550
Looks like Miss Mu

470
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,680
has some ill will against Miss Gao.

471
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,070
Yes.

472
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,750
I don't like her.

473
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,720
I've never liked her.

474
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,790
[Elegance Pavilion]

475
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,350
Senior,

476
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,480
you're here!

477
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,400
How do you know it's me

478
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,240
before the door is even open?

479
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,110
Because only you

480
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,000
knock like that every time.

481
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,030
What's this?

482
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,720
Well,

483
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
I just visited the Celestial Inn,

484
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,570
and on my way back,

485
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,480
I specially brought this for you.

486
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,830
Looks delicious!

487
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,110
You told me before

488
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,030
that you suffered a lot when you were little,

489
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,440
and when you grew up,

490
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,880
your favorite food became sweets.

491
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,030
Thank you, Senior.

492
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,310
By the way,

493
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,770
since we didn't find anything,

494
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,220
did Mr. Xie and the others

495
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,030
complain anything?

496
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,350
They said

497
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,550
the previous investigation direction was wrong,

498
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,110
so they need to rethink.

499
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,030
It's really delicious.

500
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,400
Wanwan,

501
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,070
do you think

502
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,590
the one colluding with the Spirit Clan to steal the token

503
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,880
is really one of our own people?

504
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,590
What do they want?

505
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,480
Is it something the Mirage Palace can't provide?

506
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,110
Why betray us?

507
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,510
Senior,

508
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,400
they say you can't know a person from their face.

509
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,180
In this world, people live

510
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,640
for themselves, after all.

511
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,880
Is that true for you, too?

512
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,480
You have something you want as well?

513
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,200
Of course.

514
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,750
Everyone has something

515
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,880
they desire, right?

516
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,640
As for me,

517
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,160
I don't want to suffer anymore.

518
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,720
I just want to live like this forever,

519
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,960
not needing to be extraordinary,

520
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,790
just being a regular cultivator,

521
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,480
living an ordinary life.

522
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,480
And also,

523
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,830
always staying by your side,

524
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,920
watching you

525
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,830
become the greatest female cultivator of the Humans,

526
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,440
and watching you stand atop the Humans!

527
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,550
Senior...

528
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,640
how come...

529
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,790
I'm so tired all of a sudden?

530
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,640
Wanwan,

531
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,110
I naturally believe in you,

532
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,310
but I can't stake

533
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,750
the entire Mirage Palace and the Humans

534
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,830
on this gamble.

535
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,030
Wanwan, fortunately, it wasn't you.

536
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,960
Just should sleep well.

537
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,720
When you wake up,

538
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,590
everything will return to normal.

539
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,110
We found it!

540
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,310
Let's go!

541
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,000
Yan Si,

542
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,030
you must immediately take the token

543
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,880
back to the Master.

544
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,550
What about you?

545
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,790
I still have a mission.

546
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,680
I must stay hidden here

547
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,270
and cannot expose myself.

548
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,350
Later, I'll pretend to return from outside the city.

549
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
They won't suspect me.

550
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,160
Hurry and leave.

551
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,270
Be careful.

552
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,030
Who are you?

553
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,030
How dare you steal the token from the Mirage Palace?

554
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,680
The Spirit Clan?

555
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,680
Madam.

556
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Seal off the entire city.

557
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
No one is allowed out.

558
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,720
Lock down the entire city and search for the Spirit Clan.

559
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,030
Guard all the pharmacies.

560
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,000
All fire-type medicines are forbidden for sale!

561
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:14,830
Yes, madam!

562
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,680
Have you found anything?

563
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:32,960
- No. - No.

564
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:33,960
Keep searching.

565
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:34,880
Understood.

566
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,110
Are you Cui Wanwan from the Mirage Palace?

567
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,240
Miss, don't be afraid.

568
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,740
We were entrusted by Miss Gao

569
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,640
to come assist you.

570
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,000
I see you've injured your arm.

571
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,400
This place isn't far from the Mirage City.

572
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,400
Let me escort you back to the city for treatment.

573
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,270
Thank you.

574
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:16,960
Yan Si,

575
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,920
the plan has begun.

576
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,270
The great task will succeed.

577
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,510
I won't let you die in vain.

578
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,440
[Mirage Palace]

579
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,270
Young Madam,

580
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,310
Mr. Xie has arrived.

581
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,350
Why are you here?

582
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,440
You're not here for that leaf, are you?

583
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,000
I've already searched thoroughly.

584
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,480
Nothing here.

585
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,350
I've also searched the room

586
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,400
where Wanwan stayed.

587
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,440
No token.

588
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,510
Please stop suspecting her.

589
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,270
We came here this time

590
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,400
to visit Madam Su.

591
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,070
Hey, you don't have any evidence.

592
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,550
Don't make false accusations at my madam.

593
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,070
She's just too suspicious.

594
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,310
Don't harm Wanwan.

595
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,790
Miss Gao, you're overthinking.

596
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,030
We've already exposed our whereabouts

597
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,510
while capturing the Serpent Spirit.

598
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,350
It's impossible

599
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,070
to keep investigating secretly.

600
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,200
So,

601
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,440
there's no need for us to hide anymore.

602
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,720
Xuyue and I have been in the city

603
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,680
for a while now.

604
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,960
As juniors,

605
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,640
we should visit Madam Su.

606
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,640
What about your sharp-tongued cousin?

607
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,830
And that female guard?

608
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,640
They're at the inn, guarding the array.

609
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,270
Guarding the array?

610
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,960
What array?

611
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,640
Though the Serpent Spirit has already taken her own life,

612
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,550
Feng Yao gained her spiritual essence.

613
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,640
I've been thinking deeply.

614
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,590
Suddenly, I remembered

615
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,200
an array recorded in ancient texts

616
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,030
called the Rewinding Array.

617
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,720
It can be activated within four hours.

618
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,960
When it's ready, we'll place

619
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,030
the spiritual essence into the array

620
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,160
so that we can access the Serpent Spirit's memories.

621
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,700
We will quickly discover

622
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,110
who the mole in the Mirage Palace is,

623
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,920
who's behind her,

624
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,400
and what their plan is.

625
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,480
We'll know everything clearly.

626
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,350
Miss Gao, you seem a bit upset.

627
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,590
Are you worried the array won't work,

628
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,310
or are you afraid

629
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,680
we might really find out the person?

630
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,720
Whoever we find, we'll deal with them.

631
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,000
There will be no mercy.

632
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,460
[Celestial Inn]

633
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,590
Come out.

634
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,960
Since you're here, why hide your face?

635
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,750
Why not be honest

636
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,680
and show your true face?

637
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,830
Even if you destroy this array,

638
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,550
it won't matter.

639
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
As long as we have the Serpent Spirit's essence,

640
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,440
we can restart

641
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,480
the second, third... array.

642
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,440
Don't waste your efforts.

643
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
Look at you.

644
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,400
You're just watching the show from the outside,

645
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,400
not helping at all,

646
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,400
huh?

647
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,400
The trap was set right in the spiritual essence.

648
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,590
Naturally, we needed her

649
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,680
to get it first.

650
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,400
Why is it you?

651
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,270
Why?

652
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,270
I told you,

653
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,160
everyone has something

654
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,110
they desire.

655
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,350
What do you want?

656
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,830
I told you before

657
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,350
about my background.

658
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,030
But that wasn't true.

659
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,790
Do you want to hear the real story?

660
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,550
When I was very young,

661
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,240
my biological parents

662
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,240
sold me

663
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,750
to human traffickers who make disabled beggars.

664
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,750
Do you know what they were involved in?

665
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,960
Do you know how cruel it is?

666
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,400
You don't know,

667
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,400
but my biological parents did.

668
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,070
But they still sold me

669
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,680
just for a few coins.

670
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,510
Then they went on to gamble.

671
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,590
They were already deeply in debt,

672
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,440
why didn't they stop being greedy,

673
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,880
still hoping to turn things around

674
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,480
and become rich?

675
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,000
But luckily,

676
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,680
two monkey spirits passing by

677
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,590
saved me,

678
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,110
took me back to their settlement,

679
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,310
and raised me.

680
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,720
They were kind to me,

681
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,790
and I regarded them

682
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,070
as my real family.

683
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,200
But one day,

684
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,510
several injured human cultivators

685
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,590
passed by there.

686
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,270
The monkey spirits are pure-hearted,

687
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,400
so they took them in

688
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,750
and worked hard

689
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,070
to find spiritual herbs

690
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,350
to heal their wounds.

691
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,000
But that night,

692
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,000
they set up a Spirit Slaying array

693
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,680
and killed all the monkey spirits

694
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,270
just to take

695
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,270
their spiritual essence for a reward.

696
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,030
Senior, you've lived a privileged life.

697
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,200
Everyone has pampered and catered to you.

698
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,200
Have you ever seen true human nature?

699
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,460
Do you know how vile it can be

700
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,880
and how easily it can be tested?

701
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,790
The real demon isn't in the Dark Abyss.

702
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,110
It's here in the human world.

703
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,400
Since this world

704
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,880
hasn't given the Spirit Clan a way to live,

705
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,190
then I'll find

706
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,030
a new way for them.

707
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,150
Dose your new way

708
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,250
mean cooperating with the Dark Abyss

709
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,320
and letting them destroy the Humans?

710
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,150
What's wrong with that?

711
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,510
But you're human too!

712
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,360
If I could, I wouldn't want to be human!

713
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,840
You knew all along

714
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,150
that we've already suspected you.

715
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,220
With such an obvious trap,

716
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,280
why would you still jump into it?

717
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,510
You should understand.

718
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,480
Just like you want to believe me,

719
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,360
but you don't dare bet the Mirage Palace

720
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,930
and the Humans on it.

721
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,230
I'm the same.

722
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,480
I also have something

723
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,070
more important than my life to protect.

724
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,190
Yan Si can die,

725
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,590
I can die too.

726
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,670
But our plan cannot be exposed.

727
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,070
Our great task must proceed.

728
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,230
Luckily,

729
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,000
this is just a trap.

730
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,320
Who is the master

731
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,000
of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion,

732
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,800
who can make you so devoted?

733
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,110
It seems

734
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,440
she doesn't plan to confess.

735
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,510
Wanwan, even though you deceived me,

736
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,070
there's one thing that's true.

737
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,280
All these years,

738
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,670
among all the sisters of the Mirage Palace,

739
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,070
you've always stayed by my side.

740
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,280
I don't want you to be harmed.

741
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,510
I don't want you to die.

742
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,230
As long as you hand over the token

743
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,960
and tell me who's behind it,

744
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,880
I'll go beg the Madam to spare your life.

745
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,880
Is that okay?

746
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,800
At this point,

747
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,510
you're still willing to trust me?

748
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,280
Of course, I'm willing to trust you.

749
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,670
Turn back.

750
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,440
If...

751
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,710
if you want to save the Spirit Clan,

752
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,840
you can discuss it with me.

753
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,920
We'll figure out a way together.

754
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,510
Okay?

755
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,510
Alright.

756
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,840
Alright.

757
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,360
I'll give you the token.

758
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,510
Don't come closer!

759
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,110
Senior,

760
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,440
you're still too naive.

761
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
Cui Wanwan, you're insane!

762
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,150
Move!

763
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,710
Gao Qiumin,

764
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
you really are a fool.

765
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,440
All these years,

766
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,920
you thought everyone's respect for you

767
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,290
was because they liked you

768
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:53,960
or respected you?

769
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,000
It's just because of your identity.

770
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,000
I'm no different from them.

771
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
I hate you too.

772
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
And that Su Ningzhen,

773
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,840
she controls you at every turn.

774
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,190
You don't even know how to resist.

775
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,590
Someone like you,

776
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,630
still thinking of helping me?

777
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,320
You're not just naive,

778
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,360
you're foolish.

779
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,320
Have you said enough?

780
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,280
Yes, I've said enough.

781
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,360
Let's go our separate ways from now on.

782
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,480
Wanwan!

783
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,800
Just being a regular cultivator,

784
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,480
living an ordinary life,

785
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,320
always staying by your side,

786
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,440
watching you

787
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,590
become the greatest female cultivator of the Humans,

788
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,070
and watching you stand atop the Humans!

789
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,880
She deserves to die.

790
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,150
Search her.

791
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,880
It's alright.

792
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,110
What you're afraid to do,

793
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,070
I will do for you.

794
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,630
What's wrong?

795
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,280
It seems

796
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,190
everything is going too smoothly.

797
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,440
Isn't smoothness a good thing?

798
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,230
Mr. Xie,

799
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,510
thank you all for your help this time.

800
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,440
We will

801
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,150
remember this kindness.

802
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,280
Madam, you're too polite.

803
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,450
I sincerely invite you all

804
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,680
to be our guests at the Mirage Palace tonight,

805
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,280
so I can show my hospitality.

806
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,710
Mr. Xie, please don't refuse.

807
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,000
Since Madam invited,

808
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,840
we will certainly attend the banquet.

809
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,960
That's great.

810
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,880
I'll go back to the palace and make arrangements.

811
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,110
Are you sure you're members of the Immortal Alliance?

812
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,400
Su Ningzhen looks

813
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,800
even colder than Sang Qi.

814
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,710
Don't speak carelessly.

815
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,480
Why do you look so upset?

816
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,670
Is it because of Cui Wanwan's words?

817
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,070
I thought

818
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,550
you only stood with the Humans,

819
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,760
I didn't expect you to sympathize with the Spirit Clan.

820
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,880
Then why did you

821
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,280
stop me

822
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
from killing Gao Qiumin?

823
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,290
I judge based on right and wrong.

824
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,510
It has nothing to do with Clans.

825
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,320
Gao Qiumin's wrongdoings didn't deserve death.

826
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,480
If you wanted to kill her,

827
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,510
I naturally had to stop you.

828
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,600
So, that means,

829
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,190
if I had more right reasoning,

830
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,960
you would also side with me?

831
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,630
Except you.

832
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,840
Why?

833
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,000
Your reasoning

834
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,110
is mostly nonsense.

835
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,630
What's wrong with nonsense?

836
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,110
Nonsense is still reasoning.

837
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,300
[Mirage Palace]

838
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,360
This time, we've eliminated the mole

839
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,320
and retrieved the token

840
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
thanks to your help.

841
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,280
I'll toast you all.

842
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,440
I don't drink wine.

843
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,400
Then let's substitute with tea.

844
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,110
That's fine.

845
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,000
Please.

846
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,480
Please.

847
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,510
Mr. Xie,

848
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,840
you were trapped in the Dark Abyss.

849
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,400
We were slow to respond

850
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,630
and failed to rescue you in time.

851
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,710
Instead, you came to help while injured.

852
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,110
I truly feel ashamed.

853
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,150
You're being too hard on yourself.

854
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,710
But,

855
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,800
Mr. Xie and Mr. Nan,

856
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,670
since you came to my place this afternoon,

857
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,110
why didn't you tell me beforehand?

858
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,880
The so-called "Rewinding Array"

859
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,480
was just your trick of luring the enemy.

860
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,710
Could it be

861
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,230
you two

862
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,880
don't trust me?

863
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,590
How could that be?

864
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,280
It's just that there are many people in the Mirage Palace.

865
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,400
If we're luring the enemy,

866
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,440
it's better if fewer people know.

867
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:36,800
Speaking of which,

868
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,760
we only informed Miss Gao

869
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,630
after we set the trap.

870
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,320
Madam,

871
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,250
I don't think

872
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,760
- all the Spirit Clan members are... - Enough.

873
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,550
Let's not talk

874
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,320
about unpleasant things at this banquet.

875
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,590
We have homemade wine.

876
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,550
It's made with rare spiritual flowers.

877
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,710
Except for Mr. Xie,

878
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,840
the rest of you should try it.

879
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,510
I've already sent someone to get it.

880
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,550
It'll be here soon.

881
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:03,960
Please.

882
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,030
What are you doing here?

883
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,670
Zai Xi?

884
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,030
Why is it her bringing the wine?

885
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,000
The Soul-Stealing Gu?

886
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,230
Xie Xuechen!

887
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,670
Elder Zai Xi!

888
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,000
Don't touch her! It spreads easily.

889
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,360
It's the legendary Dark Abyss Gu curse.

890
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,190
Why would it be here?

891
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,670
The Dark Abyss Gu curse?

892
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:03,670
