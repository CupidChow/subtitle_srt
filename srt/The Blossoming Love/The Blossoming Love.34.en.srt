perhaps,

192
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
you should take a look at.

193
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,860
[Everjoy Palace]

194
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,550
You shouldn't get used to all this.

195
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,720
You're truly heartless.

196
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,720
This ruined life

197
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,080
has come to this point.

198
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,510
It's enough.

199
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,390
You once said

200
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,120
you've only ever used me,

201
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,200
that you never loved me.

202
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,270
Was that true?

203
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,550
I'll ask you one last time...

204
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,750
I'll ask you one last time!

205
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,030
Can you stop lying to me?

206
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,200
What are you doing here?

207
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,700
Leave!

208
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,200
I won't leave!

209
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,870
You still won't tell the truth,

210
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,150
will you?

211
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,400
You risked being burned alive

212
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,880
just to ask me these questions?

213
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,770
When did you become so crazy?

214
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,000
To deal with someone like you,

215
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,420
of course, I must use crazy methods.

216
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,000
Is the answer really that important?

217
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,960
Yes.

218
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,440
I've told you

219
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,030
that no matter when,

220
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,880
the answer is always the same.

221
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,240
Leave.

222
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,960
Leave!

223
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,160
You're not even afraid of death,

224
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,310
yet you use a better life as an excuse

225
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,160
and push me away.

226
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,750
Do you think I'll believe that?

227
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,640
I was using you the whole time.

228
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,510
Stop imagining things!

229
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,400
I just saw the fragment of the Celestial Ladder.

230
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,070
That's the treasure of Nanyuan.

231
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,680
So, you hid it back then,

232
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,680
didn't you?

233
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,920
You're right.

234
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,350
I'm just a fool.

235
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,810
I couldn't see everything you did,

236
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,400
every word you said was a lie.

237
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,310
You meant to push me away.

238
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,720
You wanted me to give up,

239
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,440
because you know,

240
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,030
as long as the King of Xilin is alive,

241
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,750
he will never truly set you free.

242
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,540
He will keep using you to control me,

243
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,400
until I die.

244
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,680
Right?

245
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,160
Does asking these questions matter now?

246
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,030
In this situation today,

247
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,720
Qingyang must die.

248
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,350
Then I'll die with you.

249
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,110
I don't need that.

250
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,750
This is my vow.

251
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,750
Yan

252
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,590
will always protect the princess.

253
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,790
This was the vow I made in my heart.

254
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,270
In the years I left Xilin,

255
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,160
I broke my vow.

256
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,590
But today,

257
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
I won't leave.

From today on,

276
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,160
there will be no more Qingyang and Yan in this world.

00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,260
♪I desire nothing else...♪

278
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,200

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,590
is it fortunate?

280
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,590
Sometimes it is.

281
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,830
Has Fate

282
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,510
mentioned where the divine child is?

283
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,400
Well...

284
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,720
he hasn't.

285
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,400
Since Fate does not answer,

286
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
I no longer wish to wait!

287
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,070
Now go to all the water sources in the human realm,

288
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,310
whether by poisoning or emptying them,

289
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,750
bring forth a dry spell

290
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,200
as a punishment!

291
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,960
And inform the humans

292
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,830
that the source of the disaster

293
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,110
lies with Zhao Ming,

294
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,830
and to end the disaster,

295
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,880
a sacrifice of young boys and girls

296
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,240
must be made!

297
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,720
Understood.

298
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,920
The area affected by this dry spell

299
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,200
and the duration of it

300
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,540
hasn't been seen or heard of

301
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,550
in nearly a hundred years!

302
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,310
Dongze is filled with starving people.

303
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,680
They've even resorted to man-eating.

304
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,560
The nobles collectively request Your Majesty

305
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,480
to follow the divine edict

306
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,480
and sacrifice 3,000 young boys and girls.

307
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,590
Please, Your Majesty, follow the divine edict

308
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,960
and sacrifice 3,000 young boys and girls!

309
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,830
He is a foolish ruler!

310
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,790
A disaster!

311
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,720
A disaster!

312
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,340
It's all his fault!

313
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,280
- Kill him! - Kill him!

314
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,350
He's not fit to be a wise ruler!

315
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,400
Kill him!

316
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,000
He's not even human!

317
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,160
He doesn't want us to have peace!

318
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,000
A beast!

319
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,350
When the war ended,

320
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,920
the army returned to the city,

321
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,640
the people cheered along the way.

322
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,440
How little time has passed,

323
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,680
and yet things have turned out this way.

324
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,200
They probably forgot

325
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,680
who was protecting them all along.

326
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,830
May the deities bless us.

327
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,030
Please forgive them.

328
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,440
May the deities bless us.

329
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,790
May the deities bless us.

330
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,350
Bless us...

331
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,640
What are you doing?

332
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,640
This is for the deities!

333
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,400
That chicken is mine.

334
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,110
That duck is mine.

335
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,400
I'm so hungry.

336
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,790
Me too.

337
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,640
Guarding these dead things,

338
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,590
yet treating human life like dirt.

339
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,480
What dead things?

340
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,830
This is great disrespect to the deities!

341
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,350
Get away from here!

342
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,480
Who do you think you're talking to?

343
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,350
I don't care who you are.

344
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,830
The deities are the highest in this world!

345
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,720
Exactly.

346
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,640
They're causing trouble here.

347
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,660
- Exactly. - Exactly.

348
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,960
They're dishonoring the deities...

349
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,920
Stop that!

350
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,400
The deities will punish us!

351
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,270
This is unacceptable!

352
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,750
This will anger the deities!

353
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,880
It's not allowed!

354
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,070
- It's not allowed! - It's not allowed!

355
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,110
Why?

356
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,400
The deities will punish us.

357
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,920
The deities will bring down their wrath.

358
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,510
You're Saint Emperor Zhao Ming!

359
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,680
Your Majesty, spare us!

360
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,350
Dongze forbids sacrifices.

361
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,030
You can't even feed

362
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,350
your parents and children,

363
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,510
yet you still sacrifice to the deities!

364
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,590
Please spare us!

365
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,480
May the deities forgive us...

366
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,110
You have a lot of nerve,

367
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,070
daring to secretly capture young boys and girls.

368
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,750
Your Majesty, spare us.

369
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,310
We were just following orders.

370
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,720
The act of capturing young boys and girls

371
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,480
started in many villages long ago.

372
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,720
It was not just here.

373
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,750
The law doesn't punish the masses.

374
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,240
Please, Your Majesty, spare us!

375
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,400
He Zhou,

376
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,960
gather 3,000 young boys and girls,

377
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,270
and bring them to the palace immediately.

378
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,920
Yes!

379
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,310
You're bringing the young boys and girls to the palace

380
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
to protect them,

381
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,160
right?

382
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,590
Only then

383
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,480
will they not be captured by others for sacrifice.

384
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,030
Your people

385
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,830
have made you sad.

386
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,960
Are you angry with them?

387
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,480
They were just scared.

388
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,070
The humans have no divine channels, except for me.

389
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,510
They can't cultivate.

390
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,960
Facing a disaster far beyond their own strength,

391
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,680
they will be fearful,

392
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,000
confused,

393
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,680
complain,

394
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,680
and even do wrong things.

395
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,000
I admit, I have been disappointed,

396
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,960
but I will not give up.

397
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,790
I know,

398
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,510
what you see

399
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,400
is not just about one person or one thing,

400
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,070
it's about the whole world

401
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,440
and all affairs.

402
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,070
I remember you once told me

403
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,640
that people are simple,

404
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,070
yet also complex.

405
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,030
They're weak,

406
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,830
yet they can also have strength.

407
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,030
There's one thing

408
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,920
I've never told you.

409
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Actually,

410
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,200
I already know I'm the Chaos Pearl.

411
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,400
When did you find out?

412
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,680
But...

413
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,830
I want to stay by your side as Pearl.

414
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,640
Do you know

415
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,240
why I came to the human realm?

416
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,070
The Chaos Pearl is kind and merciful,

417
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,270
unwilling to see the suffering of the people.

418
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,640
So it sacrifices itself to mend the heavens.

419
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,720
Mending the heavens

420
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,440
was Hao Tian's order.

421
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,750
Although I can't recall things from the past,

422
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,110
I faintly remember

423
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,640
that Hao Tian once told me

424
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,790
that the existence of me and the Book of Fate

425
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,350
was only to maintain the order and operation of the world.

426
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,510
As for the life journey of all beings,

427
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,790
and the rise and fall of fortunes,

428
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,590
it has nothing to do with us.

429
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,110
My connection with this world

430
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,590
is you.

431
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,070
You taught me

432
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,550
what it means to be human,

433
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,550
what love is,

434
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,830
what it means to protect.

435
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,480
Once the young boys and girls arrive,

436
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,070
I will protect them with you.

437
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,880
Just like you said...

438
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,680
that's the resolve to protect.

439
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,270
He Zhou,

440
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,750
we found a few new divine servants,

441
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,720
four boys and two girls,

442
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,200
all born in the year of Cang Hao.

443
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:57,880
Come with me.

444
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,270
My mother said,

445
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,000
once you ascend to the heavens, you can never return home.

446
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,440
What's there to be sad about?

447
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,680
To be chosen as a divine servant

448
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,550
is a family's honor.

449
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,440
That's a good thing.

450
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,440
Becoming a divine servant means being sacrificed.

451
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,960
We will die!

452
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,000
Don't talk nonsense.

453
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,110
That's not death.

454
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,720
It's just leaving this mortal body

455
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
and going to the Celestial Realm

456
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,000
to serve the deities.

457
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,070
His Majesty has given orders

458
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,960
to take good care of these children.

459
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,640
Understood.

460
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,030
Does His Majesty want us to die?

461
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,160
Don't misunderstand him, dear.

462
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,720
His Majesty was born to be favored by the heavens.

463
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,830
He should never be tainted by the mortal world.

464
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,440
But I have been by his side for over ten years.

465
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,110
I have seen him work tirelessly every day

466
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,790
for ordinary people like you and me.

467
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,680
Hasn't your village

468
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,400
received his protection

469
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,350
and blessings?

470
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,200
Even the Saint Emperor

471
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,590
has his difficulties,

472
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,110
but we must trust him.

473
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,000
He will give us the best of the world.

474
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,550
Your Grace, you summoned me.

475
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,790
What's it for?

476
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,030
I want you to help the Emperor Zhao Ming

477
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,480
become the strongest in the world.

478
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,310
Zhao Ming intends to slay the deities.

479
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,510
Helping him

480
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,030
is like destroying the Celestial Realm.

481
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,960
Now, the two realms are in chaos,

482
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,550
the divine artifact falls in love,

483
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,920
the four seasons are out of order,

484
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,570
and disasters are widespread.

485
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,880
Relying solely on you to act on my laws

486
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,110
is not enough.

487
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,160
Only the strongest in the world

488
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,750
can be my vessel

489
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,640
and help me descend.

490
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,720
Your Grace,

491
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,550
you actually decide to personally correct the errors

492
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,400
and save the world?

493
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,070
Rather than fixing the mistakes,

494
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,160
it's better to start over.

495
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,350
What does starting over mean?

496
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,550
When the time comes,

497
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
you will know.

498
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,000
Off you go.

499
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,030
Your Majesty,

500
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,270
the advisor has returned.

501
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,550
You have been away for days.

502
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,030
Are you returning

503
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,440
because you're concerned about the palace

504
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,070
and the people here?

505
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,830
What I'm concerned about

506
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,880
is your will.

507
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,200
The Jun Tian Sword...

508
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,310
Your Majesty, you were born with divine channels,

509
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,240
and also own the sovereign fortune.

510
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,440
If the Jun Tian Sword can acknowledge you as its master,

511
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,310
you could fight against the Divine Clan.

512
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,480
I've figured out the Jun Tian Swordsmanship,

513
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,400
and even visited the entrance to the Guixu.

514
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,510
However,

515
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,310
I can only sense a strong sword energy,

516
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,110
but cannot make the Jun Tian Sword appear.

517
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,200
During my time away,

518
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,960
I searched for ancient texts

519
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,440
and found a record.

520
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,440
The Jun Tian Sword

521
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,160
originates from the primal chaos energy.

522
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,550
To draw it out of its sheath,

523
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,510
we need to use killing aura as bait.

524
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,750
Using killing aura as bait?

525
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,000
Your Majesty,

526
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,880
you can use human blood as a sacrifice.

527
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Other's blood

528
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,720
or your own will work.

529
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,440
Thank you for your guidance.

530
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Since you've returned,

531
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,070
will you stay?

532
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,160
No.

533
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,110
By fate,

534
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,960
I will meet with Your Majesty again.

535
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,500
[Graceful Palace]

536
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,020
[Ming]

537
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,400
Pearl,

538
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,240
[Bright Palace]

539
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,070
I will leave the palace for a few days.

540
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,790
What are you going to do?

541
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
Retrieve the sword from the Guixu.

542
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,830
When will you depart?

543
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,000
Today.

544
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,680
Right now.

545
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,750
I will go with you!

546
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,240
No,

547
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,480
I will go alone.

548
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,750
The Guixu is dangerous.

549
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,440
How can Your Majesty go alone?

550
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,310
I will accompany you.

551
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,200
My mind is made up.

552
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,270
But Your Majesty...

553
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,510
You should stay in the palace,

554
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,350
protect the children well,

555
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,590
and make sure nothing happens to them.

556
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,680
Alright.

557
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,640
I will stay in the palace,

558
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,550
behind you,

559
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,640
waiting for your return.

560
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,590
Take good care of yourself.

561
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
In ten days,

562
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,920
I will return.

563
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,630
Go ahead and do what you need to do.

564
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,440
I will do my best to protect here.

565
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,320
I trust you.

566
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,710
I trust you too.

567
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,670
I'm leaving now.

568
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,300
[A few days later]

569
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,360
You've almost worn out this book.

570
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,110
What are you looking for?

571
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,150
Since I am transformed from the Chaos Pearl,

572
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,110
how could I have no Chaos Power?

573
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,320
When you first took form,

574
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,550
we were also puzzled.

575
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,190
His Majesty guessed

576
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,840
that your spiritual power was exhausted

577
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,880
when you mended the heavens.

578
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,510
Although he gave you one soul,

579
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,550
it was still too weak

580
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:28,960
for an ancient artifact.

581
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,710
Is there no way

582
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,440
to quickly recover it?

583
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,920
The matter of the divine artifact

584
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,030
is even more mysterious than that of the Divine Clan.

585
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
Don't worry too much.

586
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,110
The palace has increased its defenses.

587
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,320
I'll go check things out now.

588
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:46,960
Pearl,

589
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,510
you seem

590
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,190
a bit different now.

591
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,440
Different?

592
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,030
You seem

593
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,880
to be more and more like His Majesty.

594
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,030
But don't learn from him to work without rest.

595
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,400
His Majesty is not here,

596
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,070
so you must take care of yourself.

597
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,630
By what means

598
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,710
could I help Zhao Ming?

599
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,710
If I can recover all the memories,

600
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,670
will that restore my Chaos Power?

601
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,280
Yan.

602
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,510
Che.

603
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,670
Yan.

604
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:03,710
Give it to me.

605
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,400
Yan,

606
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,030
this is the bread you gave me yesterday.

607
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,030
There are two pieces left.

608
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,920
I'll return them to you.

609
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,590
Why not keep them for yourself?

610
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,550
No need.

611
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,480
I need to go to the palace with them today.

612
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,670
The foolish Emperor lied to us, saying there would be a sacrifice,

613
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,960
but he secretly left the palace and is enjoying himself.

614
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,590
We plan to gather the divine servants

615
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,440
and make the sacrifice immediately.

616
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,440
I've heard that the palace has enough water and food.

617
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,900
We can bring some back

618
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,230
to relieve everyone's immediate suffering.

619
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,190
Yan,

620
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,630
do you want to come with us?

621
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,280
Who is spreading these rumors?

622
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,510
This is no rumor.

623
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,360
The high-ranking officials in the palace said it themselves.

624
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,000
If we want to survive,

625
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,190
we can only rely on ourselves.

626
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,510
If you want to join,

627
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,230
meet me in the palace later.

628
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,630
I'm leaving now, Yan.

629
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,590
If you're worried about a palace rebellion,

630
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,760
I'll go with you.

631
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,480
You should stay here

632
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,150
and take care of your mother.

633
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,360
Yan,

634
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,190
Zhao Ming is not only your Saint Emperor,

635
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,710
he is also my savior.

636
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,030
If he hadn't solved the crisis for me,

637
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,030
we'd have been separated long ago.

638
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,630
Isn't that right?

639
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,630
The Soul Scattering Poison,

640
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,920
given by the Divine Clan.

641
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,670
They wanted you to kill me?

642
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,070
Why didn't you follow their order

643
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,110
but chose to tell me instead?

644
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,880
I'm not that righteous.

645
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,150
I did indeed consider killing you.

646
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,150
But even if

647
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,230
I managed to kill you,

648
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,400
this ruined life wouldn't end.

649
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,510
For the rest of my life,

650
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,670
I would be a puppet controlled by them.

651
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,630
And my mother

652
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,360
would suffer endless abuse,

653
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,590
never seeing hope again.

654
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,320
I ask Your Majesty

655
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,960
to exchange my life

656
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,230
for my mother's safety

657
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:55,960
and freedom.

658
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,030
If you want to solve this situation,

659
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,150
you can.

660
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,000
Just kill me.

661
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,440
But do it at your birthday feast

662
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,630
in front of everyone.

663
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,110
Rising from the ashes,

664
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,630
reborn like a phoenix.

665
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,920
Zhao Ming has already told me everything.

666
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,550
This is a Fireproof Stone.

667
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,630
It will protect you from the flames.

668
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,980
But after today,

669
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,760
there will be no more Princess Qingyang in this world.

670
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,000
Princess Qingyang should have died long ago.

671
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,360
But I find

672
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,550
you're quite different from others.

673
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,280
If there were more time,

674
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,710
I would definitely be friends with you.

675
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,190
If there is another chance,

676
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,190
I'd like to get to know you again.

677
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,800
I also have to thank Pearl.

678
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,610
The blood of the Divine Saintess

679
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,840
can cure the divine poison.

680
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,320
It was her blood

681
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,000
that cured the poison for me and my mother.

682
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,070
She saved us.

683
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,510
If we are to discuss gratitude,

684
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,510
it should be

685
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,920
that you stay, and I will go.

686
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,880
All along,

687
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,670
I could never outtalk you.

688
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,670
You won't let me go.

689
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,760
We agreed.

690
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,710
No matter what happens,

691
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,360
we will face it together.

692
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,360
Alright.

693
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,320
Respect the divine edict, and overthrow Zhao Ming!

694
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,480
Respect the divine edict, and overthrow Zhao Ming!

695
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,960
Respect the divine edict, and overthrow Zhao Ming!

696
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,000
Humans

697
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,710
truly can't stand the test or stirring up.

698
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,400
I only arranged a few people,

699
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,760
gave them a little push,

700
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,280
and so many people joined.

701
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,960
Truly foolish and laughable.

702
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,150
Breaking his heart with the people he cares for.

703
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,960
Brilliant!

704
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,590
I really want to see

705
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,670
Zhao Ming's expression

706
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,840
when he faces the rebellion of those

707
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
he fought to protect.

708
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,070
It's coming soon.

709
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,000
Where are the people you arranged?

710
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,460
Respect the divine edict, and overthrow Zhao Ming!

711
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,760
Just those two leaders.

712
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,670
For a few bags of rice,

713
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,320
they sold their souls to me.

714
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,030
Now they are no longer

715
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,670
ordinary humans,

716
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,480
but servants of me!

717
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,810
As for dealing with Zhao Ming,

718
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,190
they likely stand no chance.

719
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,800
But against ordinary humans,

720
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,590
they're more than enough.

721
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,110
Hand over the divine servants!

722
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,000
Where are the divine servants?

723
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,400
Hand over the divine servants!

724
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,070
Hand over the divine servants!

725
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,440
You have disregarded your agreement with His Majesty

726
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,710
and barged into the palace.

727
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,630
What are you trying to do?

728
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,230
The sacrificial offering was promised for tomorrow,

729
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,400
but where is the foolish Emperor?

730
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,880
He lied to us,

731
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,070
but wants us to obey him?

732
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,190
Do you think we're fools?

733
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
- You... - I'll hold them off here.

734
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,110
Hurry and leave!

735
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,320
I'll go find reinforcements.

736
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,070
Find a way to get to the divine servants' residence.

737
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,000
Protect the children.

738
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,880
Be extra careful.

739
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,640
She's the foolish Emperor's trusted one.

740
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,150
She must know where the divine servants are.

741
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,030
Catch her!

742
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,590
Catch her!

743
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,110
Hand over the divine servants!

744
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,670
See it now?

745
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,030
This is human nature.

746
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,070
Can you calm this rebellion?

747
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,800
Divine artifacts cannot interfere with human affairs.

748
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,150
Then just watch here.

749
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
You lost the bet.

750
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,920
The third bet:

751
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,000
Human nature is selfish.

752
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,000
They repay kindness with hatred.

753
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,480
According to the bet,

754
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,760
you should return with me.
