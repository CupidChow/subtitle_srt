Qiumin.

207
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,440
Madam!

208
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,480
Why are you outside my room

209
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,510
so late at night?

210
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,440
Well,

211
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,030
people from the Snow City came by.

212
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,550
They said you're needed at the Hall of Integrity tomorrow...

213
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,270
to deal with Mu Xuanling.

214
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,150
Do you sympathize with that witch

215
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,390
and plan to plead for her?

216
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,090
How many times

217
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,360
will you repeat the same mistake?

218
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,960
When did you become so soft and timid,

219
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,440
sympathizing with the Spirit Clan and the Dark Clan?

220
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,790
Madam,

221
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,670
she did save our Mirage Palace once.

222
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,550
And back when Sang Qi attacked the manor,

223
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
she sacrificed herself for me.

224
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,550
I owe her a debt of gratitude.

225
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,200
So could you

226
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,240
plead for her tomorrow?

227
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,080
Madam, I'm begging you.

228
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,120
Madam...

229
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,000
You have your mother's kind heart,

230
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,320
but Qiumin,

231
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,120
some people and some things

232
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,750
are not worth your concern.

233
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,840
They should never have existed,

234
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,200
let alone stayed behind.

235
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,240
Besides,

236
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,010
if Xie Xuechen, as the Lord of the Snow City,

237
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,750
wants to correct his mistakes

238
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,840
and resolve the disputes,

239
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,870
he must personally execute that witch.

240
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,150
Otherwise, the name of the Snow City

241
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,960
will be tarnished.

242
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,750
Kill me.

243
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,910
Use my life

244
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,000
to prove your unwavering faith,

245
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,910
to silence the accusations of colluding with the Dark Clan.

246
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,790
Mr. Xie,

247
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,550
before becoming the Alliance Leader,

248
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,390
you must

249
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,360
first execute the Dark Abyss Saintess,

250
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,320
completely

251
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,270
sever ties with the Dark Clan.

252
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,440
Kill me,

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,120
and you'll once again

254
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,030
be the symbol of justice,

255
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,080
the beacon of righteousness.

256
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,240
Mu Xuanling, it's time to go.

257
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,550
He's finally made up his mind.

258
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,360
Taking advice always brings benefits.

259
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,080
Let's go.

260
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,240
Even though Miss Mu is the Dark Abyss Saintess,

261
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,150
she hasn't done anything evil.

262
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,510
Dealing with her this way

263
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,150
is far too cruel.

264
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,790
Thankfully, I didn't tell Bao.

265
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,240
If she found out,

266
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
she'd be heartbroken.

267
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,150
Nan Xuyue,

268
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,630
let's just leave.

269
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,870
Watching this execution

270
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,030
is too harsh.

271
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,790
Here they come.

272
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,750
Sir, the person has been brought.

273
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,270
Do you have any last words?

274
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,550
Yes.

275
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,870
Your injury...

276
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,240
has it healed?

277
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,480
It's fully healed.

278
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,590
Then I'm relieved.

279
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,440
Let's begin.

280
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,270
Mr. Xie,

281
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,440
what is the meaning of this?

282
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,480
Why not execute her outright?

283
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,030
I've expelled her demonic power

284
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,920
and will imprison her in Snow City for the next thousand years.

285
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,000
That is enough.

286
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,030
She is the Dark Abyss Saintess.

287
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,640
That alone is enough to sentence her to death.

288
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,880
Mr. Xie, this will be hard to justify.

289
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,110
It will especially disappoint

290
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,790
the cultivators of the Xuantian Sect.

291
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,750
Miss Mu was controlled by demonic energy that day.

292
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,720
After regaining her senses,

293
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,830
she even stopped Ignorance Demon.

294
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,590
Her heart is kind.

295
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,640
The dead are gone.

296
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,480
How she is dealt with

297
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,110
is a decision

298
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,550
for the living to make.

299
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,160
If Mr. Xie won't kill her,

300
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,640
then I will.

301
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,590
Madam!

302
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,000
this is Snow City.

303
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,000
This is my decision.

304
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,550
Mr. Xie,

305
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,440
are you openly shielding her?

306
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,750
Protecting the guilty is called shielding.

307
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,400
But Mu Xuanling...

308
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,830
is innocent.

309
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,200
Innocent?

310
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,030
Mr. Xie, what do you mean by this?

311
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,000
Since the Dark Abyss,

312
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,310
Mu Xuanling has assisted me at every turn,

313
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,200
helping the Immortal Alliance,

314
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,270
recovering the jade token, uncovering traitors,

315
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,720
and eliminating the Three Demons.

316
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,750
She was even willing to sacrifice her own life.

317
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,880
For someone like her,

318
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,450
if the Immortal Alliance blames her

319
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,270
simply based on her identity

320
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,960
and seeks her death,

321
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,200
it is the Alliance's failing.

322
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,400
I do not agree,

323
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,640
nor will I comply.

324
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,940
Mr. Xie,

325
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,160
don't blur the line between good and evil!

326
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,880
Does the judgment of you

327
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,590
define absolute truth?

328
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,160
I, Xie Xuechen,

329
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,270
live by my own principles

330
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,680
and make my own judgments.

331
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,920
Expelling Mu Xuanling's demonic power

332
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,510
is not a punishment,

333
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,790
but a means to help her

334
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,070
completely leave the Dark Abyss behind.

335
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,110
Imprisoning her for a thousand years

336
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,920
is to settle the past.

337
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,510
From this moment forward,

338
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,590
Mu Xuanling

339
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,160
belongs to the Snow City.

340
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,030
Who would've thought

341
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
that Mr. Xie is also a man of compassion?

342
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,270
Miss Mu's survival

343
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,920
is truly a blessing.

344
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,680
Indeed, it's a good thing.

345
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,880
Congratulations, sir, on mastering the Separation Array.

346
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,960
The world often admires offensive arrays,

347
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,240
but few realize that the protective arrays,

348
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,920
which ensure survival, are the hardest to master.

349
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,680
If one cannot become the strongest,

350
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,110
then being able to escape

351
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,790
from powerful enemies with arrays

352
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,200
is a supreme strategy in itself.

353
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,750
Once this array is activated,

354
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,720
it will consume a great deal of energy from the user.

355
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Unless it's a life-or-death situation,

356
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,440
use it carefully, sir.

357
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,590
Even moments of life or death

358
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,200
are also destined by fate.

359
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,070
So why bother escaping with an array?

360
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,750
Perhaps this array

361
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,070
will never need to be used.

362
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,350
An array I thought unnecessary to use

363
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
was almost activated.

364
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,880
A person I believed lost forever

365
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,550
was finally reunited.

♪Because you've stayed the same...♪

388
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,720
I asked her...

389
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,680
whether she'd be willing to follow me

390
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,240
to live in seclusion at the Greenview Heights.

391
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,510
For your sake,

392
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,510
she refused.

393
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,640
There's another way.

394
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,880
Expelling her demonic power

395
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,270
would prevent it from attacking her.

396
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,200
However, that is highly dangerous.

397
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,510
For a Spirit Clan member with damaged spiritual channels,

398
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,920
it would eventually lead to physical collapse

399
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,480
and death.

400
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,480
If she has the protection of the Jade Vault Technique,

401
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,350
she could survive.

402
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,880
This is another secret.

403
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,880
Ten years ago,

404
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,760
my father found me,

405
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,310
severely injured and near death, at the Moonlight Heights.

406
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,880
At that time, my spiritual channels were destroyed.

407
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
A human body

408
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,680
requires the opening of yin and yang channels

409
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,530
to reach peak physical condition.

410
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,640
Only then can the spiritual channels be opened for cultivation.

411
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,160
If your spiritual channels were destroyed,

412
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,750
how did you reach the pinnacle of the Spiritual Form stage?

413
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,000
The Xie family

414
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,590
has fought tirelessly for generations, often suffering injuries.

415
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,640
Thus, we are trained in healing techniques from a young age.

416
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,400
At the brink of death,

417
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,480
I comprehended the Jade Vault Technique.

418
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,000
Within three days, my spiritual channels were restored,

419
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,480
and my cultivation not only remained intact but improved.

420
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,030
The Jade Vault Technique...

421
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,550
has such miraculous effects?

422
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,000
So,

423
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,790
you intend to open her spiritual channels?

424
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,310
Yes.

425
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,610
With spiritual channels,

426
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,260
she will be able to cultivate spiritual power.

427
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,400
no longer suffering from demonic energy consuming her body,

428
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,070
nor fearing the burning sun,

429
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,920
or returning to the Dark Abyss.

430
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,790
She can live honorably

431
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,070
in the human realm.

432
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,590
Granting the Spirit Clan spiritual channels

433
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,000
could change the balance of the three realms.

434
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,200
But...

435
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,400
what does it matter?

436
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,510
Mu Xuanling,

437
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,270
live well.

438
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,960
Keep being that interesting person

439
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,750
who brings a bit of freshness

440
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,480
to this dull world.

441
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,550
Mu Xuanling!

442
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,240
Mu Xuanling.

443
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,030
Xie Xuechen,

444
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,070
I'm cold.

445
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,550
Mu Xuanling,

446
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,200
hold on.

447
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,400
Endure for three days.

448
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,030
After three days,

449
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,750
I'll take you to see the human realm.

450
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,640
Alright?

451
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,880
I just watched a new batch of Spirit Clan warriors battling.

452
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,110
They've been fighting for hours

453
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,270
without a winner.

454
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,920
What a disappointing group.

455
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:10,960
If you ask me,

456
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,200
in terms of ruthlessness and decisiveness,

457
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,720
they're far inferior to the Saintess back in the day.

458
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,270
Am I right?

459
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,790
What are you doing?

460
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,960
You want to fight too, huh?

461
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,000
Come on!

462
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,160
Shut up already.

463
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,640
How dare you mention the Saintess!

464
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,370
His Grace has been in a bad mood these days

465
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,730
because the Saintess

466
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,720
would rather die than return to the Dark Abyss.

467
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,940
And you dare bring her up?

468
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Are you asking to die?

469
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,070
Ignorance Demon, you're back.

470
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,030
Ignorance Demon,

471
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,640
you're impressive!

472
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,200
On this trip,

473
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,400
you destroyed

474
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,200
Fajian's five-hundred-year-old golden core.

475
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,000
Look at that self-destructive resolve.

476
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,750
I truly admire it!

477
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,640
In just a few days,

478
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,880
my cultivation has reached such heights?

479
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,320
Ignorance Demon,

480
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,200
you self-destructed your golden core,

481
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,370
even injuring your true form.

482
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,440
What a lose-lose situation.

483
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,200
You're truly remarkable.

484
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,550
Sooner or later, I'll kill Xie Xuechen.

485
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,830
Enough with the big talk,

486
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,720
okay?

487
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,970
Go soak in the Void Sea.

488
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,920
You know,

489
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,750
I don't like companions who are too weak.

490
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,960
I just came out of the Void Sea,

491
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,000
and something feels odd.

492
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,750
Today, the demonic energy in the Void Sea is surging,

493
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,110
as if

494
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,960
something unusual is about to emerge.

495
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,400
How much longer

496
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,310
do we need to stay here?

497
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,960
I can't get used

498
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,110
to this icy, snowy place.

499
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,270
Ignorance Demon self-destructed Saint Fajian's golden core.

500
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,110
The Pearl Tower now has cracks,

501
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,400
weakening its defenses.

502
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,640
All sects need to guard the Chaos Pearl.

503
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,750
At a time like this,

504
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,790
how can we leave?

505
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,700
The Snow City has already sent

506
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,880
half its disciples to guard the tower.

507
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,940
So, how long will it take

508
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,920
to repair the Pearl Tower?

509
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,680
Although the artifact will heal itself,

510
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,020
it will still take more than ten days.

511
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,160
That long?

512
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,140
Isn't Mr. Xie trying to come up with a solution?

513
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,110
Speaking of Mr. Xie,

514
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,550
I heard

515
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,400
he brought Mu Xuanling back to his room

516
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,270
and hasn't left for three days and nights.

517
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,110
Could it be

518
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,880
that the Snow City will soon have

519
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,520
a mistress from the Spirit Clan?

520
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,440
The dignified Lord of the Snow City,

521
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,890
completely bewitched

522
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,930
by a witch.

523
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,270
If word gets out,

524
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,000
it would be utterly disgraceful.

525
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,510
If anyone's reputation is ruined,

526
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,310
it's the Snow City's.

527
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,440
Even Xie Xuechen hasn't said anything,

528
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,110
so why are you two so concerned?

529
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:03,920
Miss Gao,

530
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,880
we were just casually chatting.

531
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,550
Besides,

532
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,270
it's not just us,

533
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,880
other sects are gossiping too.

534
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,920
If other sects gossip,

535
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,690
does it mean our Mirage Palace

536
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,590
should follow suit?

537
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,550
Miss Gao,

538
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,920
Mr. Xie did harm your father back then.

539
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,350
How can you still defend him?

540
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,350
What do you want me to do?

541
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,790
Should I kill him for revenge?

542
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,480
But he also saved me back then.

543
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,830
About possession by the Dark Clan,

544
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,160
I was also possessed by Anger Demon

545
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,480
back at the Greenview Heights.

546
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,880
If Anger Demon had succeeded that day,

547
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,070
would I have to pay with my life too?

548
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,790
That's...

549
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,400
that's not what I meant.

550
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,030
Regardless, our Mirage Palace

551
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,350
doesn't gossip people behind their backs.

552
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,400
You two seniors

553
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,480
should be mindful.

554
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,640
If gossiping fills you up,

555
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,830
why not let me eat this instead?

556
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,750
Even helping your enemy,

557
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,160
no wonder your family was destroyed!

558
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,940
[Swirling Snow Pavilion]

559
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,030
You're awake.

560
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,440
For maintaining my life

561
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,000
and handling official duties,

562
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,200
you've stayed awake for three days and nights.

563
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,310
Aren't you afraid of exhausting yourself to death?

564
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,960
Your body hasn't fully recovered.

565
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,830
You should rest more.

566
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,240
The sunlight today is beautiful.

567
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,240
I thought

568
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,830
I was destined to die.

569
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,000
My demonic power is gone,

570
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,480
so why am I still alive?

571
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,310
How did you do it?

572
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,920
It's simply fate sparing your life.

573
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
You don't want to tell me?

574
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,030
You won't say, but I know...

575
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,310
it must not have been simple.

576
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,230
I think I asked you before:

577
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,630
if I were willing to give up my demonic power

578
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,440
and become an ordinary person,

579
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,150
would you protect me?

580
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,280
I think I have my answer now.

581
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,480
What should we do?

582
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,230
I've taken on the name of a temptress,

583
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,630
and you've been labeled as favoring me.

584
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,880
But my reputation was already terrible,

585
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,670
so I don't mind it getting worse.

586
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,480
But you've suffered a big loss.

587
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,800
You gained nothing,

588
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,840
and even lost your integrity.

589
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,760
Why not

590
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,230
just claim me as yours?

591
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,880
It might make up for some of your losses.

592
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,710
Your body's barely recovered,

593
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,880
and your mouth's already running wild.

594
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,480
And are you any better?

595
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,880
A Spiritual Form cultivator lives a thousand years,

596
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,630
and the Spirit Clan also lives a thousand years.

597
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,320
You've sentenced me to be imprisoned here for a thousand years.

598
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,070
What's on your mind?

599
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,280
Do you plan to protect me for the rest of your life?

600
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,800
Just a coincidence.

601
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,150
Will you put a Spirit Lock on me?

602
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:31,800
No.

603
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,280
Will you place restrictions on me?

604
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,840
No.

605
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,670
Then how do you plan to imprison me?

606
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,550
Since you've recovered,

607
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,710
you'll leave the mountain tomorrow.

608
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,030
You want to send me away?

609
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
I'll take you to see the human realm.

610
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,920
I still have matters to handle now.

611
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,230
Rest well.

612
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,960
Mu Xuanling,

613
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,690
you'd have moments like this too,

614
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,960
fearing gain and loss?

615
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,710
The strong become weak because of this,

616
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,550
and the wise become foolish.

617
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,030
Nan Xuyue was right.

618
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,150
Love has truly misled me.

619
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,760
Your disciples told me

620
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,710
that after days of meditation,

621
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,070
you're finally willing to explain

622
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,280
why your faith collapsed.

623
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,190
A few years ago, I met someone...

624
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,510
someone

625
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,960
who stirred inner demons within me.

626
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,800
Who?

627
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,480
The Master of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion.

628
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,280
Demons

629
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,190
can never be fully wiped out.

630
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,480
But have you ever considered

631
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,190
why among all the ways in the world,

632
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,000
only the teachings

633
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,960
of your Xuantian Sect

634
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,190
can guide people

635
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
to eliminate inner demons?

636
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,760
It shows that great responsibility has been bestowed

637
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,280
upon the Xuantian Sect.

638
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,480
[Master of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion]
If everyone joined the Xuantian Sect,

639
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,400
recited the mantras to reflect their hearts,

640
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,000
returned to their true selves,

641
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,710
freed from selfish desires,

642
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,070
and escaped the pain of unfulfilled longing,

643
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,670
then the world

644
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,800
would have no love or hate,

645
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,510
and naturally, no inner demons.

646
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,030
And you believed him?

647
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,030
I wanted to forget his words,

648
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,630
but for some reason,

649
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,150
the more I tried, the less I could.

650
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,150
As days and nights turned,

651
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,360
as seasons changed,

652
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,760
his words

653
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
would occasionally

654
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,360
echo in my ears.

655
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,190
Gradually,

656
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,710
I came to feel that his guidance

657
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,440
was correct.

658
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,190
So you conspired with the Decaying Immortal Pavilion and the Dark Clan,

659
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,480
seeking to expand the Xuantian Sect's influence

660
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,030
and make the world follow your path.

661
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,030
One thought creates a Buddha.

662
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,590
One thought creates a demon.

663
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,960
You want everyone

664
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,540
to follow the way of the Xuantian Sect,

665
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,190
but have you ever asked if they're willing?

666
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,600
What if they prefer love and hate,

667
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,770
the pain of unfulfilled desires,

668
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,380
and drowning in their passions?

669
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,670
You want them to follow Xuantian Sect's way,

670
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,030
but for how long could they keep it up?

671
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,230
Wouldn't their hearts grow bitter?

672
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,670
Now, the Xuantian Sect has many disciples.

673
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,110
How many have truly transcended

674
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,630
as you say?

675
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,070
Isn't there another way

676
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,190
to eliminate inner demons?

677
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,440
I once thought

678
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,070
that demons arise from the heart.

679
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,070
They're like shadows.

680
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,400
Shadows exist

681
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,190
because we live in the light.

682
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,030
When the sun is low in the east or west,

683
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,760
shadows grow long.

684
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,760
When the sun is at its peak, shadows grow short.

685
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,150
The true way to defeat demons

686
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,630
is to create

687
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,190
a flourishing era of peace and prosperity,

688
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,920
where everyone has a place of comfort and joy.

689
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,230
Inner demons

690
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,230
would have no place to dwell.

691
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,920
But how to achieve

692
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,440
such an era

693
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,510
is the eternal challenge.

694
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,480
The more I see,

695
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,920
the more I feel humanity has lost its way.

696
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,400
Under the rule of the Immortal Alliance,

697
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,550
human lives have grown more stable and prosperous.

698
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,070
But in contrast,

699
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,000
the Spirit Clan has been driven to desolate lands,

700
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,800
enslaved or oppressed,

701
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,480
filled with hatred.

702
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,070
A world where one side dominates

703
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,440
is not a safe place for others.

704
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,150
So what must be done now

705
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,630
is not to stop killing with more killing,

706
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,360
but to find

707
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,680
a proper balance for coexistence,

708
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,230
embracing harmony in diversity.

709
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,480
Thank you, sir, for clearing my doubts.

710
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,070
I now have three questions

711
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,110
I need answers to.

712
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,190
Please speak, sir.

713
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,510
First,

714
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,800
where is the Master of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion?

715
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,510
I don't know.

716
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,150
Second,

717
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,550
on the night the sects of the Alliance arrived at Snow City,

718
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,110
I was attacked.

719
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,320
The attacker wore black robes and a mask,

720
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,000
and his cultivation was above the Spirit Manifestation level

721
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,110
but below the Spiritual Form stage.

722
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,630
He was likely from the Decaying Immortal Pavilion.

723
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,710
Who was him?

724
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,800
The Master of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion

725
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,570
has a most trusted agent,

726
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,960
whose cultivation is above the Spirit Manifestation level.

727
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,640
But their face

728
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,030
has always been hidden behind a black veil.

729
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,800
I don't know who he is.

730
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,440
Forgive me. I can't help.

731
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,360
Sir,

732
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,320
please speak of the third question.

733
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,320
As for the third question,

734
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,590
the answer lies with you.

735
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,100
All crises that have befallen

736
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,800
the Immortal Alliance

737
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,190
are entirely my fault.

738
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,110
I am guilty beyond redemption.

739
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,710
Now,

740
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,000
my senior has passed away

741
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,400
and I bear heavy sins.

742
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,800
I ask you

743
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,800
to spare the Xuantian Sect,

744
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,480
considering our thousand years of effort

745
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,670
to resist the Dark Clan.

746
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,320
Alright.

00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:11,660
♪Searching for your face in the cycles of life♪

748
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,540
