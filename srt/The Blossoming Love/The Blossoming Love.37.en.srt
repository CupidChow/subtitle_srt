19
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,230
Fate,

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,400
I ordered you to urge Demon Lord to become the strongest,

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,120
but are you really

22
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,560
helping him

23
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,200
or hindering him?

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,230
Helping him is a common method,

25
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,480
and hindering him is the best.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,590
Given the Demon Lord's nature,

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,680
the more resistance he receives,

28
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,190
the faster he will become the strongest.

29
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,840
Ten thousand years ago,

30
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,000
you removed the celestial punishment for the Chaos Pearl,

31
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,800
so you were destined to be trapped

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,560
and have your soul gradually devoured by feelings.

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,280
After being reincarnated as a human being,

34
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,400
you will never be loved for generations.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,240
Now, you have turned back into a divine artifact,

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,150
and your soul will continue to be devoured

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,120
until you die.

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,430
Apart from me,

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,910
no one can suppress or remove the celestial punishment

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,870
caused by feelings.

41
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,910
If you wish to continue to exist,

42
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,710
you must remain loyal to me

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,240
and never defect.

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,030
Act faster.

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,960
I must go to earth.

46
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,590
How much time is left?

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,080
Time

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,400
is quite different

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,840
for life

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,030
and death.

51
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,520
It depends on whether one

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,080
is seeking life or death.

53
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,310
You can see through life and death

54
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,080
and know everything,

55
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,280
so you knew Xuanxin was my brother

56
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,240
long ago, didn't you?

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,150
It's not long ago,

58
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,400
but it's also not recent.

59
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,430
Everything happens

60
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,560
for a reason.

61
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,310
I can only see the end

62
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,910
through divination,

63
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,430
but The Book of Fate

64
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,960
can see everything.

65
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,430
Back then, my brother was dying.

66
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,840
You read my fortune

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,470
and told me that my bond

68
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,030
with my brother was over.

69
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,750
Then,

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,190
even though I had access to spirit medicine,

71
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,960
I couldn't save him from the evil cultivator

72
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,400
and had to watch him be taken away.

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,190
I thought

74
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,910
that was the end,

75
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,190
but my brother survived

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,070
and was saved by the Xuantian Sect.

77
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,040
However,

78
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,160
your divination

79
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,720
did reveal the true end.

80
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,040
There is no longer any chance

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,040
of lasting my kinship with him.

82
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,160
Such a kinship

83
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,390
is killed like this.

84
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,480
Have you really thought about it?

85
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,240
I am on a different path

86
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,430
from him.

87
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,510
He's a leader with a heart for the world,

88
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,950
who would destroy his own abilities

89
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,800
to protect the people

90
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,720
and doesn't have any dirt in his mind,

91
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,560
whereas I walk around

92
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,950
in black and white,

93
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,310
covered in dust.

94
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,240
How would he react

95
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,040
if I confessed to him who I am,

96
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,720
and how would I deal with it?

97
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,000
You're so much alike.

98
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,720
You're both lonely but brave

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,920
for what you believe in.

100
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,600
After you come to Snow City this time,

101
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,070
whatever you want,

102
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,390
promise me

103
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,040
you won't hurt him.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,830
I've already given you the Black Wood Seal.

105
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,000
Please don't involve Bao again.

106
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,120
If the Demon Lord is not destroyed,

107
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,750
the scourge will always be unpredictable,

108
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,000
so who in this world can stay out of it?

109
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,040
I don't know what he intends to do,

110
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,510
but I felt a strong Jade Vault Power

111
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,780
as the demonic power

112
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,000
traveled through my body.

113
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,000
This is the proof.

114
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,390
I'm sure

115
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,310
Senior is still inside the Demon Lord

116
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,270
and hasn't melted away.

117
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,000
In time,

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,950
we will be able to awaken him.

119
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,430
What

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,390
is the Demon Lord's secret?

121
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,510
Now, I can't fight him,

122
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,120
so I have to find a way

123
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,630
to observe his heart with the seal

124
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,310
and save Gao Qiumin and the others.

125
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,600
It's the night of the full moon.

126
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,000
How boring for you

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,430
to be alone in your room.

128
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,830
Why don't you

129
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,750
drink with me?

130
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,040
How dare you?

131
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,040
Get out.

132
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,040
Can't you be nice to me

133
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,830
because I brought you

134
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,510
good wine?

135
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,240
What?

136
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,600
Dare not drink it?

137
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Afraid I'll poison it?

138
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,120
Sometimes,

139
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,070
it's less fun

140
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,560
to be too defensive.

141
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,630
My pleasure is to kill.

142
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,120
If you don't leave,

143
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,430
I'll start with those two at the Lava Chasm.

144
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,720
They're going to die sooner or later anyway,

145
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,600
so if you kill them tonight,

146
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,270
they'll be less tortured

147
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,480
at the Lava Chasm,

148
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,510
which is probably a good thing.

149
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,120
Whether it's now or ten thousand years ago,

150
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,390
they've met the right people.

151
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,310
What a call to envy.

152
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,270
But what about you and me?

153
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,560
I want Xie Xuechen back.

154
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,950
And you hate that I'm not Pearl,

155
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,750
In the end,

156
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,040
we can't get what we want,

157
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,240
and we just torture each other.

158
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,390
Who says I can't?

159
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,830
I want the Chaos Power

160
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,600
and nothing else.

161
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,870
Did your seal

162
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,720
tell you the result?

163
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,390
Didn't you already know?

164
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,600
No one can observe

165
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,030
if the one being observed

166
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,870
knows in advance and is on guard.

167
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,120
Isn't that just right?

168
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,390
Why don't we experience observing the body

169
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,720
and mind for ourselves?

170
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,480
It's just what I wanted.

171
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,510
He's really hurt.

172
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,840
I didn't realize even Demon Lord

173
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,240
could be hurt so badly.

174
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,870
It's just torture from the Lava Chasm.

175
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,390
Put away your pitying eyes.

176
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,270
I'm not Xie Xuechen,

177
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,670
so I don't need your comfort.

178
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,480
But the wound on your arm

179
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,550
wasn't caused by the Lava Chasm,

180
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,200
was it?

181
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,240
That was the wound Pearl bandaged for you

182
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,440
back when she went to the barracks.

183
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,320
I purposely left that wound

184
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,630
in order to remind myself

185
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,790
not to forget the hatred of the past.

186
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,240
Really?

187
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,240
The ones who suffered but didn't retaliate

188
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,030
were Xie Xuechen

189
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,480
and Zhao Ming,

190
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,390
not me.

191
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,120
I will make everyone in this world

192
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,240
join me

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,150
in eternal purgatory.

194
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:42,850
You...

195
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,120
You can't observe my heart anymore.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,750
Get lost.

197
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,270
Otherwise,

198
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,870
I don't mind digging out

199
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,960
the hearts of those two people for you to observe.

200
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,480
Got it.

201
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,200
Right away.

202
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,720
Who says observing hearts has to be done with a seal?

203
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,240
The scars on your body

204
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,320
already tell.

205
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,150
It's a full moon tonight,

206
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,240
but there seems

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,480
to be too much peace in Dark Abyss.

208
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,200
Take it easy.

209
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,480
A stone already in a deep pool

210
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,030
is bound to cause the ripples.

211
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,030
Yan Tong.

212
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You killed him?

213
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,030
I did want to kill him,

214
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,910
but someone else

215
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,120
deserved to die.

216
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,080
Is it me Your Grace is referring to

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,150
as the one who deserves to die?

218
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,670
Then you have truly misjudged me

219
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
for that you gave yourself

220
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,840
this seal.

221
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,390
I am still of use to Demon Lord,

222
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,240
so if you kill me,

223
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,080
he will not spare you.

224
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,270
Don't worry.

225
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,120
You are more useful to me.

226
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,630
I'm just going to break

227
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,000
the Black Wood Seal into you.

228
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,750
It won't kill you.

229
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,200
Black Wood Seal?

230
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,150
I don't mind telling you.

231
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,750
If I can lure the Demon Lord

232
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,670
into using his demonic power to activate the Black Wood Seal,

233
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,320
the night of the full moon

234
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,000
will be when the Demon Lord's power is at its lowest.

235
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,750
The power of Fate

236
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,320
can recast the seal of the Lava Chasm

237
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,600
to suppress Demon Lord once again.

238
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,240
You want to activate the Black Wood Seal

239
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,030
by using my body as an intermediary

240
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,550
while Demon Lord

241
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,240
transfers his power into me?

242
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,440
That's right,

243
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,510
but you'll soon forget it.

244
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,080
Do you think the Black Wood Seal alone

245
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,150
can trap me?

246
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,240
Your Grace.

247
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,390
Why did you resort to a method

248
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,790
that would be damaging to both of us?

249
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,910
The more you use your demonic power,

250
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,750
the stronger the seal becomes.

251
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,870
I kill on my own terms,

252
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,790
regardless of the consequences.

253
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,670
Then the Lava Chasm is where you belong.

254
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,390
The Divine Emperor, help me.

255
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,270
You want me to betray the Demon Lord?

256
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,270
I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.

257
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,750
Now that you're here,

258
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,240
it's clear that you're trying to betray him.

259
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,800
The Dark Clan was born

260
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,620
of inner demons,

261
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,630
so this is nothing.

262
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,240
Do you not want to be

263
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
or are you unable to be

264
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,080
the Lord of the Dark Abyss?

265
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,440
Either way,

266
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,840
I will help Dark Abyss get a new leader.

267
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,240
There are probably many people

268
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,320
in Dark Abyss who want

269
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,670
to be the new Demon Lord.

270
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,510
Why did you choose me?

271
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,120
Anger Demon is reckless,

272
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,000
and Desire Demon is indecisive,

273
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,150
so you fit the bill.

274
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,960
We think alike,

275
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,480
but

276
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,960
can you tell me

277
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,670
what it is you're after?

278
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,840
I want everything back

279
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,120
the way it was.

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,150
You really are always teaming up

281
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,440
with despicable ones, as usual.

282
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,790
Unbind me now.

283
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,480
You can't handle them alone.

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,240
Demon Lord is a sinful man,

285
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,200
so he must be re-sealed

286
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,120
and suppressed in the Lava Chasm.

287
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,510
If you hadn't agreed to the other immortals' petition

288
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,240
and forcibly changed Zhao Ming's destiny,

289
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,080
how could there be a Demon Lord today?

290
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,080
I think the sinful one is somebody like you

291
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,000
who turned black and white upside down

292
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,120
and caused him to become a demon.

293
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,550
Everything has a cause and effect.

294
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,720
If Zhao Ming hadn't insisted on killing immortals,

295
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,270
how could they have petitioned me?

296
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,270
If I insist on protecting him today,

297
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,240
what will you do?

298
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,320
Strike the Black Wood Seal

299
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,240
into the Demon Lord's heart

300
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,510
to complete the final step of the seal.

301
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,750
Your Grace, please savor

302
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,960
the pain of a heart slaying.

303
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,000
Mu Xuanling.

304
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,170
Why is it that Black Wood Seal

305
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,070
not only didn't seal him

306
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,000
but also went to the Lava Chasm in his place?

307
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,200
A dead man

308
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,240
doesn't deserve to know.

309
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,400
He didn't spread Yan Tong's power

310
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,400
over his whole body

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,750
but made it avoid the most crucial part, his heart,

312
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,480
so that he could counterattack

313
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,400
and control Black Wood Seal

314
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,240
in order to have Black Wood Seal

315
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,000
suppressed in the Lava Chasm in his place.

316
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,070
As I wished.

317
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
The Book of Fate's true form

318
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,680
is nothing more than this.

319
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,160
If my soul is captured

320
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,310
by an outlaw after I die,

321
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,480
they will not be able to do evil

322
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,680
with this limitation.

323
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,830
Ridiculous.

324
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,430
[In ancient times, there were ten suns,]

325
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,740
[nine of which were struck down and buried in Dark Cloud]

326
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,380
[The power of the nine suns removes the restriction]

327
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,240
The power of the nine suns removes the restriction.

328
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,640
Dark Cloud Mountain.

329
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,640
All crap.

330
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,480
I'd better destroy it.

331
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,880
Has the plan failed?

332
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,200
Demon Lord's strength

333
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,160
and intellect

334
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,240
still cannot be underestimated.

335
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,830
What should you do next?

336
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,590
As long as he can trust Mu Xuanling,

337
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,920
the plan after that

338
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,200
can still continue.

339
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,920
If the plan is in order,

340
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,440
why do you look so bad?

341
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,550
I just have limited patience.

342
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,110
The Xuanling Tree only blooms in the Dark Abyss.

343
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,400
In the human realm,

344
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,400
only one survives in the courtyard

345
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,160
of the Swirling Snow Pavilion.

346
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,310
Someone once told me

347
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,000
that the Xuanling Tree can grow up in the human realm

348
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,200
and I can find my own place

349
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,590
in the human realm,

350
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,750
but

351
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,750
a Xuanling Tree that can't bloom

352
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,790
is not a real Xuanling Tree.

353
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,110
You just woke up and started reminiscing.

354
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,750
You seem to be enjoying yourself,

355
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,200
but I'm not interested.

356
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,920
Well.

357
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,640
Then I'll say something you want to hear.

358
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,960
After so many days

359
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,880
and what happened,

360
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,110
I realized

361
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,110
that going against you won't end well,

362
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,510
so I'm willing to cooperate with you

363
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,160
and give you all the Chaos Power.

364
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,920
You want me

365
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,200
to let Gao Qiumin and Fu Lansheng go.

366
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,200
And Yan Tong.

367
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,590
His spiritual power has been greatly damaged,

368
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,310
so he's useless to you,

369
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,000
but

370
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,960
before I give you the Chaos Power,

371
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,030
I have to take two things,

372
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,510
Lotus of Life

373
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,000
and Jun Tian Sword,

374
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,310
to build a grave for Xie Xuechen,

375
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,000
to remind me

376
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,240
that he has passed away,

377
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,160
and to cut off

378
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,790
all relations with the human realm

379
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,160
and my delusion from now on.

380
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
If you don't trust me,

381
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,960
you can come with me.

382
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,000
Okay.

383
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,680
So

384
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,590
you agreed?

385
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,550
I don't care

386
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,590
what you're up to.

387
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,030
I only care about what I want,

388
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,830
but there's one thing you need to remember.

389
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,480
Don't betray me again.

390
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,510
Otherwise,

391
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,640
I will really kill you.

392
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,270
Why did Demon Lord suddenly release us?

393
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,440
Maybe he hasn't forgotten his old relationship with you guys.

394
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,070
I'll accompany you here.

395
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,480
Aren't you coming with us?

396
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,640
I've come to join Demon Lord.

397
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,160
Why should I go?

398
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,200
Have you

399
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,270
observed the Demon Lord's heart?

400
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,240
The past is gone.

401
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,550
Demon Lord is Demon Lord.

402
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,550
Are you in some kind of trouble?

403
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,480
Tell us.

404
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,160
If we fight with all our might now,

405
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,240
we can take you with us.

406
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,070
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

407
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,070
Just go.

408
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,750
If Demon Lord changes his mind,

409
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,960
we'll all die here.

410
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,110
Mu Xuanling.

411
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,000
Based on Miss Mu's character,

412
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,880
I think she has her own plans.

413
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,880
Let's go first.

414
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,480
Don't get in her way.

415
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,830
[Temple of Divine Execution]

416
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,790
Mu Xuanling just saw the three of them off.

417
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,200
She didn't do

418
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,510
or say anything suspicious.

419
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,000
Do you think

420
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,480
there's something wrong?

421
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,070
Should we follow them to the Immortal Alliance?

422
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:24,960
No.

423
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,750
Just stay here.

424
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,720
After I leave,

425
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,720
if anyone from the Immortal Alliance breaks in,

426
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,480
kill them on sight.

427
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:36,680
- Got it. - Got it.

428
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,880
Your Grace.

429
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,310
I used

430
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,920
to deal with Mu Xuanling.

431
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,350
She's a trickster,

432
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,350
but why did you agree

433
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,960
to leave with her?

434
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,630
I have my own plans.

435
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,920
There is something I must have at Dark Cloud Mountain.

436
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,510
As for Jun Tian Sword,

437
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
it was originally my sword,

438
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,750
but now that Jun Tian has disobeyed me,

439
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,150
I will have to retrieve it myself.

440
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,590
Just go.

441
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,400
- Got it. - Got it.

442
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,790
Let's go.

443
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,920
To Ethereal Jade Island.

444
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,070
Aren't you going to keep an eye on me yourself?

445
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,070
Do I need

446
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,200
to follow your orders?

447
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,470
So Your Grace,

448
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,030
where are you going now?

449
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,120
Ethereal Jade Island.

450
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,360
Phoenix Perch Forest is treacherous,

451
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,400
so you'd better get the restraints off me.

452
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,160
I already did.

453
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,120
When?

454
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,960
Just now.

455
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,840
Why don't I know?

456
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,990
Do I need to let you know?

457
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,440
You're so bossy.

458
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,510
You've finally realized.

459
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,510
There are lethal or hallucinogenic miasmas

460
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,400
and forest spirits in the forest,

461
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,920
so we'd better stay close.

462
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,270
It's just forest spirits.

463
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,070
We could just kill them.

464
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,200
The forest spirit's ability to mesmerize

465
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,070
has nothing to do with one's strength.

466
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,920
The more obsessive they are,

467
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,440
the more dangerous they are.

468
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,710
Obsession?

469
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,470
I won't be trapped by that.

470
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,840
Ling.

471
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,200
Wait.

472
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,030
Ling.

473
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,200
You go first.

474
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,400
Now that Demon Lord

475
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,550
is in the miasma of Phoenix Perch Forest,

476
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,680
and his demonic energy has been suppressed,

477
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,880
so I've been able to separate from him for a while.

478
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:43,990
Wait for me.

479
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,230
I will kill him.

480
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,440
If I can regain my body,

481
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,840
I will come back to you.

482
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,470
If I fail,

483
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,750
return to the Immortal Alliance

484
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,270
and rally the people against him.

485
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,550
Forest spirit.

486
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,470
That was brilliant.

487
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,030
You are worthy of the Chaos Saintess.

488
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:08,810
Let's go.

489
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,470
You're a fake, too.

490
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,120
Demon Lord won't recognize me as Chaos Saintess.

491
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,960
As far as he's concerned, I'm not Pearl.

492
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,880
Mu Xuanling.

493
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,600
Mu Xuanling.

494
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,270
Zhao Ming.

495
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,710
Who are you calling?

496
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,510
Pearl.

497
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,880
The dangers of the Phoenix Perch Forest

498
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,880
have nothing to do with one's strength

499
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,510
but with mind.

500
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,160
Pearl has been his obsession for 10,000 years.

501
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,990
I used Pearl as bait

502
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,710
to set a trap.

503
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,270
It's a trap

504
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,680
he must enter.

505
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,360
The deeper the obsession,

506
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,600
the deeper he will fall,

507
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,030
even if he is the Demon Lord.

508
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,920
What will happen to the Demon Lord if he can't leave Phoenix Perch Forest?

509
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,840
He will be lost in his dreams

510
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,550
and trapped in his illusion forever

511
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,990
until he disappears from the real world.

512
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,510
If he disappears completely,

513
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,120
how will you explain that to Hao Tian?

514
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,640
I'd have to

515
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,360
give up explaining.

516
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,070
Where did he go?

517
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,640
It looks like

518
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,710
he's trapped in an illusion.

519
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,440
He can't die here.

520
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,400
I can only try to find him with the Chaos Power.

521
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,550
He's not in the forest.

522
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,920
Then where could he be?

523
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,120
If I give up being a divine artifact

524
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,120
and you forget your ambition,

525
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,400
we can, no matter what happens in the world,

526
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,030
guard this world

527
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,600
and be together for ten thousand years.

528
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
For ten thousand years,

529
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,750
I have traveled to the Celestial Realm and the Lava Chasm,

530
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,680
beginning with ambition

531
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,440
but ending with hatred.

532
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,160
Only now do I realize

533
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,440
that the memories of 10,000 years ago

534
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,360
are deeply embedded in my heart like my bones and blood.

535
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,470
Zhao Ming.

536
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,550
This time,

537
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,030
don't leave me alone

538
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,070
in Everbright Palace, okay?

539
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,920
I have owed you an explanation for 10,000 years,

540
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,360
and you

541
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,550
owe me a full wedding.

542
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,840
Tonight is an auspicious time

543
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,640
to make up for all the regrets.

544
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,640
From now on,

545
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,710
there will be no more Demon Lord and the Chaos Pearl

546
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,120
but only Zhao Ming

547
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,790
and Pearl.

548
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,840
Only Zhao Ming and Pearl.

549
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,400
You gave me the same candy

550
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,880
before you went on your journey.

551
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,070
You were suppressed in the Lava Chasm for ten thousand years.

552
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,120
Whenever I missed you,

553
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,200
I ate one,

554
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,270
but it always

555
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,600
tasted sour.

556
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,400
Now,

557
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,880
the candy has finally become sweet.

558
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,270
At that time,

559
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,270
I ate all the candies but didn't see you come back,

560
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,920
so I went to the barrack.

561
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
Luckily, ten thousand years later,

562
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,680
I saw you again.

563
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,440
Zhao Ming.

564
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,230
After signing this marriage contract,

565
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,270
you and I will be married forever

566
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,960
and never be separated.

567
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,990
So

568
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,230
you don't want to be with me forever?

569
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,030
I wish I could convince myself

570
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,030
you're Pearl,

571
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,840
but you're not her after all.

572
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:55,680
Why not?

573
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,600
Pearl didn't eat all the candies

574
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,200
but saved the last one for when she went to the barrack.

575
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,710
What's more,

576
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,510
Pearl wouldn't set out to kill

577
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,600
in a marriage contract.

578
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,860
[The contract requires a signature. Trapping him in the void forever]

579
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,960
Demon Lord broke the illusion.

580
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,470
This backlash is so strong.

581
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,550
Are you all right?

582
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,710
Don't worry.

583
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,120
Whatever happens,

584
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,440
I have a plan.

585
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,990
It's a long road,

586
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,790
but it will lead to the end I want.

587
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,750
Do you know I've been looking for you...

588
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,200
Look at me.

589
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,510
I'm not the forest spirit.

590
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,640
Why?

591
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,680
Why was that fake

592
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,600
but you're real?

593
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,930
You...

594
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,440
You met Pearl?

595
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,510
How did you get out?

596
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,750
Did you kill her?

597
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,790
She thought, as you did before,

598
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,990
that she could control

599
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,400
or even kill me

600
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,550
with a few tricks.

601
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,710
So over-confident.

602
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,360
You've got me all wrong.

603
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,230
I never wanted to control

604
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,030
or even kill you.

605
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,230
What's the difference between so-called reclaiming and killing?

606
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,920
It was never me

607
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,790
you wanted to save,

608
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,600
nor was it what you expected.

609
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,030
I've told you everything I need to tell you,

610
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,030
but you always don't believe me.

611
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,750
I've searched for you

612
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,360
from dawn to dusk

613
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,710
in this dangerous jungle.

614
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,200
But what about you?

615
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,030
When you showed up, you choked me

616
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,120
and even warned me.

617
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,640
Sometimes, I wondered

618
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,790
why I did it.

619
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,210
I'd like to know

620
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,210
why you did it, too.

621
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,360
I don't want to argue with you now.

622
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,750
It's already dark,

623
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,680
so can we find a place to rest?

624
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,160
You were brought into the illusion by the fake Pearl even though you knew

625
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,600
there were forest spirits in the woods that could mesmerize people.

626
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,270
Is it because in the 10,000 years,

627
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,600
you've been subdued in the Lava Chasm,

628
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,840
you've suffered day and night

629
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,840
without being able to see

630
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,440
or talk to anyone

631
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,920
while relying on your obsession with Pearl

632
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,790
to sustain yourself?

633
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,400
Don't be a wisenheimer.

634
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,160
It won't do you any good

635
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,400
whether you can guess or not.

636
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,510
Do you think I'm curious?

637
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,640
But I am curious

638
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,550
about what's in your vision.

639
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,330
Xie Xuechen

640
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,210
and you.

641
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,070
How long did it take you to get out of the illusion?

642
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,280
Seven or eight minutes.

643
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:26,990
In terms of ruthlessness,

644
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,280
you're the best.

645
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,800
You also killed the fake Pearl

646
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,360
at the end to break the illusion.

647
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,550
In terms of ruthlessness,

648
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,360
we are just the same.

649
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,360
I'm not ruthless.

650
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,510
I've been here with Xie Xuechen

651
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,720
and met forest spirits,

652
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,590
so I know what I've seen is false.

653
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,720
You have his memories,

654
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,030
but you're not him

655
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,400
after all.

656
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,880
I don't know when His Grace will return

657
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,360
[Temple of Divine Execution]
from this absence.

658
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,670
Mu Xuanling is tricky,

659
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,470
so will His Grace fall into her trap?

660
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,760
In the face of invincible power,

661
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,240
any trickery

662
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,880
is nothing.

663
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,400
Ignorance Demon is a case in point.

664
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,720
Not only did he fail in his rebellion

665
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,510
but also lost his life,

666
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,150
never to be revived.

667
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,240
When Ignorance Demon was around,

668
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,360
he was always gloomy,

669
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,150
mocking me every day for not being smart

670
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,110
and always trying to compete with me.

671
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,280
I was particularly annoyed with him,

672
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,670
but after he died,

673
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,070
I missed him quite a bit.

674
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,440
The three of us

675
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,280
used to be united

676
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,990
as one,

677
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,880
but now,

678
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,590
it's just the two of us,

679
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,110
so you are surely a little uncomfortable.

680
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,990
The people of the Dark Clan have no blood or flesh.

681
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,070
Where would we go

682
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,150
if we were completely dead?

683
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,400
I don't know.

684
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,720
I've never really died.

685
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,240
Then how can we say

686
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,440
we've lived

687
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:18,880
if

688
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,550
we can never truly die?

689
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,190
It sounds like nonsense,

690
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,360
but it seems to make sense.

691
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,150
What brings you to the Immortal Alliance?

692
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,510
Congratulations

693
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,990
on leaving the temporal chaos.

694
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,800
Congratulations?

695
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,960
You're the one who got us in.

696
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,590
You were meant to be there

697
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,800
because you were connected 10,000 years ago.

698
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,920
What happened 10,000 years ago

699
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,960
made what just happened happen.

700
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,400
I know you're a Fate,

701
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,400
but can Fate play

702
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,280
with someone's life like a god?

703
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:08,760
Play?

704
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,770
I know you're running Snow City

705
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,760
in the name of demon removal,

706
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,280
but I'm telling you

707
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,110
if you dare harm Mu Xuanling and the Immortal Alliance,

708
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,840
no matter how powerful you are,

709
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,590
I'll fight you

710
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,160
at all costs.

711
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,910
At all costs?

712
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,240
What if the cost

713
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,190
is more than you can imagine?

714
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,670
What do you want?

715
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,870
Are you going to make an enemy of me, too?

716
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,080
We're not

717
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,510
on the same side anymore.

718
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:42,870
You are not

719
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,870
the same Nan Xuyue,

720
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,600
and I am not the same Fu Lansheng.

721
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,990
Perhaps all beings seem weak

722
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,360
to you,

723
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,840
but don't underestimate

724
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,360
a weak man's fight to the death.

725
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,240
It will also be more than you can imagine.

726
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,840
Qiumin.

727
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,990
Seniors.

728
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:29,990
Qiumin.

729
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,240
We're all glad

730
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,070
to see you back safe and sound.

731
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,850
We didn't get a chance

732
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,630
to talk to you at the Hall of Integrity.

733
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,470
You didn't wait for me

734
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,320
in the freezing cold to catch up, did you?

735
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,880
We do have important matters

736
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,680
to discuss with you.

737
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,550
A long time has passed since the war with the Spirit Clan,

738
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,360
but there has been no leader at Mirage Palace,

739
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,880
so we would like to present you as the new master.

740
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,140
Will you do it?

741
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,430
I am too young and unqualified

742
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
for such a position.

743
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,200
At first,

744
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,630
we misunderstood you,

745
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,360
but after the battle at Mirage Palace,

746
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,760
we all saw

747
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,680
your character and talent.

748
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:23,990
Since we believe in you,

749
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,800
why are you belittling yourself?

750
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,430
There is no need for you to say any more.

751
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,990
I know my own abilities best.

752
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,150
Thank you.

753
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,920
Lansheng. Qiumin.

754
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,510
Bao.

755
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,990
- You're finally back. - Bao.

756
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,360
Why did you come?

757
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,320
Let me see.

758
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,110
You've gained weight.

759
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,590
Let me touch your belly.

760
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,430
I haven't gained weight.

761
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,400
You have.

762
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,430
You've got fat on your belly.

763
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,430
Actually,

764
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,630
I didn't want to bring him here,

765
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,680
but he insisted on coming with me.

766
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,550
I'll take you to eat something nice,

767
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:13,950
okay?

768
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,110
- Okay. - Let's go.

769
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:17,600
Let's go.

770
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,040
Let's go.

771
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,200
Let's go.

772
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,950
I didn't want to talk to you,

773
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,320
but in the course of these days,

774
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,360
I've traveled to a place,

775
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,150
met some people,

776
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,880
and experienced many things.

777
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,590
There,

778
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,990
I really felt the true will

779
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,400
to save the Humans.

780
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,430
I believe

781
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,800
your will to save the Spirit Clan

782
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,920
is the same as some people's will

783
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,800
to save the Humans.

784
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,240
I can understand that,

785
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
but I don't agree with it.

786
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,950
Many lay down their lives

787
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,470
to save the world.

788
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,840
Some people's guardianship

789
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
sacrifices themselves

790
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,990
while the Decaying Immortal Pavilion's so-called guardianship

791
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,550
sacrifices the innocent.

792
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,070
Your way is wrong,

793
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:17,720
and the results are bad.

794
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,320
What I did wrong was the truth.

795
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,760
I would not be able to forgive myself

796
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,320
if I were you,

797
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,510
but if there is a chance to make amends,

798
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,110
let me know,

799
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,990
and I will do my best.

800
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,320
That won't be necessary.

801
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,320
I promised my parents

802
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,470
I wouldn't live in hate,

803
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,470
so we won't kill each other,

804
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,800
but we won't be friends either.

805
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,070
It's for the best

806
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:53,990
that you and I

807
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,470
have different surnames.

808
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,510
Fu Cangli

809
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,630
died a long time ago.

810
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,400
There is only Jiang Li

811
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,400
in this world.

812
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,760
The last ripe Lotus of Life

813
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,240
was plucked by Xie Xuechen.

814
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,430
Now, it will take a hundred years

815
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,950
to grow a new one.

816
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,920
What will it be like

817
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,030
in a hundred years?

818
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,200
You're often reminded of something by what you see.

819
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:45,690
I...

820
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,070
If I ask him to take out the lotus flower from the spiritual water for me

821
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,320
on the grounds that my Chaos Power

822
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,400
is incomplete and was depleted too much yesterday,

823
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,200
will he say yes?

824
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,630
I...

825
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,200
You just plucked

826
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:06,990
the once-in-a-century Lotus of Life?

827
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,720
No matter how rare it is,

828
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,470
it's just a flower.

829
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,010
So what if I plucked it?

830
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,840
Wait a minute.

831
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,760
I heard there were precious spiritual fish

832
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,150
in Everlife Pond.

833
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,320
If we can eat them,

834
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,630
it will be good for cultivation.

835
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,110
While we're here,

836
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,240
let's catch some together.

837
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,720
Who have you been fooled by?

838
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,400
The pool water is evolved from spiritual energy,

839
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:34,990
not real water.

840
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,510
So how can there be spiritual fish?

841
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,320
There is.

842
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:38,800
Really.

843
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:39,680
There it is.

844
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:40,590
See it?

845
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,820
It's swimming that way.

846
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,680
Look at it.

847
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,240
There it is.

848
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:44,470
It's swimming that way.

849
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:44,990
Look at it.

850
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:45,800
It's swimming that way.

851
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,240
A very big fish.

852
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:47,880
