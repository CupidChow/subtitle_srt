that you're unwell

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,350
and unable to greet the guests?

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,430
A troubled heart is still an illness.

22
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,280
Greeting the Immortal Alliance members

23
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,560
gets on my nerves.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,640
Isn't that also being unwell?

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,920
That makes sense.

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,430
Then why are you here to observe?

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Knowing the enemy well

You're still this cautious, even now?

30
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,750
I'm a spirit cultivating demonic power, after all.

31
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,820
I can't expect them

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,590

But my money comes from my parents.

192
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,910
That means

193
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,390
the richest cultivator in the world

194
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,750
must be my father.

195
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,840
Brother!

196
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,480
Plenty of people call me "Brother,"

197
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,000
but yours is the sweetest.

198
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:05,840
Come,

199
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,200
I will give you a gift.

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,510
These are all artifacts suitable for the Spirit Clan.

201
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,360
How do you have artifacts for the Spirit Clan?

202
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,200
My family has 3,000 Spirit Clan members.

203
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,320
You mean you have 3,000 spirit slaves?

204
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:17,960
No.

205
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,550
To me,

206
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,000
they're all very good friends,

207
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,510
and we often play together.

208
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,240
Little one,

209
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,200
what's your father's name?

210
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,960
I'll help you look into it when I get back.

211
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,000
Fu Cangli.

212
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,390
Fu Cangli...

213
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
That name does sound like someone

214
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,200
from the Jade Sky Palace.

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,750
I'll keep an eye out.

216
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,910
Then I'll take my leave.

217
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:38,960
To both of you...

218
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,360
to all three of you,

219
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,000
farewell.

220
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,120
No need to see me out.

221
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,480
I get it now.

222
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,080
You were saying earlier

223
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,550
that he's the world's biggest dupe,

224
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,240
right?

225
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,480
Excuse me...

226
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
The Sect Leaders are inside discussing matters.

227
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,440
Thank you.

228
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,550
It seems

229
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,960
she must be the renowned Miss Gao.

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,320
Such elegance

231
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,390
and such grace.

232
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,240
Even compared to Miss Mu,

233
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,510
there's not much difference.

234
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,550
So quiet and composed,

235
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,790
truly a perfect match for Mr. Xie.

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,360
Why does he keep staring at me?

237
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,030
Seeing a beauty

238
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,320
shouldn't warrant such exaggeration.

239
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,440
Forget it. While traveling,

240
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,440
I represent the Mirage Palace.

241
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,550
I won't lower myself to his level.

242
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,320
Truly refined,

243
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,790
the very image

244
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,360
of a Young Lord's wife.

245
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,480
Mr. Xie,

246
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,200
may I ask

247
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,120
why you've gathered us

248
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,870
here in the Snow City?

249
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,030
And where is the Alliance Leader?

250
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,960
Seniors,

251
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,870
the Snow City is in distress.

252
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,440
The Alliance Leader...

253
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,240
has been assassinated.

254
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,200
How could this happen?

255
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,960
Who is behind this?

256
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,120
It must have been Sang Qi and the Decaying Immortal Pavilion.

257
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,000
The Decaying Immortal Pavilion?

258
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,670
The Decaying Immortal Pavilion conspired with Sang Qi.

259
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,030
They once stole

260
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,000
the Mirage Palace's jade token,

261
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,750
causing the Alliance Leader's death.

262
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
Their goal is to seize all the jade tokens.

263
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,910
Has anyone here noticed

264
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,270
anything unusual in your sects recently?

265
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,720
No unusual activity has been detected.

266
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,390
May I ask,

267
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,150
where is the jade token

268
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,120
of the Snow City now?

269
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,480
The enemy didn't succeed.

270
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,630
The jade token remains in the Snow City.

271
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,790
I've always said

272
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,840
we should attack the Dark Abyss first

273
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,960
and kill those filthy creatures.

274
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,270
The Dark Clan is immortal.

275
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,790
Charging in recklessly

276
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,790
will not guarantee victory.

277
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,750
That's true.

278
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,870
We must proceed cautiously.

279
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,510
If the Immortal Alliance suffers too many losses,

280
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,720
it would not be worth it.

281
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,600
Sang Qi's return this time

282
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,870
is to seize the Chaos Pearl

283
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,630
and unlock the barrier of the Immortals Array.

284
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,630
The most pressing matter now

285
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,840
is to elect a new Alliance Leader

286
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,720
and entrust him

287
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,840
with safeguarding the Chaos Pearl.

288
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:15,910
Mr. Xie,

289
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,600
Mr. Xie,

290
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,200
you are recognized as the brightest star of the Immortal Alliance.

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,600
I believe

292
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,360
you're capable of taking on this responsibility.

293
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,320
I was ambushed at Two Realms Mountain

294
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,240
while repairing the Immortals Array,

295
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,390
trapped in the Lava for seven days.

296
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,550
My injuries were serious,

297
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,960
and my spiritual power has yet to recover.

298
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,360
Given the urgent situation,

299
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,240
I'm afraid I cannot take on this role.

300
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,120
All it takes is your word,

301
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,550
and the Jade Sky Palace

302
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,870
will immediately hire the world's best healers

303
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,480
to heal you.

304
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,510
Additionally,

305
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,080
the Jade Sky Palace has

306
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,320
the most secure vault in existence.

307
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,150
We can safeguard the Chaos Pearl.

308
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
The situation is urgent now.

309
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,670
There's no time for delay.

310
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,840
Besides,

311
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,960
when has the Jade Sky Palace

312
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,030
ever cared about the Alliance's affairs?

313
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,030
Su Ningzhen,

314
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,360
if you intend to fight for the Alliance Leader position,

315
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,440
just say it directly.

316
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,000
Why bother mocking

317
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,030
the Jade Sky Palace here?

318
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,790
Fine, I'll say it directly.

319
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,330
All this time,

320
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,610
it's been the Mirage Palace

321
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,390
guarding the Two Realms Mountain pass

322
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,200
and fending off invaders.

323
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,870
And the only one to lose a token

324
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,870
was also the Mirage Palace.

325
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,080
If you became the Alliance Leader,

326
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,840
how would you protect anything at all?

327
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:27,750
He Xianwo,

328
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,510
you spend all day with the Spirit Clan.

329
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,320
Perhaps you've already forgotten who you are!

330
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:44,870
Sir, Madam,

331
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,750
there's no need for this.

332
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,670
Calm down.

333
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,360
The path of faith is compassionate!

334
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,840
Saint Fajian,

335
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,270
he offended the Mirage Palace first.

336
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,910
I had no choice but to act.

337
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,630
Since Saint Fajian has spoken,

338
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,080
I'll stop

339
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,550
speaking too bluntly.

340
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,600
Six thousand years ago,

341
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,270
our predecessor, Lord Qian Guang, established the Immortal Alliance

342
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,080
to mend divisions

343
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,630
and unite against external threats.

344
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,750
Now, with Leader Xie's death still fresh,

345
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,960
and the enemy still hidden in shadows,

346
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,000
you're already

347
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,440
falling apart?

348
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,910
It seems there'll be no conclusion today.

349
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,320
For the next few days,

350
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,870
please consider the candidates for Alliance Leader

351
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,150
while staying in the city.

352
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,000
We'll set another day to hold the election.

353
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,790
Within the Immortal Alliance,

354
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,960
I was closest to Daocheng.

355
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,030
Now that he's gone,

356
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,440
I've lost a drinking companion too.

357
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,440
I suppose

358
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,320
Xuechen has his doubts,

359
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,870
which is why he hasn't said anything

360
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,600
and has summoned us all here.

361
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,550
Among the suspects in Mr. Xie's eyes,

362
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,000
you're naturally included as well.

363
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,120
Now that he's the city lord,

364
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,670
he can't trust anyone.

365
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,320
That's exactly as it should be.

366
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,030
If Daocheng saw this,

367
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,000
he would be comforted.

368
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,910
Then why don't you

369
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,720
fight for the Alliance Leader position?

370
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,840
Why let Su Ningzhen

371
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,360
act so arrogantly?

372
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,480
Why bother fighting

373
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,920
for such a burdensome position?

374
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,000
I live far away on the Osprey Island

375
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,590
precisely because

376
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,350
I don't want to be troubled by such trivial matters.

377
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,550
Fighting for it just to deal with Su Ningzhen

378
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,310
isn't worth it.

379
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:24,830
This way, please.

380
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:41,750
[Hall of Saints]

381
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,070
Madam Su, you and your cultivators

382
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,310
can rest in this courtyard.

383
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,590
Please.

384
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,440
This way, please.

385
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,750
Qiumin.

386
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,240
Madam.

387
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,550
What are you daydreaming about?

388
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,880
I... I just didn't expect

389
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,160
that Leader Xie would be murdered.

390
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,960
So much has happened recently.

391
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,350
As the Young Madam of the Mirage Palace,

392
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,030
how can you be so timid?

393
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:25,960
Qiumin,

394
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,440
you need to cultivate not only your skills

395
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,750
but also your mind.

396
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,030
Understood, Madam.

397
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,200
When I become the Alliance Leader,

398
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,270
you must be prepared

399
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,790
to take over the Mirage Palace.

400
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,200
If someone didn't know better,

401
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,680
they'd think the Immortal Alliance is falling apart.

402
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,070
Back when my father was around,

403
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,920
I barely paid attention to the Alliance's matters.

404
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,920
Now that I've seen it,

405
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,750
I realize even the Alliance

406
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,160
can be this ridiculous.

407
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,070
You didn't join the Alliance

408
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,750
because of this reason too, didn't you?

409
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,310
That's the difference between us.

410
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,550
For things I hate,

411
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,000
I can turn a blind eye.

412
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,200
But you,

413
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,270
you can't help but try to fix them.

414
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,170
That's why I can live carefree

415
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,070
at the Greenview Heights,

416
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,550
while you're left in the bitter cold,

417
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,070
bound and alone.

418
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,960
Leader Xie

419
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,960
was at the Spiritual Form stage.

420
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,070
Whoever killed him

421
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,070
must be among them.

422
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,510
You're pretending your spiritual power hasn't recovered

423
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,590
to lure the traitor out,

424
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,160
but they might not fall for it.

425
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,830
Within a few days,

426
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,960
there will likely be an assassination attempt.

427
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,790
I'm waiting for them.

428
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,350
When will you

429
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,590
start worrying about your own life?

430
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,070
If you die,

431
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,750
I might actually...

432
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,960
feel a little sad.

433
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
I'll try not to die.

434
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,750
Senior.

435
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,960
Senior!

436
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,480
What are your thoughts on this matter?

437
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,680
You should have...

438
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,160
Senior,

439
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,440
even if it's for the people of this world,

440
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,310
you should take up the role of Alliance Leader.

441
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,160
When it comes to resolve,

442
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,880
I am not as strong as Mr. Xie.

443
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,030
When it comes to cultivation stage,

444
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,640
I am far weaker.

445
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,000
How can you know that

446
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,880
without fighting him?

447
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,480
Mr. Xie may be born with an extra sense,

448
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,030
but he's still so young.

449
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,440
Can he really compare to you,

450
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,210
with 500 years of cultivation?

451
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,550
Mr. Xie's faith is pure,

452
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,880
and his sword heart untainted.

453
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,030
But I...

454
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,640
my heart is filled with distractions.

455
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,750
I am unworthy of the position.

456
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,790
- Senior... - Master,

457
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,720
the Sect Leader is tired.

458
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,510
Please let him rest for now.

459
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,310
Xuan Xin,

460
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,000
you call me Master,

461
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,790
yet you always side with the Sect Leader.

462
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,510
You shouldn't hold me back. You should persuade him.

463
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,750
The Sect Leader has his own decisions.

464
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,000
No one should impose their will on him.

465
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,750
No one?

466
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,310
Are you saying I, your Master, am no one?

467
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,160
Yes.

468
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,790
I am no one, too.

469
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,200
You...

470
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
I should never have picked you up back then.

471
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,200
Look at how you anger me now.

472
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,920
What's done is done.

473
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,350
Master,

474
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,510
it's too late for regrets.

475
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,790
I originally came here to have fun,

476
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,880
but I didn't expect the Alliance Leader to be killed.

477
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,400
These scoundrels

478
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,550
are truly bold,

479
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,240
daring to act in the Snow City.

480
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,750
If I catch them, I'll definitely...

481
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,440
What if you get harmed?

482
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,750
This is not your battle

483
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,070
to play hero.

484
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,850
Before you reach the Spiritual Form stage,

485
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,640
make sure you keep yourself alive.

486
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,270
Your battlefield

487
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,550
is a century from now.

488
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,790
You're destined to become

489
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,070
the leader of the Immortal Alliance.

490
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,700
Mother, aren't you thinking

491
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,640
too highly of me?

492
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,030
What am I, really?

493
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,310
Mr. Xie's divine presence

494
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,240
and unparalleled sword skills

495
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,240
are unmatched for centuries.

496
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,440
Even if he isn't the current Alliance Leader,

497
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,680
he's bound to be the next.

498
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,920
And besides, he's still so young.

499
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,250
He could hold the position

500
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,510
for hundreds of years.

501
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,550
What do you know?

502
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,000
The Spiritual Form stage grants a lifespan of a thousand years,

503
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,530
but how many truly live

504
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,570
to the end of it?

505
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,110
And as for Xie Xuechen's sword skills,

506
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,640
they're a force of pure devastation.

507
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,880
"If I can't survive,

508
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,920
we all perish together"...

509
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,000
They leave no path of retreat.

510
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,590
That's not sustainable.

511
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,000
Who knows?

512
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,480
If you just live long enough,

513
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,960
you won't even need to fight for it.

514
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,510
You could simply outlast

515
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,400
all your opponents.

516
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,920
Are you implying

517
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,750
my greatest value

518
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,550
is simply staying alive?

519
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,160
I can't agree with that.

520
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,270
Father's ideas make more sense.

521
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,070
Lansheng,

522
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,270
your greatest value

523
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,480
is marrying someone

524
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,440
with power and influence,

525
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,200
a Young Mistress who can hold her ground.

526
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,400
That way,

527
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,000
the Jade Sky Palace can continue to thrive.

528
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,740
- Father... - Fu Yuanting!

529
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,740
Your tricks

530
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,110
might work on me,

531
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,480
but now you're trying to corrupt my son too?

532
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,960
My tricks?

533
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,440
Hey,

534
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,240
didn't you pick me

535
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,200
because you wanted a son unmatched in looks,

536
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,310
and I had

537
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,920
an unparalleled, stunning face?

538
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,640
We're on the same level.

539
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,960
Neither of us has the right to criticize.

540
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,640
But if I'd known

541
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,880
your beauty would fade

542
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,070
so quickly,

543
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,030
I might have chosen someone else.

544
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,830
There it is.

545
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,400
You've finally admitted it.

546
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,240
You're still thinking about that person, right?

547
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,960
Who?

548
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,240
Who else could I have in mind?

549
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,680
And what does it matter to you?

550
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,590
I'm about to be betrayed

551
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,310
by my wife!

552
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,070
Of course it matters to me...

553
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,510
Father, Mother,

554
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,920
I'm still here.

555
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,310
Get out!

556
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,790
Oh...

557
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,920
Young Master, what happened?

558
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,830
I found a top-grade Hetian jade.

559
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,550
Well,

560
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,720
the Master and the Elders

561
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,160
are currently planning

562
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,110
the future development

563
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,400
of the Jade Sky Palace.

564
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,000
So, uh,

565
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,070
carry on with your business.

566
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,920
No worries.

567
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,640
It's shocking how difficult

568
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,510
marriage can be.

569
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,510
Marriage?

570
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,400
Only a fool would get married.

571
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:06,420
[Swirling Snow Pavilion]

572
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,750
This person isn't at the Spiritual Form stage.

573
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,110
With his strength,

574
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,400
there's no way he could have killed Father.

575
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,110
It seems the real culprit

576
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,640
is still in the shadows.

577
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,720
As expected of Xie Xuechen.

578
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,720
Even without drawing his sword,

579
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,920
and with only 40% of his usual spiritual power,

580
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,400
he's still beyond the reach of ordinary cultivators.

581
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,400
In the dead of night,

582
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,070
you two were really going at it.

583
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,350
Even the bed broke.

584
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,160
Your friend?

585
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,640
He looks so terrifying.

586
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,520
You...

587
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,590
No need to chase him.

588
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,240
Let him go back and report.

589
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,440
So, this was your and Nan Xuyue's plan,

590
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,510
playing weak to lure the enemy?

591
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,440
How despicable.

592
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,750
You really should include me

593
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,440
in such schemes.

594
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,880
You? Forget it.

595
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,830
This kind of underhanded tactic

596
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,000
is far too fitting for you.

597
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,440
Back here in the Snow City,

598
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,720
in your own home,

599
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,030
and yet you still face killing attempts.

600
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,070
So, how was it?

601
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,830
Good thing I arrived just in time, right?

602
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,030
The Snow City token isn't in their hands yet,

603
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,960
so they won't kill me for now.

604
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,880
They're just here to test how much

605
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,790
of my spiritual power has recovered.

606
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,750
Then I overstepped.

607
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,750
If I hadn't come earlier,

608
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,480
how were you planning to end

609
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,070
this drama?

610
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,550
According to the plan, I'd get injured

611
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,960
and desperately send out a distress call.

612
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,640
The elders and disciples

613
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:37,920
would come to drive him away.

614
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,880
Always with these reckless strategies.

615
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,510
What about the sword I gave you?

616
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,640
Didn't you say you wanted to live like a mortal?

617
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,310
Why are you still carrying the demonic vines?

618
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,920
Mr. Xie,

619
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,030
my sword skills are awful.

620
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,920
If I had brought a sword to save you,

621
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,830
the assassin would have laughed himself to death.

622
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,160
Also,

623
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,830
Aren't you jumping

624
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,110
into this scolding too fast?

625
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,880
Then I should thank you.

626
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,960
Once I do, can I scold you?

627
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:10,960
Late at night,

628
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
what were you doing at my place?

629
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,240
Your skill in lying

630
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,640
is improving far too quickly.

631
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,160
Though,

632
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,730
being the City Lord, you're so busy

633
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,810
that you don't even have time

634
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,000
to teach your disciples sword skills.

635
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,110
But as a disciple of the Snow City,

636
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,170
protecting the City Lord is an unshakable duty.

637
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,920
Why be so suspicious?

638
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,440
Stop looking at me like that.

639
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,590
You've got a guilty conscience.

640
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,590
You're right.

641
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,920
I have so many bad things I want to do.

642
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,880
But tonight...

643
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,590
tonight,

644
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,680
I just suddenly wanted to see you.

645
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,160
Xie Xuechen,

646
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,200
just one day apart,

647
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,110
and I missed you.

648
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,680
Mr. Xie...

649
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,680
am I beautiful?

650
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,030
All appearances are but illusions,

651
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
and in a century, only bones remain.

652
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,640
In your eyes,

653
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,550
people are nothing more

654
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,070
than good or evil, strong or weak.

655
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,160
But do you know, in my eyes,

656
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,510
what's the difference

657
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,590
between people?

658
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,070
There's Xie Xuechen,

659
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,920
and then there's everyone else.

660
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,790
Mu Xuanling, how dare you!

661
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,550
In the middle of the night, instead of staying in your quarter,

662
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,240
you sneak out

663
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:50,880
and even...

664
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,880
disturb the City Lord.

665
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,030
Your reckless behavior

666
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,030
disrupts the City Lord

667
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,310
and your fellow disciples' rest.

668
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,160
You're setting a bad example.

669
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,790
Do you realize your mistake?

670
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,110
Yes, yes.

671
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,200
I'll go back and reflect on my mistake.

672
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:13,920
Mr. Xie,

673
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,590
your bed breaks too easily.

674
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,310
Next time,

675
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:17,920
get a sturdier one.

676
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,550
How dare you!

677
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,640
Mu Xuanling!

678
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,960
You...

679
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,750
Sir,

680
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,550
Xuechen,

681
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,880
you and her...

682
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,310
oh...

683
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,480
The bed couldn't handle much force.

684
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,480
I really should get a sturdier one.

685
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,480
I...

686
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,350
It's getting late.

687
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,960
Elder, please go rest.

688
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,110
Hey...

689
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,480
Senior Daocheng,

690
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,960
the sect has suffered misfortune,

691
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,400
and the Snow City is tarnished.

692
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,600
It's my failure to oversee everything properly,

693
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,720
my fault entirely.

694
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,000
Your Grace.

695
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,830
What do you think

696
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,880
of the human realm?

697
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,550
The human realm seems no different from the Dark Abyss.

698
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
The strength of their inner demons

699
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,750
surpasses even that

700
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,790
of us Dark Clan.

701
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,160
If even you can sense it,

702
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,480
why can't she see it?

703
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,920
Your Grace, are you referring to the Saintess?

704
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,640
She has invested far too much

705
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,830
into the human race.

706
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,590
A message from the Decaying Immortal Pavilion says

707
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,160
Xie Xuechen's spiritual power has not recovered.

708
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,790
Go to the Snow City and seize the Chaos Pearl.

709
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,200
Deliver it to me.

710
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,200
If anyone stands in your way,

711
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,350
kill them!

712
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,510
Understood.

713
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,590
Mr. Nan, who's passing you love notes

714
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,590
on a paper crane?

715
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,000
Which young lady is that?

716
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,110
If Feng Yao learns

717
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,920
someone called her a "young lady,"

718
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,440
she probably won't be pleased.

719
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,840
I asked Feng Yao

720
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,280
to investigate the Decaying Immortal Pavilion.

721
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,070
After the chaos at the Mirage Palace,

722
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,360
they completely disappeared.

723
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,150
No surprise.

724
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,460
But,

725
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,840
they've been active in the human realm,

726
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,190
hiring many from both the Humans and Spirits.

727
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,510
It seems

728
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,400
someone must have noticed them.

729
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,630
Indeed.

730
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:51,920
Feng Yao

731
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,480
found a spirit clansman in a town

732
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,590
near the Jade Sky Palace.

733
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,550
He claimed to have seen members of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion.

734
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,840
He described the leader

735
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,320
as a young man in his twenties

736
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,800
with exceptional grace.

737
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,590
Another was masked with a black cloth,

738
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,710
but by the voice,

739
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,920
it was also a young man.

740
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,840
He addressed the leader as "Master."

741
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,800
Masked with a black cloth...

742
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,550
That clearly shows he doesn't want

743
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,630
his identity known.

744
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,070
Then why

745
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,000
would the Pavilion Master

746
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,070
show his true face?

747
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,400
Perhaps he's confident in his power.

748
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,590
The Pavilion has operated for so many years.

749
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,190
Eliminating them completely

750
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,800
won't be an easy task.

751
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,030
The Decaying Immortal Pavilion is still at large.

752
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,110
By now,

753
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,920
Sang Qi should be out of seclusion.

754
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,360
What will

755
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,710
his next move be?

756
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,190
I sense the presence of the Dark Clan...

757
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,920
I didn't expect that so many in the Immortal Alliance

758
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,110
are harboring ignorance.

759
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,630
Very good.

760
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,920
This body is too weak.

761
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,000
It's time

762
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,110
to select another,

763
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,590
a better puppet.

764
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,070
Xuanling!

765
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,230
What's wrong, Bao?

766
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,510
There's...

767
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,320
there's something scary nearby.

768
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,320
It's just like back when

769
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,150
at Mr. Nan's house.

770
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,510
The Dark Clan?

771
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,110
Which direction?

772
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,440
South... southeast.

773
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,800
Stay here and look after Bao.

774
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,760
She's timid.

775
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,550
If she sees the Dark Clan,

776
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,670
she might be scared to death.

777
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,400
I'll go take a look.

778
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,550
Are you going alone?

779
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,400
That's enough.

780
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,880
You must have already sensed it.

781
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,070
I'm going to meet Mr. Xie.

782
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,880
Xuan Xin,

783
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,000
take the disciples and set up an array.

784
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,190
Find the Dark Clan

785
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,070
and eliminate them.

786
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,150
Understood.

787
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,630
It's been a while,

788
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,230
and our Saintess's killing intent is as strong as ever.

789
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,880
I wondered who it was,

790
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,190
so ignorant and reckless.

791
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,710
Turns out it's you,

792
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:38,760
Ignorance Demon.

793
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,280
After all these years of fighting,

794
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,190
I've killed you many times.

795
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,510
Get used to it.

796
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,000
His Grace asked me to deliver a message to you.

797
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,800
Do you forget who you are

798
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,400
from playing the good guy for too long!

799
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,670
You set out with His Grace's mission,

800
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,150
yet you've delayed taking action.

801
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,280
His Grace can't help but suspect...

802
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,150
you have hidden motives.

803
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,440
Since Master has told you

804
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,400
everything,

805
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,230
you should know

806
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,960
I have my own plans.

807
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,590
When it comes to my work,

808
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,000
I can't stand anyone meddling,

809
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,590
not even Master.

810
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,760
And you have even less right to.

811
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,360
Stop!

812
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,280
You truly are vile,

813
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,710
daring to harm the innocent!

814
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,360
Miss, please save me!

815
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,920
I discovered her demonic power,

816
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,290
so she wants to kill me to silence me!

817
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,590
Gao Qiumin, are you stupid?

818
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,800
He's possessed by the Dark Clan!

819
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,280
The Snow City has protective barriers.

820
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,550
How could the Dark Clan possibly enter?

821
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,630
Get lost!

822
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,590
I should never have covered for you before.

823
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,880
Spirit demonic cultivators

824
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,280
are truly no good!

825
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,760
Gao Qiumin,

826
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,510
the Immortal Alliance is full of fools,

827
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,030
and you're their leader!

828
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,030
What are you trying to do?

829
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,840
Gao Qiumin,

830
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:53,630
today,

831
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,400
I'll settle both old and new grudges with you!

832
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,880
The Xuantian Sect's Curse?

833
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,840
Could the Dark Clan really have invaded?

834
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,400
If that's true,

835
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,670
then I misjudged her earlier.

836
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,070
The Xuantian Sect's Curse...

837
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,840
It seems anyone who practices demonic power...

838
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,400
cannot escape

839
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,760
the Xuantian Sect's Curse...

840
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,030
I found it.

841
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,880
I win.

842
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,710
You killed your own kind,

843
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,230
stepping over their corpses

844
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,000
to reach your current position.

845
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,110
If they didn't die,

846
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,960
then I would have.

847
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,400
If only one can live,

848
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,000
then it has to be me.

849
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,070
Indeed.

850
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,440
Impressive.

851
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,660
[Temple of Divine Execution]

852
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,400
My dear disciple,

853
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,840
tell me,

854
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,670
after fighting to survive,

855
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,840
what is it you desire?

856
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,070
I want revenge.

857
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,840
They killed the only person in this world

858
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,590
who was kind to me,

859
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,670
the one who gave me warmth!

860
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,590
I want power...

861
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,150
enough to take revenge on the Immortal Alliance!

862
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,190
I want revenge!

863
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,360
[Temple of Divine Execution]

864
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,030
Remember,

865
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,510
the more pain you endure,

866
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,550
the stronger you'll become.

867
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,590
You've won.

868
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,670
From today onward,

869
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,960
you're no longer just my disciple,

870
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,440
you are also the Saintess of the Dark Abyss.
