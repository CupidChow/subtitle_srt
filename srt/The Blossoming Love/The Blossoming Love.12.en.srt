00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,240
Chant the curse

19
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,200
and repel the Ignorance Demon!

20
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,590
Ling,

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,630
you see that I didn't lie to you, right?

22
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,190
I told you

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,800
that if you don't come back to Dark Abyss in a month,

24
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,470
your demonic energy

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,430
will split your body up.

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,750
You've been in the human world for half a month now.

The retribution

28
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,190

00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,000
Come back to me.

34
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,470
There's nothing for you in the human world.

35
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,970
Nothing.

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,220
Humans

37

They

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,630
are always insatiable

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
and lack of self-awareness.

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,120
They are the worst in all the evilness.

43
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,310
They shouldn't exist.

44
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,800
Remember.

45
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400

Qiumin!

54
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,280
- Mu Xuanling! - Miss Gao!

55
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,820
If any of you dare to say one more word from the curse,

56
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
she will be dead.

57
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,470
Mu Xuanling!

You've been looking for the traitor in the Immortal Alliance, right?

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,470
Let me give you a hint.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,520
There's another one among you

63
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,470
who has been colluding with the Dark Clan.

64
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,710
The one you trust the most,

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,470
Mr. Xie!

66
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,680
Ridiculous!

67
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,820
You are just trying to sow discord in the Immortal Alliance.

68
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,400
It is not baseless.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,190
The one standing in front of you

70
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,270
is the Saintess of Dark Abyss.

71
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,680
The direct disciple of His Grace, Sang Qi.

72
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,000
It was Xie Xuechen

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,510
who brought her back to the Snow City.

74
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,560
You don't have to take my word for it.

75
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,190
Just ask him.

76
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,480
Yes.

77
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,430
Told you so.

78
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,510
The golden boy of humanity

79
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,600
colluded with the Saintess of the Dark Abyss.

80
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,750

82
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,360
Surrender the Chaos Pearl

83
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,390
and remove the barrier.

84
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,000
You are already unconscious,

85
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,510
and yet, you won't say

86
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,360
anything cruel to him.

87
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,160
Fine.

88
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,160
Let me help you.

89
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
Surrender the Chaos Pearl

90
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,950
and remove the barrier.

91
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,560
Otherwise,

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,920
all of them will die.

93
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,800
Mu Xuanling!

94
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,360
Mu Xuanling will not kill them.

95
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,560
Mu Xuanling may not,

96
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,430
but Mr. Xie,

97
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,950
how about you?

98
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,510
A recording stone!

99
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,130
The lord of the Jade Sky Palace

100
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,240
truly lives up to the name

101
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,920
of the artifact encyclopedia.

102
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,750
Recording stones

103
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,240
are stone shards

104
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,860
from when the ladder to the celestial world collapsed

105
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,000
tens of thousands of years ago.

106
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,720
It can record true sounds and images.

107
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,650
No cultivator can change that,

108
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,830
no matter how powerful.

109
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,000
That means

110
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,000
what's recorded by the stone

111
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,510
is real.

112
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,920
You witch! What is this about?

113
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,320
Let Qiumin go!

114
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,310
Calm down.

115
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,750
The whole gang is here today.

116
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,430
Let me show you

117
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,870
a ten-year-long secret.

118
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,120
- What? - How?

119
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,240
Father!

120
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,270
Xie Xuechen.

121
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,310
Tell me why.

122
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,830
Why did you kill my father!

123
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,630
Mr. Xie won't explain.

124
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,600
Let me help you with that.

125
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,310
Ten years ago,

126
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,000
a young cultivator

127
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,270
left the mountain to hone his skills.

128
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,190
He passed by the surrounding area of Moonlight Heights

129
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
and decided to stay there last minute.

130
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,950
That night

131
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,600
happens to be the night Sang Qi attacked the place.

132
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Our young cultivator went to help,

133
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,240
but instead of doing that,

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,920
he was possessed by a Dark Clan member

135
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,920
because his faith was not strong enough.

136
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,120
He killed the then-leader

137
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,720
of the Immortal Alliance, Gao Fengxu, with Klicks.

138
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,630
On the same night,

139
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,600
the young cultivator's father also rushed here to help

140
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,830
and saw his son killing the alliance leader.

141
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,120
Justice

142
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,120
lost to sentiments.

143
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,720
His father cleared the alliance leader's wound

144
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,570
of the aura of Klicks

145
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,630
before anyone noticed it

146
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,480
and kept the incident of his son

147
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,720
killing someone after being possessed by a Dark Clan member.

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,480
Yet his conscience is troubled.

149
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,970
He punished the young cultivator to review his actions on Snow Cliff

150
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,440
for 7 years.

151
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,510
I gave you Klicks

152
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,670
along with the fate

153
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,750
of the world.

154
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,790
Yet you

155
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,150
used it to kill your allies

156
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,480
and committed this serious crime.

157
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
So?

158
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,630
How do you

159
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,910
like the story?

160
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,670
I don't remember

161
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,630
anything about that day.

162
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,750
That is the symptom

163
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,360
of being possessed by a Dark Clan member.

164
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,320
See that?

165
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,240
There you have

166
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,870
that Mr. Xie, who you trust the most.

167
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,600
He's just an ordinary person

168
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,670
who killed his innocent allies

169
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,960
because of a lack of faith.

170
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,150
Aren't you worried

171
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,270
that he will lead you to a fate of death?

172
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't listen to her bewitching words.

173
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,440
She's a witch from the Dark Abyss.

174
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,510
We can't take her word for it.

175
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,750
Not everything we see

176
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,840
is the truth.

177
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,080
Besides,

178
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,360
it's just an image left by a stone.

179
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,030
But you can't

180
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,750
fake things with a recording stone.

181
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,080
You…

182
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,150
You see what's happening?

183
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,080
Not even one person

184
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,910
in the whole Immortal Alliance dares to speak up for your father.

185
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,750
Do you know why?

186
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,910
Because it is Xie Xuechen

187
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,440
who killed him.

188
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,480
You witch!

189
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,030
Stop disturbing our minds

190
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,910
with your wicked words.

191
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,380
Ignorance Demon.

192
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,840
Everyone is here today.

193
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,720
It's the time to eliminate them all.

194
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,030
Fajian has accumulated 500 years of power.

195
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,670
The golden essence in his body is mighty.

196
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,200
To detonate it

197
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,030
will bring half Snow City

198
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,360
down with you.

199
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,790
That's a new solution.

200
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,790
Let's go big.

201
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,810
Nan Xuyue,

202
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,910
reinforce the barrier!

203
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,200
Nan Xuyue!

204
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,870
Even if

205
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,030
I die in the Lofty Cloud Array,

206
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,750
you are not removing the barrier today.

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
An insignificant artifact…

208
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,270
Cannot stop me.

209
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,720
Disciples of Snow City!

210
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,840
Join the array!

211
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,670
- Yes. - Yes.

212
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,390
Disciples of Snow City, Cui Miaomiao, joins the array!

213
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,840
Disciples of Snow City, Wang Zheng, joins the array!

214
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,440
Disciples of Snow City, Jing Sheng, joins the array!

215
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,440
Disciples of Snow City, Chun Feng, joins the array!

216
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,600
Mu Xuanling, Disciple of Snow City, join the array!

217
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,320
Mu Xuanling, Disciple of Snow City, join the array!

218
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,910
Mu Xuanling, Disciple of Snow City, join the array!

219
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,670
Mu Xuanling, Disciple of Snow City, join the array!

220
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,600
Mu Xuanling, join the array!

221
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,720
Mu Xuanling, join the array!

222
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,150
Mu Xuanling, join the array!

223
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,670
Mu Xuanling, join the array!

224
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,870
Your temperament

225
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,750
is not compatible with Snow City.

226
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,440
That's why

227
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,270
you will be starting

228
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,270
from the basic external disciple.

229
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,550
You shall refine your characteristics

230
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and start anew.

231
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,030
Mu Xuanling, Disciple of Snow City, join the array!

232
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,320
As a disciple of Snow City,

233
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,030
you can't be so downhearted.

234
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,030
But I joined the sect earlier than you did.

235
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,320
You are a junior.

236
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,440
Mu Xuanling, Disciple of Snow City, join the array!

237
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,750
Did you say

238
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,270
that you want to leave the Dark Abyss

239
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,080
and live a normal life?

240
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,910
I believed you,

241
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,720
that's why I brought you to Snow City.

242
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,720
You can live

243
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,480
a normal life here.

244
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,750
If you believe it,

245
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,000
the way will reveal itself.

246
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,390
Mu Xuanling.

247
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
When we have a chance,

248
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,440
I'll show you the real human world.

249
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,510
Xie Xuechen.

251
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,460

Xie Xuechen…

261
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,670
Ling,

262
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,720
you are such a disappointment.

263
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,000
Why are you doing this?

264
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,480
You can't make up your mind,

265
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,720
so I cut him loose for you.

266
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,360
What's wrong with that?

267
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,840
You weren't

268
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,840
possessed by a Dark Clan member.

269
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,360
You have doubts about humanity

270
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,870
and you hate the Immortal Alliance deep down.

271
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,150
That's why you couldn't resist the demonic melody

272
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,790
and handed your conscience to me.

273
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,960
You must have heard it all.

274
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,080
Back then,

275
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,600
Xie Xuechen was possessed by a Dark Clan member.

276
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,360
That means

277
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,870
the person on your mind for the last ten years

278
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,720
was not him.

279
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,440
If you knew that,

280
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,770
why didn't you tell me?

281
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,600
Because hatred

282
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,790
makes you powerful.

283
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,840
Hatred

284
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,600
gives you the strength to survive in the Dark Abyss.

285
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,270
Where is that person?

286
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,550
Where did he go after that night?

287
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,600
I've never met him

288
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,910
in the Dark Abyss over the last ten years.

289
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,910
When a Dark Clan member dies,

290
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,510
his spirit will return to the Void Sea.

291
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,220
No one knows when the spirit will gain a physical form.

292
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,360
Maybe tomorrow,

293
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,550
or the day after tomorrow.

294
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,480
Maybe a hundred years

295
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
or a thousand years later.

296
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,630
You need to be patient.

297
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,720
Ling,

298
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,750
you should get back

299
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,750
to the Dark Abyss for his sake.

300
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,630
You are hesitating.

301
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,600
Because of Xie Xuechen.

302
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,200
So,

303
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,540
you learned

304
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,080
that Xie Xuechen was not that guy,

305
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,440
yet you were willing to die with him.

306
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,550
Absurd!

307
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
My life

308
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
is my decision.

309
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,480
Even you

310
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,680
don't have the right to decide for me.

311
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,790
Ling,

312
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,550
I feel sad

313
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,680
hearing that.

314
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,480
I thought

315
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,440
you'd lost the ability to feel long ago.

316
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,310
On the day you lost your arm.

317
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm sticking to the path I chose.

318
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,720
Even if it leads to a dead end?

319
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,550
Yes.

320
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,400
Then get lost.

321
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,310
She's Sang Qi's disciple

322
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,270
and a witch from the Dark Abyss.

323
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,440
We can't spare her life!

324
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,550
According to the law of the Immortal Alliance, she should be executed right away.

325
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,680
She was just

326
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,920
controlled by the demonic energy.

327
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
It's a fact that she was a demon.

328
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,920
If she can be controlled,

329
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,920
then this will repeat.

330
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,880
Sang Qi's disciple

331
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,400
will never turn to the bright side.

332
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,110
Never give the evilness chances.

333
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,880
Master!

334
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,240
Mr. Xie,

335
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,000
are you seriously defending the witch?

336
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,960
She has never done anything evil.

337
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,000
This shouldn't be her fate.

338
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,960
If evil deeds are deemed innocent

339
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,070
because one is controlled,

340
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,200
then how is it fair

341
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,440
to the deceased Saint Fajian?

342
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,400
Madam Su, are you referring to Mu Xuanling

343
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,480
or me?

344
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,310
You should answer to

345
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,070
Mr. Gao's death.

346
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,880
I will give you

347
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,070
an answer to what happened to Gao Fengxu.

348
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,790
Gao Fengxu

349
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
had it coming.

350
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,640
Mu Xuanling!

351
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,480
Ten years ago,

352
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,750
I was in Moonlight Heights

353
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,920
as a slave when Sang Qi attacked.

354
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,720
Gao Fengxu tried to kill me.

355
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,680
A Dark Clan member killed him to save me.

356
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,200
Total nonsense!

357
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,120
What do the leader of the Immortal Alliance

358
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,000
care about an insignificant slave?

359
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,680
Do you think Gao Fengxu is a decent man?

360
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,400
As the leader of the Immortal Alliance,

361
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,920
he set an example of oppressing and bullying the Spirit Clan.

362
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,070
He may look like an upright man,

363
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,720
but he's just a hypocritical

364
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,440
and ruthless scoundrel.

365
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,960
On the night Sang Qi attacked,

366
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,350
he lost his mind over the killings.

367
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,720
Because of I'm a Spirit Clan,

368
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,550
he tried to kill me

369
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,550
regardless the fact that I did nothing.

370
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,000
A Dark Clan member can't watch him bullying a young girl

371
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,830
and helped me.

372
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,640
What did he do wrong?

373
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,510
Mu Xuanling!

374
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,030
How dare you slander my father!

375
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,350
You lived with him for ten years.

376
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,460
Don't you know

377
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,510
what he's like?

378
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,030
What about you?

379
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,960
What were you doing?

380
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,790
Why pretend that you were in a good relationship now?

381
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,830
You are just two peas in a pod.

382
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,030
Mu Xuanling!

383
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,200
Ladies!

384
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,750
No one has seen

385
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,440
what happened to Mr. Gao.

386
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,880
It's pointless to keep arguing.

387
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,160
Am I right?

388
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,480
Yes.

389
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,030
It has been ten years since Mr. Gao passed away.

390
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,960
We can't allow his name

391
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,240
to be smudged because of a few words.

392
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,640
Mr. Xie's fault

393
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,720
is that his faith was not strong enough

394
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,440
and allowed a Dark Clan member to possess him.

395
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,750
Defending the Dark Clan at all times is difficult for everyone.

396
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,790
Otherwise,

397
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,680
Saint Fajian wouldn't have…

398
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,310
Mr. Xie.

399
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,350
Am I right?

400
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,790
In addition, Mr. Xie stood before

401
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,350
the exploding golden essence

402
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,350
and saved everyone here along with half the city.

403
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,160
How could we judge

404
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,960
his faults and merits?

405
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,640
We will discuss

406
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,070
Mr. Gao's death another day.

407
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,400
Our focus right now should be

408
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,960
how to deal with

409
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,440
the Saintess of the Dark Abyss.

410
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,400
Restrain Mu Xuanling's power

411
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,070
and lock her up in the Frozen Dungeon.

412
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,440
We shall discuss

413
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,640
what to do later.

414
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,070
Mr. Xie…

415
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,070
I said

416
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,160
that we'll discuss it later.

417
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,920
You and him are so similar.

418
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,160
But why

419
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,350
you are not him?

420
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,720
Xuechen. The Immortal Alliance…

421
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,510
Xuechen!

422
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,030
Xuechen!

423
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,600
Saint Fajian

424
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,310
owned great power.

425
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,070
You used your primordial spirit

426
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,720
to resist his self-exploding.

427
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,400
You were looking for death.

428
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,680
Jun Tian Sword took half of the impact.

429
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,790
I will live.

430
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,270
If it weren't for the Jun Tian Sword,

431
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,400
you'd be dead on the spot.

432
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,790
Xuyue.

433
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,000
Xuyue.

434
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,880
Don't let anyone know

435
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,070
about my injury.

436
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,310
You are worried that Sang Qi might strike.

437
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,790
Fajian's self-explosion

438
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,960
has put a crack on the Pearl Tower.

439
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,880
We can't let anything happen to the Chaos Pearl.

440
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,160
As long as I'm all right,

441
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,200
Sang Qi will think twice before making moves.

442
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,310
As long as you are all right,

443
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,480
Immortal Alliance will think twice as well,

444
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,640
and you will keep Mu Xuanling safe.

445
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,350
Right?

446
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
In the Hall of Integrity,

447
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,030
all the sects wanted Mu Xuanling dead.

448
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,620
If you didn't toughen up

449
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,510
and control the situation,

450
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,830
they would have

451
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,590
killed Mu Xuanling on the spot.

452
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,030
Even so,

453
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,790
we have to keep her in the dungeon for the time being.

454
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,000
She has never done anything evil.

455
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,720
This shouldn't be her fate.

456
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,880
But there are abnormalities

457
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,480
in her body.

458
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,680
I checked her pulse.

459
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,830
The demonic energy is stirring up in her body

460
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,000
and pulling her internal channels apart.

461
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,000
Her spiritual apertures are damaged.

462
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,160
I don't know how long she can keep holding on.

463
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,350
The retribution of the demonic energy

464
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,240
makes the sunshine untouchable for me

465
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,000
in the last half month.

466
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,110
Why do I have to go through this?

467
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,830
I don't want to

468
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,350
live like pests in the sewer.

469
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,720
Mr. Xie,

470
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,680
you shouldn't be here.

471
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,030
What happened to you?

472
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,750
It's just a scratch.

473
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,880
Compared to your injury,

474
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,830
this is nothing.

475
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,720
Now that the wristband is broken,

476
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,440
you are not transferring

477
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,030
my wounds to you again.

478
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,000
Xie Xuechen.

479
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,640
I'll be honest with you.

480
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,240
I don't have much time left.

481
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,070
So,

482
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,160
kill me.

483
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,070
Prove that you have strong faith

484
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,310
with my life.

485
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,400
That will put an end to the statement

486
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,510
of you colluding with the Dark Clan.

487
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,200
Kill me,

488
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,110
and you can keep being

489
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,720
the fair

490
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,830
representative of justice.

491
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,880
You have never done anything evil.

492
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,920
You shouldn't die.

493
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,350
What is justice?

494
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,720
If I can't save one person, how can I save the world?

495
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,750
I told you

496
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,960
that when there's hope,

497
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,790
there's a way.

498
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,270
You are in this situation because of me.

499
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,110
Why aren't you mad?

500
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,000
Xie Xuechen.

501
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,720
I'm not as kind as you think.

502
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,070
I lost my conscious today to the demonic power

503
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,640
because there's a demon inside of me.

504
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,790
If it weren't for…

505
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,880
the bond I have with this world,

506
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,350
I might have put an end to the Immortal Alliance

507
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,550
and humanity.

508
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,200
Mu Xuanling.

509
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,270
I've been thinking about a question

510
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,750
since the day we met.

511
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,640
Why were you so persistent about me?

512
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,440
I got my answer today.

513
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,680
It wasn't me

514
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,680
who had been on your mind.

515
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,000
Yes.

516
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,960
It was that big brother.

517
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,000
I owe him my life.

518
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,790
But today,

519
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,440
I wasn't thinking about him.

520
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,440

there's no point talking about this.

524
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,920
Can you bring me some snacks

525
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,270
and delicious liquor?

526
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,640
When I finish my last delicious meal,

527
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,270

to decide.

538
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,030

You knew, didn't you?

555
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,750
When I asked you

556
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,130
how the puppet incident

557
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,270
in Mirage Palace ended,

558
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,240
your answer was vague.

559
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,680
You were covering for her,

560
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,880
weren't you?

561
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,110
I wasn't, Master.

562
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,960
I didn't know that she was the Saintess of the Dark Abyss.

563
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,200
She did use her demonic power to save everyone.

564
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,480
But she's a Spirit Clan member.

565
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,720
You covered up for a Spirit Clan member.

566
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,510
Her kind knows how to lure people.

567
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,240
Sang Qi must have asked that witch

568
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,440
to get close to Xie Xuechen

569
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,510
to hinder

570
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,790
Xie Xuechen's cultivation.

571
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,350
Xie Xuechen

572
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,590
was trapped in the Dark Abyss

573
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,070
and held up under the Lave.

574
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,720
What's the point of complicating things?

575
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,160
What do you know?

576
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,880
Sang Qi is a treacherous man.

577
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,270
Messing with people's minds is fun for him.

578
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,400
Sang Qi is the nemesis of the Mirage Palace.

579
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,830
This vendetta will only end with death.

580
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,510
I will not let him

581
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,350
or that witch off.

582
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,550
Master.

583
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,980
Has Sang Qi tricked you before?

584
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,600
Ridiculous!

585
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,550
He's just a low Spirit Clan member.

586
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,960
He's no match for members of the Mirage Palace.

587
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,110
Master.

588
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,070
Your hatred against Sang Qi

589
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,750
is a little too strong.

590
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,880
Qiumin.

591
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,640
You should hate him, too.

592
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
You have to.

593
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,270
He brought a massacre on Moonlight Heights

594
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,720
and he's the reason your mom is dead.

595
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,200
You said that my mom died when giving birth to me.

596
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,160
I have misspoken.

597
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:43,720
I'm tired.

598
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,310
You should leave me.

599
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:04,260
[Hall of Saints]

600
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,670
Is this barrier useless?

601
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,510
How did you get in here?

602
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,170
The barrier of the Frozen Dungeon

603
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,240
is meant

604
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,510
to trap the prisoners.

605
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,280
Good people like me

606
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,230
can come and go freely.

607
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,710
Good people.

608
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,230
Good lady,

609
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,440
what are you doing here?

610
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,030
Even if I am to be killed,

611
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,590
you shouldn't be the executor.

612
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,150
Mu Xuanling.

613
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,110
You are in this situation

614
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,590
all thanks to

615
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,670
that mouth of yours.

616
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,450
My good ladyship,

617
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,710
you are not here

618
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,230
just to humiliate me, are you?

619
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,070
What?

620
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,440
Is it information that you want?

621
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,000
Do you want to know

622
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,150
about Sang Qi's plan

623
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,840
or why did I

624
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,920
slander Gao Fengxu?

625
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,030
I want to ask

626
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,920
what's the connection of Sang Qi and my mother's death.

627
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,070
Your mom

628
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,670
died of giving birth.

629
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,440
What's Sang Qi's role in this?

630
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,250
I don't know what Su Ningzhen

631
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,150
has told you.

632
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,040
All I know is that

633
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,840
when you were born,

634
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,920
Sang Qi was in seclusion.

635
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,960
He couldn't have gone out to hurt your mother.

636
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,920
Why should I believe you?

637
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,800
If you don't trust me,

638
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,590
why come to me?

639
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,030
Twenty years ago,

640
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,110
Sang Qi hasn't adopted me yet.

641
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,800
I heard about this from other Dark Clan members.

642
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,960
Sang Qi was severely injured

643
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,030
and lost an arm.

644
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,630
He was in seclusion for three years.

645
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:13,920
That means

646
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,320
he couldn't have gone to the human world.

647
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,480
Sang Qi has lost an arm.

648
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,920
Miss Gao,

649
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,190
do you have more questions?

650
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,510
Maybe it's time for you to leave.

651
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,150
I need my rest.

652
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,710
Mu Xuanling!

653
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,030
Why do you always see me

654
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,280
as an enemy?

655
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,110
Because you are just like your father.

656
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,590
You never remember

657
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,110
the vicious things you did to others.

658
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,590
Make yourself clear.

659
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,030
What vicious things have I done to you?

660
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,360
Weren't you the one who were such a high-up

661
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,150
and always bullied members of the Spirit Clan?

662
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,840
When Sang Qi, you switched clothes with me

663
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,440
so that I could die for you. Didn't you do that?

664
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,280
Her eyes…

665
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,670
You are

666
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,510
that girl.

667
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,110
See?

668
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,030
You did forget it.

669
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,840
That's how cheap my life is.

670
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,880
I didn't forget.

671
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,250
It's not like that.

672
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,000
My father forbade me to be close to Spirit Clan slaves.

673
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,630
If I'm kind to anyone,

674
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,900
he would punish them.

675
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,000
That's why I pretended

676
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,280
that I hated Spirit Clan slaves.

677
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,560
As for sacrificing you,

678
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,600
there were so many killings

679
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,360
that I…

680
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,820
I couldn't do anything back then.

681
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,280
The elders arranged everything.

682
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,110
When I realized what was happening,

683
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,320
I was taken away.

684
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,400
I tried to save you,

685
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,400
but you had already been taken.

686
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:12,920
Mu Xuanling.

687
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,480
I didn't want things to happen like that.

688
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,230
Yes.

689
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,230
You got all the advantages

690
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,320
and the faults are always someone else's.

691
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,280
You are always pure and innocent.

692
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,970
My ladyship.

693
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:25,840
Mu Xuanling!

694
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:30,760
Miss Gao,

695
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,400
Mr. Xie has ordered

696
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,590
to keep Ms. Mu here for the time being.

697
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,760
No unauthorized penalties.

698
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,190
Did I do anything to her?

699
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,630
Just a little reminder.

700
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,480
You are not a member of the Immortal Alliance.

701
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,960
What gives you the right to protect her?

702
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,190
Though the Greenview Heights

703
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,510
is not a part of the Immortal Alliance,

704
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,800
someone in the golden essence stage

705
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,440
cannot offend us.

706
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,280
Fine.

707
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,510
For the sake of the Greenview Heights,

708
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,360
I will let this one slide.

709
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Stupid and cowardly.

710
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,000
Is that because of the demonic energy?

711
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,150
I'll get some medicines for your wound.

712
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,920
That will help with your recovery.

713
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,960
It might hurt a little, though.

714
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
I don't think it could hurt more

715
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,840
than being penetrated by demonic energy or demonic energy dispersing.

716
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,960
This is regeneration powder.

717
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,320
It speeds up wound recovery.

718
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,510
But

719
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,710
you will feel both painful and itchy,

720
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,400
like you were bit by bugs.

721
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,880
Maybe just let the wound be.

722
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,070
Scars are like medals in the Spirit Clan.

723
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,590
Do you want to try the decay powder?

724
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,320
Your medals will look fancier.

725
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,590
Mr. Nan

726
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,320
is dashing

727
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,760
and descent,

728
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,230
why do you have poisons so vicious.

729
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,440
That's because

730
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,550
I'm not such a decent person.

731
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,320
Greenview Heights does have

732
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,630
surprisingly efficient medicines.

733
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,920
I'm already feeling better.

734
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,190
How much time do you have?

735
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:37,800
About half a month.

736
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,480
So,

737
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,320
talk to Xie Xuechen.

738
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,230
It is time to kill me.

739
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,840
You already know

740
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,320
that he's not the one who saved you.

741
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
Yet you are still willing to die for him.

742
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,630
I didn't know better.

743
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,440
But when Ignorance Demon

744
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,800
detonated the golden essence,

745
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,110
I was so scared.

746
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,400
I was scared of the idea

747
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,590
that I couldn't find Xie Xuechen in this world.

748
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,400
Other than him saving my life on that day,

749
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,400
I guess

750
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,030
I do have feelings for him.

751
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,360
Anyway, I'm dying.

752
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,030
Does this count as dying in a foreign land?

753
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,190
Never mind.

754
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,710
I don't even know where my hometown is.

755
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,400
How do I know where is a foreign land?

756
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,590
What if I get you out of here?

757
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,230
Would you come with me?

758
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,880
Greenview Heights has unique medical knowledge.

759
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,320
I can help you strengthen your body

760
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,550
and defend the demonic energy.

761
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,360
My arrays are unparalleled in the world.

762
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,280
You will not be found by anyone

763
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:10,840
from the Spirit Clan, the Dark Abyss

764
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,760
or the Immortal Alliance.

765
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,510
Come with me

766
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,710
and you will live

767
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,840
a normal life.

768
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,230
Will you?

769
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,230
How can Snow City answer

770
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,480
to the other sects if they lose an important inmate?

771
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,280
If you stay,

772
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,840
you will die.

773
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,070
Are you willing to die

774
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,400
to protect him?

775
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,070
This is the path I've chosen.

776
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,630
I stick

777
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,880
