[Episode 23]

18
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,950
Don't catch a cold.

19
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,040
I suddenly remembered

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,790
the first time you took me to the Snow City.

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,000
Back then, when you brought me back,

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,870
it was to keep an eye on me, wasn't it?

23
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,310
What if the Immortal Alliance finds out?

24
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,230
Find out what?

25
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,560
That the Alliance Leader

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,790
fell in love with the cunning Saintess of the Dark Abyss?

27
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,480
That would be big news.

28
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,190
Or are you planning

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,870
to tell them directly

30
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,080
I am the Chaos Pearl?

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,470
It's better to keep your identity

32
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,560
as the Chaos Pearl a secret.

33
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,560
Otherwise, you will be the target

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,030
of a multitude of arrows.

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,000
Then how do you plan

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,690
to introduce me to the Snow City?

37
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,590
As expected,

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,780
our relationship

39
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,240
would still trouble him

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,360
if the Immortal Alliance knew about it.

41
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,430
Actually, keeping it from them

42
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,910
and sneaking around is quite fun.

43
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,800
That constant feeling

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,190
of possibly being found out

45
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,000
is more thrilling

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,190
than making it public.

47
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,910
I really wonder what goes on

48
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,630
in your little head every day.

49
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,560
I'm thinking...

50
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,560
If seeing them together makes you uncomfortable,

51
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,910
why follow them here?

52
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,190
Out of sight, out of mind.

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Wouldn't that be better?

54
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,710
How did you know I'm uncomfortable?

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,120
The ending is set.

56
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,750
Fate cannot be changed.

57
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,280
Qian Guang or Feng Xiang couldn't alter it,

58
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,080
nor could they.

59
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,240
Lord of the City...

60
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,310
- Sir! - Sir!

61
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,240
Mr. Nan.

62
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,150
Mu Xuanling!

63
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,150
What are you doing here?

64
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,120
I...

65
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,070
He...

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
He dragged me back to repent for my sins.

67
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,070
Repent for your sins?

68
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,070
She wasn't dragged back.

69
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,070
I asked her

70
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,800
to come home with me.

71
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,720
Sir,

72
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,680
did you two really...

73
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,800
It's a long story.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,560
The wind and snow are harsh in the Snow City.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
Let's not talk here.

76
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,920
Let's go.

77
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,390
Hey...

78
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,560
Sleeping on a real bed after that boat cabin,

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,240
it's so much more comfortable.

80
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,390
He has kept it for me

81
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,680
for all this time?

82
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,560
Has Xie Xuechen peeked at it?

83
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,600
Why are you here?

84
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,920
Come sit.

85
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,430
All the sects heard that Xuechen was coming back,

86
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,970
so they sent people to wait for him.

87
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,240
Xuechen

88
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,950
has to report the Pearl searching results to them.

89
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,240
What do you think?

90
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,120
Want to go listen?

91
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,160
The searching results?

92
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,750
No, thanks.

93
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,680
I can't stand Elder Cang's

94
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,800
heartbroken look.

95
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,390
I won't go and provoke him.

96
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,830
All right.

97
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,070
Then I'll stay here with you,

98
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,120
just like before,

99
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,600
two outsiders,

100
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,360
supporting each other.

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,830
I can give you what you want,

102
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,310
including...

103
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,560
that little affection.

104
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Perhaps

105
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,000
we could become friends

106
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,070
even closer.

107
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,270
Nan Xuyue...

108
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,950
- back then, I said that because of the Disillusion Water... - I know.

109
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,950
Just joking.

110
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,000
You don't mind?

111
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,190
Mind what?

112
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,830
Mind you being together with him?

113
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,750
If I said I didn't mind at all,

114
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,070
I'd be lying to you.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,120
Since you already know,

116
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,000
why are you still willing

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,310
to come back to the Snow City with us?

118
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,720
Although your choice

119
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,950
makes me feel a bit uneasy,

120
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,310
as long as you're happy,

121
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,950
that's enough.

122
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,600
Don't you want to go listen?

123
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:18,750
No.

124
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,000
Since you don't want to go,

125
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,750
then I won't join the crowd either.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,920
Get some rest.

127
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,680
I'll take my leave now.

128
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,120
Wait.

129
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,480
I've been wanting

130
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,070
to return this jade to you.

131
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,240
Why?

132
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,870
My heart belongs to Xie Xuechen,

133
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,270
and there will never be anyone else in my heart.

134
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,950
So,

135
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,000
I can't keep accepting your kindness.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,190
I don't want to owe a debt I can't repay.

137
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,430
I never intended for you to return it.

138
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,750
On the contrary, I hoped

139
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,560
you'd owe me

140
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,830
this little favor.

141
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,120
Someday,

142
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,950
it might make you think of me as a friend.

143
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,440
Fine.

144
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,670
We're just ordinary friends.

145
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
I shouldn't even touch you.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,630
Keep it.

147
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,150
It's just a token of care between ordinary friends.

148
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,870
One last question!

149
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,270
What does Xie Xuechen

150
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,270
mean to you?

151
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,270
What do you think?

152
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,600
Because of me,

153
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,320
you lied to him

154
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,550
and kept things from him.

155
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
That doesn't seem like something a friend would do.

156
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,440
Or perhaps,

157
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,440
all along,

158
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,150
you've just been pretending to be his friend?

159
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,840
Nan Xuyue,

160
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,360
how much of your care for him is sincere?

161
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,080
If I weren't sincere,

162
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,600
then back at the Greenview Heights,

163
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,270
in the Snow City or the Mirage Palace,

164
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,840
I could've just stood by

165
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,510
and let him die.

166
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,200
Why would I have saved him?

167
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,510
Mu Xuanling,

168
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,120
you've seen all this for yourself.

169
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,790
After ten years in the Dark Abyss,

170
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,480
I've grown used to not trusting anyone.

171
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,550
Nan Xuyue,

172
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,150
I want to see you as an old friend,

173
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,440
but your actions make me doubt.

174
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,080
Xie Xuechen is my bottom line.

175
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,150
If we're to move forward,

176
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,790
you don't act,

177
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,510
and I won't act.

178
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,200
But if one day

179
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,480
you hurt Xie Xuechen,

180
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,000
I will show no mercy.

181
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,120
Fine.

182
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
If that day comes

183
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,910
and I hurt him,

184
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,910
you can take my life.

00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,270
are not the same thing.

192
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,180
♪It's like a gentle kiss from warm winds♪

193
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,500
♪Love blooms across mountains♪

194
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,940
♪My heart belongs to you♪

195
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,020
♪Join me to savor the world's dazzling fireworks...♪

196
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,910
Sir,

197
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,600
do you think she fully trusts you?

198
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,630
As she said,

199
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,750
these ten years in the Dark Abyss

200
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,870
have made her stop trusting others easily.

201
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,200
But because of those experiences,

202
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,120
she understands better than anyone

203
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,600
that making another enemy

204
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,550
isn't good for anyone.

205
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,960
It's better to maintain the current state...

206
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,030
even if this current state

207
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,120
is already on the point of collapse.

208
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Is the Chaos Pearl

209
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,120
truly impossible to find?

210
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,000
Regarding the Chaos Pearl,

211
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,600
since I've already agreed,

212
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,550
I will see it through to the end.

213
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Please rest assured, Elder.

214
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,960
Very well.

215
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,200
And what about Mu Xuanling?

216
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,750
Xuechen,

217
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,600
I've watched you grow up.

218
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,960
I've also seen you

219
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,750
transform from a reckless youth

220
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,670
into the composed and steady man you are today.

221
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,850
I've seen you pay the price

222
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,600
for your past mistakes,

223
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,000
imprisoning yourself for seven years at the Snow Cliff.

224
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,080
Honestly,

225
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,000
I've always hoped

226
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,670
you'd find a lifelong partner to stay by your side,

227
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,910
so you wouldn't walk this path alone.

228
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,030
But the less likely someone is to fall in love,

229
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,440
the deeper they'll fall when they do,

230
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,600
lost with no escape.

231
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,870
In the end,

232
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,440
their obsessions

233
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,840
will turn into inner demons,

234
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,790
shaking their faith again.

235
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,270
But I no longer want to avoid my feelings.

236
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,750
Because I've come to understand my heart.

237
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,790
The desire to protect someone

238
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,910
can make my faith

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,750
stronger

240
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,600
and more steadfast.

241
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,510
Rest assured,

242
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,720
I won't repeat the mistakes of the past.

243
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,750
Even so,

244
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,200
that partner should be upright

245
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,910
and kind,

246
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,510
not someone like Mu Xuanling,

247
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,550
cunning and unpredictable.

248
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,720
How can I rest easy

249
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,480
or face your father like this?

250
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,870
She has left the Dark Abyss

251
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,000
and will no longer threaten the Immortal Alliance.

252
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,080
Silly child.

253
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,750
I'm not worried

254
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,150
about her endangering the Immortal Alliance.

255
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm worried she'll hurt you.

256
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,670
I hope you truly understand

257
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,870
what kind of person you've fallen for,

258
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,760
and that you're not just blinded

259
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,630
by her tricks.

260
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,840
Or in the end,

261
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,750
you might find yourself hurt

262
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,320
and disappointed.

263
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,440
Elder Cang,

264
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,200
I know the things you've said today

265
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,550
are for my sake.

266
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,510
But I believe

267
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,910
I've never been more certain

268
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,320
of what I'm doing than I am now.

269
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,720
I trust in her feelings for me,

270
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,440
and I trust my judgment of her.

271
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,960
It seems I've been overly concerned.

272
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,630
Let's hope

273
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,670
Mu Xuanling doesn't betray

274
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,030
your sincerity.

275
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,390
Looks like attending this meeting

276
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,080
was worth it after all.

277
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,390
[Swirling Snow Pavilion]

278
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,000
Mu Xuanling.

279
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,030
What are you doing?

280
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,550
That day in the Snow City,

281
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,510
when I fell under the Xuantian Sect's Curse,

282
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,510
I woke up right here.

283
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,440
Back then, I thought

284
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,510
your room was too empty.

285
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,510
So I created many flowers

286
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,000
to give you a surprise.

287
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,360
Later,

288
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,360
Sang Qi dragged me into an illusion,

289
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,840
and I learned my days were numbered.

290
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,790
I was even forced to try and kill you.

291
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
In my anger,

292
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,910
I made all the flowers in this room

293
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,240
disappear.

294
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,440
But now we're all back.

295
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,750
I thought

296
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,360
you should see them at least once.

297
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,000
I remember that day...

298
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,030
I brought you so many pastries,

299
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,000
only to find you were already gone.

300
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,080
I always thought

301
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,390
you were mad at me for coming back too late.

302
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,720
I never realized

303
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,200
you endured so much back then.

304
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,240
It won't happen again.

305
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,360
Actually, I'm not saying this

306
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,150
to make you feel sorry for me.

307
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,910
I just want to tell you

308
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,680
that as long as I'm here,

309
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,240
I won't let your days

310
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,750
be so lonely again.

311
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,030
But you'd better be prepared,

312
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,680
because this room might

313
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,550
start filling up

314
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,000
with all sorts of unexpected things.

315
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,640
From now on, everything in this room

316
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,480
is up to you to manage.

317
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,350
Oh?

318
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,550
Well then...

319
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,200
what about you in this room?

320
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,240
I'm yours as well.

321
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,240
You're surprisingly agreeable now.

322
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,960
Back then,

323
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,350
if I touched you,

324
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,030
you'd shout and threaten to kill me.

325
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,920
You even said,

326
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,440
"Those close to demons grow bad."

327
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,590
It's different now.

328
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,480
Now it's...

329
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,480
"Those close to the Pearl grow bright."

330
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,960
So, does this Pearl of mine

331
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,270
still need to keep learning from Elder Cang?

332
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,680
If you're really worried,

333
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,240
I can teach you myself.

334
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,750
No, thanks.

335
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,400
You see, I'm the kind of person

336
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,830
who likes doing what I'm not supposed to.

337
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,750
The more that old man dislikes me,

338
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,640
the more I want him to like me.

339
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:17,960
True enough.

340
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,440
You've always had a knack

341
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,510
for insisting on your way.

342
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,960
That brings more fun.

343
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,590
Twisted logic.

344
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,350
You don't believe me?

345
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,030
Tonight,

346
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,510
let me test it on you

347
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,070
and see if it brings more fun.

348
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,200
I'm very busy tonight.

349
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,200
Busy with what?

350
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,440
Official duties.

351
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,070
So you're spending

352
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,790
such a wonderful evening on official duties?

353
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,110
Perhaps,

354
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,510
you should head back to sleep now.

355
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,400
Or you can...

356
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,550
sleep here.

357
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,000
Great!

358
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,160
Then I'll wait here for you to return.

359
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,310
Xie Xuechen,

360
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,960
your bed is too big.

361
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Sleeping alone

362
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,510
makes me feel so scared.

363
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,640
Xie Xuechen,

364
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,070
I never thought

365
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,550
I'd be doing something this boring

366
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,880
with someone one day.

367
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,030
Boring?

368
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,350
Then why are you so happy?

369
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,310
Yeah, why?

370
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,200
I don't know either.

371
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,590
Doing something so boring

372
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,200
and yet feeling so happy.

373
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,440
What exactly is love?

374
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,830
Love...

375
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,880
is it desire,

376
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,350
or is it motivation?

377
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,350
As long as the sun rises and sets

378
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,270
and the universe endures,

379
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,830
we'll always be together.

380
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,790
It's been years since I've seen you angry, Sir.

381
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,160
I dreamed of her again.

382
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,590
I could see her clearly,

383
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,440
but I couldn't tell where it was.

384
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,790
You've been searching

385
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,270
for that place from your dreams for many years now.

386
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,240
Will you keep looking?

387
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,590
The feeling of losing control

388
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,400
is truly unpleasant.

389
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,550
Feng Yao,

390
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,030
stay here and keep watching.

391
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,310
Don't let anyone know I've left.

392
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,880
Understood.

393
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,680
Tonight, I don't want to kill.

394
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,750
If you don't want to die,

395
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,920
retreat.

396
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Mr. Nan.

397
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,590
Judging by your tone,

398
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,400
it seems you're not in a good mood today.

399
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,070
As it happens,

400
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,240
I've just received some fresh tea.

401
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,750
Mr. Nan,

402
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,310
would you like to try some with me?

403
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,750
The message you sent through my people

404
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,350
has already reached me.

405
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,880
Rest assured.

406
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,640
I won't touch Mu Xuanling.

407
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,350
That's not

408
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,030
why I'm here this time.

409
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,400
Now I'm curious.

410
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,110
Aside from Mu Xuanling and Xie Xuechen,

411
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,880
what else in this world

412
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,070
could matter so much to you?

413
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,830
You've been drinking tea

414
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,960
from the mortal world for so many years.

415
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Aren't you tired of it?

416
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,310
The mortal world...

417
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,640
Mr. Nan, the way you phrased that

418
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,030
seems rather meaningful.

419
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,400
I know what you want.

420
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
I can help you.

421
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,110
For example,

422
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,310
opening the Celestial Ladder.

423
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,110
You have your warriors,

424
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,400
and I have my spies.

425
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,510
Over the years, aside from the Chaos Pearl,

426
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,290
you've also been searching for the site

427
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,590
where the Celestial Ladder fell ten thousand years ago,

428
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,480
and the method to restore the divine artifact.

429
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,750
Isn't it to reopen the Celestial Ladder

430
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,200
using the Chaos Pearl?

431
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,110
Having known you for so many years,

432
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,750
there are some things

433
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,480
I've kept unsaid,

434
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,830
but that doesn't mean I don't know.

435
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,510
Though you have lost three of your spiritual channels,

436
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,510
you are clearer than anyone else

437
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,720
in this world.

438
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,110
I don't doubt

439
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,270
your capabilities.

440
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,270
But since we're talking about cooperation,

441
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,720
I have to know

442
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,880
what is it that you want.

443
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,160
A place I've searched all through the Dark Abyss

444
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,400
and the human realm

445
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,720
but never found.

446
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,640
I was thinking...

447
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,310
maybe it's in the Celestial Realm.

448
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,530
Dragging us out here in the middle of the night...

449
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,350
what's this about?

450
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,270
Haven't you noticed

451
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,880
that ever since Sang Qi began cultivating the Jade Vault Technique,

452
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,000
the Dark Abyss's demonic energy has surged,

453
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,000
even this Lava

454
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,030
isn't what it used to be?

455
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Are you implying

456
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,030
the one below?

457
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,790
Could it be

458
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,440
that the Fallen Deity is waking up?

459
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,790
What if...

460
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,440
he's already awake?

461
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,240
Xie Xuechen.

462
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,110
Xie Xuechen.

463
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,640
Xie Xuechen.

464
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,790
Xie Xuechen.

465
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,200
Xie Xuechen!

466
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,200
Xie Xuechen!

467
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,480
Xie Xuechen.

468
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,030
We'll be meeting very soon.

469
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,510
Sir.

470
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,590
Did your discussion go well?

471
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,000
If the plan succeeds,

472
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,270
it will go well.

473
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,920
And what if it fails?

474
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,440
Then we'll stand against the entire world.

475
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,640
Mr. Yan.

476
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,070
I'm here to inform Mr. Nan...

477
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,590
Mr. Xie is in trouble!

478
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,160
It's not an injury,

479
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,310
nor an illness.

480
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,590
From his pulse,

481
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
there's nothing wrong at all.

482
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,880
Having nothing wrong

483
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,640
is the biggest problem of all.

484
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,510
Xie Xuechen,

485
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,480
you're awake.

486
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,680
What happened to me?

487
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,350
You were unconscious for two hours.

488
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,790
Two hours?

489
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,350
Just now...

490
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
just now, I think I heard

491
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,070
someone calling my name.

492
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,030
Who was it?

493
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,680
I don't know.

494
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,240
This condition...

495
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,720
sounds more like a soul intrusion.

496
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,270
Soul intrusion?

497
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,110
Do you remember

498
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,110
I was once possessed by the Dark Clan?

499
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,720
You're saying...

500
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,070
a Dark Clan member connected with you just now?

501
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,920
I'm not sure.

502
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,750
But for some reason,

503
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,960
that voice felt...

504
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,550
felt strangely familiar.

505
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,790
Familiar?

506
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,920
Xuechen,

507
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,750
don't jump to conclusions

508
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,350
based on a single calling.

509
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,440
The birth and death of the Dark Clan

510
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,200
cycle through the Void Sea.

511
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,480
Perhaps the answer

512
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,790
lies in the Dark Abyss.

513
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,480
Could it be...

514
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,400
Mister...

515
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,240
he's back?

516
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,240
Sir,

517
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,320
Spirit Clan warriors

518
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,640
have already gathered outside the sects.

519
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,920
Once the Immortals Array is broken,

520
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,440
they can ally with the Dark Clan

521
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,160
to destroy the Immortal Alliance in one strike.

522
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,310
Leave the rest

523
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,000
to me.

524
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,000
Go do your righteous deeds.

525
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,350
The path you need

526
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,270
is already paved for you.

527
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,720
Thank you, sir.

528
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,720
Are you still thinking about last night?

529
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,350
Or...

530
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,240
are you thinking about Mister?

531
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,640
You're the one thinking about Mister, aren't you?

532
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:55,790
I thought about him,

533
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,070
but I only thought of one thing:

534
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,070
You are you,

535
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,350
and Mister is Mister.

536
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,880
Right now,

537
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,880
the only person in my heart and mind

538
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,510
is you.

539
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,400
Sir,

540
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,640
we've received a tip.

541
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You previously instructed me

542
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,680
to have disciples secretly monitor the various sects

543
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,070
in case the Decaying Immortal Pavilion made a move.

544
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,510
We've discovered

545
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,030
that He Xianwo, Lord of the Osprey Island,

546
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
is never on the island.

547
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,830
In such troubled times,

548
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,480
where could he be?

549
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,460
- Xuechen! - Xie Xuechen!

550
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,000
Xuechen!

551
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,000
- Xie Xuechen! - Senior!

552
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,110
Xuechen!

553
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,000
Xie Xuechen!

554
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,160
Xie Xuechen!

555
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:48,920
Xuechen!

556
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,720
Xie Xuechen!

557
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,550
Are you okay?

558
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,480
Why...

559
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,640
why are you staring at me like that?

560
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,550
Xuanling...

561
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,790
Xuanling...

562
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,110
Xuanling...

563
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,240
I won't let you

564
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,110
face any more danger.

565
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,720
I can't bear to lose you again.

566
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,200
Xie Xuechen,

567
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,960
what's wrong with you?

568
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,070
What exactly is going on?

569
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,560
He Xianwo is the Master of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion.

570
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,140
He's heading to the Dark Abyss to break the Immortals Array.

571
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,720
What?

572
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,110
How do you know?

573
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,550
There's no time to explain.

574
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,880
I need to teleport myself there immediately.

575
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,590
Where is Nan Xuyue?

576
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,440
Should I call you Lord He of the Osprey Island

577
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,960
or the Master of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion?

578
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,240
If I recall correctly,

579
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,550
you've only seen my face once.

580
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,510
What gave me away?

581
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,240
Or...

582
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,640
Who told you?

583
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,720
- Let me go! - Senior said

584
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,790
to wait for him to return!

585
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,680
He's there now.

586
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,400
He's alone on that side.

587
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,830
What if he faces danger?

588
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,270
Xuechen is strong-willed.

589
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,510
If you don't go,

590
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
he'll have one less worry

591
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,400
and face one less danger.

592
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,640
So how exactly

593
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,440
did Xie Xuechen figure out

594
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,400
that He Xianwo is the Master of the Decaying Immortal Pavilion?

595
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,350
And how did he know

596
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,270
that He Xianwo was heading to the Dark Abyss?

597
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,350
Your aura is calm and steady,

598
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,480
far from that of a youth.

599
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,310
Though there are many cultivators in the world,

600
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,790
aside from disguise techniques,

601
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,310
only you can use shapeshifting and skin-changing.

602
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,830
Who exactly are you?

603
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,720
You didn't answer my questions,

604
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,920
yet you want to learn from me?

605
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,070
No matter.

606
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,510
Whether you answer or not,

607
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,110
I'm killing you today.

608
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,070
Perfect.

609
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,070
That suits me just fine.

610
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,110
In such a short time,

611
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,000
your strength has surged.

612
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,680
Quite impressive!

613
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,070
What's going on?

614
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,480
Xie Xuechen was strong,

615
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,510
but not this strong.

616
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,200
Why does he now carry

617
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,270
such a desperate, all-or-nothing aura?

618
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,110
Just give me a little more time...

619
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,510
just a little more.

620
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,880
Why now of all times,

621
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,880
when things could have been changed?

622
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,110
You know him well.

623
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,630
Don't you think he's been acting strange just now?

624
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,880
Why do you say that?

625
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,030
Well...

626
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,760
did he ever behave like that before?

627
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,630
Suddenly, he seems like a completely different person,

628
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,840
doing strange things,

629
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,630
and saying puzzling words.

630
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,360
Senior occasionally shows his true feelings.

631
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,190
There's nothing strange about that.

632
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,030
Really?

633
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,320
My intuition is usually accurate.

634
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,440
What exactly feels off?

635
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,920
Xie Xuechen was acting strange today.

636
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,550
He doesn't have future-seeing abilities,

637
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,630
so logically,

638
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,150
he shouldn't have known He Xianwo's whereabouts.

639
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,880
Perhaps...

640
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,150
it's related to the incident last night.

641
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,230
But,

642
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,960
aren't you worried He Xianwo

643
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,000
will tell Xie Xuechen about you?

644
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,550
If he finds out, so be it.

645
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,400
It's only a matter of time.

646
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,800
Pretending for too long

647
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,590
gets exhausted anyway.

648
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,630
Revealing everything

649
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,760
might be refreshing.

650
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,360
You told me to wait for you to reunite.

651
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,550
But that day,

652
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,440
I never saw you come back.

653
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,400
This time,

654
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,670
it's your turn to wait for me.

655
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,360
That's really not like you.

656
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,630
Ningxi,

657
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,960
I'll come

658
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,150
to find you very soon.

659
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,110
This time,

660
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,030
we'll never be apart.

661
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,840
Do you truly no longer want revenge?

662
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,630
I never thought the mighty ruler of the Dark Abyss

663
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,400
would now waste away,

664
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,440
guarding a corpse like a lost soul.

665
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,840
No matter how much you talk to her now,

666
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,800
she can't hear you.

667
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,070
Ningxi,

668
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,550
an uninvited guest has arrived.

669
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:42,760
But don't worry.

670
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,000
I'll get rid of him soon.

671
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,160
You're disturbing Ningxi.

672
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,030
Leave now,

673
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,840
or I'll personally

674
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,280
send you on your way.

675
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,510
Su Ningxi is dead.

676
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,630
Completely and utterly dead.

677
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,030
No matter

678
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,510
how much you deceive yourself now,

679
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,320
she's not coming back to life.

680
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,400
You

681
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,320
are quite rude.

682
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,800
Your anger at what I said

683
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,630
proves you know

684
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,760
I'm right.

685
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,800
So the one you should hate isn't me,

686
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,710
but the people who killed her.

687
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,000
Those people are already dead.

688
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,110
Not all of them.

689
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,840
You were bullied by the humans from a young age.

690
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,110
You should've hated them long ago,

691
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,840
yet back then, for her,

692
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,880
you gave up your revenge against them.

693
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,360
And in the end,

694
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,760
the humans killed her.

695
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,150
It was your decision to give up revenge

696
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,110
that led to today's tragedy.

697
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,800
Can you really accept that?

698
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,480
Ningxi wouldn't want me

699
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,440
to be consumed by hatred.

700
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,320
And what's the result

701
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,190
of letting go of that hatred?

702
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,190
You lost the one you loved most,

703
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,400
and now you're neither human

704
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,440
nor ghost,

705
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,230
just lost in misery here.

706
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,770
Meanwhile, the Immortal Alliance and humanity

707
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,760
don't reflect

708
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,030
on their mistakes.

709
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,000
Instead, they mock your failure

710
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,880
from their victors' throne.

711
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,550
What a tragic irony.

712
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,150
I think

713
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,400
if Su Ningxi could see this,

714
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,630
she'd feel it wasn't worth it for you either.

715
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,800
Look at yourself now...

716
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,920
do you think

717
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,960
she'd still love you?

718
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,190
Did you come here

719
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,760
just to spout this nonsense?

720
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,000
I came here

721
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,230
because I feel it's unfair for you.

722
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,030
Those you forgave

723
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,710
never chose to forgive you.

724
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,280
You lost the one you cherished,

725
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,320
so why should they

726
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,800
get to keep on living?

727
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,360
What do you want?

728
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,110
I'll break the Immortals Array for you,

729
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,710
and the humans will face

730
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,070
the punishment they deserve.

731
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,280
But in exchange,

732
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,630
I want you to tell me

733
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,920
the whereabouts of the Chaos Pearl.

734
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,630
We can't wait any longer.

735
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,440
If the Immortals Array is broken,

736
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,630
the human world will suffer great disasters.

737
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,360
I must inform the Immortal Alliance sects

738
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,670
so they can prepare in advance.

739
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,000
Mr. Nan.

740
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,590
I have urgent matters to attend to with Yan Tong.

741
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,280
Please watch over Mu Xuanling.

742
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,230
Make sure she won't act rashly.

743
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:01,800
I leave it to you.

744
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,150
I think you know me well.

745
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,070
I will definitely act rashly.

746
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,710
Xie Xuechen is at the Two Realms Mountain.

747
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,550
I can't leave him there alone.

748
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,880
You must go?

749
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,000
I have to go.

750
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,710
Just because he's there?

751
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,510
Just because he's there.

752
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,440
All right.

753
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,840
Follow my gestures.

754
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,760
I'll teleport you there.

755
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,070
Nan Xuyue...

756
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,590
Thank you.
