1
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,800
I think you just wanted
to bring me out on a date.

2
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,270
This room’s filled with memories of you.

3
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,150
Just tell me what to do
‘cause I like you so much.

4
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,490
Yeah, P’ Pai and I are going out.

5
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,830
What do you think?

6
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,440
Mine's way better.

7
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,039
Sky, how was it?

8
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,600
My project’s approved.
Teacher said I could go ahead with it.

9
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,450
- Damn, for real?
- Hell yeah.

10
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,260
You’re so lucky.
Do you know what I went through?

11
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,490
- What?
- The teacher asked me…

12
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,070
‘Why did you decide to study architecture?’

13
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,630
I’m a straightforward guy,
so I answered honestly.

14
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,250
‘My mom told me to, so I did.’

15
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,170
The teacher was fucking livid.
He pointed at me and yelled.

16
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,540
‘Then why don’t you let
your mother study instead?’

17
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,730
So I took my phone out and
called my mom to ask her.

18
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,670
- To scold the teacher?
- To study in my place.

19
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,710
The teacher blew up.
He yelled and told me to get out.

20
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,970
- He doesn’t like you.
- He doesn’t like me.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,020
It’s not surprising.

22
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,720
There’s a race tonight.
I’ll meet you late. Wanna eat anything?

23
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,270
I’ll buy dinner myself. Don’t worry.
Good luck.

24
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,410
Will there be a prize for me if I win?

25
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,240
If you’re not worn out, I’m up for it.

26
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,790
Hold up, I’m gonna
screenshot and print it out.

27
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,190
You’re so in love.

28
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,470
A single guy like me can
only be stuck with assignments.

29
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,600
Gonna find myself a girlfriend.
Be right back.

30
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,200
Don’t tease me, Sig.

31
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,900
Do you have a boyfriend?

32
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,760
Sig.

33
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,610
P’ Pai’s really something.

34
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,300
Ever since he went out with you...

35
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,650
His IG’s been swarming with
your pics and sky images.

36
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,160
P’ Saifha said he’s
turned into a sky gazer.

37
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,660
Do you know there’s a race tonight?

38
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,250
I wanna go but I
haven’t finished my work.

39
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,470
Man, when will this semester be over?

40
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,540
In just a few weeks.

41
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,959
What I mean is, you’ve only got a few
weeks left to finish the final project.

42
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,510
That's true.

43
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,240
Gosh, how am I gonna finish it in time?

44
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,070
What do I do?

45
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,960
Right!
Come with me to the next race.

46
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:40,990
You didn’t get inside last time.
P’ Pai is super cool when he’s in the race.

47
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,600
Don’t you wanna see?

48
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,940
- I’m telling the truth.
- I already know that.

49
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,420
Jeez.

50
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,230
You’re so love stoned.
I guess love makes everything beautiful.

51
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,470
So how are things between you guys?
Give me an update.

52
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,070
The Wind Will Always Embrace the Sky

53
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,120
Dad! Dad!

54
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,700
What’s the matter, you rascal?
That was quite a loud shout.

55
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,390
Are you really gonna let
me go to school in Bangkok?

56
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,430
Are you?

57
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,260
- Do you wanna go?
- Absolutely!

58
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,140
- You must study hard when you get there.
- Yes, Dad.

59
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,740
Wanna try?

60
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,570
- Is it good?
- Yeah, give it a try.

61
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,960
Go ahead.
You’ve got nothing to lose.

62
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,840
Use this.

63
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,730
- How do I light it?
- Like this.

64
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,990
Put it in your mouth first
then light it up.

65
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,650
- Put it in my mouth first?
- Yeah.

66
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,120
Light it up.
Just like that.

67
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,190
Inhale.
Inhale.

68
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,890
- Smoking helps relieve stress.
- Really?

69
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,250
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

70
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,260
Familiar taste.

71
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,680
- How are you?
- Huh?

72
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,930
- How are you today?
- My mom kicked me out of the house.

73
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,560
- Again?
- Yeah.

74
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,820
- Cheers.
- Okay.

75
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,180
I ran away from home.
My mom kicked me out.

76
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,770
You’re a naughty boy.

77
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,150
I'm a good boy.

78
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,040
P’ Gun, I love you.

79
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,700
I snuck out again.
Let’s go all out today.

80
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,799
It’s bitter.
Why didn’t you add more soda?

81
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,280
Oh hey! Sky’s here.
Let’s give him a big hand.

82
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,370
- Treat me, okay?
- Sure, it’s on me.

83
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,280
- Cheers.
- Okay, cheers.

84
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,230
Cheers!

85
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,000
- Sky.
- Huh?

86
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,200
What happened to you?
You look like you were run down by a truck.

87
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,590
Nonsense, I’m fine.
You’re just seeing things.

88
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,620
Don’t tell me P’ Gun…

89
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,830
I told you he’s a fucking piece of shit!

90
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,870
I fell down the stairs.
It’s got nothing to do with him.

91
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,580
Fell down the stairs?

92
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,330
Then what about these marks?
Aren’t they cigarette burns?

93
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,430
It’s none of your business.

94
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,210
Forget it.
I did this to myself.

95
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,950
Ouch!

96
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:46,090
P’ Gun, can we not do this anymore?
It hurts.

97
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,150
Can we have normal sex, please?

98
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,510
This is normal for me.

99
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,320
Didn’t you say you loved me?

100
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,470
I thought you said...

101
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,090
'I love you, P' Gun.'

102
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,070
Can't you...

103
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,740
Endure this much for me?

104
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,210
P’ Gun, what’s going on?
Why are your friends here?

105
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,380
P’ Gun. P’ Gun.

106
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,950
It’s a surprise for you.

107
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,140
You like it?

108
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,260
P’ Gun, don’t do this to me.

109
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,450
P’ Gun, help me.
It hurts.

110
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,570
Please let me go.
I’m begging you.

111
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,690
Please let me go.
Please.

112
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,190
Please.
Please let me go.

113
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,480
No. No!

114
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,660
Help!

115
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,940
P’ Gun.
You love me, right?

116
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,470
Right?

117
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,570
Help me, P’ Gun.

118
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,850
Help me.

119
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,690
You’re annoying.

120
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,680
Boring.

121
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,720
I’m bored.

122
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Help...

123
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,640
Why did I dream about that time again?

124
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,310
When will I forget this fucking nightmare?

125
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,320
What’s up?
You miss me?

126
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,020
Hello?

127
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,020
Answer me, baby.

128
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,280
Sky, are you alright?

129
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,370
Sky, answer me.

130
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,420
P’ Pai, I had a nightmare.

131
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,670
You okay now?

132
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,040
You asked me if I missed you.

133
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,130
What if I tell you that I do?

134
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,510
What?
Say it again.

135
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,130
I really miss you, P’ Pai.

136
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,230
Can you hurry up and come to me?

137
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,070
I’m coming right away.

138
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,690
Please hurry up.

139
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,140
Okay.

140
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,940
Payu, I’m done for the day.
I’m leaving first.

141
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,740
But you only raced two rounds so far.

142
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,010
Sky called.
He didn’t sound good.

143
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,540
- I wanna go check on him.
- Okay, just go.

144
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,310
- Drive safely.
- Later.

145
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,460
- You’re awesome today, P’ Pai.
- I know.

146
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,360
What’s up, Gun?
Long time no see.

147
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,640
Hello.
Your boyfriend’s cute.

148
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,760
We saw from your IG.
You just couldn’t stop showing him off.

149
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,830
He’s not just cute but very cute.

150
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,090
You’d better stay away
from him if you meet him.

151
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,760
I’m jealous.

152
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,950
Alright, see you later.

153
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,930
- Bring him with you next time.
- Okay.

154
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,120
Sky, where are you?

155
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,100
I’m here, honey.
I’m here.

156
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,270
Have you eaten?
Wanna eat anything?

157
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,520
You wanna cuddle me?

158
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,660
- P’ Pai.
- Yes?

159
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,880
Will you hold me?

160
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,460
Bad dream?

161
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,440
Are you okay?

162
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,990
P’ Pai, can you do something for me?

163
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,130
What is it?

164
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,660
Don’t let go of my hand.

165
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,480
Okay, I won’t let you go.

166
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,920
I can do it.

167
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,410
Let me do it.
I’m the one who drained you out.

168
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,950
You know what?
I’d never wiped anyone’s body before.

169
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,170
My siblings always said that
I was an uncaring sweet talker.

170
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,920
But I don’t think I’m uncaring.

171
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,430
It’s just that I hadn’t
found the one for me.

172
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,180
Do you need help with your project?

173
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,810
I don’t think I can sleep tonight.
‘Cause my heart’s full of joy.

174
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,690
No.

175
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,610
I don’t need your help tonight.

176
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,250
I just...

177
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,110
Wanna hug you to sleep.

178
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,360
C’mere.

179
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:14,560
No one could beat me at all tonight.
I won almost 700k.

180
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,160
It’s all thanks to you.

181
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,760
‘Cause when I think about you,
I become invincible.

182
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,680
I’ve got an idea.
I’ll give you all the money.

183
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,220
I don’t want money.

184
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,600
Then let’s go on a trip on
your summer break.

185
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,960
I’ve heard Payu's gonna
take Rain out on a trip.

186
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,170
We should do that too.

187
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,610
I don’t wanna go anywhere.

188
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,680
Then what do you want?

189
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,790
You.

190
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,420
Only you.

191
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,930
I just wanna be with you.

192
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,360
My honey’s awfully adorable.
Will I die from a heart attack?

193
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,470
P’ Pai.

194
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,390
Strong summer monsoon
causes sharp temperature drop...

195
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,910
As the east wind sweeps through Thailand.
Please beware of weather changes.

196
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,850
P’ Payu and P’ Pai are gonna
be surprised to see you with me.

197
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,140
I’m the one who should be surprised.

198
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,120
You were still running away
from the securities last time.

199
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,760
But now, everyone knows you.

200
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,980
That was ages ago.

201
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,020
It was only half a year ago.

202
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,730
Hey, P’ Payu’s over there!

203
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,830
Sky.

204
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,230
It’s me.

205
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,020
Why didn’t you tell me you’d come?
I could've picked you up.

206
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,270
I’ve missed you so damn much.

207
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,890
I wanted to surprise you.

208
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:28,050
Honey, I almost went crazy when
you told me not to go to your room.

209
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,780
P’ Pai, we’re in public!

210
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,950
I don’t give a damn.
My lucky star’s right here.

211
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,470
- Are you tired?
- No.

212
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,000
Can I kiss you?

213
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,310
I’ll punch you if you kiss me here.

214
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,940
What about on the cheek?

215
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,900
Did the helmet hit your cheek?

216
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,130
Pai, get ready.
It’s your turn next.

217
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,370
Take care of him.

218
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,960
- He’s very precious to me.
- Alright, I got it.

219
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,690
Will you just go?
You’re wasting time.

220
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,630
Fine!

221
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,970
Don't just focus on your
boyfriend but ignore mine.

222
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,440
As for you, don’t talk to anyone.

223
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,100
If anyone asks,
tell them you’re my boyfriend.

224
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,630
So can I talk to other people or not?

225
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,660
Just tell them you’re my boyfriend
and don’t say anything else.

226
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,130
You’re still not leaving.

227
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,270
You should go.

228
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,490
He’s pretty possessive of you.

229
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,040
Rain, give me your car key.
I must’ve left my phone in your car.

230
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,910
I wanna film P’ Pai during the race.

231
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,320
You sure you can go alone?

232
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,500
- P’ Pai said…
- I’m not a three-year-old.

233
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,910
I'll be back in a jiff.

234
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,140
Hi.

235
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,990
Sky.

236
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,060
It’s been a while.

237
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,820
You look better than I thought.

238
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,020
P’ Pai, you’re so cool!

239
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,970
Yeah, thanks.

240
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,120
I’ve got a favor to ask.

241
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,020
See that chick over there?
I want her.

242
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,600
What’s that got to do with me?

243
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:45,250
Well, she says if I can take her
to your room, she’ll let me do her.

244
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,650
Come on, let me use your room.
The one where you brought your hookups to.

245
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,260
Those girls brag about
how they got into your room.

246
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,820
If I’m really gonna get that chick,
I must use your room.

247
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,680
Please let me use your room.
I’ll let people clean it up in the morning.

248
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,370
Aren’t we buddies?

249
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,280
It’s hot.
Get your hand off me.

250
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,010
Come on, it’s just one night.

251
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,440
I’ll return the key at your
house in the morning.

252
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,320
Pai, the bike’s ready.
Prepare for next round.

253
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,910
Please, I’m begging you.
I’ll be very grateful.

254
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,990
Fine, go get the key from Saifha.
I’ve left it with him.

255
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,270
If you do illegal stuff in
my room, I’m gonna kill you.

256
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,210
Roger that.

257
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,470
You sure it’s a good idea?

258
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,910
I don’t like him either.

259
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,050
I can see through him.

260
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,200
But I need to know exactly
why he tries to get close to me.

261
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,830
If he blows clouds in my room,
I’ll be the one to throw him in jail.

262
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,590
But I’m gonna let him go for now,
as long as he doesn’t stab me in the back.

263
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,820
Don’t let your guard down.

264
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,810
They’ve suddenly come more often.
They neither race nor place a bet.

265
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,430
It’s like they specifically target you.

266
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,430
Yeah, I know.
Just let it go for now.

267
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,340
Today I’ve got to show
my honey how cool I am.

268
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,360
What a coincidence.

269
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,020
Yeah.

270
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,980
I thought...

271
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,650
You were already broken.

272
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,290
Look at you.

273
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,550
P’ Pai fixed you until you’re good as new.

274
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,010
My condition’s got nothing to do with you.
If you’ll excuse me.

275
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,920
Where are you going?

276
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,200
You’ve gotten bolder after
becoming Prapai’s boy.

277
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,840
You really think he’s serious about you?

278
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,410
Don’t be naïve.

279
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,950
P’ Pai’s not a fucking scum like you!

280
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,640
Stay away from me.

281
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,930
Sky.

282
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,040
What did I teach you?

283
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,260
Earnestness is boring.

284
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:46,480
And who’d be serious
about someone like you?

285
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,710
Sky.

286
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,280
P’ Pai’s not that kind of man.

287
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,710
He takes good care of you.
He’ll never hurt you.

288
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,470
He’ll never hurt you.
He takes good care of you.

289
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,940
He takes good care of you.
He takes good care…

290
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,920
What’s wrong?
You’re very pale.

291
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,120
It’s nothing.

292
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,510
I think I’m gonna leave first.
I’m not feeling good.

293
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,490
Hey! Wait.

294
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,740
Wanna go to the hospital?
I’ll come with you.

295
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,920
It’s okay, I’m really fine.

296
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,720
Hey, I think you really
need to go to the hospital.

297
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,800
I’ll take you there.
Let the doctor examine you.

298
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,930
Let me tell P’ Payu first.
Wait here.

299
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,950
Don’t go anywhere.

300
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,560
You need to tell P’ Pai.

301
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,490
Tell him everything and you
won’t have to live in fear anymore.

302
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,030
A guard says P’ Pai wants
you to wait for him at his condo.

303
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,500
I’ll drive you to the condo then.

304
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,300
- Do you have the key card?
- Yes.

305
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,370
Come on, let’s go.

306
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,340
Are you sure you can be alone?

307
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
Yeah.

308
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,990
You should go back to P’ Payu.
Thanks for the ride.

309
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,890
Yeah. Rest up.
You look like you’re sick.

310
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,490
Drive safely.

311
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,050
It’s okay.

312
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,470
You’re gonna tell P’ Pai tonight.

313
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,160
Tell him everything.

314
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,410
He’ll definitely understand you.

315
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,610
We’ve met sooner than expected.

316
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,360
Let’s have fun again tonight.

317
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,270
- Where are you going?
- Let me go!

318
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,080
Let go! Let go!
Let me go!

319
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,200
Stop struggling.

320
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,580
Let me go!

321
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,870
When have you become so feisty?

322
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:15,520
You’re as heartless as ever.
Thought you’d be gentler to your ex.

323
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,030
My ex?

324
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,890
The fuck he is.

325
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,740
He's just a toy.

326
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,670
A toy that I threw away.

327
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,890
He’s fucking feisty.

328
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:47,080
I wouldn’t have helped you if I hadn’t
wanted to know what P’ Pai saw in him.

329
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,560
By the way...

330
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,480
I’m very curious why
P’ Pai readily gave him to you.

331
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,720
What?
You're shocked, Sky?

332
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,340
I gave you such a valuable lesson.

333
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:17,070
But it looks like you’ve forgotten it.

334
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:25,190
Your dear darling P’ Pai...

335
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,140
Gave you to us.

336
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,250
I don’t believe you.

337
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:51,480
And how do you think we entered this room?

338
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,710
It was your dear darling P’ Pai…

339
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,650
Who gave us the key card.

340
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,760
That’s a lie!
You’re fucking lying!

341
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,370
P’ Pai will never do something like that!

342
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,610
You don’t have to believe me.

343
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:23,770
After all these years,
you haven’t learned anything at all.

344
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,060
So I’m gonna enlighten you.

345
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,949
Sky, I only told him I was your ex.

346
00:34:52,719 --> 00:35:04,050
And showed him photos of your
happy times with me and them.

347
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,550
Do you know...

348
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,990
What he said?

349
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,580
Hmm?

350
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,970
Sky, Sky, Sky, Sky.

351
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,690
He said…

352
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,410
‘Take back your filthy shit!’

353
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,840
- Payu, where’s Sky?
- Rain took him away.

354
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,130
And where did Rain take him?

355
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,480
Rain said Sky wasn’t feeling well,
so he drove him back.

356
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,450
They just finished the exam
today, so he must be exhausted.

357
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,310
It’s a shame he couldn’t see me being cool.

358
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,980
Never mind, I’m gonna check on my honey.
He must’ve missed me.

359
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,820
P’ Pai, are you leaving?

360
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,340
Please take care of Sky.
He’s not feeling well.

361
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,660
You can count on this nurse.

362
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,280
- Nurse him only.
- Okay.

363
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,940
Wait a minute.

364
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,200
If Rain took Sky back to his dorm,
then why did he return so soon?

365
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,920
Rain, where did you drop Sky off?

366
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,720
How forgetful of you, P’ Pai.

367
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,140
Didn’t you tell me to take
him back to the condo?

368
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,250
Me?

369
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,890
I was racing this whole time.
How could I possibly tell you?

370
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,490
What? But...

371
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,690
During the race, a guard said you
wanted Sky to go back to the condo.

372
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,250
Fuck!

373
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,150
I’m coming with you.

374
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,610
Cheers.

375
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,890
Open up!

376
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,420
The party hasn’t started.
What’s the rush?

377
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,540
P’ Pai!
Wait! You let me use the room.

378
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,510
- P’ Pai.
- Out of my way!

379
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:57,200
P’ Pai, it’s not what it looks like.
Your boyfriend started it.

380
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,530
You can see what’s going on here.

381
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,820
We’re not forcing him at all.

382
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,510
That’s right.
We’re telling you the truth.

383
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,610
We brought that chick here
and met your boyfriend.

384
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,320
And you know that
he used to date Gun before.

385
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,130
He suddenly flipped out,
scaring the girl away.

386
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,770
He dragged Gun to the bedroom.

387
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,930
- And the rest is what you see.
- You’re lying.

388
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,980
Sky’s not that kind of person.

389
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,940
Move.

390
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:35,250
Sky, get up and talk to me.

391
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,870
Sky.

392
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,330
Get up.

393
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,140
Answer me!

394
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,330
P’ Pai...

395
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,980
Can’t I be only yours?

396
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,300
Please don’t give me to anyone else.
I'll do anything.

397
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,430
Can’t I only be with you?

398
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,650
Of course.

399
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,780
You can.

400
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,060
It’s okay, baby.

401
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,940
You don’t need to be with someone else.

402
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:06,050
- Rain, take care of him.
- Okay.

403
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,230
Are you alright?

404
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,240
Are you okay?

405
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,850
Let's get out of here.

406
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,590
You hurt my boyfriend, huh?

407
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,900
No, I didn’t.
He seduced me.

408
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,300
No! P’ Pai! Stop!

409
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,650
Stay the fuck out of it!

410
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,450
That’s enough!
You’re gonna kill him!

411
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,510
Sky, are you alright?
Answer me.

412
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,410
Sky! Hey!

413
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,900
Rain.

414
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,380
Sky. Baby.

415
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,480
Look at me, baby.

416
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,880
Just cry if you’re suffering.

417
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,380
I’m right here.

418
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,860
I’ll wipe away your tears.

419
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,520
Let it out.

420
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,080
Don’t hold back.

421
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,440
I’m here with you.

422
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,730
I told you to cry!

423
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,080
I’m begging you.

424
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,030
Let it out.

425
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,090
Let me take care of you.

426
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,870
Why are you crying, P’ Pai?

427
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,840
Because you don’t cry.

428
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,620
If you can’t cry...

429
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,420
I’ll cry for you.

430
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,000
If you suffer...

431
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,340
I’ll suffer with you.

432
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,810
If you’re in pain...

433
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,490
I’ll be in pain too.

434
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,850
Let me cry in your stead.

435
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,910
Nothing gets better even if I cry.

436
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,470
It does.

437
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,030
Trust me.

438
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,630
I’m right here.

439
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,590
I promise.

440
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,700
I won’t let you go through this again.

441
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,260
I won’t give you to anyone else.

442
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,250
I love you, Sky.

443
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,390
Don’t leave me, P’ Pai!

444
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,110
Don’t give me to anyone else.

445
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,130
Love... Love me.
Please love me, P’ Pai!

446
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,870
Of course.

447
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,690
I won’t give you to anyone.

448
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,210
I love you so much.

449
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,000
It’s alright, come this way.

450
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,650
You okay?

451
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,500
I’ll bring you some clothes.

452
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:36,890
Hmm?

453
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,670
Aren’t you gonna ask me what happened?

454
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,160
You can tell me when you’re ready.

455
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,150
Then today’s the day.

456
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:39,630
I’m scared if I don’t tell you today,
I won’t be able to bring it up again.

457
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,240
P’ Gun is my ex.

458
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,490
I first met him when I had
recently moved to Bangkok.

459
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,150
Everything was great at first.

460
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,740
But I don’t know why...

461
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,940
He suddenly started to abuse me.

462
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,590
Little by little.

463
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,260
I’d always thought that it was my fault.

464
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,230
Even when my friends told
me to break up with him...

465
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,280
I didn’t listen to them.

466
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,360
I always thought that he still loved me.

467
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,080
He tied me to the bed.

468
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,350
Stripped me naked.

469
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,190
And he let his friends...

470
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,780
Raped me.

471
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,880
They held my arms and head.
Treated me like I wasn’t a human

472
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,160
I begged P’ Gun to help me.

473
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,150
I pleaded.

474
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,750
I cried until my voice was hoarse.

475
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:15,640
But he didn’t help me.

476
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,950
Nobody pitied me at all.

477
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,840
What a fucking scum.

478
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,440
How could he do that to you?

479
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:35,090
I’m trash.

480
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,700
I’m damaged goods.

481
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,760
When I returned home,
I was like a broken doll.

482
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,880
I didn’t speak.

483
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,140
Didn’t listen.

484
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,740
I spaced out so much
that my dad got worried.

485
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:06,650
- P’ Pai.
- Hmm?

486
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,750
Can I really love you?

487
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,970
- Can I?
- Yes.

488
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,860
Why are you crying?

489
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:37,530
I’m sorry, I should’ve met you sooner.

490
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,770
I should’ve met you at that time.

491
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,800
I’d never hurt you.

492
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,100
Never make you cry.

493
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,910
Never let you go through that incident.

494
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,010
But we eventually met.

495
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,060
Sky.

496
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:19,490
The question isn’t whether you can love me.

497
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,200
But I want you to only love me.

498
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,670
I won’t let you love anyone else.

499
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:32,850
I won’t let you get hurt.

500
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:41,090
It won’t get hurt as long
as you’re by my side.

501
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,210
Stop crying.

502
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,370
Then you should stop too.

503
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:58,320
Who says I’m crying?
These are tears of joy.

504
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:04,390
I’m happy too that you’re now in my arms.

505
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,440
I won’t make a promise.

506
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:11,480
I won't make a vow.

507
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,890
But I’ll show you with my actions.

508
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:21,750
I’ll make you so happy
until everyone gets jealous.

509
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:26,770
I’m already happy.

510
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,620
If I become any happier...

511
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,270
I’ll get scared.

512
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:38,640
Then I’ll make you very happy
until you stop being scared.

513
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,570
I’ll always make you smile like this.

514
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:55,760
Me too.

515
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,450
It’s time for ‘Chitchat of the Day’ again.

516
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:26,290
I wonder what everyone’s doing on
this beautifully bright and clear-sky day.

517
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:31,520
If you’re lonely hearts with nothing
to do, you can share your answers on...

518
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,750
‘How to win a rocky heart.’

519
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:36,460
Let’s check out some
answers from our listeners.

520
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,370
P’ Pai.

521
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:15,360
Why did you get out of bed?
You could’ve slept longer.

522
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,220
Afraid I’d disappear?
Come here.

523
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:26,140
I won’t go anywhere.

524
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:37,430
Will your family look at me strangely?
You suddenly brought me home last night.

525
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:43,670
My mom’s most likely to be thrilled to
meet Sky who’s put Prapai in his place.

526
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,200
- P' Pai.
- Yes?

527
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,410
Thank you for getting me out.

528
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,280
Thank you for waking me up
from my nightmare.

529
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,790
It’s my duty as your lover.

530
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:13,540
Thank you too for telling me everything.

531
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,290
And I let P’ Chai deal with that bastard.

532
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:23,700
We won’t ever see him again.

533
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,450
What's the condition?

534
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,190
Competing in every race
according to P’ Pakin’s order.

535
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,950
But don’t worry, you know how skilled I am.

536
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:36,750
Right?

537
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,830
Right?

538
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:48,720
Sky.

539
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:52,230
The one who helped you
that time was your dad...

540
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,720
And your favorite actor’s interview, right?

541
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:01,440
Yeah, I came across my
favorite actor’s interview.

542
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,140
He'd left the business many years ago.

543
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:09,370
Before he accepted an acting role again.

544
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,730
He had relationship problems at that time.

545
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,020
Just like me.

546
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,610
But he got back on his feet again.

547
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:21,240
I still remember his words.

548
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:23,880
He said...

549
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:30,460
‘How sad will my loved ones be
if I don’t love myself?’

550
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:38,950
‘If one person can ruin my life,
how could I face my family?’

551
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,240
You know what?

552
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:51,110
When I saw my dad’s tears, I asked
myself who was actually important to me.

553
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,220
I wanted to become strong again.

554
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,260
I wanted my dad to be proud of me.

555
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,750
Instead of obsessing over someone
who didn’t care about me at all.

556
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,760
I might not be able to
help you at that time.

557
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,070
But from now on, I'll be by your side.

558
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,670
I will cherish you.

559
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:26,320
Take care of you.

560
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,200
Value you.

561
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,870
I love you, Sky.

562
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:43,070
And have I told you?

563
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:47,640
That I love you too.

564
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,480
The last answer is from Khun Prapai.

565
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:03,390
He says, ‘To win a stony heart,
you must use your own.’

566
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,710
Even though we met in an
unfavorable circumstance…

567
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:10,670
But from now on, I want him to know that…

568
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:15,400
The wind will always embrace the sky.

569
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,500
One Month Later

570
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:58,640
P’ Pai, Mother asked me
to bring you coffee.

571
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,060
So refreshing.

572
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,450
This is your family photo?

573
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,900
Yeah, you met all of them.

574
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,570
Oh, except my uncle.
This one.

575
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,310
P' Pai!

576
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,050
Frost Patheera is your uncle?

577
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,180
Hold on.

578
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:53,560
Yes, I listened to his interview
when I was feeling down.

579
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,440
I wanna meet him.
Can you take me to your uncle?

580
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,810
Please, I wanna meet him.
Please take me to him.

581
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,440
That’s enough, enough, enough, enough.
Stop looking.

582
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:06,360
- But I wanna…
- I’m jealous even if he’s my uncle.

583
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:10,850
Just look at this Black
Giant for the rest of your life.

584
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,680
- Jealous?
- Obviously.

585
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,440
I almost wrote the word on my forehead.

586
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,430
- You know what, P’ Pai?
- What? I know nothing at all.

587
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,590
I can look at Black Giant
for the rest of my life.

588
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:32,710
Because I love you, P’ Pai.

589
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,580
I’d better go see Phan.
Bye.

590
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,800
If I can’t make you pass out
tonight, don’t call me Prapai.

591
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:10,430

The End
