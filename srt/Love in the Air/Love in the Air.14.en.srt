1
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,080
What’s the matter?

2
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,600
I could ask you the same question.

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,400
You sighed first.

4
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,480
I think I heard you sigh first.

5
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,680
- I did not.
- You did too.

6
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,760
Fine, I sighed first, so I won.
You go first.

7
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,720
Why am I arguing with you?

8
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,960
- Don’t tell me…
- Stop your wild imagination, Rain.

9
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,680
I didn’t fight with P’ Pai.
It’s P’ Pai and his family.

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What happened?

11
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,280
Tell me, I wanna hear it.

12
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,520
You seem to be in a good mood today.

13
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,720
Yes, I have a date tonight.
It’s rare for him to come see me here.

14
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,360
Nong Sky?
Shall I go get him?

15
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,680
It’s okay, he’ll call me when he arrives.

16
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,080
You’re so cute, Nong Sky.
Let me give you a hug.

17
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,960
P’ Plerng.

18
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
- Come on, Sky.
- P’ Pai’s gonna see us.

19
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,880
Hey! How did you get here?

20
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,920
Why couldn’t I come?

21
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,040
This is Dad’s company,
which means it’s also mine.

22
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,360
And I’m the one who brought Sky up here.

23
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,040
You’re so terrible, P’ Pai.

24
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,360
How could you let him
wait on the first floor?

25
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,520
It’s not what you think.

26
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,360
I was about to call you
when P’ Plerng saw me.

27
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,480
- So we came up together.
- Sky, don’t speak up for him.

28
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,120
You can come to me if P’ Pai mistreats you.

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,440
That’s enough.

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,800
This is my boyfriend.
Stop hugging him!

31
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,960
Only I can hug him.

32
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,160
Stingy!

33
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,360
Don’t listen to him.
If he invites you out, don’t go.

34
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,320
Or if he buys you a gift, don’t accept it.
I’ll buy it for you.

35
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,280
But Mom wants to meet Sky.
She’s already booked a restaurant.

36
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,520
Sky, please don’t be mean to our mom.

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,840
Don’t believe him.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,240
How could she book a restaurant?
I haven’t told her that you’d come.

39
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
What are you doing?

40
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,560
Telling Mom.
And now she knows.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,040
Okay, let’s have dinner together tonight.

42
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,960
Nong Sky, you should come this way
or you'll go crazy like them.

43
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,600
- Who are you calling crazy?
- Who are you calling crazy?

44
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,120
P’ Tan, is it alright to let them be?

45
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,120
Don’t worry, everyone’s just teasing
Mr. Pai and showing you affection.

46
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,600
We should get out of here.
Come on, let’s go.

47
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,280
Let’s go outside.

48
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,440
How could you do this?
He’s my boyfriend.

49
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,960
Who told you to make him wait downstairs?

50
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,320
I didn’t make him wait.
Sky was about to call me. You heard him.

51
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,240
So P’ Pai’s whole family likes you.

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,360
And P’ Pai, his parents, and
siblings are waging war to snatch you.

53
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,680
Wow, my friend's become
their favorite son-in-law.

54
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,320
I don’t know if I’m their favorite,
but I don’t want to upset any of them.

55
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,720
‘Cause I want his family to like me.

56
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,560
What about you?
Why did you follow me here?

57
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,000
I’m lonely.

58
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,520
And it’s summer break.
I’ve got nothing to do.

59
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,800
Don’t tell me you fought with P’ Payu.

60
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,960
No, I didn’t fight with P’ Payu.

61
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,120
I’m just annoyed that he’s attractive.

62
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,840
I think it’s okay.
What do you think?

63
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,600
- Let’s adjust it a bit.
- How?

64
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Perfect.

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,440
- Not yet.
- What’s missing?

66
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,520
Turn around.

67
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,520
Yeah, this is it.
That’s what I’m talking about.

68
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,720
- Fuck you.
- Perfect.

69
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,200
Why do I have to wear this costume, Sig?

70
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,200
‘Cause our faculty will be putting
on a Korean historical play this year.

71
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,280
And you look the most
like an ancient Korean.

72
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,280
It’s okay if you’re not gonna perform,
but you must be our mannequin.

73
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,760
Okay?

74
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,360
Just do us a favor.

75
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,000
The guy who’s supposed to be
at the fitting got food poisoning.

76
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,120
And both of you’ve got similar body sizes.
See? It’s a fit.

77
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
He’s right.

78
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,960
I wouldn’t have worn it
if it hadn’t been for your sake.

79
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,040
Hold on, why Sky’s sake?

80
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,600
Why can’t you do it for my sake?
What’s wrong with me?

81
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,720
It’s because I don’t like you.

82
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,320
- Got it?
- Here we go again.

83
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,840
Very well, very well.

84
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,560
You’ve gotten arrogant
after getting yourself a hubby.

85
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,720
Don’t mock me.

86
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,400
- ‘It’s because I don’t like you.’
- What’s wrong with you?

87
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,920
Look at this, everyone!

88
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,280
Well? Doesn’t he look stunning?
It’s done by me.

89
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,800
Why is P’ Payu wearing this costume?
And why are you with Ple?

90
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,080
Hey, it’s not what you think.
I don’t have feelings for him anymore.

91
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,400
When I was picking up the altered
costume, I met P’ Payu on the way.

92
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,440
You know our lead actor
can’t come to the fitting.

93
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,640
So I asked P’ Payu to try it on instead.

94
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,400
Well? What do you think?

95
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,720
He looks great!

96
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,240
So much better than Rain.
Sawasdee krub.

97
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,520
- P’ Payu in this costume…
- What?

98
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,080
I won’t let you look at him anymore.

99
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,920
- Huh?
- Enough. Stop looking. Stop watching.

100
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
- I’m gonna look.
- No.

101
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,120
Since you’re here, can I take
a photo with you, P’ Payu?

102
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
- Take a photo for me.
- Hurry up.

103
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,080
- I’d be greatly honored.
- No, I won’t let you.

104
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,200
- P’ Payu’s a star now.
- Hey!

105
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,640
- I want a photo too.
- Don't...

106
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,960
Come here.
Get away from him.

107
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,640
- No photos.
- Say cheese.

108
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,280
- No.
- Do the cyclone pose.

109
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,880
Come with me right now!

110
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,600
Why are you looking at me like that?
It doesn’t suit me?

111
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,760
Yeah, it doesn’t.
It doesn’t suit you very much.

112
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,280
- Take it off right now.
- It really doesn’t suit me?

113
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,600
Well… It does.

114
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,160
Of course, you like to see me cosplay.
So how could you not like it?

115
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,080
I don’t like to see you cosplay.

116
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,680
But you sometimes want me to
put on a racing suit or a pilot uniform.

117
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,480
It’s because...

118
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,120
My boyfriend’s handsome.
He looks good in everything.

119
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,800
Don’t change the subject.

120
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,440
You were bullying me.
I saw it.

121
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,280
What did I do?

122
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,280
Everyone was bullying me.
You were supposed to take my side.

123
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,880
How could you let Sig take a photo?
And I saw you put your arm around Sky.

124
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,080
My boyfriend’s gotten smarter.

125
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,960
You’re calling me stupid again.

126
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,320
‘Stupid’ means ‘cute.’

127
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,480
Actually…

128
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,680
Actually?

129
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,920
You look handsome in this costume.
I wanna keep you to myself.

130
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,120
I think so too.

131
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,520
You should only wear this
costume when you’re alone with me.

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,640
And if you don’t take it off soon,
I’m gonna walk around in this costume.

133
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,920
Hey, hold on! I’m taking it off.
I’m taking it off right now.

134
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,600
But you must take it off too.
Come here, come take it off with me.

135
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,080
You’re upset ‘cause the juniors were
fangirling over P’ Payu in costume?

136
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,760
My friend’s so childish!

137
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,080
You’ve really got no idea, Sky.

138
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,920
His photos were spread
to accountancy faculty.

139
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,400
That buliding's miles away from ours.

140
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,560
And he’s got a lot more followers now.

141
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,520
So this is why you’re sulking?

142
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,480
That’s why I said you’re childish.
P’ Payu didn't do anything wrong.

143
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,640
The hell he didn’t.
He laughed every time I brought it up.

144
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,200
It’s so frustrating.

145
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,520
Maybe he likes seeing you huff and puff?
I think it’s funny.

146
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,960
Sky!

147
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,120
What?
Hey, is that all of your story?

148
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Huh?

149
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
No.

150
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Have you ever called P’ Pai ‘Daddy’?

151
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
What?

152
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
Have you ever called P’ Pai ‘Daddy’?

153
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,800
What did you say?

154
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,400
Have you ever called P’ Pai ‘Daddy’!
Daddy!

155
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,120
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

156
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Daddy.

157
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
What's this?

158
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,720
A book.
What do you think it is?

159
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,720
I know it’s a book,
but why are you giving it to me?

160
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,720
A book is for reading
and I want you to read it.

161
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,560
How many days have you been lazing around?

162
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,240
I promised your mama to push you hard.

163
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,040
Get up and do something else.
Don’t just play with your phone.

164
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,600
You’re acting like a dad, P’ Payu.

165
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,360
Who did you call dad?

166
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,640
You.

167
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,720
Papa, Dad, Daddy.

168
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,800
Then I’d better teach
the difference between...

169
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,360
'Daddy'...

170
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,000
And 'hubby'...

171
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,840
To you.

172
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,200
Enough already, P’ Payu.

173
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,280
I’m making sure you know
the difference between ‘daddy’ and ‘hubby’.

174
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,680
I already know it.

175
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,160
My papa doesn’t squeeze my chest like this.

176
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,680
Ouch! Don’t pinch!

177
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,920
You know what?

178
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,480
When I teach...

179
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,360
I teach to the core.

180
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,880
What did you call me again?

181
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Daddy.

182
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,160
Are you sure you wanna call me daddy?

183
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,800
P’ Payu, please hear me out.

184
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,960
By my definition, ‘daddy’ isn’t a father.

185
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,080
To me, ‘daddy’ means…

186
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,080
Hubby.

187
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,720
Daddy.

188
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
Hubby.

189
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,200
Daddy.

190
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Daddy.

191
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,360
I told you it’s nothing.

192
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,440
Okay, if you say so.

193
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,800
Sky! You!

194
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,720
Your face says it all, Rain.

195
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,000
P’ Payu must’ve done
something that made you shy.

196
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,200
But it’s fine if you don’t wanna tell me.

197
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,440
Sky, get in the pool now.
Get in.

198
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,520
No way.

199
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,840
By the way, didn’t you say
you’d go on a trip with P’ Payu?

200
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,240
He’s busy.
Do you wanna go with me?

201
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,560
No.
I just went to Lopburi with P’ Pai.

202
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,160
And I’ve got to prepare
the orientation activities.

203
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,280
I’m up to my eyes in work.

204
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,280
Oh, so you took him to Lopburi.

205
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,560
To pay respect to your father, P’ Sky?

206
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,600
Will you stop being nosy for once?

207
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
You make me even more curious now.

208
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,080
Let’s have a heart-to-heart.

209
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,720
What is P’ Pai’s size?

210
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,120
What size are you talking about?
I don’t know anything.

211
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,880
Don’t play dumb.

212
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
- Come on, tell me.
- No.

213
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,480
- Tell me.
- I won’t tell you. No.

214
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,160
- Come on.
- No, no. I won’t tell you.

215
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,280
Don’t you follow me!
Rain! Don’t. Don’t.

216
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,560
- Go away.
- Why are you shy?

217
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,200
- I’m not shy.
- Your face's red.

218
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,920
- It's not.
- It's redder than that building’s lights.

219
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,720
- Stop exaggerating.
- I’m not.

220
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,920
I'm not exaggerating.

221
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,880
You bought quite a lot.
Let me help you.

222
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,400
You said you’d be working late,
so I was afraid you might be hungry.

223
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,000
Then can I eat something else too?

224
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,800
Have you finished your work?

225
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,960
No, I’ve got a meeting
with the Europe branch.

226
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,480
Next time, tell me when you
work hard so that I’ll come see you.

227
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,880
This is enough to recharge me.

228
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,560
Now that I’m recharged,
I’m gonna wrap up my work.

229
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,120
And we’ll ‘eat’ after that.

230
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,200
I know what you’re thinking.

231
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,960
Come on, let’s go.

232
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
I’ve finished my work.

233
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,320
Give me a second, P’ Pai.
I’m in the middle of the game.

234
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,400
I don’t wanna lose.

235
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,280
But I already finished my work.

236
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,040
Besides, Plerng and Phan
aren’t here to disturb us today.

237
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,880
Just a sec, let me play the game first.

238
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,800
I told you to give me a second.

239
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,160
Keep playing your game.
I’m gonna play mine.

240
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,880
- Is this how you wanna play it?
- Yes, I’m gonna play it like this.

241
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,280
Lift your ass.

242
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,920
You won’t stop playing?

243
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,600
So what’s more interesting, me or the game?

244
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,640
P’ Pai.

245
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,280
- P’ Pai.
- Yes?

246
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,920
I already lost the game.

247
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,240
And you lost to me.

248
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,920
Now you’re eating me up.
Enjoy it?

249
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,240
Very much.

250
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,800
- Tell me now.
- No, no.

251
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,520
- Hurry up.
- No, no. I won’t tell you.

252
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,600
Don’t follow me!
Rain! Don’t. Don’t.

253
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,920
- Go away.
- Why are you shy?

254
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,520
- I’m not shy.
- Your face’s red

255
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,280
- It’s not.
- It’s redder than that building’s lights.

256
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,760
Stop exaggerating.

257
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,680
You’re picking Rain up?

258
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Yeah, he said he came
here to swim with your boy.

259
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,240
You’re in a good mood.

260
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,120
So are you.

261
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,480
How could I not be?

262
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,680
I can’t stop smiling at
the scene in front of me.

263
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Just look at them.

264
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,520
So adorable.

265
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,400
They’re gonna fall into the pool.

266
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Oh.

267
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,320
I’ve arranged the matter
according to your request.

268
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,320
Thank you so much for
taking care of it for me.

269
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,720
But they’re just hotel
reservation documents.

270
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,840
Why did you deliver them yourself?

271
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,840
I’d like to ask you a favor, Mr. Payu.

272
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,240
Don’t forget our date.
And please wear cute outfit.

273
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,600
Why do I’ve got to do it?

274
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,360
‘Cause I wanna see.
My darling’s usually cute.

275
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,600
But I wanna see you
especially cute on our date.

276
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,040
Why do I’ve got to do it?

277
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,840
Besides, you chose to date a boy like me.
I won’t dress up to seduce you.

278
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,400
Whose boyfriend are you?
Always read my mind.

279
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,320
Look in the mirror if you wanna know.

280
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,160
Sawasdee Ka, P’ Pai.
What a coincidence.

281
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,840
I haven’t seen you in a long time.
Why don’t we have a meal together?

282
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,080
Sorry, I’m busy.
And I’ll always be busy from now on.

283
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,680
What’s the matter, P’ Pai?

284
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,280
You’re usually not like this.

285
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,960
You wouldn’t pick up my calls.

286
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,440
Did I do something wrong?

287
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,440
No, I just quit.

288
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,080
- Quit?
- Yes.

289
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,520
- I quit…
- P’ Pai.

290
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,080
Sky, it’s not what you think.
I didn’t do anything.

291
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,120
Step aside, P’ Pai.

292
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,320
Excuse me, I have something
to discuss with P’ Pai.

293
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,400
- You’re the one who needs to step aside.
- But I don’t!

294
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,000
Not even a tiny bit.
Please believe me.

295
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,000
Excuse me, my boyfriend has made it
clear that he has no business with you.

296
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,800
So please give us some privacy.
We’re on a date.

297
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,000
Yes, I’m on a date with my boyfriend.

298
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,120
Is that so?
Let’s talk next time then.

299
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,720
It wasn’t me.
She’s the one who came on to me.

300
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,760
I’ve already got you.

301
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,080
- You're telling the truth?
- Of course! A million percent truth.

302
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
Come sit.

303
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,600
You’re not angry that I was being rude?

304
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,440
No, I’m happy that you showed
your possessiveness over me.

305
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,560
- Really?
- Yes.

306
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,160
Don’t care about other people.

307
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,640
Let’s eat.
You must be hungry now.

308
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,080
I’ve ordered a special course for you.

309
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,200
Thank you.

310
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,000
How could I have eyes for
anyone else when you’re this cute?

311
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,840
I'm curious.

312
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,360
Are you confident that
P’ Pai’s serious about you?

313
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,920
What is it that you want?

314
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,880
I want you to answer my question.

315
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,200
You’re not stupid enough to think
that he takes you seriously, are you?

316
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,200
P’ Pai’s made it clear to you.

317
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,680
Confident, aren’t you?

318
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,120
A word of advice from someone
who used to hook up with him.

319
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,040
Don’t take his words seriously.

320
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:18,840
You're asking me how confident I am.
P’ Pai openly admits I’m his boyfriend.

321
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,840
So how confident are you
to ask me such question?

322
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,840
- Has he ever called you his girlfriend?
- You!

323
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,080
And has he ever said that he loved you?

324
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,280
He says he loves me.

325
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,400
Be cocky all you want.
P’ Pai’s never serious about anyone.

326
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,360
Then I’m the first and only one.

327
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,680
- Rain, let’s go on a trip!
- Sky, let’s go on a trip!

328
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,720
- We’ll go on a trip together.
- Yes, we’ll go on a trip together.

329
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,520
- Just the two of us.
- Yes, just the two of us.

330
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,720
Just the two of us.

331
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,160
Yeah, just the two of us.

332
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,040
Rain.

333
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,440
Do you know where we’re going?

334
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,440
Come on, trust me.
I’ve made an arrangement.

335
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,360
And don’t you whine
about wanting to see P’ Pai.

336
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,480
Got it?

337
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,280
Exactly who’ll do that?
You sure it won’t be you?

338
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,960
I’m a man of my word.
Mark my word.

339
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,400
I won’t say a single thing
about P’ Payu during this trip.

340
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,760
Don’t say things when you
could go back on your word.

341
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,320
Hey, I’m your buddy.
Don’t take that bad guy’s side.

342
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,960
Whatever, I won’t talk about P’ Payu.

343
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,840
And don’t you talk about P’ Pai.

344
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,760
There’s no way I’ll talk about him.
Why would I talk about him?

345
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,440
Just an attractive guy
who’s liked by everyone.

346
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,080
There’s nothing good about him.

347
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,200
- I won’t talk.
- Neither will I.

348
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
Promise.

349
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,400
Yeah, promise.

350
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,840
Bring it on.
Alright, bring it on.

351
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,080
Bring it on.

352
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,240
Bring it on.

353
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,080
- Are you thinking about P’ Pai?
- What?

354
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,480
- You were thinking about P’ Pai.
- I wasn't.

355
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,040
- You were looking sad.
- No, I was just enjoying the view.

356
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,520
You’re thinking about P’ Payu.

357
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,320
No, I’m not.
Why would I think about him?

358
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,440
Don’t deny it.

359
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,080
- I’m not.
- Your face says it all.

360
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,640
- Have you found them?
- No. Have you?

361
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,560
I called everyone who might know Sky.

362
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,960
Neither my siblings, my mom, nor
my secretary kidnapped my boyfriend.

363
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,080
I also called Sky’s dad,
but he didn’t know where Sky was.

364
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,040
I searched for Rain at his house and
university but didn’t find him anywhere.

365
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,600
Rain’s mom even thought
that he was with me.

366
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,560
I almost couldn’t keep a poker face.

367
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,080
At least they sent texts
about going on a trip together.

368
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,440
But ended them with
‘Don’t follow us. We’re still mad’?

369
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,000
Did I do something wrong?

370
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,320
- I still don’t know what I did wrong.
- Neither do I!

371
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,960
I quit partying, I quit hooking up,
I quit everything.

372
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,000
Oh, I was thinking
you guys looked familiar.

373
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,840
It turns out to be
my beloved friends’ sweethearts.

374
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,680
But you’re blocking the entrance.
Come on, get out of the way.

375
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,520
Why are you making scary faces?
Your lovers disappeared?

376
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,240
You know something, don’t you?

377
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,160
What do you think?

378
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,240
Tell us what you want.

379
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,560
Now we’re talking.

380
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,400
Come here, I’ll tell you
a stupid story of those stupid guys.

381
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,040
- Por.
- What?

382
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,920
Have you seen Rain’s messages
in Student Club’s chat group?

383
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,800
- No, I haven’t seen them.
- C’mere, c’mere, c’mere.

384
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,160
I’ll read them to you and you’ll
know how stupid our friend is.

385
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,320
- Ready?
- Yeah.

386
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,840
‘Guys, Sky and I are on a trip in Rayong
to get away from our boyfriends.’

387
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,400
‘You mustn’t tell P’ Payu and
P’ Pai where we’re staying.’

388
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,200
‘But I’m gonna tell you so that you’ll
know why Sky can’t attend the meeting.’

389
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,520
‘Alright, here’s the hotel’s location.'

390
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,640
'We’re staying in Tawan Chai room.’

391
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,000
‘Call us if there’s anything urgent.’

392
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,720
‘I repeat! You mustn’t
tell P’ Payu and P’ Pai!’

393
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,600
Hold on, let me get this straight.

394
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,480
Those guys made a plan to escape
their hubbies but told you all about it?

395
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,800
Wait a minute,
why are you smiling like that?

396
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
No reason.

397
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,680
Just think about it.

398
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,120
- Rain told me not to tell…
- Not to tell...

399
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,280
- P’ Payu and P’ Pai.
- P’ Payu and P’ Pai.

400
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,560
But I didn’t promise him
that I wouldn’t tell them.

401
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,040
I’m gonna spill all the beans to P’ Payu
to show him how stupid Rain is.

402
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,200
You just can’t stop bullying him, Sig.

403
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,720
‘Cause he’s funny.

404
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:05,720
He fucking wanted to hide but
shared the location, the room’s name...

405
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,360
And even which bed he’s sleeping on.

406
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,840
The more he forbids me,
the more I wanna do it.

407
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,920
I’m gonna let the whole world know.

408
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,400
You’re unbelievable.

409
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,800
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Sig! Sig! Sig!

410
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,880
I'll become the King of the Pirates!

411
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,320
Have you gone mad?

412
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,200
Don’t get in the way of my happiness.

413
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,320
You never had a dream when you were a kid?
I’m just fulfilling mine.

414
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,040
By imitating your favorite manga character?

415
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,960
Rain.

416
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,360
Have you ever heard the saying…

417
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,080
‘Take time to heal your mind
after a bad day’?

418
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,240
And we came here to have fun.

419
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,720
Yeah, let’s have some fun.

420
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,720
That’s right.
Yeah! That’s right!

421
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
The other arm.

422
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,040
There’ll be just
the two of us on this trip.

423
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,840
- Of course. One, two.
- Three, four, five, six.

424
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,240
Alright! Another shot.

425
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,720
There won’t be anybody else.
Just us and the sea.

426
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,440
We don’t need others.
We can have fun by ourselves, right?

427
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,920
- Let’s enjoy ourselves.
- Let’s have the time of our lives!

428
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,360
Juicy, very juicy.

429
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,040
- So good.
- Very good.

430
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,120
The best.

431
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,960
Keep drinking.
Don’t stop.

432
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,040
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Don’t put your glass down.

433
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,880
We'll drink until we get drunk from soda.
No stop. No quit. No sleep.

434
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,000
Yeah, and we’ve still got
soft drinks and plenty of snacks.

435
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,080
Plenty of them.
Just for us.

436
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,200
Yeah, we’ll have fun and chill out today.

437
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,920
- Yeah.
- See the swing over there?

438
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,960
You go sit on it.
I’ll swing.

439
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,120
Hey, keep having fun.
Don’t stop.

440
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Okay.

441
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,560
What a blast.

442
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,440
You think I couldn’t track you down, Rain?

443
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,680
It’s hunting time, Sky.

444
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Rain.

445
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,600
I think it’s time to admit it.

446
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,160
Admit what?
I won’t admit to anything.

447
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,360
P’ Payu kept saying how much he loved me.

448
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,800
But why did he put his face
close to someone else's?

449
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,600
I was gonna say we needed
to admit that we ate too much.

450
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,800
I don’t think I can go to dinner with you.

451
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,280
What?

452
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,480
Weren’t you trying to say we needed to
admit that we couldn’t live without them?

453
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,200
Fuck you, Sky.
You tricked me into saying it.

454
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,720
I didn’t.
You let it slip yourself.

455
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,200
You can’t fool me.

456
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,680
Fine, I admit that I miss P’ Payu.

457
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,280
You too.
Don't deny that you miss P’ Pai.

458
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,240
You think I can’t tell how you feel?

459
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,280
You’ve been feeling blue
and sighing all day.

460
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,880
What?

461
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,440
What are you looking at?

462
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,200
You’re acting like
there’s a ghost behind me.

463
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,520
Don’t tell me there’s
actually a ghost behind me!

464
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,640
P’ Payu, how did you get here!
And who said you could hug me?

465
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,520
I’m borrowing your friend.
Thanks for taking care of him.

466
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,960
- You come with me, you little devil.
- No! Let me go!

467
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,480
What a naughty boy!

468
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,840
You know I’ll get angry if you
drag me away like that, don’t you?

469
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,480
I won’t do it.

470
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,320
You know I won’t do
anything against your will.

471
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,440
I told you not to follow me.

472
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,360
You probably think I’m your prey.

473
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,240
Think you could just show up,
flash me a smile, and I’d forgive you?

474
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,000
You know you're wrong, don't you?

475
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,080
Come on, that’s not what I think.

476
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,760
Fine, I'm sorry.

477
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,960
Please forgive me.

478
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,480
Do you know what you did wrong?

479
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
No.

480
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,640
Fine, I forgive you.

481
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,240
But you must do everything
I say without any exceptions.

482
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,800
Okay?

483
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,520
Okay.

484
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,360
I’ll show you who’s the real prey.

485
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,560
Hey, what are you doing?

486
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,520
Why are you angry with me?

487
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,480
I’m not.

488
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,920
Rain, tell me.
I wanna know.

489
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,680
You really don’t know why I’m angry?

490
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,640
Then continue being in the dark.
I’ll stay angry, I’ll sulk.

491
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,480
And I won’t talk to you.

492
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,200
Tell me.

493
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:20,480
What can I do to make
you naughty boy forgive me?

494
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,960
Well, you must do as I say.

495
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,080
What do you want me to do?

496
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,800
Just a sec.

497
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,760
You said you’d do it for me.

498
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,720
Think of it as a way
to fulfil your promise.

499
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,680
Why did you bring me up here?

500
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,920
Didn’t you say you’d do
everything as I say?

501
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:23,520
I can do everything you want me to.
But I’m just curious.

502
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,560
Rule No. 1: You don’t have to do anything.

503
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,040
Huh?

504
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,520
Rule No. 2: You must
not respond to whatever I do.

505
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,680
Huh?

506
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,080
And rule No. 3: If you can’t
follow the first two rules...

507
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,360
I won’t forgive you and
tell you why I’m angry.

508
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,960
- Understood?
- Hold on a sec, I’m confused.

509
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,760
How can I make up with you
if you won’t let me do anything?

510
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,640
Wait, why are you taking off your clothes?

511
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,960
P’ Pai.

512
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,720
- Let’s take a bath.
- Huh?

513
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,880
Okay.

514
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,640
Let’s take a bath.

515
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,040
- Will you forgive me now?
- No.

516
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,200
Stand still.
I’m gonna take photos.

517
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,200
Are you angry about the play’s costume?

518
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,600
No.
Who’d be angry about such a silly matter?

519
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,960
I’m angry that my boyfriend’s
annoyingly charming.

520
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:12,080
Is it because I forced you to
read until you called me Daddy?

521
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,120
No, it’s not about that.

522
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,160
It’s not?

523
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,320
Then it must be when
I punished you until you were sore.

524
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,280
But I remember that you liked it.

525
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,440
Not that!

526
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,600
You brought a random woman home
and made out with her.

527
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,440
When?
I never do that to anyone but you.

528
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,520
Don’t you argue with me.

529
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,800
She was beautiful, had nice body.
It’s still fresh in my memory.

530
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,680
She was wearing an orange dress
and had this round thingy on her head.

531
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,560
Ms. Natsu.

532
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,400
Ms. Natsu?

533
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,800
I don’t wanna know her name.

534
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,360
But you’ve finally admitted that
you brought a woman home, right?

535
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,720
That’s right, I brought a woman home.

536
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,120
How could you do it, P’ Payu?

537
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,480
How could you do this to me?

538
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:25,520
But they’re just hotel
reservation documents.

539
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,520
Why did you deliver them yourself?

540
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,760
I’d like to ask you a favor, Mr. Payu.

541
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:45,000
Since we’re in the same circle of friends,
I hope you won’t turn down my request.

542
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,560
Is it about P’ Pakin?

543
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,600
I’ve heard from my friends
that you’re close to Mr. Pakin.

544
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,240
And he’s been planning
to expand his business.

545
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,480
So I'm hoping that we can talk.

546
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,200
I don’t think I can help you.

547
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:17,720
How about an upgrade from a seaside
resort to a villa on a private island?

548
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,480
What do you think?

549
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,640
All you need to do is introduce me to him.

550
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,680
It’s not easy to bribe me.

551
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,200
It’s just an introduction.

552
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:41,480
Mr. Pai told me you wanted to
take your important person on a trip.

553
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,440
If you’re looking for surprise packages,
our affiliated hotels are at your service.

554
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,840
- I’m not easily swayed.
- What about this time?

555
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,840
Your offers hit the spot.

556
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,600
- I’ll introduce you to him.
- Thank you.

557
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,640
This person must be
very important to you.

558
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,360
What do you think, Ms. Natsu?

559
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,360
Your smile says it all.

560
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,600
Don’t worry, I’ll rebook
for you immediately.

561
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,000
And if you want to plan a surprise
event, I’ll take care of it for you.

562
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you too.

563
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,520
That woman’s my friend.

564
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,600
I’m telling the truth.

565
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,400
Pai can verify that we’re
in the same circle of friends.

566
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,800
I asked her to help me book
a villa on a private island.

567
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,240
‘Cause a certain boy wanted to go on
vacation before new semester started.

568
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,600
But it seems he misunderstood.

569
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,440
You’re lying.

570
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,000
Have I ever lied to you about this stuff?

571
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,560
I made a promise that
I'd never let you down.

572
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,080
Umm… I guess I’m mistaken.

573
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,800
That being said,
you promised to cosplay for me.

574
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,280
Next outfit.
Go get changed now.

575
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,880
- Must I get changed again?
- Yeah, hurry up and change your clothes.

576
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,600
Shit.

577
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,800
That was a huge misunderstanding.

578
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,760
A villa reservation for our vacation?
Damn, I totally got the wrong idea.

579
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,480
My boyfriend’s so great.
How did I misunderstand him?

580
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,880
But the pilot outfit was so good.

581
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,720
Hey, where’s the doctor uniform?

582
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,920
I prefer it like this.

583
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:34,320
Time to punish the boy who misunderstood
and made me run around looking for him.

584
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,480
Who says you can punish me?
I’m still angry with you.

585
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,280
I’m trying to make it up to you now.

586
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,640
Let’s make up.

587
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,280
What did I tell you?

588
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,080
Aren’t you too mean?

589
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,840
You expect me to do nothing
in this kind of situation?

590
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,920
You’re killing me.

591
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,160
You said you’d do anything.

592
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,560
Can’t you do this much for me?

593
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,800
Then how do you expect me
to believe your words?

594
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,360
Sometimes I’ve got
a feeling that you’re mean.

595
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,960
- So you’re gonna look for someone else?
- Hold on, I only love you.

596
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,000
One foul.

597
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,160
Get three fouls and
I’ll stop talking to you.

598
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,840
I’m sorry, that was unintentional.

599
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,240
You think I don’t know
that you did it on purpose?

600
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,920
Rule No. 1: Prapai
won’t do anything to Sky.

601
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:14,040
Rule No. 2: Prapai won’t
respond to whatever Sky does.

602
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:21,760
Rule No. 3: If Prapai can’t follow
the first two rules, Sky won’t forgive him.

603
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,800
Copy that!

604
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,640
You’d better stick to the rules.

605
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,520
Oh, did you just smile?

606
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,200
Put your hands on the edge.

607
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,200
The edge?

608
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,600
Do you wanna know
the reason I’m angry with you?

609
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,320
Then you need to endure.

610
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,720
Don’t move, Pai.
Don’t move.

611
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,680
Don’t move.

612
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,800
Stay down, my son.
Stay down! Stay down!

613
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,480
Stay the hell down!

614
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,120
P’ Pai.

615
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,760
- Hmm?
- Open your eyes.

616
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,360
No, this isn’t the best
situation to open my eyes.

617
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,600
I told you to open your eyes.

618
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,480
Do you wanna kiss me?

619
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,160
Absolutely.

620
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,240
Then next time...

621
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,520
Don’t let your ex pester me again.

622
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,520
Remember the day we went on
a date and met your ex-girlfriend?

623
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,000
She isn’t my ex-girlfriend.

624
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,040
She said you’d never
be serious about anyone.

625
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,000
But I’m serious about you.
Please believe me.

626
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,800
I know that.

627
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,240
Huh?

628
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,280
I know she was trying to provoke me.

629
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,280
And I know she was jealous
that you called me your boyfriend.

630
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,640
And I also know that
she wanted my boyfriend.

631
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,280
But...

632
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,400
But I know better than anyone
that you’re not that kind of man.

633
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,400
You’re serious about me.
You love me.

634
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,520
But I still wanna get angry with you.

635
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,720
I’m sorry.

636
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,680
I promise I won’t let anything
like this happen again.

637
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:39,280
And do you wanna know
what I wanna get angry about?

638
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:50,880
I wanna get very angry that other
people saw a side of you I never saw.

639
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,840
You’ve really got no idea how greedy I am.

640
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,560
I wanna keep you to myself.
I don’t wanna share you with anyone else.

641
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,280
I wish I could’ve been
the first person to touch you.

642
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,480
And...

643
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,600
I sound selfish.

644
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,440
Not at all.
I feel that way too.

645
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,200
Did you forget how much
I hate your ex-boyfriend?

646
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,280
You’ve got a right to be angry with me.

647
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,640
A right over my body, my heart.

648
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,040
A right to my love.

649
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:40,840
I’m sorry that my past
has made you feel upset.

650
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,320
Are we good now?

651
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,040
Ouch!

652
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,240
Yes, we’re good now.
And that was the second foul.

653
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,480
- Hey, did that count?
- Of course!

654
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,960
We’ve made up, but I never
said your punishment was over.

655
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,360
So don’t move.
Understood?

656
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,080
Understood.

657
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,680
Let’s see how long you can last.

658
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,560
Just kill me.
Kill me, kill me right now!

659
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:35,960
You little devil.

660
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,040
You’re allowed to touch this much.

661
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,440
Sky.

662
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,840
You’re telling me that you knew
P’ Payu and P’ Pai would follow us here?

663
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,080
Yeah.

664
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,320
How did you know?

665
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,680
I knew from the moment you sent
messages to Student Club’s chat group.

666
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,680
Look, did you forget that
P’ Payu knows the club’s members?

667
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,200
So I thought they might follow us here
but didn’t expect it to be so soon.

668
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,040
So you told Rain to
come up with my punishment.

669
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,320
I only asked him what he’d do
if you came here to apologize.

670
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,440
And he prepared the rest himself.

671
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,920
I didn't plan to use them here.

672
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:06,560
I planned to punish P’ Payu if he came
to apologize after I returned to Bangkok.

673
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,480
So I brought them with me.

674
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,200
Wasn’t it because you
liked to see me cosplay?

675
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,040
There are a pilot uniform,
a doctor uniform…

676
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,120
Eat up, P' Payu.

677
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,000
The dough sticks are very tasty.
So eat up.

678
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,560
Is it tasty?
Let me feed you.

679
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,200
You're really something, Rainy Boy.

680
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,800
Be quiet, P’ Pai.
You were acting timid with Sky just now.

681
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,440
He scolded me.

682
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,920
Any other costumes you want?

683
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:52,000
Eat up. Bite it, bite. Gobble it down.
Eat with this dip. It’s very sweet.

684
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,520
- How about a racing suit?
- Open your mouth.

685
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,280
It’s nice to go on
vacation once in a while.

686
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,640
Let’s go on a trip next week.
Just the two of us.

687
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,640
I’m talking about the villa on
a private island, naughty boy.

688
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,640
I just told you yesterday.
Forget it already?

689
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,200
You bullied me again.

690
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,920
I didn’t forget.
But you’re really serious about it?

691
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,200
It’s a reward for the good
boy who’s worked hard.

692
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,760
Then I’ll study hard every year and
snatch the first-class honor for you.

693
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,920
But I don’t think you can do it.

694
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,200
P’ Payu.

695
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,760
Can’t you just encourage me?

696
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,400
I’m just being honest.

697
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,920
I love you, P' Payu.

698
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,160
P’ Pai and Sky are gonna see us.

699
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,280
They won’t.
They’re over there.

700
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,120
I’m leaving.
I don’t wanna stay with a bully.

701
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,280
I’m gonna ask Sky to swim with me.

702
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,800
Rain.

703
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,960
I love you too.

704
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,200
Do you like the sea?

705
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,480
Yes.

706
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,200
Then shall we have a beach wedding?

707
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,240
You must’ve forgotten that same sex
marriage isn’t legalized in this country.

708
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,200
But I believe there’ll be
changes in the future.

709
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,600
‘Cause everyone’s got a right
to take care of people they love.

710
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,520
And I wanna have that
right to take care of you.

711
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,520
Are you asking me…

712
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,920
To marry you?

713
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,160
I can get serious at times too.

714
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,280
Not today. Not now.

715
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,240
Maybe after your graduation.

716
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,120
Maybe after you get a job.

717
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,400
Maybe after you get
to live the life you want.

718
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,120
When you’re ready,
I’m gonna propose to you.

719
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,360
I might not be ready
for the rest of my life.

720
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:30,080
I’m ready to take care
of you for the rest of my life.

721
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,440
Then please wait for me.

722
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,520
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
We’re outdoors now.

723
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,680
Didn’t know you were a PDA couple.

724
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,080
Hey, P' Payu! Let me down!

725
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,040
- Let me down!
- Didn’t you say you wanna swim?

726
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:07,440
- I’ll swim with you.
- No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

727
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,560
Wanna join them?

728
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,920
Let me down!

729
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,240
P’ Pai, no.

730
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,720
- Come on, let’s swim.
- Don’t even think about it.

731
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,200
- Let’s swim.
- P’ Pai! No!
