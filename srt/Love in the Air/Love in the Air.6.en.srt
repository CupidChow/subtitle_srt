1
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,300
My darling.

2
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,160
You've lost, my darling.

3
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,400
Bring him with you to the next race.

4
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,680
Can I really come here?

5
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,690
Just do as I said.

6
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,690
If anyone asks...

7
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,820
I'll tell them I'm your darling.

8
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,259
A place where you can bet everything.
From fame, wealth, to lovers.

9
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,730
But if you're here to make trouble,
things won't end easily.

10
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,620
That's Street Circuit race for you.

11
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,690
When does the race start?

12
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,820
In about half an hour.

13
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,680
It’s two hours long.

14
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,740
Wow, won’t it take
the whole night to clear up?

15
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,850
You’re wrong.

16
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,850
The whole event’s no
more than four hours long.

17
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,530
That’s crazy.
How is it possible?

18
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,140
We make the impossible possible.

19
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,980
Sawasdee krub, P’ Chai.

20
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,750
Rain, this is P’ Chai,
P’ Pakin’s right-hand man.

21
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,210
And this is Rain, my boyfriend.

22
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,640
It's a pleasure to meet you.

23
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,600
Sawasdee krub.

24
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,620
Looks like Rainy Boy
is scared of you, P’ Chai.

25
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,350
Am I that scary?

26
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,980
What part of you isn’t scary?

27
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,020
So where’s your boss?

28
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,660
His boy got sick suddenly,
so he didn’t come.

29
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,000
I have guests to entertain.
Let's talk later.

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,540
Is that the guy who makes people
disappear easily if they make trouble?

31
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,780
Do you understand now?

32
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,250
But there aren’t only
scary things in this event.

33
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Come on, I’ll introduce you to my friends.

34
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,260
The Near Raging Storm

35
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,190
Welcome.

36
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,480
Damn, that was awesome!
You really got me in.

37
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,409
Why would I lie to you?

38
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,430
I told you my dad’s
familiar with the organizer.

39
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,590
To tell you the truth...

40
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,040
I thought you were bullshitting.

41
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,010
- Bullshitting my ass.
- Hey, don't punch me.

42
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,170
I’ve heard that the guy
is really hard to approach.

43
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,660
It’s not that hard.

44
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,170
I even had a meal at Mr. Pakin's place.

45
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,770
I can even bring you to
see him if you want to.

46
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,040
As for this race, I was just
curious how cool it’d be.

47
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,730
But from what I’ve seen so far,
these people look like amateurs.

48
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:46,130
I bet I can easily crush them.

49
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,620
Do you wanna race with my friend?

50
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,400
We’ve finally met, Payu’s little boy.

51
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,180
There’s no need to be on guard.
My name’s Prapai.

52
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,500
You can call me P’ Pai.
I’m Payu’s friend.

53
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,730
I’ve got something to ask.

54
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,240
Last time you came here…

55
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,540
- With your friend, right?
- My friend's over there.

56
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,840
Please do him a favor.

57
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,220
Nobody’s willing to race with him today.

58
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,370
Since you’re new here and
don’t know who to race with…

59
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,050
Why don’t you race with him?

60
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,780
He’ll be able to test the road too.
It’s a win-win situation.

61
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,820
First time here?
Wanna race with me?

62
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,340
Sure.

63
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,260
This way, please.

64
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,960
Why are you smiling like that?

65
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,070
I’m proud of myself for
being such a good guy.

66
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,300
I condescended to
teach an asshole a lesson.

67
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,810
Pai’s currently the number one racer here.

68
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,150
Fuck, it's you!

69
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:36,560
I thought you were a big shot.
But you’re just a lowly mechanic.

70
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,980
Someone like you dared
to teach me a lesson?

71
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,880
Do you know the golden rule
is to never mention it in public?

72
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,670
You're here to pick a bike?

73
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,690
- Hey!
- Come on, don’t fight.

74
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,700
We should compete on the road instead.

75
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,430
Don’t you agree?

76
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,790
You don’t wanna get into trouble
for fighting with a mechanic, right?

77
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,460
Did you fucking cheat?

78
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,550
Well?

79
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,850
Wanna see the proof?

80
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,760
But that's unnecessary.
You can just ask the spectators.

81
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,830
Besides, I didn’t win narrowly.

82
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,780
It’s a landslide victory.

83
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,530
If it’s not your doing…

84
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,900
Then it’s gotta be you!

85
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,130
You chose it yourself.

86
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,330
You fucking gave me a shitty bike.

87
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,570
I lost because of you and your shitty bike.

88
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,510
You fucking chose it.

89
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,090
You must’ve pulled dirty tricks on me.
How the hell could I lose?

90
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,930
Because you’re incompetent.

91
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,250
Why don’t you go home
if you wanna throw a tantrum?

92
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,420
If you’re the real deal,
prove it with your skills.

93
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,710
Not bellowing that you’re the best!

94
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,390
- It’s pathetic.
- Pathetic, huh?

95
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,120
No violence allowed in this race.

96
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,640
Why don’t you just fuck off?
Fucking lackey.

97
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,580
You’d better leave while
I’m being nice to you.

98
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,940
Fine, I don’t wanna stay
here any fucking longer.

99
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,050
This race’s a fucking piece of shit.

100
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,540
Just you wait, I’ll tell
your boss to fire all of you.

101
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,060
Take this bike away first.

102
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,380
- I’ll check it after the race.
- Yes.

103
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,110
P’ Payu.

104
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,540
Are you okay?

105
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,130
That should be my question.

106
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,810
Are you okay?

107
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,610
You look mad.

108
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,150
I almost punched that bastard.

109
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,920
Because what he said to you
and did to the bike?

110
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,990
I don’t mind being called a mechanic.

111
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,780
It’s not an insult to me.

112
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,650
I’m proud of what I do.

113
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,880
But what he did to the bike…

114
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,920
Yes, I’m mad.

115
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,290
But you did a great job enduring it.

116
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,950
Isn't my boyfriend so cool?

117
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,100
Please smile.
You’re scaring your darling.

118
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,030
Don’t scowl.

119
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,570
Your darling’s gonna cry.

120
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,650
Okay?

121
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,880
You finally smile.

122
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,220
So you like it when I
address myself as your darling.

123
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,960
Since you like it, you
should brighten up now.

124
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,570
You don’t want your darling
to shake in fear, do you?

125
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,440
Okay?

126
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,440
Has my darling ever
been scared of this hubby?

127
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,710
Yes.

128
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,350
Because you’re so strict.

129
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,610
Because you’re disobedient.

130
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,560
I’m not.

131
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,610
If I’m disobedient, would
I let you hug and kiss me?

132
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,080
I haven’t kissed you yet.

133
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,470
Thank you.

134
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,270
You do things slowly sometimes.

135
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,760
Alright, let’s wrap up and go home.

136
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,410
- Let’s go home.
- Good night, get home safe.

137
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,950
Good night, see you later.

138
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,610
Sorry for making you work on the weekend.

139
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,450
It’s okay, just compensate
me with year-end bonus.

140
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,180
Damn, you bet I’m gonna give it to you.

141
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,770
Come on then.

142
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm hanging out at the garage.

143
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,630
Oh, somebody’s in love.

144
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,880
The ladies are gonna be
heartbroken if they see you now.

145
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,960
It’s cloudy today. The weather’s
been unpredictable lately.

146
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,840
- P’ Mhok, I’ll be going first.
- Oh, okay.

147
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,740
See you.

148
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,310
Why is he in such hurry?

149
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,670
It’s done.

150
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,349
Your wage.

151
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,530
Just this?

152
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,050
You only typed a few pages of document.
What else do you want?

153
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,470
I’d been typing for four hours.

154
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,270
Whether it’s hours or
minutes, isn’t it your duty?

155
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,970
When has it become my duty?

156
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,870
P’ Nui said many people took
sick leave today, so I decided to help.

157
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,340
Hey, there are people around.

158
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,690
Oh?

159
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,270
Aren’t I right? It’s your duty anyway.

160
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,430
As the garage owner’s boyfriend.

161
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,160
This way, the money won’t leak.

162
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,140
Bummer, I thought you
were gonna kiss my lips.

163
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,440
Don’t dare me.

164
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,130
Payu, here you are.

165
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,590
That fucker challenges you to a race.

166
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,790
What fucker?

167
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,800
The fucker who spat on your bike.

168
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,850
What did he say?

169
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,570
I called your mom and told
her you’d be staying over.

170
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,670
- P’ Payu.
- No.

171
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,600
But I haven’t said anything.

172
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,810
You’re gonna stop me from racing, right?

173
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,880
P’ Saifha said that man’s gonna cheat.

174
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,650
He said he'd bring his own bike.

175
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,930
I don’t know much about bikes,
but he’ll definitely cheat.

176
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,110
Even P’ Saifha doesn’t want
you to accept the challenge.

177
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,910
I’m being serious now.

178
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,400
And you think I’m not?

179
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,120
Well?

180
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,560
Do you really think I’m not being serious?

181
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,100
Okay, fine.

182
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,120
I know I won’t gain anything
from accepting the challenge.

183
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,070
But in some matters, actions
can’t be explained with reasons.

184
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,410
Then you’ve got to promise me.

185
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,910
Don’t crash the bike.
Don’t go to hospital.

186
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,460
Don’t get your limbs broken.
Every part of your body must be intact.

187
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,220
And don’t…

188
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,930
I'm gonna have a bike race.

189
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,960
Not going to war.

190
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,770
Rain.

191
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,010
Do you remember what I said?

192
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,010
I said you’re enviable.

193
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:16,940
You’ll see how enviable you
are to have a boyfriend like me.

194
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,790
Just wait and see.

195
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,780
Isn't my boyfriend narcissistic?

196
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,430
Don’t worry about me.

197
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,160
Worried about Payu?

198
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,900
Don’t worry about him.

199
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,600
He’s capable to do anything
if he sets his mind to it.

200
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,720
By the way, why are you here?

201
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,300
How could I miss the fun?

202
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,910
I’ve only seen him during
tryouts, never in real race.

203
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,940
I’d be stupid if I miss it.

204
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,820
Besides, isn’t this happening
because of you and me?

205
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,740
You raced with the guy.
Who do you think is gonna win?

206
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,790
It’s true I’ve only known
Payu for a few years.

207
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,950
But ever since I met him,
there’s one thing I’m sure of.

208
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,550
Payu won’t do things
he thinks he can’t do.

209
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,750
And there’s nothing he can’t do.

210
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,210
You really think so, P’ Pai?

211
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,600
Who do you think is gonna win, Rain?

212
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,430
P’ Payu never loses
and won’t lose to anyone.

213
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,040
Are you worried?

214
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,310
I’ll definitely win.

215
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,520
But I saw him lost once.

216
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,090
Yeah, me too.

217
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,060
Your suit’s so cool!

218
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,930
Just the suit?

219
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,440
Yeah, just the suit.

220
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,320
You tousled my hair.

221
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,370
But the suit’s really cool.

222
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,220
I look cool when I put it on.

223
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,440
Wanna see me when I take it off?

224
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,050
I’m starting to want you
to rip this suit off me.

225
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
What?

226
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,600
Put them on for me.

227
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,160
One minute you wanna take it off,
the next you wanna put it on.

228
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,660
You’re so hard to please.

229
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,790
Am I really hard to please?

230
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,400
So this is your cup of tea, huh?

231
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,210
Aren’t you gonna run
and hide under car hood?

232
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,460
Or you prefer to...

233
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,660
Hide between legs?

234
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,880
Fuck you.

235
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,690
Do you know why you lost to my friend?

236
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,240
'Cause you can't do anything but bark.

237
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,310
Calm down.
Don’t you wanna race?

238
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,260
Just you wait, I’ll show you who’s the dog.

239
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,490
You can beat him.

240
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,460
You must make him
crawl in defeat like a dog.

241
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,930
Someone like him doesn’t stand
a chance against my P’ Payu.

242
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,850
Not even in his next 10 lives.

243
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,470
Why are you smiling?

244
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,830
I’m gonna win.

245
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,470
I promise.

246
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,150
Don’t worry about him.

247
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,650
He’s capable to do anything
if he sets his mind to it.

248
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,460
Payu won’t do things he thinks he can’t do.

249
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,690
You'll see how enviable you are
to have a boyfriend like me.

250
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,220
Just wait and see.

251
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,080
I fulfilled my promise.

252
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,670
Hey!

253
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,370
Where the hell are you going?

254
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,940
I haven't lost yet!

255
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,980
You like this suit?

256
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,480
I like the one wearing it too.

257
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,970
Go ahead, P’ Payu.

258
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,670
Do me.

259
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,950
What a tease.

260
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,020
P' Payu.

261
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:15,320
You said you’re happy
when you’re with bikes, right?

262
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:22,940
But I’m happier to spend
a moment like this with you.

263
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,340
This is also...

264
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,240
Riding.

265
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,390
I'll train you to be...

266
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,050
The best rider.

267
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,640
So good.

268
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,980
You like it?

269
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,890
Yes.

270
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,170
Will you wear race suits again?

271
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,130
You like it?

272
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,350
I’ve just realized it.

273
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,450
Then I’ll prepare a doctor uniform.

274
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,850
A pilot uniform.

275
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,030
And mechanic overalls.
Okay?

276
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,800
You’re crazy, I don’t
have that kind of kink.

277
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,710
But it sounds like a good idea.

278
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,360
You’re feeling better now?

279
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,699
I’ve been better since you
kissed me on the racetrack.

280
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,900
Will you race again?

281
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,929
No.

282
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,750
I like bikes, but I don’t like to race.

283
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,840
I like engine sounds, but it
doesn’t mean I’ve got to ride.

284
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,449
Just like when I build a house.
I don’t have to live in it.

285
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,159
That’s why you chose this field of study?

286
00:34:56,139 --> 00:35:00,050
When I was a kid, my mom
often complained about my dad.

287
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,040
He could furbish bikes beautifully.

288
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,760
But he couldn’t furbish his own home.

289
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,780
So I had this idea.

290
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,900
‘I’m gonna build cool bikes
and beautiful houses.’

291
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,020
It’s turned out to be very exhausting.

292
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,450
But I couldn’t give any of them up.

293
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,720
So where are your parents now?

294
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,880
They’ve moved to Korat.

295
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,200
Sleep if you’re sleepy.

296
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,380
Yeah, I’m sleepy.

297
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,970
But I wanna keep listening.

298
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,990
Do you know why?

299
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,390
'Cause you wanna know more about me.

300
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,980
Just like how I want you...

301
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,300
To know more about me.

302
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,300
About my world.

303
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,420
And myself.

304
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,750
Does this mean I like you, P’ Payu?

305
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,020
What do you think?

306
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,970
I like you.

307
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,500
It’s more than like.

308
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,440
Actually…

309
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,240
It’s been more than like for a while now.

310
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,740
Me too.

311
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,140
Sweet dreams.

312
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,700
This is what I call
seducing with a costume.

313
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,050
Someone accused me of seducing him.

314
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,120
So I decided to do it for real.

315
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,520
Well? Does it work?

316
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,090
If you’re trying to seduce me,
be more daring.

317
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,900
I won’t get it up this way.

318
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,110
This is what I call rude.

319
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,400
Looks tasty.

320
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,220
By the way, P’ Pakin was
there to watch the race too.

321
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:55,030
I just found out after
reading Saifha’s text.

322
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,180
That guy will be banned from
every event related to P’ Pakin.

323
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,590
So it’s over now?

324
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,170
When are you coming home today?

325
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,160
Why? You wanna have dinner with me?

326
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,550
Yeah.

327
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,380
Eat slowly or you’ll choke.

328
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,040
You don’t need to eat that fast.

329
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,030
I’ve got fulfil my duty
as a good boyfriend.

330
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,750
Finish breakfast quickly.

331
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,410
Hurry to work.

332
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,220
And hurry back home to you.

333
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,900
Just like lovers.

334
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,520
‘Lovers’ isn’t an accurate definition.

335
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,850
We’re more like a married couple.

336
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,430
You should wash up.
I’m gonna hurry to work.

337
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,880
Or do you want me to help you?

338
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,540
I don't need your help.

339
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,340
I’ll come home early.

340
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,570
I know that.

341
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,530
P’ Payu.

342
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,640
Please come home early.
Your darling’s waiting.

343
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,820
Wait and see how I’m
gonna deal with you.

344
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,220
P’ Payu said he could eat anything.
But will he like these foods?

345
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,050
Package delivery?

346
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,050
There’s a package for Mr. Payu.

347
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,190
I’ll receive it for him.

348
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,990
It’s a big package.
Can you help me carry it?

349
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,410
Help! Help!

350
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,280
P’ Payu! Help!

351
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,940
Let me go! Let go!

352
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,840
How did it get so dirty in one semester?

353
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,930
Because you forbade me from
touching everything in your room.

354
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,010
So it’s gotten unbearably dirty.

355
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,940
Use your holiday break to clean up.
Throw away the stuff you don’t need.

356
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:30,900
Yes.

357
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,890
Where have I seen it before?

358
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,270
What a coincidence.

359
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,750
I keep seeing ‘storm’ everywhere I go.

360
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:19,910
Wait…

361
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,620

362
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,300
What do I want?

363
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,540
I want you to come crawling to me.
