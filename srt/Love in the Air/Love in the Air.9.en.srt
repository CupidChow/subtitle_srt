1
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,560
Brace yourself, I’m gonna pursue you.

2
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,320
It’s because I already tried
that I don’t want you.

3
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,920
Couldn’t I get you hooked at all?

4
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,720
A handsome guy driving a luxury car asked
me to give you this sunflower bouquet.

5
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,480
You’ve got to end up in
the trashcan because of your owner.

6
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,240
Your coffee, Ms. Phan.

7
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,440
Thank you.

8
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,440
It’s weekend but you’re up so early.
Let me guess.

9
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
Is it a guy or a girl
this time, Big Brother?

10
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,520
A guy.
A very cute one too.

11
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,920
Is he cuter than me?

12
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,440
Tough question.
I never think you’re cute.

13
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,240
Hey, how could you say that
to your gorgeously cute brother?

14
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,440
Wow, how confident.

15
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,080
Or do you think you’re unattractive?

16
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,400
I didn’t say that.

17
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
Unbelievable.

18
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,000
Plerng.

19
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,040
Yes?

20
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,079
Nong Plerng.

21
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,800
- Are you shy when I call you this?
- If it’s you, no.

22
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,760
But if it’s a hunk who’s an animal in bed…

23
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Then I frickin’ love it.

24
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,520
Hold on.
Aren’t I one as well?

25
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,240
Alright, I’d better go.

26
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,640
It’s obvious who we take after.

27
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,840
‘Cause he's the one who raised us.

28
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,880
We’re such gossipers.

29
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,840
Guess it’s time for grocery shopping.

30
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,520
No.

31
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,120
Must be my imagination.

32
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Good morning, Nong Sky.

33
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,080
What a mean boy.
How could you walk away after seeing me?

34
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,320
If you want your flowers back,
I already threw them away.

35
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,640
So you threw my flowers away.

36
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,280
P’ Joy must’ve picked them up.

37
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,120
Wasn’t it a soft-hearted boy who
sought a home for the poor flowers?

38
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,080
But I don’t think that
boy is you, Nong Sky.

39
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,360
'Cause you threw them away.

40
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:43,440
If the sunflowers could talk, they’d
surely say ‘Meanie. Meanie. Meanine.’

41
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,520
She must’ve been bribed.

42
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,640
Are you done?

43
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,680
No.

44
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,960
I’m here to get to know you
better, but I haven’t learned a thing.

45
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,400
I haven’t even figured out your eyes
color even though I’m standing here.

46
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,520
Are you color blind?

47
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,520
No, but love makes me blind.

48
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,160
I love you, Sky.

49
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,400
Sky?

50
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,640
Are you done?

51
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,800
Are you alright?

52
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,040
I'm fine.

53
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,159
But I won’t be ‘cause you
keep me from buying breakfast.

54
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,920
What a coincidence!
I’m hungry too.

55
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,680
Let’s have breakfast together.

56
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,440
- So thick.
- Yes, I’ve got thick hands.

57
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,120
I mean your face!

58
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,560
Not only my face.

59
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,920
My chest and shoulders are thick too.
Wanna cuddle?

60
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,800
I guarantee that you’ll like it.

61
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,800
You’re really thick-skinned!

62
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,800
Don’t you know fortune
favors the thick-skinned?

63
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,920
Since I want you in my arms...

64
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,800
Why would I stay timid?

65
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,840
Come on, let’s have breakfast.

66
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,400
Come on.

67
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,400
Hurry up.

68
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,320
Could You Be the Wind That Passes By?

69
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,320
I’ve got nothing for you to look at.

70
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
I beg to differ.

71
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,200
Pretty eyes, beautiful nose, soft cheeks.

72
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,320
And your lips are…

73
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,280
Very sweet.

74
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,720
- Ouch!
- It hurts, right?

75
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,120
Do you wanna lose your legs?

76
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,960
I still need them for bike riding.

77
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,240
How about…

78
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,159
Seriously, can’t I make you shy at all?

79
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,560
You’re hurting my self-esteem.

80
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,280
I see that your self-esteem’s still fine.
And don’t force yourself to praise me.

81
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,080
I know I’m different
from what you described.

82
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,240
I’m not forcing myself.

83
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,520
I like your messy bed hair.

84
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
Though you’ve got sleepy eyes.

85
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,040
Wearing worn-out shirt.

86
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,200
And flip-flops.

87
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,960
I still think you’re cute.

88
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,160
And most importantly…

89
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,320
It's my first time going on a date
with someone so down-to-earth.

90
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,440
And your piercings...

91
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,320
I like them too.

92
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,120
You're blushing.

93
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,160
Won’t you really tell me
when you did the piercing?

94
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,560
And I wanna know why you took them out.

95
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,280
Okay, since you don’t
wanna talk to me, then I'll talk.

96
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,200
My name is Prapai.
I think you already know this.

97
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,360
I’m the oldest of three siblings.
One brother, one sister.

98
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,240
I completed bachelor’s and
master’s degrees in England.

99
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,360
Before I could take
a break after graduation...

100
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
My father ordered me
to help with the company.

101
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,000
- I don’t wanna know.
- But I wanna tell you.

102
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,640
- I don’t wanna listen.
- I wanna tell you.

103
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,200
I want the one I like to know about me.
And I wanna know about the one I like too.

104
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
I’m full.

105
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
I don’t know why you’re attracted to me.

106
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,920
But if you’re looking for a sex buddy or
an FWB, you’ve come to the wrong guy.

107
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,520
I slept with you that night
out of necessity.

108
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,440
And I won't do it for a second time.

109
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,560
What a bad boy.
You pounce and bounce?

110
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,840
No matter how hard you try to seduce
or annoy me, the answer’s still the same.

111
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,200
Leave me alone.

112
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,240
What if I’m serious?

113
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
What if I don’t want just an FWB?

114
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
No.

115
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,160
A guy like you won’t
commit yourself to anyone.

116
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,360
You just enjoy seeing me refuse you.

117
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,920
I’ve said everything.

118
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,880
From now on, don’t waste
your time with me anymore.

119
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,760
Payu, is Rain with you?

120
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,360
Okay, wait there.
There’s something I must find out.

121
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,280
A widespread cold front is expected.

122
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,400
With strong winds and
temperature drop in some areas.

123
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,400
Caution: Please take care of your health.

124
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,640
We’ve been getting many weather
reports from our listeners today.

125
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,440
Looks like it’s raining in
many areas of Bangkok.

126
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Please stay away from
rain and strong winds.

127
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,000
Now let’s move on to the next song.

128
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,760
Why didn’t you tell me
that P’ Pai’s pursuing you?

129
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,800
‘Cause you didn’t ask.

130
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,760
But you should’ve told me.

131
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,240
I don’t like him, so I didn’t tell you.
Why are you upset with me?

132
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,040
When I told you about my relationship
with P’ Payu, why didn’t you tell me…

133
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,560
That you like men?

134
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
When I came clean about P’ Payu...

135
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,280
I was really afraid that you’d shun me.

136
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,320
I told you I’m not your mom.
I’m fine with whoever you date.

137
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,080
And I don’t think it’s important
whether I like men or women.

138
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,000
Put that aside.

139
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,480
So don’t you like P’ Pai at all?

140
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,320
P' Pai’s kind, funny, and hot.

141
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,680
Though not as hot as my P’ Payu.

142
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,240
No, and I don't think he’s hot.

143
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,520
Don’t you dare take bribes or egg me on.

144
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,040
Hey.

145
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,680
You still can’t get over your ex?

146
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,160
You said you found out
about the race from your ex.

147
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,800
Which means...

148
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,280
P’ Payu knows him, right?

149
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,520
If you’re still my friend, never
mention that son of a bitch again!

150
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Got it?

151
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,680
To Sky, A present for
you when I’m absent.

152
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,760
Don’t skip your meals. Take care.
From Prapai.

153
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,040
Rain.

154
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
I’ll never like your boyfriend’s friend.

155
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,520
Even if it’s not him...

156
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,720
I won’t like anyone.

157
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,000
No!

158
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,120
Relax, Sky.

159
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,120
It’s just a dream.

160
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
It’s okay.

161
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
It’s okay.

162
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,839
It’s okay.

163
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
It’s okay.

164
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,359
I’ll be out of town for work for a week.

165
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,800
Don’t forget to miss me while I’m away.

166
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,640
I’m not your parents.

167
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,280
Why would you tell me this?

168
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,280
Are you crazy, Sky?

169
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,400
Psycho!!
Block Number

170
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,560
Block

171
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,720
This is for the best.

172
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,160
It will pass.

173
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:34,840
P’ Pai, you’re telling me that Sky,
my friend, used to date a guy?

174
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,640
You didn’t know about it?

175
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,840
Then you don’t know that
I’m pursuing Nong Sky.

176
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,400
Then you definitely don’t
know about what I wanna ask.

177
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,600
It’s okay.

178
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,720
I’ll find out myself.

179
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,200
P’ Payu, your friend’s pursuing my friend.
Do something.

180
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,880
So you’re really not gonna reply.

181
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,440
Why did he have such an expression?

182
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
Sky?

183
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,760
- Are you done?
- Are you alright?

184
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,040
I'm fine.

185
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Why am I thinking so much about him?

186
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,400
Didn’t you say you’d be out of town?

187
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,960
Oh, I haven’t left yet,
but you already miss me?

188
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,440
- You think that’s funny?
- Not quite.

189
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,800
I just wanted to see you
before I go to work.

190
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,680
But I'm cool with it if you're happy.

191
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,640
I bought them for you.

192
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,600
Why did you do that?

193
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,600
So that I'd have an excuse...

194
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,160
To see you before I go.

195
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,840
This shop’s very famous.
I had to queue up since 5 a.m.

196
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,680
- I didn’t ask you to do it.
- But I wanted to.

197
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,640
In case my effort makes a
certain boy sympathize with me.

198
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,920
- I told you that it’s…
- It’s impossible.

199
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,400
I know that.

200
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,960
But I’m the type of guy
that likes challenges.

201
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,720
Today, I'm here to tell you.

202
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,040
That I won’t give up.

203
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,680
See you next week.
I’d better go or I’ll miss the flight.

204
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,360
Sky, are you okay?
You’re very pale.

205
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,920
Didn’t get much sleep.

206
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,560
Don’t worry, I’ll get better.

207
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,640
- You sure?
- Yeah.

208
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,240
You’d better not lie to us.

209
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,360
- Just tell me if you feel sick.
- Yeah.

210
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,880
You’re just afraid no one’ll help
you with the orientation activities.

211
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,640
- How could you say that?
- Yeah.

212
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,960
I can be worried about my friends too.

213
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,840
But you’re right.
I can’t do it alone.

214
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,640
Yeah, I’ll get better.

215
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,120
Okay.

216
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,080
- Come sit.
- Show me your smile.

217
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,400
Come on, take a seat.

218
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,960
Sky, help me.
The teacher rejected my design again.

219
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,040
Which part needs to be revised?

220
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,600
This part. It's been rejected again.
Help me revise it.

221
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,880
I think the glasses should
be in the same direction as...

222
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,040
What are you doing?

223
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,960
And you probably need
to raise the roof structure.

224
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,520
‘Cause when it’s too low,
the air above gets too hot.

225
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,960
And the room will get hot too.

226
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,600
Some people come and go.

227
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,640
Everything will get back to normal.

228
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,000
How's the orientation activities?
Have you had dinner?

229
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,400
I'm worried about you.

230
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,080
Sky.

231
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,360
Sky.

232
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,800
Hey.

233
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,200
- Take a look at this for me.
- Okay.

234
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,040
You look distracted.

235
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,720
It’s okay.

236
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,800
You know you’ll get through this.

237
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,040
Ignore the voice in your heart.
Only listen to your head.

238
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,520
Sig, Sig, wake up.

239
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,040
The juniors have called us.
We must attend the meeting now.

240
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,160
Get up now. Hurry up.
You need to wake up.

241
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,800
Did you get any sleep?

242
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
No.

243
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,960
Then get some sleep.
I’ll go first and you can go later.

244
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,720
So you’re saying you can
remember what the seniors say...

245
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,040
And explain them to the classmates.

246
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,240
No, I’m gonna make a mistake
if you don’t come with me.

247
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,000
Want me to go instead?

248
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,280
Just get some sleep.
You barely slept last night.

249
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Okay.

250
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,600
Rain.

251
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,440
Let me borrow your car.
I’ll let Sig drive.

252
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,920
The key’s over there.
Take it.

253
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,960
Thanks.

254
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,360
Here, take the key.

255
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,560
Don’t forget to turn off the air con.
Electricity bills are pricey.

256
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,320
- Why did you wake me up so early?
- To help me deliver documents.

257
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,080
We need a permission to use premises too.

258
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
Sky.

259
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,440
P’ Som, Sawasdee krub.

260
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,640
I’ve been looking for you.

261
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,920
How did you guys teach the freshmen?

262
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,000
They’re so disrespectful to the seniors.

263
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,840
I don’t mind if they don’t greet me.

264
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,280
But they almost bumped against me.

265
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,680
Good thing they didn’t step on my head.

266
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,040
And they didn’t even apologize.

267
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,040
You did a fucking lousy job teaching them.

268
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,040
Calm down, P’ Som.

269
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:54,360
You’ve got small body and baby face,
so they probably misunderstood.

270
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,400
- Sig!
- Yes, I’m the good old Sig.

271
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,560
And I think you’re taking it out on Sky.

272
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,320
You’re really asking for it.

273
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,120
I’m not asking for it,
but I'm asking for...

274
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,400
A kiss on my cheek.

275
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,960
On the left and the right.
Or maybe the forehead?

276
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,160
How ‘bout it?

277
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
What’s wrong with him?

278
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,080
Don’t take it to heart.
He’s heartbroken over P’ Payu.

279
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,760
And you’re Rain’s close friend.
So he’s taking it out on you.

280
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,440
- I’ll go piss him off again.
- Okay.

281
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,640
- See you.
- See you.

282
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,800
P’ Som, please wait for me!
You can vent to me.

283
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,840
I’m the sophomore rep.
You can count on me.

284
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,880
Why is this happening to me?

285
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,640
It’s okay, Sky.

286
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,000
It’s not a big deal.

287
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
No.

288
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,800
Please stop.

289
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,560
Help!

290
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,360
It’s okay, Sky.

291
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,280
It’s okay.

292
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,760
It will pass.

293
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
You’re gonna be okay.

294
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
You’re gonna be okay.

295
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,960
Stop texting me!

296
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,400
Leave me alone!

297
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,760
Don’t come into my life!

298
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,360
I don’t need anyone anymore.

299
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,200
Please stop.

300
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,480
I’ve had enough.

301
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,960
Stop! Stop texting me.
Stop calling me.

302
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,800
Leave me alone.

303
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,840
You should’ve seen the look on
P’ Som’s face when I kissed his cheek.

304
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,240
He was shocked.

305
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,600
When he realized it, he was so angry
that he chased me around the campus.

306
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,520
You’re laughing ‘cause you
didn’t go through what I did

307
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,920
Whenever he saw me,
he looked like I’d just killed his dad.

308
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,640
- How?
- Like this.

309
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,160
That’s totally P’ Som.

310
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,120
Come on, you already snatched P’ Payu.

311
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Be understanding towards
the guy who’s jealous of you.

312
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,560
- That’s right.
- Yeah.

313
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,200
Stop being petty.

314
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,680
But he looked funny earlier.

315
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,040
Man up and threaten him back like this.

316
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,360
I’ll do it next time.

317
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,880
- Hey, Sky.
- Hi, Sky.

318
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,120
Hey, are you okay?

319
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,960
Shit, you’re burning up!

320
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,200
I’m fine, I already took the meds.

321
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,680
Are you sure?

322
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,960
- I don’t think he’s fine.
- Me neither.

323
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,520
- Sky!
- Sky!

324
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,640
- Shit, why is your body so hot?
- It’s burning hot.

325
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,280
I’ve never missed my office this much.

326
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,760
If you miss your office...

327
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,760
Then please do the work that’s
piled up while you were away.

328
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,280
You’ve really got no sense of humor.

329
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,640
Yes, I have no sense of humor.

330
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,960
And I think that these SIM cards
slow down your work progress.

331
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,440
Come on.

332
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,520
My old number’s been blocked,
so I’ve got to keep changing.

333
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,640
But...

334
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,480
This number hasn’t been blocked.
See? He read my texts too.

335
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,800
Might as well call him
to listen to his voice.

336
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,720
Since you’ve worked
hard for the whole week...

337
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
I’ll push back your today’s schedule.

338
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,360
Hello, you finally answered my call.

339
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,280
P’ Pai, Sky’s very sick.
Come to the hospital now.

340
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,200
What?
Where are you?

341
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
I'll be there right away.

342
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,640
Sky collapsed in the classroom.
He was burning up.

343
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,000
Good thing we were calm enough
to take him to the hospital.

344
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,520
Which hospital?
I'll meet you there.

345
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,360
No, I'm taking him back to his dorm.

346
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,560
Take good care of him.
I'm on my way.

347
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,640
Hurry up!
The fuck’s wrong with the traffic!

348
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,120
Yeah, Nong Sky.
The fair-skinned boy from room 207.

349
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,200
Let me tell you something juicy.

350
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,520
A guy sent him a bouquet,
but that’s not the end of the story.

351
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,960
He didn’t come this week
but ordered foods for Nong sky.

352
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,160
And I’m the one who
hung them on his doorknob.

353
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,760
What else could I do?
Nong Pai asked me to support him.

354
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,160
He’s so hot, and I’ve got
a soft spot for hot guys.

355
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,720
Oh, Nong…

356
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,320
Girl, I think something’s happening.
I’m gonna take a look.

357
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,880
P’ Pai.

358
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,760
Where’s Sky?

359
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,239
Hold on! Hold on!
We need to talk.

360
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,520
Sky’s sleeping now.

361
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,280
Listen to me.

362
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,880
The thing is, he should’ve been
admitted to the hospital, but he refused.

363
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,400
So the doctor gave him an IV.

364
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:39,800
I wanna take care of him myself,
but I left my work at P’ Payu’s home.

365
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,120
I won’t be able to finish it
if I travel back and forth.

366
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,040
I couldn’t contact his parents.

367
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,960
His mom’s abroad and his dad’s in Lopburi.

368
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,520
Therefore…

369
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,160
I can trust you, right?

370
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,560
Of course.

371
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,640
I promise I won’t do
anything to your friend.

372
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,640
I’m leaving him in your care.

373
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,440
And call me if he wakes up.

374
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Okay.

375
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,640
Who says it’s just sex?

376
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,880
If so, then why am I so worried about you?

377
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,240
I’m even surprised at myself.

378
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,760
Please don’t go.

379
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,640
I’m right here.
I’m not going anywhere.

380
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,440
Let me go first.
I’ll wipe your body.

381
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,280
Don’t go. Don’t go.

382
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,920
Now I’m curious.

383
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,520
Who’s the bastard you’re thinking
of so much that you won’t let me go?

384
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,440
Dad.

385
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
Seriously?

386
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,840
Which part should I laugh at first?

387
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,680
The part where you mistook me for your dad?

388
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,880
Or the part where I called my
boyfriend-to-be’s dad a bastard?

389
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,360
You’ve made me flustered.

390
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,600
Want me to hug you tighter?

391
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,600
Want me to stroke your hair?

392
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,640
Want me to kiss you?

393
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,320
I won’t bully you.

394
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,640
But why are you so cute
even when you’re sick?

395
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,600
Why do your eyes cry for help all the time?

396
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,400
How can I help you?

397
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,560
I’ve never taken cared
of my siblings like this.

398
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,680
Can’t believe I changed a bedsheet
and wiped a sick person’s body.

399
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,480
You might think I only want sex.

400
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,000
But I swear I’ve never taken care
such good care of anyone in my life.

401
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,440
No, I made a promise to Rain.

402
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,160
Alright.

403
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,040
Let's wash them now.

404
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,160
Aren't you really gonna reply, Sky?

405
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,720
Ignore me all you want.

406
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,200
But I won't let you go.

407
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Sky.

408
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
Sky.

409
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,200
Is it too curt?

410
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,440
Sky krub.

411
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,400
Nong Sky krub.

412
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,760
Something's missing.

413
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,000
Nong Sky krub.

414
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,240
Nong Sky krub.

415
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,600
That's more like it.

416
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,040
English Subtitle by Saowalak K.

417
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,400
I'll never let anyone hurt you.

418
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Relax.

419
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,240
P' Pai, don't let me go.
I'm begging you.

420
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,880
Worse than pounce and pounce is being
kicked out after I’m no longer beneficial.

421
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,920
Get some rest.

422
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,800
I'll wake you up later
to eat and take meds.

423
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,720
I don't like owing anyone.

424
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,400
I've never given in to
anyone like this in my life.
