1
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,039
Hey!

2
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,759
Thank you, Mr. Payu.

3
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,120
How dare you slap me!

4
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,680
You keep calling me stupid!

5
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,120
I’ll make you so head over heels with me
that you won’t call me stupid ever again.

6
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,440
You look happy today, Big Boss.

7
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,039
A little.

8
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,800
I see that the same goes for you.

9
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,000
Something good happened.

10
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,759
It’s all thanks to you.

11
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,040
The weather looks nice today.

12
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,560
Perfect for a race.

13
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,320
What’s gotten into him?

14
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,000
I’m still waiting, Rain.

15
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,680
I Like Rain
And I’m Not Talking about the Weather

16
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,079
30 days consist of four weeks.
Two days have passed.

17
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,560
I have full-day classes on
this day, this day, and this day.

18
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,840
Assignment deadlines
on this day and this day.

19
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,079
Quizzes on this day and this day.
And finals too.

20
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,480
Not to mention that I need to find time
to do homeworks and sleep as well.

21
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,280
How many days do I have left?

22
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,360
Have you gone full-blown crazy?

23
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,320
Right, how was that day?

24
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,320
I’m fine, but you’re not.
So why were you whining?

25
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,800
Sky.

26
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,960
You'll help me, right?

27
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,360
With what?

28
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,720
Here’s the thing.

29
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,960
I must make someone fall for me in 30 days.

30
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,440
Him?

31
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,120
You’ve moved on from Ple to a guy?

32
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,360
Step 1: Show up in front of him every day.

33
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,959
That’s it?

34
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,880
Yeah, that’s it.

35
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,880
Let’s see first if you
can pass this step.

36
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,120
Will it work?

37
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,880
Fortune favors the bold,
ever heard of it?

38
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,440
Fortune favors the bold.

39
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,320
There's only one way.

40
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,960
I'm always bold anyway.

41
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,680
I'll definitely make him fall for me.
Piece of cake.

42
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,920
- What are they doing?
- Dunno.

43
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,200
- Por.
- What?

44
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,800
What’s the word on the blackboard?

45
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,360
'Miss-i-on', what does it mean?

46
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,520
Sig, I can't believe you're so stupid.

47
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,080
It’s pronounced ‘Mis-si-on’.

48
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,320
- 'Mis-si-on'?
- Yeah.

49
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,400
- You sure?
- Take a better look.

50
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,920
- You’re right. It’s really ‘Mis-si-on’.
- Told you.

51
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,640
Come on, let’s sign up
for an English course.

52
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, count me in.

53
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,560
Oh hi, is P’ Payu here?

54
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,600
He’s not coming today.
You wasted your trip.

55
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,960
It’s you, Mr. Payu’s boy.
Here to see Mr. Payu?

56
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,480
Yes, I’m here to see him.
I see his bike.

57
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,920
Oh, that one?
Yes, it’s Mr. Payu’s bike.

58
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,600
But he rode off on another one.
I’m so sorry.

59
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,040
P’ Payu.

60
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,159
Hello.

61
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,120
P’ Payu.

62
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,800
Oh, it’s you.

63
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,920
Everyone’s been saying
that you’re Payu’s boy.

64
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,920
No, I’m not his boy.

65
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,200
But...

66
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,840
Why are you in this outift?

67
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,920
P’ Aon said only the owner wears
a coverall with the logo on the back.

68
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,800
Oh.

69
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,880
I’m the owner.

70
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,720
You thought I was Payu?

71
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,560
I’m his twin.

72
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,920
Older twin’s not here today.
There’s only the younger twin.

73
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,720
How’s it coming along?
Your mission to seduce a guy.

74
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,720
I haven’t even seen his face.

75
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,920
That’s why I told you to
get through step one first...

76
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,640
Before thinking about step two,
step three, step four.

77
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,680
Sky, what should I do?

78
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,760
Get past step one first.

79
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,640
Besides, look at this.

80
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,920
Finish your work before
you don’t have any to submit.

81
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,640
There’s an easier way to see me.
Think carefully.

82
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,360
I gotta go.

83
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,560
Do you know what he means?

84
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,040
It’s a clue.

85
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,920
A clue?

86
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,320
Clue No.1.

87
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,240
Some people prefer to get a call.

88
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Clue No.2: some people
have a soft spot for polite kids.

89
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,320
Clue No.3: someone will have his
pay cut if he doesn’t start working now.

90
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,760
I gotta go.

91
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,800
Huh?

92
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,800
The heck?

93
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,400
Don’t tell me.

94
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,320
Umm... P’ Payu, it’s Rain.

95
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,560
Where are you?

96
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
Hello, P’ Payu?

97
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,760
Say something, man.

98
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,720
I’ve called you like you wanted.
What else do you want?

99
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,520
Don’t tell me.

100
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,440
P’ Payu, I've come to
the garage to see you.

101
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,600
Where are you?

102
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,400
Can we meet…

103
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,040
Please?

104
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,840
Finally.
Wait there, I’ll go to you.

105
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,000
Hey, don’t tell me the mission's complete.

106
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
See, Sky?
I told you I could do it.

107
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,640
Step 1: Show up in front of him every day.
There’s only one way.

108
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,120
Step 1: call him.
Step 2: be polite.

109
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,480
You ended up dancing to his tune.
What’s there to be happy about?

110
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,440
Completely Defeated

111
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,040
I admire you.

112
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,600
In my more than 20 years life with Payu…

113
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,520
This is the first time I’ve met
someone who could stand him.

114
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,400
What do you mean, P’ Saifha?

115
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,040
Nobody would wait for
him for a whole day like me.

116
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,960
Let me tell you something, Rain.

117
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,840
You’re not the first.

118
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,920
My twin’s far from simple.

119
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,800
You’ll get burned if you don’t
know how to play with fire.

120
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,640
What's there to be afraid of?

121
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,320
I don’t like him.

122
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,720
And I don’t care if I’m his first or not.

123
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,240
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

124
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,960
Here you are. I’m leaving.

125
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,800
He’s been waiting for two hours.
Be kind to him.

126
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,640
Ant bit your lips?

127
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,800
The fuck it did.

128
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,040
I thought I made it clear
that I hate vulgar language.

129
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,080
I’m sorry.

130
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,240
I’m going home.

131
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
What’s wrong?

132
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
Nothing.

133
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,840
You look tired.
I shouldn't disturb you.

134
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,600
You’re happy with seeing me for
two minutes after waiting for two hours?

135
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,680
You are...

136
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,200
Pretty crazy about me.

137
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,080
I’m different from other people.

138
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,960
Jealous?

139
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,600
You're crazy. I’m not.

140
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,840
- You sure?
- Yeah.

141
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Rain.

142
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,120
If you don’t want me
to be with other people…

143
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,200
Then make me fall in love
until I only have eyes for you.

144
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,400
I’m leaving.

145
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,480
Let go of me.
I said I’m leaving.

146
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,120
I’m hungry.
Go grab some food with me.

147
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,240
I might fall for you faster.

148
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,080
What do you like to eat?

149
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,080
Snooping for info?

150
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,160
Snooping, my foot.
Can’t you see I’m trying to order food?

151
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,360
What do you like to eat?

152
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,160
Since we’re at a porridge shop…

153
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,800
It's gotta be...

154
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,800
Stir-fried water spinach.

155
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,920
And stir-fried preserved radish with egg.

156
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,400
Stir-fried preserved radish with egg.

157
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,400
- Spicy salad?
- Spicy salad!

158
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,400
Spicy salted egg salad.
Wait, change to century eggs.

159
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,640
Ah, okay.

160
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,480
And a bowl of porridge for me.
It’s late.

161
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,480
Afraid to gain weight?

162
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah.

163
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,440
Wait, you haven’t ordered.

164
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Too late for that, stupid boy.

165
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,880
You have a long way to go
before you can snoop for my info.

166
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
You called me stupid again.

167
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,920
What are you looking at?

168
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,880
I’m looking at anyone
who's in front of my eyes.

169
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,280
Rain, I’m curious.

170
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,280
How are you gonna make me fall for you?
I don’t see how you can do it.

171
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,360
Keep your voice down.
People will hear you.

172
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,040
- Come again?
- Keep your voice down.

173
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,360
You’re afraid of other people’s opinions?

174
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,800
It’s not too late to back out.

175
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,560
Don’t speak as if I’m gutless.

176
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,600
It’s obvious, though.

177
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,760
Mister, I’m hitting on this guy.
Please give me your support.

178
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,160
Do your best.

179
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Shit.

180
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,840
Do your best, stupid boy.

181
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,520
Quit it.
This is all because of you.

182
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,760
- Are you shy?
- I'm not.

183
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,640
Then what’s wrong?
Hungry?

184
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,160
Yes.

185
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,000
- Hangry?
- Yeah.

186
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Thank you.

187
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,000
Aren’t you gonna eat?

188
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,000
The plate’s right there.
You’re not using it?

189
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,680
I usually eat from a bowl.

190
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,320
I wanna eat the eggs.
Will someone pick them up for me?

191
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,800
Don’t you have hands?
Do it yourself.

192
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
What's wrong?

193
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,880
I'm eating.

194
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Aren’t you gonna eat
anything else but porridge?

195
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Come on.

196
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,360
Here.

197
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,880
Hey.

198
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,360
Here.

199
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,320
Please don’t be mad.
I said I’m sorry.

200
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,680
I’m still mad.

201
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,320
You made me angry and shout on purpose.
And you even laughed at me.

202
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,520
Affectionate laughter and mocking
laughter are two different things.

203
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,680
- Talk to me.
- What else do you want?

204
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,440
Next time, call me before
you come to see me.

205
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,240
You’re already busy.

206
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,920
I don’t want you to waste
your time waiting for me.

207
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,800
And I’ll text you when I go to the garage.

208
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,720
You’re starting to fall for me, aren’t you?

209
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,360
No. It’s fun to have
you around, that’s all.

210
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,040
You’re teasing me again.

211
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,200
I’m just worried.

212
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,120
Besides, I want you to balance your time.

213
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,600
See how good of a senior I am?

214
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,640
Do you get it, stupid boy?

215
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,560
You called me stupid again.

216
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Then how about a reward
for the boy who persevered?

217
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,520
Try replacing my ‘stupid’ with ‘cute’.

218
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,880
See how good of a senior I am?

219
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
Do you get it, cute boy?

220
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,800
Too late for that, cute boy.

221
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,480
You have a long way to go
before you can snoop for my info.

222
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,880
Do your best, cute boy.

223
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,720
Cute boy.

224
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,160
Hey, aren’t you coming?

225
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
I don’t mind leaving you there.

226
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,760
That’s cheating, P’ Payu.

227
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,680
You’re a cheat.

228
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,440
Did everyone finish your homework?
You must submit it this afternoon.

229
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
No.

230
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,960
How is your exam preparation?

231
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,240
Don’t forget it’s the day after tomorrow.

232
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,840
Students who get low marks
need to retake the exam.

233
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,600
Getting off work early.
Will reach the garage before 7.

234
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,560
Rain, the teacher’s watching.

235
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,960
Just a sec.

236
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,120
Rain, a text from debt collectors?

237
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,600
Shut the hell up.

238
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,280
Is something going on?

239
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,200
No!

240
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,800
Pay attention and stop talking.
The teacher will scold us.

241
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,840
As for daylighting...

242
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,240
I’m going to add more clerestories
on this side of the building.

243
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,040
And the windows will be
installed at the ceiling level.

244
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,880
It exactly meets the client’s needs.

245
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,680
They don’t want too many
windows to disturb their privacy.

246
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,840
That’s why I plan to use timber
battens as the façade around the house.

247
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,600
To give smooth texture,
allow sufficient light...

248
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,520
And obscure the clerestories from view.

249
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,480
The clerestory windows
will be installed on this side.

250
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,600
Because the morning sunlight
comes from this direction.

251
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
Good idea.

252
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,400
Excuse me.

253
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,120
I didn’t wanna know when you’ll be there.

254
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,040
And I don’t wanna see you.

255
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,640
I’m just gonna go and
give P’ Aon some snacks.

256
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,320
If you don’t want a pay cut...

257
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,040
Leave everything you get...

258
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
At the office.

259
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,080
Hey, Boss. What do you mean?

260
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,400
Sorry.

261
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,080
Finally.

262
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,560
- Bye, Ple.
- Bye.

263
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,640
Bye, guys.
Gotta attend extra English class.

264
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,080
Okay, see ya.

265
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,120
Bye, Sky.

266
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,280
Hey, where are you going?
What about homework?

267
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,720
I’ll do it at home.

268
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,400
The deadline’s tomorrow before 8.30.

269
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,680
I know. I gotta go.

270
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,920
Rain.

271
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,160
Ple, I’m in a hurry.
 See you later.

272
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,520
Does he forget who his crush is?

273
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,840
For P’ Aon.
Rain.

274
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,600
You’re quite skilled.

275
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
I know, right?

276
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,000
I may flunk lecture classes,
but I’m confident with this one.

277
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,200
Where are my snacks?

278
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,080
Why would I give them to you?

279
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,120
They’re for P’ Aon
because he took care of my car.

280
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,320
It’s fine if I don’t get any.

281
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,160
I only replaced the engine and the battery.

282
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,920
I even replaced all the four tires.

283
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,600
It’s not that expensive, actually.
Only…

284
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,720
Here.

285
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,960
Happy now?

286
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,000
What are you looking at?

287
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
A cutie.

288
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,360
When’s the deadline?

289
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
Why?

290
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,800
I wanna buy you dinner
in return for the snacks.

291
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,200
But it’s fine if you don’t want to.
I can eat alone.

292
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,040
Wait, I’ll go with you.

293
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,480
I’m totally free.

294
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,080
I’ll wait at the bike.

295
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Pack your things quickly
and follow me, okay?

296
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Okay.

297
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,840
Hey, am I seeing things?

298
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,640
Of course not, P’ Aon.
I saw it with my own eyes too.

299
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,520
Boss was smiling like an idiot.

300
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,880
I’d be screwed if I
accepted Mr. Rain’s snacks.

301
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,120
Exactly.

302
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,560
- What should we eat tonight?
- Super duper spicy salad.

303
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,440
It’s gonna be hot and spicy for sure.

304
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,600
Grinning like that, someone’s
bound to get his happy ending.

305
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,960
Done.

306
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,000
There’s still time.
Let’s take a nap.

307
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,520
If you’re trying to seduce me,
do it better next time.

308
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,920
Rain. Rain.

309
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,520
Rain.

310
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,480
Rain.

311
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,160
Rain, wake up.

312
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,320
- What, Ma?
- You have to submit your work today.

313
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,920
- What time is it now?
- 8.15.

314
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,400
Shit!

315
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,480
Sky, Rain’s leaving the house.
Thank you for calling me.

316
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,640
Take it back.

317
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,120
But I finished it before the deadline.

318
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,720
Do you remember how many
days I gave you to complete it?

319
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,120
- Seven days.
- And the deadline?

320
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,080
- 8.30.
- What time is it now?

321
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,480
This is why I won’t accept your work.

322
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,800
Teacher, but…

323
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,560
Your peers had the same
amount of time as you.

324
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,480
So why were they able to meet
the deadline but you couldn’t?

325
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,840
Because you’re irresponsible.

326
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,200
Teacher, I know it’s my fault.
But please give me a chance.

327
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,640
I want you to ask your seniors.

328
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,400
If I give each and every
one of you a chance...

329
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,240
How many total chances will I give?

330
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,720
No matter how hard you cry,
I won’t accept your work.

331
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,040
I’m sorry.

332
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,520
You’d better resign if you
think it’s too much for you.

333
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,120
If this matter can discourage you easily,
then forget graduating.

334
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,400
You won’t even be able to make it
through to 5th year at this rate.

335
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,600
Your seniors have it harder than you.

336
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,320
Take it back.
I won’t grade this piece of your work.

337
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,240
You should leave.

338
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
Yes.

339
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,440
Rain.

340
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,840
How did it go?

341
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,160
Rain, are you okay?

342
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,400
Oh, I’m fine.

343
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,040
I’m not affected by such tiny matter.

344
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,280
If there’s something on
your mind, I’m here to talk.

345
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,520
I’m really fine.

346
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,160
It’s just that I pulled
an all-nighter last night, so…

347
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,120
I’m very sleepy.
I’m going home to sleep.

348
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,800
See you, Ple.

349
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,040
Get home safe.

350
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,000
Why am I here?

351
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,200
Rain, what are you doing here?
Come inside.

352
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,640
Is P’ Payu here?

353
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,960
- Never mind.
- Let’s get inside first.

354
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,400
- What’s up?
- When are you coming back?

355
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,480
Rain had been waiting for you in the rain.

356
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,280
Come here.

357
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,160
P’ Payu.

358
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,840
It’s okay.

359
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,040
I’m here now.

360
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,560
I screwed up.

361
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,360
It’s okay, good boy.

362
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,400
Let me see.

363
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,160
You look like a drowned rat.

364
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,880
I’m here for you.
Don’t cry.

365
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,200
I don’t know what to do anymore.

366
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,520
I’m here to talk.

367
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,400
You look awful, Rain.

368
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,640
Why did you put up a
front with other people...

369
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,840
But cried in front of P’ Payu?

370
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,800
Enough, stop crying.

371
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,760
But...

372
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,400
I’m kinda thankful to him.

373
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
P’ Payu.

374
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,040
P’ Payu.

375
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,200
Hey, don’t look!

376
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,920
Don’t.

377
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,720
Is this what you were drawing yesterday?

378
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,320
Got harsh criticism
or missed the deadline?

379
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,440
I missed the deadline.

380
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,160
If you want me to comfort you...

381
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,400
All I can say is everything
the teacher said is right.

382
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,920
I don’t want you to comfort me.
I know it’s my fault.

383
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,000
Good that you know.

384
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,480
And you’d better come
to terms with it fast.

385
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,680
Rain.

386
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,000
The criticism and
pressure you received today...

387
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,320
Is like a first test before
you step into the real world.

388
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,600
It will protect you and give
you strength in the future.

389
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,400
For some people, missing
deadline is no big deal.

390
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,280
But for others,
it means responsibility.

391
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,080
The teacher probably
wants you to be responsible.

392
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,760
And I want you to be responsible.

393
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,120
But I know how you feel.

394
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,000
Because my works
are often criticized too.

395
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,960
The talented P’ Payu?

396
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,720
The P’ Payu who’s standing in front of you.

397
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,920
Go dry your hair.
I’ll have someone buy dinner for you.

398
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,680
What’s done is done.
Don't dwell on it.

399
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,080
Focus your effort into your next work.
Got it, naughty boy?

400
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,160
Dry your hair properly.
Don’t get sick.

401
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,480
I don’t wanna take care of you.

402
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,440
I thought you wouldn’t comfort me.

403
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,240
How could you be so mean to the poor kid?

404
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,240
He left?

405
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,240
Yeah, he’s gone.

406
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,800
I really pity your boy.
You’ve got him in the palm of your hand.

407
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,640
Hey, let me borrow your phone.

408
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,480
What’s this?

409
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,960
A photo I got before the frat party dinner.

410
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,040
Return it to me at the
office when you’re done.

411
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,320
I’ve got some work to do.

412
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,640
So the tiger was preparing
to hunt from the start?

413
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,360
Our group’s freshman this year.
Rain.

414
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,320
I can’t help you change the tire,
but I can shelter you from the rain.

415
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,360
English Subtitle by Saowalak K.

416
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,720
- Rain.
- Yes?

417
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,400
You shouldn’t come here anymore.

418
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,080
P’ Payu.

419
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,480
- Don't you like Ple anymore?
- I still do.

420
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,400
Rain, did you submit your work?
Let’s have a meal together.

421
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,960
I’m not sure if I like P’ Payu.

422
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,200
I don’t know how to do it,
but I’m doing the best I can.
