1
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,960
It's a landslide victory for me.

2
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,080
If you're the real deal,
prove it with your skills.

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,800
Not bellowing that you're the best!

4
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,360
It's pathetic.

5
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,920
I haven't lost yet!

6
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,520
Come home early.
Your darling's waiting.

7
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,039
P' Payu!

8
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,760
Who the hell dropped food
bags in front of my house?

9
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,720
What’s going on?

10
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,800
Some idiot dropped food
bags and made such a mess.

11
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,760
And now I’ve got to clean up.

12
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,520
Rain!

13
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,680
Payu, what’s going on?

14
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,840
Rain!

15
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,120
Rain.

16
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,839
Rain.

17
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:35,320
Sky After Rain

18
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,040
What exactly is going on?

19
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,400
Rain’s not here.

20
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,120
What do you mean?

21
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,200
- I told you Rain’s not here!
- Calm down.

22
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,880
I got it.

23
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,840
What I’m saying is,
maybe Rain went home.

24
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,440
You kept him here for days.

25
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,720
Rain, where are you?

26
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,240
P’ Payu, help me! Help…

27
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Remember me?

28
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,880
Stop!

29
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,200
Let me go!

30
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,520
I’m glad you remembered my voice.

31
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,200
If you don’t wanna die,
let my boyfriend go now!

32
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,200
Are you sure you wanna
use that tone with me?

33
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,800
What would you do if I accidentally
slash your boyfriend’s face?

34
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
What do you want?

35
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,640
What do I want?

36
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,360
I want you to come crawling to me.

37
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,760
Simple, just come alone.

38
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,440
And if you bring friends with you,
I’ll beat your boyfriend.

39
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,520
And if you fucking call the
police, I’ll beat your boyfriend.

40
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,159
You don’t want things to turn ugly, do you?

41
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,920
Don’t worry, just do as I say.

42
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,920
When all this is over, I guarantee
both you and your boyfriend won’t die.

43
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,040
Isn’t my offer tempting?

44
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,880
Send me the address.

45
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,240
Don’t come, P’ Payu!

46
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,720
I give you half an hour.

47
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,640
And you’d better keep in mind.
Just. You. Alone.

48
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,320
No! P’ Payu, don’t come!

49
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
You!

50
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,760
What did he say?

51
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
Abandoned building behind racetrack

52
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,600
Dammit!

53
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,480
Calm down.

54
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,920
How can I calm the fuck down?

55
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,520
Don’t you see that Rain’s
fallen into his hands?

56
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,080
Stay out of it.
I won’t waste my time here.

57
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,560
You know it’s a trap.

58
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,400
I know it’s a trap.

59
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,120
But Rain’s with that bastard.
I’ve got to help him.

60
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,560
He’s in this predicament because of me.

61
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,520
Don’t worry, he’s got no guts to kill me.

62
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,040
Just stay here.

63
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Dammit.

64
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,920
- What the hell?
- Stop, you’re going too far!

65
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,080
Yeah, I thought you just
wanted us to beat someone up.

66
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,920
But this is kidnapping.

67
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,400
You think he’ll stay still
and let you beat him?

68
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,720
He humiliated me.
I’m gonna get back at him

69
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,720
You know what?
Leave me out of this.

70
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,360
- You’re chickening out?
- Yeah!

71
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,000
I don’t know if you feel it,
but Payu’s a scary man.

72
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,160
You’re gonna run away like Bas too?

73
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,320
What the fuck are you looking at?

74
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,120
Oh, can’t talk?

75
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,520
P’ Payu won’t lose to someone like you!

76
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,560
Without dirty tricks,
you can’t do anything to him!

77
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,200
Oh, even when you cheated,
you couldn’t even beat him.

78
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Loser!

79
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,960
Hey, you’re gonna kill him!

80
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,560
I wanna see the look on your
face when Payu gets beaten up.

81
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,800
Protect your pretty face well.

82
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,840
When I’m done with Payu,
it’ll be your turn.

83
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,400
Bring it on!

84
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,120
Wanna slash my face?
Go ahead!

85
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,880
Chickenshit!

86
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
You...

87
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,480
Let me go!

88
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,920
Don't come alone, P' Payu.

89
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,360
A few cuts on my face won't kill me.

90
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,080
But don't do as he says.
Please don't.

91
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,560
Let me go!

92
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,720
I’m here!
Let my boyfriend go!

93
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,120
If I let him go now...

94
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,440
You won’t do as I say.

95
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,040
It’s okay, Rain.
It’ll be over soon.

96
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,080
We’ll go home together.

97
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,000
Your love makes me laugh my ass off.

98
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,040
But you two won’t be leaving anytime soon.

99
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Kneel.

100
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Don’t.

101
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Hey.

102
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,960
Good!

103
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,840
Obedient like a tame dog.
That’s how I like it.

104
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,720
Next…

105
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,960
Stick you face to the floor.

106
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,080
P’ Payu, don’t!

107
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,680
Not there.

108
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,800
Crawl and kowtow at my feet.

109
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,680
Please stop!

110
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,280
I did as you said.
Now let my boyfriend go.

111
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,200
Don’t be impatient, dude.

112
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,680
Hey, don’t forget to take pictures.

113
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,680
Take a look, the consequence
of challenging me.

114
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,000
You called me a loser, huh?

115
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,560
You’re resisting?

116
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,600
Wanna see your boyfriend get hurt?

117
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,000
If you can’t satisfy me...

118
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,720
I’ll have my men screw
your boyfriend right here.

119
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,240
Good!

120
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,280
That’s more like it!

121
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,640
You arrogant bastard!

122
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,800
What’s wrong?
Why aren't you barking?

123
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,520
Hey, what the fuck!

124
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,280
Let me go!

125
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Hey!

126
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,920
Stop it, don’t hurt him!

127
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,120
I said stop, you fucker!
Don’t you hurt him!

128
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,600
Let me go!

129
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,440
Don’t hurt him, huh?

130
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,040
I dare you to let me go!

131
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,320
A useless scum like you can’t defeat anyone
without cheating or using dirty tricks!

132
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,680
Let go of me, you coward!

133
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,360
- Let go!
- Coward?

134
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,240
Don’t touch my boyfriend.

135
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,320
Don’t touch your boyfriend?

136
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,880
P’ Payu!

137
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,480
P’ Payu!

138
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,880
P' Payu!

139
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,400
That’s enough.
Stop, don’t do it!

140
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
Let go!

141
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,480
Leave him alone!

142
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,040
I said, don’t touch my boyfriend!

143
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,440
Don’t hurt him!

144
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,240
Don’t!

145
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,760
Shut the hell up!

146
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Let go!

147
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,599
Let go!

148
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,160
That’s enough.
Let go! Let me go!

149
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,440
Let P’ Payu go!

150
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,600
- Let go!
- Leave him alone! Let go!

151
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,800
What the fuck are you standing there for?
Teach him a lesson!

152
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,920
I think you should stop.

153
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
P’ Payu.

154
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,360
P’ Payu, I’m sorry.

155
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,000
If I hadn’t been captured,
you wouldn’t have gotten hurt.

156
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,160
Why are you apologizing?
I’m the one who should apologize.

157
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,040
Come on, don’t cry.

158
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,520
I’m the reason you bowed
to him and got beaten up.

159
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,920
You could fight back,
but I was a hindrance to you.

160
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,200
Bowing is nothing...

161
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,200
As long as you're safe.

162
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,400
I’m sorry I was late.

163
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,840
Don’t blame yourself.
You’re just in time.

164
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,200
I should thank you instead.

165
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,280
Where’s Saifha?

166
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,040
Calm down.

167
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,160
How can I calm the fuck down?

168
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,880
Don’t you see that Rain’s
fallen into his hands?

169
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,360
Stay out of it.
I won’t waste my time here.

170
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,920
You know it’s a trap.

171
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,640
I know it’s a trap.

172
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,920
Abandoned building behind racetrack

173
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,400
But Rain’s with that bastard.
I’ve got to help him.

174
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,040
He’s in this predicament because of me.

175
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,840
Don’t worry, he’s got no guts to kill me.

176
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,400
Just stay here.

177
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,160
He’s standing by outside.

178
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,280
Let me go! I said let go!

179
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,360
I’ll tell your boss to fire all of you!

180
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,760
Don’t you know who my father is?

181
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,960
Yes, I know who your father is.

182
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,000
But I guess you don’t know
who Mr. Pakin’s subordinate is.

183
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,880
Payu’s the only one my boss allows
to touch every bike in his private garage.

184
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,840
And if his favorite mechanic
couldn’t work due to injured hands...

185
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
How do you think my boss would feel?

186
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,040
- So what? I…
- Oh.

187
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,800
And we also have our golden rule.

188
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,880
My boss will be very upset
if anyone publicizes the race.

189
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,640
One more thing.

190
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,440
I despise underhanded methods the most.

191
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,840
Get up!

192
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,440
I’d like to see how you’re
gonna fight me, a lackey.

193
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Let’s go.

194
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Just a minute.

195
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,840
This is for my boyfriend!

196
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,760
Bear this in mind.
P’ Payu’s the only one who can screw me.

197
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Let’s go.

198
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,200
- Yes, got it.
- Does it hurt?

199
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,360
I’ll tell him.

200
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,800
A little.

201
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,160
P’ Chai said sorry.

202
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,080
He was supposed to deal with
Stop before any of this happened.

203
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,240
But he was busy with work.

204
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,920
And the bastard made a
move faster than he expected.

205
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,760
To be honest, I was terrified
just by hearing P’ Chai’s voice.

206
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,400
I guess he’s pissed
for being called a lackey.

207
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,120
With P’ Pakin’s permission, Stop
will have a much harder time than you.

208
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,600
You should get some rest.
You too, Rain.

209
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,440
Yes, P’ Saifha.

210
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
Come closer.

211
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,640
I don’t wanna bump into your wounds.

212
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,040
You should’ve been admitted to
the hospital like the doctor said.

213
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Be careful with your arms.

214
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,960
It’s just a pinky finger fracture.

215
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,440
Rain.

216
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,280
When you kicked him for me
despite your fear of P’ Chai…

217
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,760
You made me fall in love with you again.

218
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
You've ever fallen in love with me?

219
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,840
I already confessed.

220
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
When?

221
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,000
When I sang for you.

222
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,480
No, that didn’t count.
You’re cheating.

223
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,720
You've never said it.

224
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,200
Neither have you.

225
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,560
Can you hear what my heart’s saying?

226
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,120
I won’t know if you don’t say it.

227
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,840
I love you, Rain.

228
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,800
Me too.

229
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,120
What do you mean?
Don’t cheat.

230
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,280
Then don’t tease me.

231
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,440
I love you too, P’ Payu.

232
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,760
It’s raining again.

233
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,720
Don’t you like it?

234
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,400
I do.

235
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,800
And I like ‘storm’ too.

236
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,840
Because whenever there’s
a storm, there’s always rain.

237
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,480
Guys, my gaming rank went
up a lot during summer break.

238
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
So idle.

239
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,640
What’s there to be happy about?
It’ll go down when school starts anyway.

240
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,120
Hey, don’t hurt my feelings.
I spent so much time playing.

241
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,480
As for me, I thought
I finally got a chance to relax.

242
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,720
But P’ Som asked me to
gather data for his thesis.

243
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,880
- That’s expected of P’ Som.
- He did it again.

244
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,000
- What about you, Sky?
- Yeah.

245
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,920
I returned to my home in Lopburi.

246
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,080
I would’ve stayed longer if it hadn’t
been for freshmen orientation meeting.

247
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,320
So I’ll be going home after the meeting
to spend more time with my dad.

248
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,920
'Cause I’ll be busy when school starts.

249
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,760
What about you, Mr. Cloud Jizz?
What did you do during summer break?

250
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,200
My name’s not Cloud Jizz.
My name is R-A-I-N, Rain.

251
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
I know you’re smart enough
to know the difference.

252
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,280
Don’t call me Cloud Jizz.

253
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,560
Guess he took extra English course.

254
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,640
His pronunciation’s on point.

255
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,920
Okay, Okay. Nong Fon. Nong Fon.

256
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,520
- Nong Fon, how was your summer break?
- My name’s not Fon.

257
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,200
Stop calling me Fon.

258
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,560
- He’s been clingy to his partner.
- What?

259
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
- Sky!
- He found himself a partner?

260
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,240
Someone as annoying as you?
Damn, I wonder who.

261
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,200
Sky, you know who his partner is, right?

262
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,400
- Sky, don’t tell them.
- 500 baht.

263
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Sky.

264
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,800
- If I tell you the name…
- I’ll give you 1,000 baht.

265
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,400
You’ll know who it is.

266
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,560
- Shit.
- Who?

267
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,720
- Sky!
- I’m more curious now.

268
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,320
- Who?
- Stop talking.

269
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,560
Look! Nong Fon’s bangs
shifted from being shy.

270
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,080
His mouth’s droopy too.

271
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,640
So what’s the deal?

272
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,920
- Nong Fon.
- What?

273
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,440
- Spill the beans.
- What do you have to say for yourself?

274
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,320
Who is it, Sky? Tell me.

275
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,480
Oh, who’s calling you?

276
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,440
My mom.

277
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,680
Where are you going, Nong Fon.

278
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Nosy.

279
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,040
- He said we’re nosy.
- It’s our fault?

280
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,720
The heck? We’re just worried.
How come it’s our fault?

281
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,040
He’s acting strange.
That must be his partner.

282
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,640
- Who is it?
- Or maybe a scammer call?

283
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,000
I received one yesterday.

284
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,080
Hello.

285
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,160
Is the meeting over?

286
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,560
Yes.

287
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,680
We’re eating at the restaurant
you recommended me.

288
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,000
Oh, my favorite place.

289
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,960
Yeah.
So why are you calling?

290
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,320
I miss you.

291
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,480
Send me your selfie.

292
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,280
Why?

293
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,560
Just for fun.
Are you feeling shy?

294
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,520
I’m not.
Don’t talk nonsense.

295
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,880
Just a sec.
You’re leaving, Ple?

296
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,200
No, I’m going to P’ Sert’s shop.
Do you want anything?

297
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,000
- You’re going alone?
- Yeah.

298
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,560
- Want me to accompany you?
- It’s okay, keep talking.

299
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,200
Where were we?

300
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,120
I’ll be there in 10 minutes.
See you at the restaurant.

301
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
Hey!

302
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,160
Shit, he’s really coming?

303
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,760
What am I gonna do?

304
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,480
- Let’s tease P’ Som.
- Sure.

305
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,960
P’ Som.

306
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,760
You always make Ple help you with work.
Can I help you too?

307
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,080
Shut the hell up, Sig!

308
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,480
- Why?
- I don’t wanna hear your voice.

309
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,360
What’s wrong with my voice?
Do you wanna hear my voice?

310
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,800
- Just shut up.
- P’ Som!

311
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,480
- I told you to shut up.
- No!

312
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,320
Enough, just shut the hell up.

313
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,120
- Don’t tease him.
- Stop teasing him.

314
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,800
- P’ Som’s cute.
- You like him?

315
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,680
A little.

316
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,240
Oh, P’ Payu.

317
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,880
Oh, P’ Payu’s here.

318
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,600
- Hello.
- Have a seat.

319
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,040
- Okay.
- How are you?

320
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Why’s he here?

321
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,280
How would I know?
Maybe he's here for you?

322
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,120
So handsome.

323
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,680
I've been doing fine.

324
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,920
You really wanna sit here?

325
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,920
My seat’s here.

326
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,360
Aren’t you gonna claim your ownership?

327
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,760
Why would I do that?

328
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,160
Suit yourself.
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

329
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,520
'Cause judging from the brother's eyes...

330
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,120
And the sister's...

331
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,520
P' Payu is indeed popular.

332
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,640
Are you really my friend?

333
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,120
What else could I be?

334
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,240
This is also your friend,
your friend, and your friend.

335
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,880
- Your friends are my friends.
- Yeah.

336
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,760
- Guys!
- P’ Payu.

337
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,840
May I sit with you guys?

338
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,840
- Be my guest.
- Please do.

339
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,880
Dust the seat, Rain.

340
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,840
Sawasdee ka, P’ Payu.
Do you remember me?

341
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,440
We met last time when
you came to find Rain.

342
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
Of course.

343
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,360
So what are you doing here?
Is it about the freshmen orientation?

344
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,920
No, I’m here to pick up my partner.

345
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,240
What?

346
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,560
You’re in a relationship?
With who?

347
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,800
Shhh, it’s a secret.

348
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,800
- Another secret?
- So many secrets today.

349
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,040
I’m going home.

350
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,280
- What?
- That's so sudden, Rain.

351
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
Oh?

352
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,360
Where are you going, P’ Payu?
You haven’t answered my question.

353
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,000
I’m going home.
I told you I’m here to pick up my partner.

354
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,120
- Huh?
- Who?

355
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,440
My boyfriend’s going home,
so I’m leaving too.

356
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,040
- Damn.
- Right, Rain?

357
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,440
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

358
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,000
Sig, didn’t you ask who my partner is?

359
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,280
Yes.

360
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,760
Let’s go home, P’ Payu.

361
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,200
Oh my god!!

362
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,280
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

363
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,080
Is it true?

364
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,760
P’ Payu and Rain are dating?

365
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,720
Impossible!

366
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,320
It’s possible.
It’s already happening.

367
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,760
I can’t believe it.

368
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,760
Our friend’s become cocky after
he’s dating the department’s god.

369
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,720
- Yeah.
- Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

370
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,480
Did you see the look on P’ Som’s face?
He was flabbergasted.

371
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,160
Do you still like Ple?

372
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,000
Are you…

373
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,680
Jealous?

374
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,240
Furiously jealous.

375
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:08,200
Didn’t you see the way she looked at you?
Come on, she doesn’t like me.

376
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,600
I don’t care how that girl looked at me.

377
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:20,320
All I care about is how
my boyfriend looks at me.

378
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,600
So do you see how your
boyfriend’s looking at you?

379
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,920
For your information.

380
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,120
I never look at other people...

381
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,360
The way I look at you.

382
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,200
Okay.

383
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,680
Then I won’t punish you today.

384
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,160
I won’t cheat on you.

385
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,600
But if you cheat on me, I’ll storm
to the garage to unleash my wrath.

386
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,000
Then there’s no reason for me to be afraid.

387
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,440
'Cause I'll never let you down.

388
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,040
Never.

389
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,520
Let’s go home, P’ Payu.

390
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
Let’s…

391
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,000
Do something fun.

392
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,240
After it rained continuously
for the past week…

393
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,160
The sky is clearing up.
While a wind coming from the east…

394
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,840
Good morning, my babies.

395
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,400
Oh, a new shoot.

396
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,600
Let’s hang the laundry.

397
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,680
So much dust.

398
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,600
Has Dad ever cleaned up?

399
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,640
Should I find him a girlfriend?

400
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,320
If he’s got a girlfriend,
I won’t have to clean up.

401
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,200
Tomorrow, you have a meeting at 10 a.m.

402
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,920
And a meeting with
shareholders in the afternoon.

403
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,200
I already sent related
materials to your email.

404
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,280
And this file…

405
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,160
Cancel the 10 a.m. meeting for me.
I just remembered that I’m busy.

406
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,920
But Mr. Pai…

407
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,200
Don’t worry, I’ll be in time
for the afternoon meeting.

408
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,440
It can’t be canceled, Mr. Pai.

409
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,560
I know it’s important.

410
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,480
I can’t afford to have my
father fire me anytime soon.

411
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,640
Thank you.

412
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,280
Sky!

413
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,440
Are you okay?

414
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,040
I told you I’d do it myself.

415
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,440
Look, it's summer break.
You should be resting up.

416
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,800
Come on, Dad.
It’s not a big deal.

417
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,480
I do everything by myself
when I’m at the dorm.

418
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,960
It’s especially because I’m on
summer break that you need to rest up.

419
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,160
Please let me help.

420
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,960
How stubborn.

421
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,320
Alright, I’ll get back to work.

422
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,800
I can’t carry them all.
Help me carry the rest.

423
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,000
I knew it.

424
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,640
Now I can rest easy after
seeing him smile again.

425
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,560
Sky, I’ll make lunch to show
off my great cooking skills.

426
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,400
No, I don’t wanna eat burnt fried eggs!

427
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,080
What are you doing here?

428
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,560
Visiting my friend.
I heard you got beaten up.

429
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,840
It’s been weeks after the incident.

430
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,440
And I’m planning to spend
my leave with my darling.

431
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,240
You’re such a heartless friend.

432
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,960
I went out of my way to visit you.

433
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,760
Now that you’ve seen me, get out.

434
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,680
I’ve just arrived.

435
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,240
Not a single glass of water
to welcome your guest.

436
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,360
- I’ll go get it.
- Stop.

437
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,680
If he’s capable of driving here,
then he can buy himself a drink.

438
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,280
Am I right?

439
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,640
Okay, I’ll get to the point.

440
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,720
Yes?

441
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,040
Last time you were chased by the
guards, you came with a friend, right?

442
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
What's his name?

443
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,160
Oh, Sky.
You mean Sky?

444
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,480
Can I have his number?

445
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,840
I got him out of the venue that day.

446
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,520
And he forgot to take his stuff back.
I wanna return it.

447
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,560
That’s why I’m asking you his number.

448
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,760
You can give the thing to me.

449
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,160
I wanna return it myself.

450
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,040
If you don’t give me his number...

451
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,320
I won’t leave.

452
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,480
Sky, I’m sorry. I’ll help you to finish all works

453
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,000
when the semester starts.

454
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Okay.

455
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,800
Thanks for a warm welcome to this guest.

456
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,920
I’m leaving.

457
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,280
P’ Payu, I gave him my friend’s number.
What do I do?

458
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,520
Judging from his expression,
it’s too late to save your friend now.

459
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,320
A cunning expression like yours?

460
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,480
Wanna see that expression on my face?

461
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,920
A water for you.
Here.

462
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,280
- Thanks, son.
- Sure.

463
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,320
- Eat.
- Okay.

464
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,080
Try this, Dad.
Fried Chinese sausages.

465
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,560
Are they burnt?

466
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,920
They’re crispy, Dad. Crispy.
I fried them myself.

467
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,080
- Really?
- Yeah!

468
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,120
You’re not picking up?

469
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,040
I don’t recognize the number.
Maybe it’s a scammer call.

470
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,480
What if I get scammed?

471
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Let’s eat.

472
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,480
By the way, when will
you return to the dorm?

473
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,280
The day after tomorrow.

474
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,040
Pay attention to your studies.
But don’t push yourself too hard.

475
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,240
You don’t need to worry.
Your son is smart.

476
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,920
I can do it, don’t worry.

477
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
Showoff.

478
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,120
- Here, try this stewed egg.
- Thank you.

479
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,040
Oh, there’s one left.
This one’s for you.

480
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,640
One for you and one for me.
Here.

481
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,160
You’re trying to please
me to get something?

482
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,440
No!

483
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

484
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,840
Let’s eat.

485
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,800
Ignore it, Dad.

486
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,720
Let’s eat.

487
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,320
He’s not picking up.

488
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,600
It’s okay, there’s still time.

489
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,040
I’m not the type to give up easily anyway.

490
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,800
You’re the one who tampered
with my car at the frat dinner?

491
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,120
Yeah.

492
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,920
I was attracted to the boy
who held an umbrella for me.

493
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,200
So I had to find a way to approach him.
Right?

494
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,480
But your car was due for a checkup too.

495
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,520
You remembered me from the start?

496
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,360
Rather, I like you from the start.

497
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:09,080
Ever since you held the umbrella for me,
I’d been thinking that if we met again...

498
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,880
I’d make a move on you.

499
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,120
After that, a senior sent
your photo in the group chat.

500
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,240
That's how I found out before the dinner
party that you’re in the same frat group.

501
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,760
But you never pursued me.

502
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,720
That’s my way of pursuing you.

503
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,120
By making me pursue you instead?

504
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,840
So that you’d wanna get to know me better.

505
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,240
Besides…

506
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,240
I enjoy teasing the person I like.

507
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,600
How am I dating someone like you?

508
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,960
You won’t love me after learning the truth?

509
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,880
No.

510
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,920
'Cause I already love you.
What else can I do?

511
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,040
I’ll let you tease me
for the rest of our lives.

512
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,120
Then you’d better be prepared.

513
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,560

514
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,840
- He's my boy.
- I don't have to stay.

515
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,440
At least leave me your number.

516
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,120
They're all assholes.

517
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,280
Hello, P' Pai.
This is P' Pai, P' Payu's best friend.

518
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,960
I'll go back with P' Pai.
