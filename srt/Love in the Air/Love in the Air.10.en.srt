1
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,160
No matter how hard you try to seduce
or annoy me, the answer’s still the same.

2
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,400
Leave me alone.

3
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,479
I won't give up.

4
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,800
Even if it's not him, I won't like anyone.

5
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,920
Sky should’ve been admitted
to the hospital, but he refused.

6
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,920
So the doctor gave him an IV.

7
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,160
I’m calling to ask for leave, Dad.

8
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,200
Are you too old to
understand human language?

9
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,840
The reason?

10
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,600
I’m sick.

11
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,160
What, Dad?
You don’t believe me?

12
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,680
Okay, fine.

13
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,120
My boyfriend’s sick.

14
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,800
I swear I’m not fooling around with anyone.

15
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,680
Come on, please believe your son.

16
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,840
- Yes.
- P’ Pai?

17
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,120
There, there. Don’t sulk.

18
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,200
You’re a good guy, a family
man, and a faithful husband.

19
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,600
Let me correct myself.
I take after Uncle Frost.

20
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
I don’t inherit any of
your good behaviors at all.

21
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,040
Are you a father who claims all the fame...

22
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,320
But puts all the blames
on your younger brother?

23
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,120
Don’t yell.
You’ll get a heart attack.

24
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,960
Talk to you later.

25
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,440
You’re awake, naughty boy?

26
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,920
What?

27
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,960
Woah, you’re so mean.

28
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,400
You didn’t let go of me at all last night.

29
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,560
Now you’re pushing me
away after you’re done?

30
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,079
I didn’t…

31
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,000
- I’m begging you! No!
- Sky. Sky. It's me.

32
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,640
- Let me go!
- It’s P’ Pai, P’ Black Giant.

33
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,640
- Sky.
- No! Let me go!

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,840
- Sky.
- Let me go.

35
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,400
Don't.

36
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,120
I won’t let you go.

37
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,560
I’ll be right here.
I’ll be right here.

38
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,640
I won’t let anyone hurt you.
Relax.

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,080
It’s okay.

40
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,000
You’re okay.

41
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,320
Is that you, P’ Pai?

42
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,760
Yes, it’s me.

43
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,000
P’ Pai, don’t let me go.
I’m begging you.

44
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,000
I don’t wanna have that
kind of dream anymore.

45
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,360
Don’t let me go.

46
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,800
Remembered last night?

47
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,920
Your arms and legs were all over my body.

48
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,640
Do you know how hard it
was for me to hold back?

49
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,840
You’re such a naughty boy.

50
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,760
I’ve got to hand in my work.

51
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,560
Take it easy.

52
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,480
Rain has asked for leave for you.

53
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,440
And he told you not to
worry about the student club.

54
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,640
Use this time to rest, okay?

55
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,320
No.

56
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,520
You must rest whether you like it or not.

57
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,360
I almost took you to the hospital
again ‘cause you ran a fever.

58
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,520
Don’t be stubborn and behave.

59
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,360
Sleep.

60
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
I’ll wake you up later
to eat and take meds.

61
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,440
Time to sleep.

62
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Low pressure across Thailand
causes high temperatures in many areas.

63
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,360
Warmer weather is expected.

64
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,800
We’ve been getting many weather
reports from our listeners today.

65
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,000
Looks like it’s raining in
many areas of Bangkok.

66
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,680
Please stay away from
rain and strong winds.

67
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,760
Alright, here's our next song.

68
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,240
Could You Be the Sky That
Becomes My Destination?

69
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,480
Let me help.

70
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,600
I'm here.

71
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,280
It's okay.

72
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,320
I’m right here.
I’m not going anywhere.

73
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,680
I’m fully recovered.
You can go home now.

74
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,480
Worse than pounce and bounce is kicking
me out while I’m no longer beneficial.

75
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,320
Be kinder to me.

76
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,640
I nursed you all night long

77
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,480
Bought you meals, wiped your
body, took you to the bathroom.

78
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,800
I did almost everything.

79
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,320
But now you’re chasing me out
after I’m no longer useful?

80
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,600
Though I’m shameless, my heart’s fragile.

81
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,720
So what do you want?

82
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,120
You know what I want, Nong Sky.

83
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,480
No, I won’t have sex with you.

84
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,400
So you don’t know what I want.

85
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,640
Yes, I wanted to have sex with you.

86
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,040
That was my goal when
I asked Rain for your number.

87
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,600
But that was before.

88
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,680
Now I’m happy as long as you don’t
block my number, answer my calls...

89
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,120
Reply to my texts sometimes,
don’t run away from me.

90
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,640
And most importantly, let me pursue you.

91
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,680
See? Piece of cake.

92
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,240
That’s all I’m asking for.

93
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,840
Since you’re still unwell,
I’ll back down for now.

94
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,520
But I won’t restrain myself next time.

95
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,400
No matter how hard you
pursue me, I’m not interested.

96
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,120
Let’s see how it plays out.

97
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,040
By the way, there’s food in the fridge.
Don’t forget to eat it and rest up.

98
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,120
I don’t like owing anyone.
And thank you for the food.

99
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,160
I won’t let you escape next time.

100
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,880
You can’t catch me.

101
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,520
Has he blocked this number?

102
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,600
What's up?

103
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,800
Did you get the invitation from P' Pakin?

104
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,920
Are you coming?

105
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,120
You know I never miss it.

106
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,280
- See you at the race.
- Yeah.

107
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,520
The race’s still canceled
even though the rain’s stopped?

108
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,880
Yeah, it’s too dangerous.

109
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,920
I think it’s gonna rain the whole night.

110
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,200
But that’s a good thing
‘cause I’m in a hurry.

111
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,400
Where are you going?

112
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,640
P’ Pai, P’ Payu, Sawasdee krub.

113
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,080
What's up? Petch. Gun.
Haven’t seen you guys in a while.

114
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,000
We’ve been pretty busy.

115
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,400
Besides, his self-esteem’s been
pretty damaged after he lost to you.

116
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,320
So you’re here for a rematch?

117
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,280
Come on, who’d dare race against you?
No one can beat you.

118
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,800
We saw you when we were
passing by, so we came to say hi.

119
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,680
But the race’s canceled.
We should go home.

120
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Get home safe.

121
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,120
Where were we?

122
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,400
There’s Last Cheer today.

123
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,080
I’m gonna join in the wrist
binding ceremony at the faculty.

124
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,360
Wanna come with me?

125
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,840
What’s this Last Cheer
you’re talking about?

126
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,960
We’ve finally come to Last Cheer!

127
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,240
Everyone’s been doing
a great job since First Cheer.

128
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,720
Let the rules and the ‘United
Architecture’ song we taught you...

129
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,560
Be etched into your souls.

130
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,360
Therefore, we’ll
conclude the activity with...

131
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,200
The ‘Chicken White Butt’ song!

132
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,320
Don’t boo!

133
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:52,640
Let’s see if the baby chicks have
grown into graceful pheasants.

134
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,840
Give your all, everyone!

135
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,160
Music!

136
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,120
Chicken white butt.
Chicken white butt.

137
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,880
It will be grilled.
It will be grilled.

138
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,680
Grilled to the left.
Grilled to the right.

139
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,200
Very hot. Very hot. Very hot.

140
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,080
Chicken white butt.
Chicken white butt.

141
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,760
It will be grilled.
It will be grilled.

142
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,480
Grilled to the left.
Grilled to the right.

143
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,960
Very hot. Very hot. Very hot.

144
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,520
Has anyone prepared the snacks?

145
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,440
- Ask Jhai, it’s his job.
- Okay.

146
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,640
We need drinks for the freshmen.

147
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,440
- Where’s first aid kit? Someone’s fainted.
- I’ll go get it.

148
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,120
- Hurry up.
- Do you need a hand?

149
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,600
Sit tight and be quiet.

150
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,320
Okay, I’ll be quiet.

151
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,640
Look, move an inch and
let’s see how I’ll deal with you.

152
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Got it?

153
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,000
What’s up, Mr. Patient?
Are you alright?

154
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,080
I don't wanna be a hindrance.

155
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,800
A hindrance my ass.

156
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,760
Can’t you see that things are going
smooth ‘cause of your hard work?

157
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,839
It’s you who organized
everything systematically.

158
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,680
Take Sig for example.
What does he do?

159
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,920
All he does is monkey around
in front of the freshmen.

160
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,280
You deserve credit for the
sophomore’s behind-the-scenes work.

161
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,359
I just want it to come out well.

162
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,200
Trust me, it will.

163
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,000
‘Cause we’re doing our
best for the freshmen.

164
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,360
Right?

165
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,120
- Yeah.
- Don’t think too much.

166
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,080
Is it gonna rain?

167
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,320
Yeah, seems like that.

168
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,160
Hang in there, Sky.
It’ll be over in a few hours.

169
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,000
You must stay until the end.

170
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,800
You’re exerting yourself again.

171
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
P’ Pai.

172
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,120
I’m glad you say my name.

173
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,960
I’ll get you medicine.

174
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,520
Don’t tell my friends.
I don’t wanna worry them.

175
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,560
I’ll be back in a jiffy.

176
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,440
I’ll get you medicine.

177
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,160
Put your head on my shoulder.

178
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,960
We will leave many hours later.

179
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,880
Or I’ll take you back to the dorm.

180
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,680
How come you’re here?

181
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,600
‘Cause I know a certain
stubborn boy would exert himself.

182
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,400
You should be spanked, honestly.

183
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,720
If Payu hadn’t told me that Last Cheer
would be wrapped up in the morning…

184
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,560
I wouldn’t have known that you’d
exert yourself until you ran a fever again.

185
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,600
Are you gonna stop me?

186
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,240
If it’s important to you...

187
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,360
Then I won’t.

188
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,080
You might not believe me, Nong Sky.

189
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:06,200
I know I seem like a smooth
player who lives a carefree life.

190
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,120
But I mean it when I said I’m
serious about this relationship.

191
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,760
Thank you for coming to me.

192
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,760
Pai, oh, Pai.

193
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,520
You’ve never given in to
anyone like this in your life.

194
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,040
Sawasdee krub, get home safe.

195
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,600
Thank you for coming.

196
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,880
Get home safe.
Sawasdee krub.

197
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,280
You haven’t left yet?

198
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,360
You cuddled me for hours.
Now you’re chasing me away again.

199
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,520
I rode in the rain after I found
out you’d be staying up all night.

200
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,560
I became your pillow and blanket.

201
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,600
But I’m still unappreciated.

202
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,720
Prapai's always the bad guy in your eyes.

203
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,840
That's not what I said.

204
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,400
Then I should get reward for my good deeds.

205
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,000
I wanna see your lovely smile.

206
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,360
Smile.

207
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,680
P’ Sky.

208
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Yes?

209
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,960
We’ve heard you got sick from
the preparations, so we want to thank you.

210
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,600
Thank you so much for
taking good care of us.

211
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,840
We promise to do the same
to our juniors next year.

212
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,320
Thank you.

213
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,240
It’s us who should thank you.

214
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Then we'll take our leave now.

215
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,480
- Get home safe.
- Sawasdee ka.

216
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,040
- Thank you so much.
- Sawasdee krub.

217
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Are you happy?

218
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Then you should show it.

219
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,520
P’ Pai, I’m so over the moon.

220
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,240
I feel so good.

221
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,520
- P’ Pai?
- Looks like your no-strings-attached life...

222
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,920
Is coming to an end, Pai.

223
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,640
It’s nothing.

224
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,960
Let’s go home.

225
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,480
What a wicked boy.

226
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,800
How could you sleep so peacefully
without understanding my feelings?

227
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,440
And why the heck am I
watching a sleeping boy?

228
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,680
You’ve come this far.
Don’t lose your self-control.

229
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,240
Are you gonna jump me, P' Pai?

230
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,120
Let me use the bathroom.

231
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,720
Are you crazy, Sky?
You wanted him to…

232
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,680
Kiss you.

233
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,080
Thank you for helping me.

234
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,040
Don’t mention it.
I wanna ask you a favor too.

235
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,200
Clear your schedule next week.

236
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,440
Is this what you mean by ‘a favor’?

237
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,480
Yes, I wanna take you out on a date.

238
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,640
Do you like this place?

239
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,600
- P’ Payu took me here once.
- What?

240
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,920
P’ Payu took Rain and me to eat here once.

241
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,080
What?
I got beaten to the punch?

242
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,160
But that’s okay, I won’t make
the same mistake next time.

243
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,400
But you asked me only one favor.

244
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Meanie, that’s really cunning of you.

245
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,720
Mr. Pai, Sawasdee ka. Long time no see.
You’re here to have lunch?

246
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,000
Sawasdee krub, I’m having lunch with…

247
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,640
What about you, Ms. Natsu?
Overseeing your business on the weekend?

248
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,040
No wonder this place’s so famous.

249
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,880
You’re too kind, Mr. Pai.
I’m not that capable.

250
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,560
Sawasdee ka, welcome to our hotel.

251
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,200
I won't take any more of your time.
Please excuse me.

252
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,200
- Yes, see you later.
- Yes.

253
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,600
Enjoy your meal.

254
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,760
That woman’s beautiful.
She’s perfect for you.

255
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,880
Hold on, she’s my friend.
Don’t misunderstand me.

256
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,000
Don’t push me away like that.

257
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,880
You don’t wanna hear it,
but I’ll tell you anyway.

258
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,040
So just listen to me.

259
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,840
After I held you that night,
I’ve stopped fooling around.

260
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,960
Why are you such a nice guy, Pai?

261
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,360
Look, I’m not stupid.

262
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,760
Once.

263
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,040
Twice.

264
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,280
Fine, I’ll tell you the truth.

265
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,280
Three times.
No more than that.

266
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,320
I swear I’m not lying.

267
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,480
At least I haven’t been with
anyone in the past two months.

268
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,440
And why did I confess?

269
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,080
Exactly.
I didn’t wanna know.

270
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,280
That’s okay, I’ll just
deem myself shameless.

271
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,440
Hey!
Did you just smile?

272
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,280
No, I didn’t smile and I didn’t wanna know.

273
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
Okay.

274
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,080
Trust me, they already did it.

275
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,760
I sat here the whole night that night.

276
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,720
Nong Pai only came down to
get delivery and went back up.

277
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,120
Oh, and he came to get
some clothes from his car too.

278
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,080
Are you sure, P’ Joy?

279
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,600
My friend’s really crazy about Sky.

280
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,440
Of course.
Don’t you know who I am?

281
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,960
I never miss any juicy gossips in my dorm.

282
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,320
They’d disappeared for days.
And Sky looked sick when I saw him again.

283
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,880
I bet they did the bam-bam in the ham!

284
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,040
Yeah, I’m sure of it.

285
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:06,120
Oh, Nong Sky. Sawasdee ka.
You’re with Nong Pai.

286
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,600
Oh my, your names perfectly rhyme.
Sky and Pai.

287
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,440
- P’ Joy.
- Yes?

288
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:21,480
I’d disappeared ‘cause I was sick.
That’s all. Nothing happened.

289
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,760
Oh.

290
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,720
Yes, he was sick, so I took care of him.

291
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
Okay.

292
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,880
Told you so!
They already did it!

293
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,000
- They must've done it!
- Told you.

294
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,560
I’ve got goosebumps!

295
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,040
They did it until he got sick
and had to be taken care of.

296
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,200
My gosh!

297
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,360
Why are you following me?
Can’t you see the rumor’s flying around?

298
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,320
I don’t see what's
wrong with what they say.

299
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,600
- They say that we…
- We?

300
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,760
So when will you leave?

301
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,360
I should get used to your meanness, right?

302
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,360
If we become a couple...

303
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,640
I guess you won’t make up
with me no matter how hard I sulk.

304
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,560
You’re not stopping me?

305
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,880
You won’t listen anyway.

306
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,040
Clever. You can read your
future boyfriend’s mind now.

307
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,480
You’re ignoring me again.

308
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,920
I told you I’m gonna finish my work.
Be quiet if you wanna stay.

309
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,120
- I told you I’m working.
- Go on, I won't bother you.

310
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,720
Sweet.
But it’ll be sweeter without clothes.

311
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,840
I’d better go get changed.
This shirt’s uncomfortable.

312
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,000
I’m borrowing your clothes.

313
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,600
Did I sleep with a psycho?

314
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,280
What are you doing?

315
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,640
Working.

316
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,600
Will you use these papers?

317
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,840
Huh? No.

318
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,760
What are you doing?

319
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Is it similar?

320
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,000
- To what?
- Wind.

321
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,200
All I see is three lines.
And why did you draw on my papers?

322
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,120
I’m claiming ownership.

323
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,400
You draw way better than me.

324
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,640
‘Cause I’m an architecture student.

325
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,400
- P’ Pai.
- Yes?

326
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,800
You own only yourself.

327
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,760
Come on, couldn’t I make
you shy with what I did at all?

328
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,080
No.

329
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,440
Finally.

330
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,680
It’s all done.

331
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,320
Your work’s done?
Wanna eat dinner now?

332
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,040
Since when did you buy it?

333
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,440
You were too engrossed in your work.
How could I not worry about you?

334
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,640
Come sit here.

335
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,960
Don’t you have plans to go home?

336
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,840
You’re chasing me out again.

337
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,160
My sister’s gonna mock me if she
knows I’m being chased out constantly.

338
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,720
You seem close to your siblings.

339
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,480
Are you curious?

340
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,480
We’re very close.

341
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,960
I’m the eldest.
With one brother and one sister.

342
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,960
My brother’s a junior student.
My sister’s a freshman.

343
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,680
They’ve got so much in common.

344
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,240
Wayward, spoiled, and very stubborn.

345
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,920
They’ve got tons of
tricks up their sleeves.

346
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,960
They can do everything
to achieve their goals.

347
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,520
What a pain in the neck!

348
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,760
That should be my line.

349
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,840
You’re exactly like that.

350
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,720
I admit that the three of us
are the shameless siblings.

351
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,400
What about you, Nong Sky?
Got any siblings?

352
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,880
I’m an only child.

353
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,080
I don’t know what it
feels like to have siblings.

354
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,400
My parents got divorced.

355
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,440
I mostly spend my time with my dad.

356
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,120
But after I came to Bangkok,
we see each other once in a while.

357
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,960
I’ll introduce you to my siblings.

358
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,240
And you won’t be lonely anymore, Nong Sky.

359
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,120
I’m not lonely...

360
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,480
At all.

361
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,720
Let’s eat.
You must be hungry.

362
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,680
- P’ Pai.
- Hmm?

363
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,560
Can you stop calling me ‘Nong Sky’?

364
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,400
Then what should I call you?

365
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,440
Just ‘Sky’ is enough.

366
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,240
As long as you omit the word ‘Nong’.

367
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,360
It sounds fake.

368
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
Sky.

369
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,440
Sky krub.

370
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,880
I’ll wait until you’re ready.

371
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,880
Alright, let’s finish our dinner.

372
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,880
This meal…

373
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,640
Is much tastier than today’s lunch.

374
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,320
Don’t tell me I’ve got
to sleep on the floor.

375
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,760
What’s your relationship with
me to sleep in the same bed?

376
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,600
Fine, I’ll sleep on the floor.
I’m not picky anyway.

377
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,560
And I’d better not see you
on my bed when I wake up.

378
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,720
I take such great care of you,
but I’ve got to sleep on the floor.

379
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,240
I’m just a servant.

380
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,520
You do it of your own free will.
Too bad.

381
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,280
I’ll let you win this time.

382
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,800
Whether now or later, I’ll always win.

383
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,120
What choice do I have?
I already lost to you.

384
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:26,080
How to treat a patient

385
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,160
His body’s wiped.

386
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,840
His clothes are changed.

387
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,680
As well as the bedsheet.

388
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,080
He took the meds.

389
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,200
So what am I supposed to do?

390
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,680
What should I do to help you get better?

391
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,280
If only it were as easy as working.

392
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,400
Mom. It’s me, Pai.

393
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,440
How do I take care of someone with fever?

394
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,920
Mom, your son can take care of others too.

395
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,680
I’ll introduce him to you later.

396
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,880
But now you must tell me what to do.

397
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,480
Yes.

398
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,720
Oh, yes.

399
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,720
Okay.

400
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,080
I already did it.

401
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,280
Yes.

402
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,120
Big brother.
Loves bike racing.

403
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,760
English Subtitle by Saowalak K.

404
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,800
I'm sorry, P' Pai.
I didn't mean to make you worried.

405
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,600
- He's hot...
- P' Payu's not the only hot guy.

406
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,360
And not the only one who's the best.

407
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,120
You're talking about P' Pai?

408
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,040
I've made up my mind, P' Pai.

409
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,680
Wait, wait, wait.

410
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,400
I’m giving myself to you.
I won’t stop you anymore.
