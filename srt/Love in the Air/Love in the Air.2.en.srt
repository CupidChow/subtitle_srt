1
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,200
- Mr. Rain, can you hear me?
- Yes, please give me a minute.

2
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,160
Okay.

3
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,600
- Excuse me, about the payment.
- Yes?

4
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,880
Oh, I remember you.

5
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,160
You’re Mr. Payu’s boy.

6
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,000
The boiler was leaking.
The stater dynamo was broken.

7
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,520
So we replaced both parts for you.

8
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,120
We also changed the battery.
The previous one was very old.

9
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,840
The battery too?

10
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,400
It’s necessary.

11
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,960
Oh, all the tires were worn out.
We replaced all of them.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,040
You never checked your
car’s health at all, right?

13
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,240
- All of them?
- Yeah.

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,440
So brand new.

15
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,280
See this?

16
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,440
Shiny like new.

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mr. Payu told us to polish and wax it.

18
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,800
Sparkling.

19
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
How much does everything cost?

20
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,560
Mr. Payu didn’t tell you that it’s free?

21
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,520
Huh?

22
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,840
And he fixed everything himself.

23
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,040
That’s why everyone knows
that you’re Mr. Payu’s boy.

24
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,720
Hey! I’m not your Mr. Payu’s boy.

25
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,920
How do I know that your boss
didn’t do anything weird to my car?

26
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,079
Oh? You don’t know anything at all?

27
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,000
Do I have to?

28
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,600
Over there.

29
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,560
See that race bike?
It belongs to a big shot.

30
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,680
The owner only trusts Mr. Payu.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,880
I don’t wanna brag about
my boss, but I can’t help it.

32
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,680
Because he's a real expert.

33
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,960
Well, what do you think?

34
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Are you interested in
becoming Mr. Payu’s boy?

35
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,079
Sign here.

36
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,920
I Hate Payu (Storm)
And I’m Not Talking about the Weather

37
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Brand new.

38
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,520
My baby, you’ve gotten pretty.

39
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
Hello.

40
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,640
Only ill-mannered kids don’t
greet houseowners when they visit.

41
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Who’s this?

42
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,960
You’ve got the memory of a goldfish.

43
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,760
Hey, what’s your problem?

44
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,600
It’s me. Payu.

45
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,280
How the hell did you get my number?

46
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,480
Don’t tell me.

47
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,200
Sign here.

48
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,320
Free.

49
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,320
Thank you.

50
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
No, it's not.

51
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,200
How could you steal a client’s
number for personal affairs?

52
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,840
Unprofessional.

53
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,960
Need I tell you that we have yet to
discuss the repair cost, Mr. Client?

54
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,880
You said it was free.

55
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,000
Nothing in this world is free.

56
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,960
How much?

57
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,120
Not ‘how much’, but ‘what’.

58
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,120
I have money.

59
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
I don’t want money.

60
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,280
Then what do you want?

61
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Simple.

62
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,560
From now on, you need
speak like an educated person.

63
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,600
I don’t want people to say
that my junior lacks manners.

64
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,760
That’s all.

65
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,640
Hey, wait.

66
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,840
You scolded me and hung up just like that?

67
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,480
A well-behaved, role-model
student like me lacks manners?

68
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,880
And why do I have to be
polite to someone like you?

69
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,360
Widespread storms are expected today.

70
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,840
Please plan ahead for
slick roads and travel delays.

71
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,640
Dammit, ‘Payu’ is all I hear about wherever I go.

72
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,960
I’ve had enough of it!

73
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,320
Payu, Payu, Payu, Payu, Payu.
Over and over again!

74
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,680
I want nothing to do with Payu.
Not anymore!

75
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,920
Looks like someone’s
big brother is happy today.

76
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,000
Not as happy as you.

77
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,760
Then get into a serious
relationship if you wanna be like me.

78
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,400
How long have you been single?

79
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,800
Hold on, Payu.

80
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,040
Are you hiding something from me?

81
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,720
I’ll tell you when
something actually happens.

82
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,240
Gotta go. Works are waiting for me.

83
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,720
Who the heck made you smile like that?

84
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,800
I really feel sorry for them.

85
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,240
Hiding from debt collectors?

86
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,680
The fuck? You scared the shit out of me!

87
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,520
Who’s hiding from debt collectors?
Not me. I don't owe any debt.

88
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,760
Remember, I never let
off anyone who owes me.

89
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,240
‘Not me’. That's a high-pitched
voice you’ve got there.

90
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,520
- This is my normal voice.
- Oh, really?

91
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,680
- Are you done?
- Yeah.

92
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
Stop being idiotic and go.

93
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,600
- Go where?
- To class. We’re getting late.

94
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,720
Hurry up.

95
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,520
What now?

96
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,799
Small framed with big eyes? A freshman?

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
Yes, a freshman.

98
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,159
What are they looking at?
Let me have a look.

99
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,800
Why the hell are you here?

100
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,280
P’ Payu.

101
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,600
I’ve found the one I was looking for.
Thanks for helping me.

102
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,200
Don’t mention it.
So you were looking for Rain.

103
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,560
I was wondering who had
a small frame and big eyes.

104
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,560
What are you doing? Let go of me!

105
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Where are you taking me?
I'm not going.

106
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,240
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

107
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,640
I called and told you about
the repair fee collection.

108
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Repair fee.

109
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,800
Repair fee for what?

110
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,200
For car repair at my family’s garage.

111
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,760
Or you can pay the rest right here.

112
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,680
Because you already paid some of it.

113
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,080
By letting me grab...

114
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,480
- Grab?
- Grab?

115
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Grab what?

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,920
Rain, why are you covering his mouth?

117
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,200
Take your hand off.

118
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,360
Come with me.

119
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,280
Oh? Rain? Rain!

120
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,040
- Hey!
- Are they close?

121
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm not so sure myself.

122
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,440
What?

123
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,400
What the fuck were you gonna say?

124
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,400
Do you know what I hate the most?

125
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,000
No, and I don't give a damn about it.

126
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,520
A boy who doesn’t keep his word.

127
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,320
When the fuck did I break my word?

128
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,760
You must have forgotten
that I told you it’d be expensive.

129
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,320
And a certain liar said that he could pay.

130
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,560
I’m not a fucking liar.

131
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,200
You told me it was free.
It’s you who’re the bad grownup.

132
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,480
I didn’t say it was free.

133
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,200
I just didn’t let you pay with money.

134
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,960
And I…

135
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,360
Don’t like ill-mannered boys.

136
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,480
Do you… Do you think I’d be afraid of you?

137
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,240
Are you okay?

138
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,920
The hell I am. I’ve stayed up
for three nights straight.

139
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,880
Oh, have you heard?
P’ Payu's at the faculty.

140
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,840
Really? That’s great.

141
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,960
I’ll have him review my work.
It’s been rejected so many times.

142
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,480
Move. Back off.

143
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Raise your voice and people
will find out we’re in here.

144
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,640
Shit, I brought this on myself.

145
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,800
What are you doing?

146
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,360
Call me P’ Payu.

147
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,200
In your dreams.

148
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,720
‘P’ Payu, please let Rain go.’
Say it.

149
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
No.

150
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,440
Fine by me.

151
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,400
What are you doing?

152
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,320
Want people to find out?

153
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,800
We’re gonna get caught.

154
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,360
P'... P’ Payu.

155
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,440
Please let Rain go.

156
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,640
'I promise that I won’t
swear at you again.'

157
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Say it.

158
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
I...

159
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,640
I promise that I won’t
swear at you again, P’ Payu.

160
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,400
Good job.

161
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,920
Those guys already left.

162
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
I told you I’m here to collect the debt.

163
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,920
And I also told you to speak nicely.

164
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,040
Since you didn’t listen to me,
I had no choice but to play hardball.

165
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,680
I don’t like kids who say bad words.

166
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,160
You weren’t trying to
force yourself on me?

167
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,040
I may not look it,
but I’m very particular.

168
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,080
I’m leaving.

169
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
Oh.

170
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,800
And if you say bad words again...

171
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,880
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

172
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,360
There won’t be next time!
Do you hear me, you bad senior!

173
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,880
Jerk, you’ll pay for this!

174
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,880
What the hell is wrong with you, Rain!

175
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,760
Hey, Rain!

176
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,920
What are you doing here?
Get up.

177
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,680
- I’m getting up right now.
- What do you mean? Get up!

178
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,440
I am getting up!

179
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,840
Huh?

180
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,560
I’m getting up.

181
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,520
You’re confusing me.
Get up. Like this.

182
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,720
No!

183
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,320
Not like that!
Get up, as in stand up.

184
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,640
How are you doing in classes?

185
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,760
I’m very overwhelmed.

186
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,920
I’m still struggling myself.

187
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,880
- Rain, calm down. Where are you going?
- Let go of me.

188
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,640
Oh Rain, what’s the matter?

189
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,800
P’ Som, Ple said you’re
close to P’ Payu. Is that true?

190
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,880
Of course, he's the
senior I respect very much.

191
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
What?

192
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,720
What’s wrong?
Why are you asking me this?

193
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,360
Do you know his weaknesses?

194
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,400
What’s wrong with you?

195
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,480
I’d never tell you even if I knew.
That’s my idol we’re talking about.

196
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,960
The fuck he is!

197
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,319
Rain, don’t cross the line.

198
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,319
- I’m sorry. Rain’s in a bad mood.
- Don't apologize.

199
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,760
Let’s go.

200
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,800
I’m not leaving.

201
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,920
If you’re really close to him, then
you should know where he’s racing.

202
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,839
Rain, you’re going too far!

203
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,760
And what the fuck are you
talking about? P’ Payu doesn’t race.

204
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,319
Oh, you actually don’t know, do you?

205
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,800
What the fuck do you mean?

206
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,360
I’m really sorry, P’ Som.
You know Rain’s got a foul mouth, right?

207
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,200
I’m sorry for his words.

208
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,920
I’ll find it out for you. Cool off!

209
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,440
If you know your friend’s a crazy
dog, you’d better put him on a leash.

210
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,640
Listen to me, Ple.
P’ Payu is a shady guy.

211
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,640
Rain, how would you feel if
someone you respect is insulted?

212
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,440
Yeah, that’s what I’m feeling right now.

213
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
Rain.

214
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,560
Have you gone insane?

215
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
That’s our senior.
And that’s the girl you’re crushing on.

216
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,600
I’m not insane. I’m just angry.

217
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,160
And I’m gonna get back at him.

218
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,680
Will you help me?

219
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,560
Isn't that a given?

220
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,240
You’re the best.

221
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,840
Don’t hug me.

222
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,320
- Come on.
- Stop.

223
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,920
Don't think I can't throw a tantrum.

224
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,400
What got you fired up?

225
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,440
Thought you wanted me to test the engine.

226
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,320
With such a skilled mechanic,
a racer won't be needed anymore.

227
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,600
If the racer doesn’t shut up,
I’m gonna find a replacement.

228
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,040
You know I’m a busy man.
I wouldn’t have come if it weren’t for you.

229
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,440
We’d better hurry.
Looks like it’s gonna rain.

230
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,440
I don’t see how it’s a problem.

231
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,680
Hold on.

232
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,160
If I remember correctly,
we both hate rain, don't we?

233
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,640
You always cancel races whenever it rains.

234
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,040
I hate to cancel the races because
I work my ass off to organize them.

235
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,920
But who says I hate rain?

236
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,560
I think I can guess.

237
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,600
I never let off anyone who owes me.

238
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,080
Is this ‘rain’ a cutie?

239
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,800
You can put it that way.

240
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,320
Looks like it’s about to start.

241
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,640
Welcome to Street Circuit.
Please state your name.

242
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,400
Welcome to Street Circuit.
Please state your name.

243
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,640
Are you sure this is the place?

244
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,840
That’s what the source told me.

245
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,440
What source?

246
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,440
You don’t need to know.

247
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Sky.

248
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,520
My ex.

249
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,320
But now that you’ve seen it,
let’s go home.

250
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,440
No.

251
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,400
Wait here. I don’t wanna cause you problem.

252
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,200
I’ll be gone for a sec.

253
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,280
Rain! Rain!

254
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,480
Rain! Rain!

255
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,720
What a troublemaker.

256
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,640
These people aren’t assholes like my ex.

257
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,040
Right?

258
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,520
Who exactly is P’ Payu?
Why is he at such an event?

259
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,800
Excuse me, who are you with?

260
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,920
I live around here.
I heard the noises, so I came to check.

261
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,080
So you don’t have permission to enter.

262
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,160
Hey, let me go!

263
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,760
I’ve caught a rat.

264
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,280
Catch him!

265
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,920
Stop!

266
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,200
Catch that brat!

267
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,760
Which daredevil’s causing a ruckus?

268
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,440
But the real devil’s right here.

269
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,760
Hey! Stop!

270
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Stop!

271
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,400
- Let me go. Let go!
- You little bastard.

272
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,280
Thank you, Mr. Payu.

273
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
What's up?

274
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,520
I think I’m screwed.

275
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,360
P’ Payu.

276
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,200
What a troublemaker you are.

277
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,840
Please give him to me.

278
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,080
I’ll take it from here.

279
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,800
It’s okay. I’ll take care of him.

280
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,920
This boy's with me.

281
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,960
But I must report this to the boss.

282
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,520
I'll do that myself.

283
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,920
Please ignore it once for my sake.

284
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,960
Okay.

285
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,680
But you should keep
a better eye on your boy.

286
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,240
I’m really screwed.
Totally screwed.

287
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,200
The most screwed I’ve ever been in my life.

288
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,240
Ouch! How dare you slap me!

289
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,760
- Even my parents don’t treat me like this!
- Keep yelling!

290
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,200
How could you do this to me?

291
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,880
Say something.

292
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,800
Do you realize what you did?

293
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
I…

294
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,480
Do you know what would
happen if I wasn’t there?

295
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
I’m sorry.

296
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,520
I’m asking if you know.
I don’t want your apology.

297
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,800
Wanna throw your future down the drain?

298
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,560
No matter how stupid you are,
if only you used your brain…

299
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,960
Then you would’ve realized how powerful
illegal street race’s organizers are.

300
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,640
Making a stupid brat disappear
is a piece of cake for them.

301
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
I…

302
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,520
I thought you were mature.

303
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,960
Don’t think that crying out for your
parents’ help can solve everything.

304
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,160
Some matters, Rain.

305
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,120
Can’t be solved with just apologies.

306
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,560
Grow up.

307
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,200
Don’t be a crybaby.

308
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,680
I didn’t mean to get anyone in trouble.

309
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,680
I just wanted to get back at you.

310
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,800
That’s all.

311
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,800
Stupid.

312
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,600
Go home.

313
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,760
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
That’s all you’ve been saying.

314
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,560
You keep calling me stupid!

315
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,360
Fine, I’m stupid for being reckless.

316
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,640
I’m brainless just like you said.

317
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,160
Just you wait.

318
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,840
I’ll make you so head over heels with me
that you won’t call me stupid ever again.

319
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,240
Then I’ll be waiting.

320
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,520
You’d better keep your word.

321
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,280
What the hell have I done?

322
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,720
Wanna make me fall for you?

323
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,480
I wasn’t gonna show you my bad side.

324
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,600
You wanna make me love you.

325
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,240
But do you know what kind of a man I am?

326
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,920
Just you wait.

327
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,520
I’ll make you so head over heels with me
that you won’t call me stupid ever again.

328
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,280
Damn, why did I say that?

329
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,159
What’s wrong?

330
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,239
Chickening out?

331
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,000
Who's chickening out?

332
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,480
I thought you gave up.

333
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,239
I won’t lose to you.

334
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,120
- You sure?
- Yeah.

335
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,120
Really?

336
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,760
I’m a man of my word.

337
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,600
Like I said, I will make
you fall in love with me.

338
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,120
Then go wash up
so you can have breakfast.

339
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,840
I bought them.
Not sure if I got the right size.

340
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,960
But judging from what I touched...

341
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,240
I think I got it right.

342
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,480
P’ Payu!

343
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Who the hell wears size S?
Mine’s not that small.

344
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,880
He knew my size just from feeling it?

345
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,280
I thought you slipped and
hit your head on the floor.

346
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,160
I’m the type to take a long shower.

347
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,920
I wonder if you’ll wash up for an hour or
a minute when you become a sophomore.

348
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,600
Have a seat.

349
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,040
Is it the right size?

350
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,720
No idea.

351
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,640
So you’re going commando.

352
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Just kidding.

353
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,800
Dig in. You can answer my questions later.

354
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,120
You didn’t put poison in the food, did you?

355
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,040
If I poisoned you, you wouldn’t
have been alive until now.

356
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,840
What’s that, P’ Payu?

357
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,080
The project plan I’m gonna
present to a client this Monday.

358
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,720
- May I have a look?
- Go ahead.

359
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,280
Wow, this is awesome.

360
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,240
I wish I could creat a project like this.

361
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,040
You will one day.

362
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,520
Hey!

363
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,600
It’s the right size.

364
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,720
P’ Payu!

365
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,640
Aren’t you gonna make me fall for you?
But you get embarrassed pretty easily.

366
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,440
I wish I could see the look on
your face when you put it on.

367
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,320
It’s the same look as I’m having.

368
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,440
Are your parents home?

369
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,160
Why do you ask?

370
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,440
I'm gonna ask them for forgiveness.

371
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,280
Hey, you made fun of me?

372
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,400
Because you looked funny.

373
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,080
Oh? Is this all you’ve got?

374
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,920
Let go of me and I’ll show
you how much I’ve got.

375
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,520
Let go.

376
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,560
What are you doing?

377
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,360
What do you think I’m doing?

378
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,960
You think I’m gonna kiss you?

379
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,400
That’s not what I think.

380
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,160
You don’t like me.

381
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,160
Yes, I haven’t liked you.

382
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,960
Do you know that becoming a sophomore
means you’ll be studying harder...

383
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,320
Getting more stressed
and more works?

384
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,400
If you can’t manage, then you
can kiss your free time goodbye.

385
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,000
I know, but why are you bringing this up?

386
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,400
What I'm trying to say is...

387
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,520
You must won me over
before going into second year.

388
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,200
But as far as I can see...

389
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,000
I don’t think you can make it.

390
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,560
Don’t underestimate me.

391
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,840
Just you wait. I’ll make you
fall for me within a month.

392
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,960
A month, it is.

393
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,600
I’ll be waiting.

394
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,760
Go on.

395
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,280
Get inside your house.

396
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,960
I have to go to work.

397
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,320
He kept calling me stupid.
And now he’s looking down on me.

398
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,840
I'll make you swallow
your words. Just you wait.

399
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,080
Wait.

400
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,840
Why do I feel like I’m
dancing to P’ Payu’s tune?

401
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,040
Nah, I’m not that stupid.

402
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,680
I’m leaving early today.

403
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,680
You can punish me
later if you’re unhappy.

404
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,680
- I’ll have Saifha replace me.
- Hey!

405
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,640
You’re disobeying P’ Pakin?
This is an important event.

406
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,160
But something’s more important.

407
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,640
Let go of me!

408
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
Let go!

409
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,280
English Subtitle by Saowalak K.

410
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,840
I'm hungry.
Go get some food with me.

411
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,600
I might fall for you faster.

412
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,640
I'm hitting on this guy.
Please wish me luck.

413
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,360
Don't give up, stupid boy.

414
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,080
Try replacing my 'stupid' with 'cute'.
