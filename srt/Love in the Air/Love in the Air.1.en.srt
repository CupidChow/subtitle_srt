1
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,030
Not Just Rain but a Raging Storm

2
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,070
- Ready?
- We’re all set, Mr. Payu.

3
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,450
Hey. It’s rare to see you go all out today.

4
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,360
Higher-ups’ order.
But you like it too, right?

5
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,400
Your babies are such beauties.
Of course, I like them.

6
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,590
They’re P’ Pakin’s babies.

7
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,840
I don’t dare to mess with that guy.

8
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,870
Nice bike, by the way.

9
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,820
We’d better go home.

10
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,170
No. Wait here.

11
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,730
I don’t wanna cause you problem.

12
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,550
I’ll be gone for a sec.

13
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,620
Rain! Rain!

14
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,950
What a troublemaker.

15
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,970
Who exactly is P’ Payu?
Why is he at such an event?

16
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,260
Excuse me, who are you with?

17
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,440
I live around here.
I heard the noises, so I came to check.

18
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,510
So you don’t have permission to enter.

19
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,670
Hey, let me go!

20
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,330
I’ve caught a rat.

21
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,820
Catch him!

22
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,470
Stop!

23
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,800
Catch that man!

24
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,390
Which daredevil’s causing a ruckus?

25
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,970
But the real devil’s right here.

26
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,250
Hey! Stop!

27
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,310
Stop!

28
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,940
- Let me go. Let go!
- You little bastard.

29
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,900
Thank you, Mr. Payu.

30
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,170
What's up?

31
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,010
I think I’m screwed.

32
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,830
P’ Payu.

33
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,560
What a troublemaker you are.

34
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,300
You probably wonder how
an ordinary boy like me...

35
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,870
ended up on illegal street racetrack.

36
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,920
It all started three weeks ago.

37
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,900
3 Weeks Ago

38
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,850
It’s raining all over Bangkok.

39
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,990
To all drivers out there,
please drive safely.

40
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:41,490
And on this lonely rainy day,
let’s listen to some relaxing love songs.

41
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,110
What’s happening to my baby?

42
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,600
Daddy. Mommy.
What’s Rain going to do?

43
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,970
And it’s raining too.
Damn, just my luck.

44
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,020
What am I gonna do?

45
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,550
Why does it have to be now? Dammit.

46
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,930
What am I gonna do?

47
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,550
Shit, how do I fix it?

48
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,610
Huh? What?

49
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,250
Turn on the hazard lights.
I’ll check the tire.

50
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,120
- Really?
- Hurry up.

51
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,150
Go wait in the car. It’s pouring.
I’ll take care of things here.

52
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,920
I can’t help you change the tire,
but I can shelter you from the rain.

53
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,500
Can I help you with anything else?

54
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,290
Hold this for me.

55
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,900
Thank you. I wouldn’t know
what to do without you.

56
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,600
Learn the basics about cars.
Don’t just drive.

57
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,150
It's so that you can
fix it yourself next time.

58
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,990
Alright, it’s done.

59
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,760
Oh.

60
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,800
Helmet.

61
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,640
You’re so handsome.

62
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,510
Wait, no. I mean...

63
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,620
Thanks for the compliment.

64
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,800
I’ll have it back.

65
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,070
Don’t go blow your tire up again.

66
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,280
Run along now.
You’ll get sick from the rain.

67
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,910
Go on. I wanna go home too.

68
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,560
Yes, yes. Thank you.

69
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,910
So damn cool.

70
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,060
When he saw that I got
back on the road, he drove off.

71
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,880
I thought I was gonna get stabbed to death.

72
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,530
Not only is he kind, but he’s
also got great skills. And he’s so…

73
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,820
Drop-dead handsome that puts
even idols and angels to shame, right?

74
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,520
How did you know?

75
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,800
This is the third time you’re telling me.

76
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,600
I just wanna tell you.
Can’t you hear me out?

77
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,900
Hey, do you realize that
you’re very annoying?

78
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,800
And do you know that you’re heartless?
You won’t even listen to me.

79
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,840
Don’t know. Don’t care.

80
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,880
Just hear me out.

81
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,420
Fine, so this is how you want it.

82
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,260
Wanna snatch my phone?

83
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,730
You’re a meanie.

84
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,680
Yes, I absolutely am.
And do you know?

85
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,540
I understand now why such a good
looking man who looks like Korean actor...

86
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,230
can’t get a single girlfriend.

87
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,660
Fuck, don’t add insult to injury.

88
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,830
I’m telling the truth.

89
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,590
Hey. What are you guys talking about?

90
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,500
Can I do anything for you, Ple?

91
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,680
No, but Sky can.

92
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,510
Nothing. I'm gaming. Keep talking.

93
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,620
You hooked up behind my back?

94
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,930
I did no such thing. Are you crazy?

95
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,850
So what do you want?

96
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,230
It’s about class activity next month.
Do you have the senior’s document forms?

97
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,600
Document forms?

98
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,680
Oh, I do.

99
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,280
I just met P’ Payu last month.
I asked for them from him.

100
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,740
You met P’ Payu? How?
Didn’t he already graduate?

101
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,960
He came to the faculty?
How did you meet him? How?

102
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,130
Too close. Too close.
Enough. Split up.

103
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,650
Sorry. How did you meet him?

104
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,130
Who’s P’ Payu?

105
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,220
You don’t know him?

106
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,860
You don’t know P’ Payu?
The P’ Payu.

107
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,470
P’ Payu who?

108
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,070
The one the professors often talk about.
Every senior knows him.

109
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,470
He won many design awards.

110
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,160
And got the second prize
from World Star Contest too.

111
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,570
- Most importantly.
- Most importantly?

112
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,950
P’ Payu is extremely handsome!

113
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,570
He was our faculty’s president
for three years in a row.

114
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:34,240
And he got an A from every
assignment. He’s the best.

115
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,390
- How many assignments do you want today?
- 10.

116
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,120
Umm... Two, Ajarn.

117
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,540
Four, then.

118
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,260
- But…
- Five.

119
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,660
Five, Ajarn.

120
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,430
We’ll continue later.

121
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,980
So no assignments for me, Ajarn? Okay.

122
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,590
Serves you right.

123
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,420
You can share some with me. I’m free.

124
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,760
Any assignment to share? No?

125
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,280
Any assignment to share? Gimme.

126
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,700
And you? Give it to me.

127
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,910
Apart from massive homework...

128
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,520
I have to listen to my crush
talk about another guy too.

129
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,490
Wonderful, isn’t it?
Damn you, P’ Payu.

130
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,390
Let’s continue.

131
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,720
P' Payu's handsome, an excellent
student, and the department’s god.

132
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,310
He's super-duper nice too.

133
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,870
My brother’s his keen admirer.

134
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,010
I chose this uni because
I heard of him from my brother.

135
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,960
It’s a shame he graduated when I got in.

136
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,590
I heard his family owns
some kind of business.

137
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:14,520
That’s right. But nobody
knows what it is. I’m so curious.

138
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,430
But a guy with secrets
has a certain charm too.

139
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,220
Oh.

140
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,050
Here to check the work, Mr. Payu?

141
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,560
Can’t be negligent.
The client’s a big gun this time.

142
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,750
I’ll take you to it.

143
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,710
He won’t let anyone but you touch his baby.

144
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,220
Here’s the new bike. Have fun.

145
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,430
I need to do my best as well.

146
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,770
Nobody wants to mess with the big shots.

147
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,810
By big shots, do you mean ‘The Mafia’?

148
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:12,339
Think about it, Rain.
My brother barely praises anyone.

149
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,230
But P’ Som’s been praising P’ Payu
since his first year until he’s a senior.

150
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,990
Is your brother gay?
Why does he praise P’ Payu?

151
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,730
If P’ Som’s gay, then
you’ve turned gay before him.

152
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,530
You were praising
the big bike bro just now.

153
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,050
I only admire him.

154
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,670
We only admire P’ Payu too.

155
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,060
Don’t mind him, Ple.
He’s been sharp tongued lately.

156
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,960
Forget it, I don’t mind him
talking bad about P’ Som.

157
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,940
But he said as if being gay
is a bad thing. I don’t like it.

158
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,980
Sky, send me the forms
when you get them. Gotta go.

159
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,080
Ple.

160
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,040
I don’t think being gay is a bad thing.

161
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,390
-  I just…
- Spoke without thinking.

162
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,890
I have three words for you.

163
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,330
You are rejected.

164
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,590
Not yet. I’m still pursuing her.

165
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,300
And you’re so good at it.

166
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,660
Rejected? We’re still getting
to know each other though.

167
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,900
P’ Payu, that bastard.

168
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,670
Why do I have to compete for a
girl with someone I’ve never met?

169
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,250
You’re not as handsome as my Big Bike Bro.

170
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,870
Wait for me.

171
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,580
Ple, need help?

172
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,470
It’s okay, just do your own work.

173
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,670
Ple, let me carry them for you.

174
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,680
It’s okay, I can do it.

175
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,050
Wanna get something to eat?
How about bingsu at your favorite café?

176
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,540
I’ll take you there, okay?

177
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,140
Rain.

178
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,020
Yes?

179
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,880
I’ve already eaten.

180
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,250
Aren’t you gonna drink?

181
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,980
I don’t drink, Senior.

182
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,490
But this is a frat dinner party.

183
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,620
What about you, Rain?

184
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,620
I drove here.

185
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,210
Just a sip. Come on.

186
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,150
Don’t bully him, or the
kid will curse you out.

187
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,990
I won’t do it.

188
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,960
Not you. I’m talking about that cocky guy.

189
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,520
Well, you say he’s cocky.

190
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,740
But didn’t you guys fight to
recruit him when he graduated?

191
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,670
Everyone knows he’s a fine diamond.
But I heard he rejected every offer.

192
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,090
I wonder why. He was
offered very high salaries.

193
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,590
If I were him, I’d jump at the chance.

194
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,110
I heard he didn’t wanna
rely on connections.

195
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,450
Come on.

196
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,750
If he’s got connections,
then it’s purely because of his talent.

197
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,850
That's just like him.

198
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,910
Yeah.

199
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,150
He’s goddamn cocky.

200
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,040
But you guys love him just as goddamn much.

201
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,520
Umm, who’re you talking about?

202
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,120
What? How come you don’t
know the handsome guy?

203
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,700
Oh, I guess he already
graduated when Rain got in.

204
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,020
Oh.

205
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,110
But he often stops by.
In the right place, at the time too.

206
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,070
The faculty budget gave
the council a big headache once.

207
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,570
He solved the problem
in less than half an hour.

208
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,140
Outsiders call him
‘Faculty of Architecture’s Hottie’.

209
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,580
But the council members
call him ‘The Messiah’.

210
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,200
Sounds majestic.

211
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,090
Damn, that’s one heavy storm.

212
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:27,440
Guess the sky’s paving
the way for the latecomer.

213
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,590
Everyone, big applause for
Mr. Payu who came with a storm.

214
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,780
Do you realize what time it is?
Everyone’s about to leave.

215
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,970
Am I too late?

216
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,840
You brought a storm with you,
so how are we going to leave?

217
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,800
Yeah.

218
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,490
P’ Payu, Sawasdee Ka.

219
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,910
Hey, you’re that P’ Payu.

220
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,940
Yes, I’m Payu.

221
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,030
And who are you?

222
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,010
I’m going home, everyone.
Sawasdee Krub.

223
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,960
Forget it, Rain. No need to thank
him when he doesn’t remember you.

224
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,420
Let’s go home.

225
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,950
Enough, Rain. Go home.

226
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,910
Don't tell me.

227
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,510
Let’s try again.
Probably a tiny jerk.

228
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,830
This is bad.

229
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,560
Man, just my goddamn luck.
Why am I so unlucky with cars?

230
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,830
Dammit, Rain.

231
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,580
You stupid head!

232
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:25,120
Wait, I need to make a call.
Yes, that’s right. Make a call.

233
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,500
But who should I call?

234
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,060
A mechanic.

235
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,470
But I don’t have the number.
Oh, the insurance company.

236
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,390
But my car didn’t break down.
Can I still make the call?

237
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,120
Who am I supposed to call?
Who do people call at a time like this?

238
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,220
Who should I call?
I don’t have the mechanic’s number.

239
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,820
P’ Payu!

240
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,500
Are you okay? I heard the car horn.

241
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,440
My car broke down.

242
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,320
It was fine earlier,
but now I can’t start it.

243
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,260
Help me, P’ Payu. Please.

244
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,190
Please help me.

245
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,180
You’re Rain, right?

246
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,950
Yes, my name is Rain.

247
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,040
If you’re trying to seduce me,
do it better next time.

248
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,220
I must have misheard.
Yeah, I must have really misheard.

249
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,120
The boiler’s leaking.

250
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,380
The starter dynamo's sound
shows that there’s a problem.

251
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,640
You have to leave the car here tonight.

252
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,620
No garage’s gonna get
through the rain to tow your car.

253
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,930
You need to wait until the morning.

254
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,810
That is, if the rain doesn’t flood Bangkok.

255
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,020
I’m leaving.

256
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,230
Hey! Don’t leave me like this.

257
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,210
Can you recommend a garage for me?
I just need to tow my car right now.

258
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,610
Do you have any in mind?

259
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,200
I do know one.

260
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,590
But it’s expensive.
Can you pay?

261
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,970
Yes.

262
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,330
Hello, P’ Aon. I need
you to tow a car for me.

263
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,600
They're coming.

264
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,080
See? I really misheard.

265
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,690
A nice guy like P’ Payu
wouldn’t say something like that.

266
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,880
Hey, where are you going?

267
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,340
Getting my bike.

268
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,850
Umm, thank you for
letting me use the bathroom.

269
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,120
Sky, I think I’ve found out
about P’ Payu’s family’s business.

270
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,710
You should have told me
your family owns a garage.

271
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,920
And a luxurious one at that.

272
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,810
You didn’t ask.

273
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:48,860
I wouldn’t have been reluctant to come
with you if you told me in the first place.

274
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,520
Didn’t you say we need to
talk about the fee?

275
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,050
Come sit here.

276
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,040
Let me wipe your hair.

277
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,120
Tell me if I’m too rough.

278
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,860
So nice.

279
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,950
Want me to keep wiping?

280
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,030
Will you?

281
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,150
Hey, what are you doing?

282
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,870
Hold on, what are you trying to do?

283
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,610
I'm collecting the fee.

284
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,610
You’re gay, P’ Payu?

285
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,950
To be honest, I’m bi.

286
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,960
And you approached me first, Rain.

287
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,640
I did not.

288
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,350
Your boiler suddenly leaked.
Your car wouldn’t start.

289
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:20,420
You wouldn’t let go of my hand.
Stared at me during the party.

290
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,500
It’s true I looked at you, but...

291
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,020
you got it wrong.

292
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,380
Really?

293
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,980
What you did was throwing yourself at me.

294
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,680
You’re getting the wrong idea.
Let go of me.

295
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,860
You mustn’t enjoy this, Rain. Struggle!

296
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,190
You can’t escape with
such half-ass struggle.

297
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,920
Shit, this is bad.
Why the hell is he so handsome?

298
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,820
But you must stop now, Rain.

299
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,730
Let me go.

300
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,120
Stop playing hard to get.

301
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,910
You’re the one who followed me here.

302
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,100
Does this mean this whole time,
P’ Payu’s been thinking that I…

303
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,200
Die, you fucking bastard!

304
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,170
Asshole, I didn’t throw myself at you.
Never thought of it.

305
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,080
What a waste of your looks.

306
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,380
Even if you throw money at me,
I won’t give in to you.

307
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,510
Where are you going?

308
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,740
Home. I don’t wanna stay with you.

309
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,950
Go ahead.

310
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,130
The mechanics must be awake by now.

311
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,430
You won’t go farther than
three steps in this state.

312
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,370
What are you gonna do?

313
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,130
Go to sleep.
I’m not in the mood anymore.

314
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,160
Who’d believe you?

315
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,930
Keep it down if you wanna stay.

316
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,910
I’m gonna sleep.

317
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,270
Are you for real?

318
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
I survived.

319
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,140
Being fully clothed doesn’t
mean nothing happened.

320
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,050
Don’t touch me!

321
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,590
Don’t flatter yourself.
I just wanna get the blanket.

322
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,650
You’re an asshole.

323
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,370
What did you say?

324
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,520
I said, you’re an asshole!

325
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:00,980
And do you wanna see
what the real asshole can do?

326
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,000
- Scared?
- No way.

327
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,610
Look who’s talking.

328
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,610
I meant what I said.

329
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,400
Really? Then...

330
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,900
let me have a taste.

331
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,380
Go fuck yourself, bastard!

332
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,560
Hey, why won’t it open?

333
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,460
Rain.

334
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,750
I’m warning you as your frat bro.

335
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,190
Don’t be so good at being dumb.

336
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,190
Why aren’t you leaving?

337
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,370
Wanna continue?

338
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,910
Bear this in mind.

339
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:53,060
I’m gonna tell everyone that
you’re an asshole, P’ Payu!

340
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,469
Shut the hell up!
I don’t wanna hear you.

341
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,440
I told you to shut it.

342
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,570
Dammit! I hate both
the guy and the weather.

343
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,250
Should I take you to a doctor?

344
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,429
I’m fine.

345
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,770
Then do you have anything to tell me?

346
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:48,570
Since you attended the frat party
last week, you’ve suddenly gone crazy.

347
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,179
I mean, picked a fight with everyone.

348
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,949
Don't tell me...

349
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,490
it’s about P’ Payu.

350
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,820
Don’t say that name.

351
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,740
Rain.

352
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,700
I don’t know what you went through.

353
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,640
But ever since I knew P’ Payu,
he’s been a very nice senior.

354
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,040
You don’t know anything.
Dammit, stop asking me.

355
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,350
I don’t wanna talk about him, think
about his face, or hear his voice.

356
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,100
And you. Stop rumbling.

357
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,360
I don’t wanna hear you.

358
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:43,150
What a perfect timing.
Dammit. Hello!

359
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,570
Oh. Yes.

360
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,450
I can go tomorrow, right?

361
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,980
Yes. Okay.

362
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,640
Sky, I forgot.

363
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,300
I need to pick my car up at the garage.

364
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,570
What does that mean?

365
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,200
It means I’m gonna meet P’ Payu.

366
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,180
Damn, I’m going crazy!
What do I do?

367
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,380
Rainy my buddy, let me tell you something.

368
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:33,340
A kitty who tries to go against a tiger.

369
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:37,070
I don’t need to tell you
what’s gonna happen.

370
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,990
I’m going to class. Bye. Fighting!

371
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,630
Do I really have to meet him?

372
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,220
Fuck!

373
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,240
Will you just stop?
I don’t wanna hear you!

374
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,980
What am I gonna do?

375
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,110
Why do I have to pick up my car?
Why do I have to meet him again?

376
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,520
Mr. Rain. Excuse me.

377
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,890
- Mr. Rain, can you hear me?
- Yes, please give me a minute.

378
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,850
Okay.

379
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:46,540
- Excuse me, about the payment.
- Yes?

380
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,810
Oh, I remember you.

381
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,070
You’re Mr. Payu’s boy.

382
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,210
Remember me?
I towed your car the other day.

383
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,990
Oh, it’s you.
I’m here to pick it up.

384
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:04,040
Oh, so you’re Mr. Payu’s boy.

385
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,650
- No, I’m not.
- Yeah, he’s the one.

386
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,570
Mr. Payu’s at the back.
I’ll take you to him.

387
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,530
I’m not going.

388
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,890
Well, I almost forgot that
I had an appointment today.

389
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,310
Yes, I need to hurry.
I’m really in a hurry.

390
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,240
- I’ll take you to your car.
- Oh, let’s go.

391
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,040
The boiler was leaking and
the stater dynamo was broken.

392
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,560
So we replaced both parts for you.

393
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,140
We also changed the battery.
The previous one was very old.

394
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,090
The battery too?

395
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,400
It’s necessary.

396
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:56,990
Oh, all the tires were worn out.
We replaced all of them.

397
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,070
You never checked your
car’s health at all, right?

398
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,250
- All of them?
- Yeah.

399
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,460
So brand new.

400
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,310
See this?

401
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,470
Shiny like new.

402
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,010
Mr. Payu told us to polish and wax it.

403
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,810
Sparkling.

404
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,590
How much does everything cost?

405
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,700
Mr. Payu didn’t tell you that it’s free?

406
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,680
Huh?

407
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,960
And he fixed everything himself.

408
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,190
That’s why everyone knows
that you’re Mr. Payu’s boy.

409
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,880
Hey! I’m not your Mr. Payu’s boy.

410
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:45,030
How do I know that your boss
didn’t do anything weird to my car?

411
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,240
Oh? You don’t know anything at all?

412
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,120
Do I have to?

413
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,710
Over there.

414
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:00,700
See that race bike?
It belongs to a big shot.

415
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:04,790
The owner only trusts Mr. Payu.

416
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,700
Let me tell you this.

417
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:11,610
Mr. Payu always works his
magic on every vehicle he touches.

418
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,870
I don’t wanna brag,
but I can’t help it.

419
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,660
Because my boss is a real expert.

420
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,220
He works full-time.

421
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,530
And has to finish tuning these
bikes before next Friday’s race.

422
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,760
Well, what do you think?

423
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,250
Are you interested in
becoming Mr. Payu’s boy?

424
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,880
Sign here.

425
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,430
So diligent.

426
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,660
Your boy’s left.

427
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,990
Just like you said,
he wouldn’t meet you.

428
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,500
What did you do to him?

429
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,320
I haven't done anything.

430
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,190
He winked.

431
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,610
He’s planning to do something.

432
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,330
Let's continue.

433
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,570
So you can still sleep
after causing all the ruckus.

434
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,200
I’m starting to like you.

435
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,490
If Saifha hears about this,
he’ll probably feel sorry for you.

436
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,870
I’m really starting to like you.

437
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,190
Rain.

438
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,690
English Subtitle by Saowalak K.

439
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,770
Hiding from debt collectors?

440
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,230
- I held...
- Held?

441
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,150
If you're really close to him,
then you'll know where he's racing.

442
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,920
Rain, you're going too far.

443
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,110
I'm brainless just like you said!
