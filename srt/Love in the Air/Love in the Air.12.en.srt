1
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
I've made up my mind, P' Pai.

2
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,880
I meant what I said.
I won't stop you anymore.

3
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,080
My ex is the one who pierced my nipples.

4
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,240
Don't wear the rings anymore.

5
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,560
It’s to assure someone that
I’ve told everyone I’m taken.

6
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,039
Ouch!

7
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,160
What happened, P’ Pai?

8
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Just a tiny cut.
It doesn’t hurt.

9
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,560
It’s nothing compared
to falling off a bike.

10
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,000
Don’t take this lightly.

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,760
My friend had to have
stitches because of a cut before.

12
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,760
And I recently changed the blade.

13
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,680
It’s so sharp you can
stab people to death.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,480
Is the wound deep?
The bleeding won’t stop.

15
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,040
It’s starting to hurt.

16
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,640
I told you the wound’s deep.
We need to go to the doctor.

17
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,440
Why are you smiling?

18
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,000
‘Cause the pain makes me go crazy?

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,720
This is not the time to joke around.

20
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,520
I’m sorry.

21
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,360
You’re worried about me,
so I can’t help smiling.

22
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,240
I’m not worried.

23
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,120
Give me your hand.

24
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
- Ouch!
- Oh!

25
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,400
- Ouch!
- Ah!

26
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
P’ Pai.

27
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,400
Don’t let it get wet and
apply antiseptics every day.

28
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,760
Worried about me?

29
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,680
I think it’ll heal faster if you kiss it.

30
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,960
Have a speedy recovery, P’ Pai.

31
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,960
- Can you do it one more time?
- No.

32
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
So cute.

33
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,040
You’ve become sillier since I last saw you.

34
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,760
You said as if it was ages ago.
We met last week at the race.

35
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,880
Last week…

36
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
It was him last week.

37
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,440
If you can’t tell us apart...

38
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,720
It’s like you can’t differentiate
a husky from a bulldog.

39
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,760
I’ll be the husky.

40
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,880
‘Cause you bark a lot?

41
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,680
Sorry, I’ve been only
thinking about my boy.

42
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:52,560
He’s a gentleboy in the streets,
but a freak in the sheets.

43
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,240
I thought I only liked the sex.

44
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,960
But when I got to know him better…

45
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,000
He’s a delicate and lonely
boy who wants to be loved.

46
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,880
He always asks when I’ll get bored but
happily sneaks at me when I go see him.

47
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,200
And he smiles when
he thinks I don’t notice.

48
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,440
He hugs me when he thinks I’m sleeping.

49
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,680
I keep thinking about him all the time!

50
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Let him be.

51
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,440
He’s just a baby learning to love.

52
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,480
Okay, I got it.

53
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,560
So are you coming this weekend?

54
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
To where?

55
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,400
P’ Off’s birthday party.

56
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,240
I guess I’ll stop by.

57
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,680
Can you go shopping with me this weekend?

58
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,840
Hey, I can’t go anymore.

59
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,000
I think the weather will
be lovely this weekend.

60
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,800
Perfect for a date, don’t you think?

61
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,280
How does he know
the weather will be lovely?

62
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,840
When the Sky Surrenders to the Wind

63
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,040
Do you know people are looking at you?

64
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,240
They’re looking at you.

65
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,880
I know, ‘cause I’m irresistibly charming.

66
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,400
But the only one who can look at me is you.

67
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,120
I’ve got an idea.
I’ll get couple T-shirts for us next time.

68
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,120
Mine will say ‘Will you marry me?’
While yours will be ‘Yes!’

69
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,520
Or ‘The boy beside me is taken’ for me.

70
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,520
As for yours…

71
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,480
‘The guy next to me is my hubby.’

72
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
What do you think?

73
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,440
Let’s get couple T-shirts
after the shopping.

74
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,120
Something’s wrong with your brain.

75
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,680
But I still made you smile.

76
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,720
Who says I smiled?
I didn’t.

77
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,000
Need a mirror?

78
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
No.

79
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,880
You’re buying stationery?
But you’ve still got plenty of it.

80
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,160
I left them at the faculty
the other day and they were all gone.

81
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,960
That’s just how it is.

82
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,400
If you lose your wallet there,
it’ll be left untouched.

83
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,600
But your stationery
will be completely gone.

84
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,480
I’m gonna put name
tag stickers on this time.

85
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,080
What’s the matter?

86
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,320
Don’t they sell these
items at the university?

87
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,000
The mall sells them cheaper.

88
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,640
That’s news to me.

89
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,960
I thought you just wanted
to bring me out on a date.

90
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,960
It’s really cheaper here.
This one’s cheaper. This one too.

91
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
Even this one’s cheaper.

92
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,440
- Are they really cheaper?
- They are!

93
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,240
Eat your meat.
I can grill mine.

94
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,560
Just eat it.

95
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,600
Why did you choose this place?

96
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,800
I wanted to eat here.

97
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,600
Isn’t it because I told you
that I love barbecue?

98
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,440
No.

99
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
So happy.

100
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,800
Here, eat it.
You’ve gotten thinner since you got sick.

101
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,280
P’ Pai, don’t play with food.

102
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,400
I’m not playing.
I’m trying to feed you.

103
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Open your mouth.

104
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,560
If you don’t open your mouth,
I’ll force it open with mine.

105
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,440
P’ Pai, everyone’s looking at us.

106
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,720
Just let them.
I don't care.

107
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,920
‘Cause all I care about is you.

108
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
If you don’t eat, I won’t eat too.

109
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
People will misunderstand
that you’re my boyfriend.

110
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,000
You’re right.

111
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,320
- Excuse me.
- Can I get you anything else?

112
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,440
No, I think you must’ve
misunderstood something.

113
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,200
I’ll correct it.

114
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,320
This guy’s my wife, not boyfriend.

115
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,000
And a bowl of rice for him please.

116
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
- Yes, yes, please wait a moment.
- Thank you.

117
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,440
P’ Pai, what have you just said!

118
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,560
A certain boy looked like
he wanted me to clarify.

119
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,000
Or you want me to say
as well that I’m your hubby?

120
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Excuse me.

121
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,160
It’s nothing.

122
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,920
Don’t make that face.

123
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,160
Your blushing’s gonna
make my heart skip a beat.

124
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,600
I’m not blushing or anything.
My face’s red because of the hot smoke.

125
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Hot smoke?

126
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Yeah.

127
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Hello.

128
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Okay.

129
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,880
I’ll stop by.

130
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Yes.

131
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,240
Weather forecast from today’s
morning until tomorrow morning.

132
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,960
Monsoon trough causes weather
changes across the country.

133
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,040
Today’s my senior’s birthday.

134
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,720
I wasn’t gonna go, but
the birthday boy is insistent.

135
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,880
He called me again just now.

136
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,120
So I’ll fetch the present, give it
to him, and we’ll leave after that.

137
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,400
You should go to the party.
I’ll just go home.

138
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,920
No, I wanna take you home.
Promise it won’t take long.

139
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,880
Do you like this room?

140
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,880
It’s beautiful.

141
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,120
Then I’ll give it to you.

142
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,000
This room’s filled with memories of you.

143
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,360
I don’t have any reasons
to come here without you.

144
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,480
This is where you did that
to me for the first time.

145
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,800
This is where I dragged you to the bedroom.

146
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,080
And I remember you ripped my shirt off.

147
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,680
I’m not the only one.

148
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,960
Don’t you use this room
to screw other people too?

149
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,080
You know I’ve stopped
doing that for months.

150
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,720
I don’t know when it started.

151
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,800
But when you snarl at me...

152
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,680
I want you to do it again.

153
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,320
When you tell me to stay away...

154
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,240
I want you to admit that
you want me to stay close.

155
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,960
Or when you tell me to get bored,
I wanna tell you that I won’t.

156
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,800
My feelings are so overwhelmed.
What should I do?

157
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,720
Just tell me what to do
‘cause I like you so much.

158
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,000
Please look at me.

159
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,000
Why?

160
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,760
I wanna kiss you.

161
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,680
I want you to kiss me too.

162
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,040
I want you to like me.

163
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,920
Are you in a hurry to go back?

164
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,280
- Birthday party.
- Screw it!

165
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,960
- I can skip morning class.
- Nice.

166
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,119
I’m yours, all yours.

167
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,760
Wanna come with me?

168
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,720
I’ll just wait here.
I don’t know anyone.

169
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,920
Give me 10 minutes, no,
five minutes and I’ll take you home.

170
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
- Hurry back.
- Yes.

171
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,960
Are you out of your mind, Sky?

172
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,000
‘I’m yours’? ‘All yours’?
Why did you say that?

173
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,000
How shameless of you.

174
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,800
Hey, P’ Pai.
I thought you weren’t coming.

175
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,920
I wouldn’t have come if
the birthday boy hadn’t called me.

176
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,800
- Where’s he?
- Inside.

177
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,000
Why do you look cranky?

178
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,760
Yeah, I’m very cranky.

179
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,280
I just wanna give the present
and go the fuck home.

180
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,200
As if someone’s waiting for you at home.

181
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
There is.

182
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,040
Woah, who’s it?
Tell me.

183
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,120
P’ Pai, didn’t you say you’d contact me?
Where have you been?

184
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,720
I couldn’t reach you at all.

185
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,120
Damn, who’s this guy again?

186
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,360
Excuse me, where’s the toilet?

187
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,680
Why doesn’t P’ Payu come to the party?

188
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,280
He’s your target?

189
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,720
You lost your chance.
‘Cause P’ Payu says he’s got a boyfriend.

190
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,640
Why don’t you go for P’ Pai?

191
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,560
He’s hot, playful, and…too.

192
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,920
You had it off with him?

193
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,920
He’s not as hard as you think.

194
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,080
It’s fine as long as you
don’t try to tie him down.

195
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,440
But I think you won’t get a chance tonight.

196
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,760
Someone’s set their sights on
him ever since he appeared.

197
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
Again…

198
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,120
It’s happening again.

199
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,800
It’s happening to me again.

200
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,720
Please let go of me.
I’ve got to go home.

201
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,320
No, I won’t let you go no matter what.

202
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,760
P’ Pai, is it true that
you’ve got a boyfriend?

203
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,600
Yes.
I’ve got a boyfriend, so let me go.

204
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,040
Is he cuter than me?

205
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,240
Yes, he’s very cute.

206
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,640
Cuter than everyone I’ve met.

207
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,520
Don’t smile like that.

208
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,600
Do you know how much I’ve missed you?

209
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,840
I’ve been waiting for your call every day.

210
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,720
Yes, I know.

211
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,920
Next time...

212
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,320
Don’t call me.
Don’t wait for me.

213
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,120
I’ve stopped fooling around.
Go play with someone else.

214
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You’re sleeping?

215
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,200
I wanna go back.

216
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,200
Get some rest.
I’ll wake you up when we get there.

217
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,880
Gun, I saw your boy.

218
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,680
Who are you talking about?

219
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,040
His name’s Spy or something.

220
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,840
- Sky?
- Yeah, Sky.

221
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,560
The one you let me borrow him.
The one who said he loved you so much.

222
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,840
He kept saying ‘I love you,
P’ Gun. Don’t do this to me.’

223
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,480
Man, I still remember that.

224
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,640
Guess who was with him today.

225
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,040
Holy shit, it’s P’ Pai.
Looks like he’s P’ Pai’s boy now.

226
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,600
Sky is P’ Pai’s boy?
This is getting interesting.

227
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,480
I wonder if he forgets everything I taught.

228
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,400
I’m claiming ownership.

229
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,120
This room’s filled with memories of you.

230
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,480
I don’t have any reasons
to come here without you.

231
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,800
Working today.
Won’t go back to the dorm.

232
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,280
Don’t forget to eat.
Call me when you finish it.

233
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,960
Have you finished?
Why didn’t you call me?

234
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,640
- I was sleeping.
- I’ll go see you today.

235
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,200
I’m meeting the seniors today.

236
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,160
I’m busy.
Too busy to talk.

237
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,680
I’m tired today.
I’ll call you back.

238
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,240
I’ve got a meeting.
Frat dinner.

239
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,760
Got to meet Rain.
Got work to do.

240
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,680
Appointment with teachers.
Meeting with seniors.

241
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,880
Don’t come.
Project review today.

242
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,640
What the hell?
Did I do something wrong?

243
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,240
Looks like Nong Sky
hasn’t returned for days.

244
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,920
I hung the takeouts here
after I received them.

245
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,600
I threw some of them away
when they started to spoil.

246
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,360
Thank you so much, P’ Joy.

247
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,000
Sky’s been working on
assignments at the faculty.

248
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,800
Umm, are you alright, Nong Pai?

249
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,160
I don’t have a choice, do I?

250
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,640
My boyfriend’s working hard.
All I can do is worry about him.

251
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,840
I’m leaving then.

252
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,560
As for these, I’ll throw them away.

253
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
Okay.

254
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,400
A hot guy’s so scary when he’s angry.

255
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,320
Will I get killed if I spread the news?

256
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,920
Ms. Phan, please do something.
None of the maids dare to clean that room.

257
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,040
I get what you mean.
I experienced it firsthand.

258
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,320
P’ Pai said my footsteps
were annoyingly loud.

259
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,280
This is the first time in
my life P’ Pai scolded me.

260
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,080
Gosh, you were scolded for walking loudly.
Then won’t we face something worse?

261
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:14,400
They’re drawing lots in the kitchen
to decide who’ll clean Mr. Pai’s room.

262
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,720
Scary.

263
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,240
Yes, scary.

264
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,240
The scary person’s the one
who made P’ Pai like this.

265
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,320
Hello.

266
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,200
You pick up when
it’s not my number?

267
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,840
Where are you?
You're making me worried.

268
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,000
It’s none of your business
where I go or what I do.

269
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,760
Do you realize what you’ve just said?

270
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,520
You still haven’t figured out?
I’m tired of you.

271
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,680
Sky, stop joking around.
It’s not even funny!

272
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,160
You’ve disappeared for two weeks.
I couldn't find you anywhere.

273
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,840
Yet you still said something like that.
My patience’s got a limit too, you know?

274
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,040
I can get bored too.

275
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,080
It’s no longer fun when
you're head over heels for me.

276
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,240
I didn’t think you’d be this dumb.
You should know what I mean.

277
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,440
It was so hard to hold back my
laughter every time you bought me food.

278
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,520
Couldn’t you be more creative?

279
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,520
I’m sick of pretending to be a pitiful boy.

280
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,440
And stop calling me.
It’s annoying.

281
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,400
I don’t believe you.

282
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,640
That’s up to you.
It’s got nothing to do with me.

283
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,520
How could you say that!

284
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,840
Didn’t we make it official
when we were in my room?

285
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,200
Then we’re over.

286
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,240
Though I haven’t started
anything with you at all.

287
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,560
Dammit!
I don’t fucking believe it.

288
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,040
Sky’s not that kind of person.

289
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,960
The boy I love’s not that kind of person.

290
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,400
No, I won’t give up.

291
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,080
Sky, are you okay?

292
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,200
What do you think?

293
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,160
I thought you were gonna cry.

294
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
But you didn't.

295
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,040
Thanks so much for
letting me stay with you.

296
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,400
I don’t get it.
I can see that P’ Pai loves you.

297
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,600
So why did you run away,
move out of your dorm...

298
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,040
And break up with him?

299
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,400
He doesn’t love me.

300
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,800
He just finds me unusual.

301
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,600
Thanks so much.

302
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,000
Let me stay with you for one more night.

303
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,720
I’m gonna pay a deposit at
the new dorm tomorrow and move out.

304
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,800
You know what?

305
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,080
Maybe it’s better if you
just allow yourself to cry.

306
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,320
It’s uncomfortable to see
someone who can’t cry.

307
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
Cheer up.

308
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,120
You’ve got to move out anyway.

309
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,040
There are too many
memories of him in this place.

310
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Where is it?

311
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,320
Looking for this?

312
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,840
Is this another one of your jokes?

313
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,360
Big brother.
Two siblings.

314
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,480
Graduated from England.
Loves motorbike racing.

315
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,840
Close with his uncle.

316
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,440
Slick. Cheeky. Good-humored.

317
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,240
Smiles like an idiot.
Annoying.

318
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,920
- No. Don’t read. Don’t!
- Pervy.

319
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,200
Has too much time on his hands.

320
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Narcissistic.
You think you’re so hot?

321
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,280
Cunning.
Always knows what I think.

322
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,920
No. Enough. Stop it.

323
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,000
- Please stop.
- He gets on my nerves...

324
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,560
But always makes me smile.

325
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,840
He’s a narcissist but deserves to be one.

326
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,160
He’s willful...

327
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,320
But also the kindest man I know.

328
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,400
Exhaustion can’t stop
him from coming to me.

329
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,600
Always makes me happy.

330
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,160
What excuse should I use to ask P’ Pai out?

331
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,920
P’ Pai loves to buy me foods.
I want him to eat his favorite foods too.

332
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:33,200
What should I do to make
P’ Pai enjoy my company?

333
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,480
How can I prevent P’ Pai
from getting bored?

334
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,240
Can you not look for someone else?
Can I be the only one for you?

335
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,080
I might be boring, unpretty, uncute.

336
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,640
But please don’t get bored of me.

337
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,360
Don’t say the word ‘like’ to anyone but me.

338
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,320
Don’t leave me.

339
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,840
Only be kind to me.
Only take care of me.

340
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,760
Only buy foods for me.

341
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,200
There’s nothing good about me,
but I’ll do my best.

342
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,360
I’ll do whatever you want me to do.

343
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,240
Please don’t like anyone else.

344
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,600
Please.

345
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,120
Please like me.
Please love me, P’ Pai.

346
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,280
Is this the person who enjoys
putting a player like me in my place?

347
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,120
When you wrote in this notebook…

348
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,720
Were you acting too?

349
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,480
You knew I’d find the key and
enter the room to read it, didn’t you?

350
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,640
Even this notebook’s full of lies too?

351
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,720
Look at me.

352
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,600
Look into my eyes.

353
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,760
It’s unfair for you to say it first, right?

354
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,080
Fine.

355
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,720
I don’t like you anymore.

356
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,240
Because I love you.

357
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,280
I don’t just like you.

358
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,160
I love you, Sky.

359
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,720
How do you feel about me?

360
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,960
I love you, P’ Pai.

361
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,240
I love you.
I love you.

362
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,600
I love you so much.

363
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,240
It’s okay.

364
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,040
You finally said it to me.
It’s okay.

365
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,520
I love you.
I love you so much.

366
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,920
Please don’t leave me.
Stay with me.

367
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,520
Don’t go away.

368
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,200
You misunderstood ‘cause you saw
me hugging someone at the party?

369
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,840
I remember that I talked
to him perfunctorily that night.

370
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,840
All I wanted was to go back to the car.

371
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,240
I’ve only got eyes for you.

372
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,000
P’ Pai.

373
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:52,080
So what should I do to make you like me,
love me, and not get tired of me?

374
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,400
Just be yourself and I
won’t be able to get away.

375
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,520
You mean it?

376
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,720
Yes.
I’m so head over heels for you.

377
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,160
I wonder where you got this idea
that I’d get tired of you one day.

378
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,080
From my ex.

379
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,440
We broke up on bad terms.

380
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,960
I never forget what he told his friends.
He said he got tired of me.

381
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,280
‘Cause I was boring and broken.

382
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,040
He tried to brainwash me.

383
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,440
Told me to be good and obedient.

384
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,720
But when I resisted, he got bored.

385
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,720
And...

386
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,600
You can tell me when you’re ready.

387
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,640
I’m sorry.

388
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,400
Look into my eyes.

389
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,680
Do you see me as that kind of man?

390
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,600
I see nothing at all.

391
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,280
‘Cause love makes me blind.

392
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,520
Then I’m permanently blind.

393
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,560
Making fun of me?

394
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,000
I guess we’re both blind.

395
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,000
And we’ll both use canes.

396
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,080
You guys are going out?

397
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,320
You couldn’t guess?
Don’t you know how capable I am?

398
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,280
Is it true, Sky?

399
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,760
Yeah, P’ Pai and I are going out.

400
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,840
I said I’d tell you when
I started dating someone.

401
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,440
Actually, Sky wants to tell
you how much he loves me.

402
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,040
That’s why I brought him here.

403
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,120
Though you didn’t do anything,
you’re the reason we met, Rain.

404
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,760
- Really?
- Yeah.

405
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,720
Why would Sky lie to you?

406
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,840
I’m asking my friend, not you.

407
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:01,120
Sky’s heart belongs to me now.
That’s why I know he loves me so much.

408
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,240
You sure it’s not your own imagination?

409
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,240
That’s right, Sky.
Did he drug you?

410
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,160
You don’t really wanna
hold his hands, do you?

411
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,600
He superglued your hands, didn’t he?
Want me to pry them apart?

412
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,080
He didn’t do anything.

413
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,320
- Did you finish your assignment?
- Here's an advice for your own good.

414
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,680
Don’t speak ill of me
or Sky will get angry.

415
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,320
You'll really get angry?

416
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,280
- So have you finished it?
- Of course!

417
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,160
Who wouldn’t get angry when
someone speaks ill of their lover?

418
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,320
Won’t you get angry if I speak ill of Payu?

419
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,200
I haven’t finished it.
I’ll do it later.

420
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,880
You’ve got a point.

421
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,440
- Right, what about the stage play?
- I know, right?

422
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,880
I’ve only got good intentions for Sky.

423
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,680
Jeez, can we discuss one topic at a time?

424
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,960
Stop talking already, P’ Pai.
I wanna talk to my friend.

425
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,000
Look at your friend, P’ Payu.

426
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,560
- He’s giving me a headache.
- You just don’t get it.

427
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,320
Yes, we’re talking about the same topic.

428
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,040
Sky was trying to change
the subject ‘cause he’s shy.

429
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,840
And I was trying to get
us back to earlier topic.

430
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,440
My duty is to tell you how
much the two of us are in love.

431
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,120
- P’ Pai.
- Yes?

432
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,040
Has anyone ever told you
how shameless you are?

433
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,160
Too many to count.

434
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,080
Rain.

435
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,760
Don’t speak ill of my boyfriend.
I don’t like it.

436
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,720
It’s evening now.
Let’s go get dinner.

437
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,480
Make yourself at home, Sky.

438
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,640
Come on, get up.

439
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,360
- What are you looking at?
- A cutie who spoke up for me.

440
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,280
Who else would speak up for
if not my boyfriend?

441
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,520
Can I kiss you?

442
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,000
Can we go back to our room first?

443
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,760
Okay, as you wish.

444
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,760
I’m sorry, P’ Pai.

445
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,960
I’m sorry, I already love you.

446
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,680
Can you not look for someone else?
Can I be the only one for you?

447
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,680
I might be boring, unpretty, uncute.
But please don’t get bored of me.

448
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,400
Don’t say the word ‘like’ to anyone but me.
Don’t leave me.

449
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,200
Only be kind to me.
Only take care of me.

450
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,360
English Subtitle by Saowalak K.

451
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,120
A guard says P’ Pai wants
you to return to the condo.

452
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,320
P’ Gun.
Can we not do this anymore?

453
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,960
Take back your dirty shit!

454
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,480
- Where’s Sky?
- He’s with Rain.

455
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,680
Where did Rain take him?

456
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,720
Can’t I be with only you?
