1
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,250
You seem to have gained
a better understanding, Rain.

2
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,530
Did I do good enough?

3
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:39,560
Can I stand by your side?

4
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,500
I’m sorry I let you sit
in the rain for hours.

5
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,250
I'm sorry.

6
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,290
P' Payu?

7
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,930
I was gonna flirt then dump him,
but willingly became his instead.

8
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,550
Way to go, Rain.

9
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,590
Where are you, you rascal?

10
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,370
I told you to call me
if you weren’t coming home.

11
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,670
I don’t get why architecture
students study so hard.

12
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,079
Do something else hard, more like.

13
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,630
Mama, I’m sorry.
I’m going home now.

14
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,860
I’m borrowing it, P’ Payu.

15
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,690
Rain.

16
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,080
You wake up?

17
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,970
I won’t let you escape.

18
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,140
You’ve long lost your chance.

19
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,650
P' Payu

20
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,790
The Calm Before the Storm

21
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,090
This room.

22
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,360
I don’t know what he did last night,
but he came back with high fever.

23
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,100
So I gave him medicine and let him rest.

24
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,920
Thank you so much for letting me visit him.

25
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:30,180
Oh, I’m the one who should thank you.
I’ve heard so much about you.

26
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,090
Thank you for helping Rain
when his car broke down.

27
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,010
Make yourself at home.
I’ll be downstairs.

28
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,870
- Yes, thank you.
- Okay.

29
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,890
How did you get in here?

30
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,170
Your mom let me come up here.

31
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,730
And why did she do that?

32
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,530
Why can’t I come here?

33
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,670
Why are you raising your voice at me?

34
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,970
Why did you run away from me?

35
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,730
I didn’t run away.
I saw you were busy.

36
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,230
So I didn’t want to disturb you.

37
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,840
You said you didn’t run away.
So why didn't you pick up my calls?

38
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,310
Do you know how worried I am?

39
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,960
You had a fever this morning,
so I let you rest.

40
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,840
But you suddenly disappeared.

41
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,320
What would I do if you had an accident?

42
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,740
You don’t understand my feelings, do you?

43
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,780
I’m sorry, I didn't do it on purpose.

44
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,190
I fell asleep after I took the medicine.

45
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,660
I didn’t mean to ignore your calls.

46
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,060
Please believe me.

47
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,180
C'mere.

48
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,530
Don’t disappear on me again.

49
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,640
You got sick.

50
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,020
Ran away from me.

51
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,960
Didn't answer my calls.

52
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,840
Are you ready to be punished?

53
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,770
What is it?

54
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,260
Fever reducer.
Rectal suppository.

55
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,400
Do you want me to take
the pants off for you?

56
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,510
- On the count of three.
- No.

57
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,860
- I won’t show you mercy.
- I won’t take them off.

58
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,090
- Don’t come closer.
- One...

59
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,650
Two...

60
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,020
- Three!
- Stay away!

61
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,380
Stop! Let me go! No!

62
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,570
Ma!

63
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,870
No!
P’ Payu, I’m serious.

64
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,480
- I’ll kick you.
- It’s for your own good.

65
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,170
- I’ll really kick you.
- Go ahead.

66
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,630
- Let go.
- You’ll really kick me?

67
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,440
No. Don’t. Let go of me.
No. I’ve recovered.

68
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,150
Your mom's gonna hear you.

69
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,330
No, no, stay away from me.
No, don’t touch me!

70
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,820
Let go! Let go! Let go!
I’ll fucking kick you!

71
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,880
Let go! Leave me alone!
Don’t do this, P' Payu! Let go!

72
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,820
I’m gonna...
I'm gonna shout.

73
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,890
No! Don’t touch me.
Don’t touch me.

74
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,780
Don’t! Let go. Let go.

75
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,850
No!!!!

76
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,340
Rain, open the door.
I’m bringing you snacks.

77
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,700
P’ Payu, don’t.

78
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,170
Don’t!

79
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,650
- Let me help.
- Thanks.

80
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,400
What’s the matter?
Are you hot?

81
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,810
- Do you want me to wipe your body?
- No.

82
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,190
Then what’s wrong?
You’re strangely flustered.

83
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,310
Are you shy that I’m going to
wipe your body in front of him?

84
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,420
That’s right.

85
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,530
Don't worry, I can take care of myself.
Please go downstairs.

86
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,230
You’re chasing me away?

87
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,250
Payu, is there anything you can’t eat?
Stay and have dinner with us.

88
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,640
- I can eat about everything, Mama.
- Okay.

89
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,740
Don’t you have anything to do, Ma?
Just do downstairs.

90
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,520
You keep chasing me away.

91
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,090
He’s probably worried that
you’ll catch a cold from him.

92
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,910
He often tells me that you
haven’t had enough rest lately.

93
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,840
Because you take care
both of him and his dad.

94
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,620
So he's worried.

95
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,520
My son’s not that good of a kid.

96
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,600
But since you said so,
I’ll believe you.

97
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,350
Anyway, make yourself at home.

98
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,820
Yes.

99
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,590
P’ Payu, why did you let her in?

100
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,420
What's wrong with you?

101
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,150
Don’t stay for dinner.
Leave.

102
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,920
Afraid she'll find out?

103
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,160
Of course, you bastard.

104
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,000
Think you can finish it today, P' Aon?

105
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,070
Now that you ask me, I'm not sure.

106
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,230
- Sawasdee krub, Mr. Prapai.
- Sawasdee krub, P’ Aon.

107
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,380
Wow, look who’s here!

108
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,210
It’s our regular customer.

109
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,730
Not just any regular.
I’m a VIP.

110
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,510
Hold on.
You appointed yourself to a VIP?

111
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:53,040
There’s only one VIP here.
And his name is Pakin.

112
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,630
That’s a VVIP.
How dare you downgrade him?

113
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,080
Fine, I’m sorry.

114
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
You’re forgiven.

115
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,040
If you’re looking for
Big Boss, he’s not here.

116
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,060
But he usually spends his
weekends at the garage.

117
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,700
Today’s the fateful day.

118
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,730
Well, it’s the day a certain cutie
will be caught in the devil’s trap.

119
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,930
I was gonna ask about the cutie’s friend.

120
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,260
But it’s okay.
I can wait for Payu.

121
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,330
‘Cause If he’s a devil,
then I’m a beast.

122
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,140
If you’re a beast,
then what will I be?

123
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,590
I wanna be an angel.

124
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,370
Being ordinary suits you best.

125
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,100
Man, that hurts.

126
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,680
- I’mma punch your face.
- Gimme a good one.

127
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,960
Forget it, I feel sorry for my hand.

128
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,110
- You won’t do it.
- Come on, I’ll show you a car.

129
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,340
Is someone talking about me?

130
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,120
Nah, don't think so.

131
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,910
So dusty.

132
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,860
Guess I need to clean up after the finals.

133
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,800
It’s so dusty in here.

134
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,140
Right, what’s the
situation on Rain’s side?

135
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,910
Whatever, it’s none of my business.

136
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,070
What a loud sneeze, germ spreader.

137
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,040
I’ve got goosebumps because of you.

138
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,060
At dinner, how did you do it?
My mom agreed with everything you said.

139
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,710
She even told me to get
tutored by you during holidays.

140
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,600
Did you put a spell on her?

141
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,290
Why do you put a
triangle in a display case?

142
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,510
Oh, that’s my lucky charm
during the entrance exam.

143
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,270
Hey, don’t change the subject.
You haven’t answered me.

144
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,680
Don't address yourself as ‘Rain’ anymore?

145
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,640
Then should I address
myself as ‘Wife’ instead?

146
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,610
No.

147
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,930
Because we’re just senior and junior.

148
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,440
Your time to win me over is up.

149
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,599
P’ Payu.

150
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,190
It's time to stop studying each other.

151
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,310
It’s raining like the day we first met.

152
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,630
P’ Payu, don’t be like this.
Don’t say that.

153
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,540
Don’t cry.

154
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,850
What I’m trying to say is…

155
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,630
From now on…

156
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,580
I’ll be the one to pursue you.

157
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,290
Stop. Stop.

158
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,180
You left scratch marks
all over my back last night.

159
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,220
Don't open the wounds.

160
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,350
P’ Payu!

161
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,690
But I think I’ve already won you over.

162
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,500
Don’t flatter yourself.

163
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,600
You won’t succeed until your next life.

164
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,800
Are you sure it’ll be next life?

165
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,320
I want you to choose.

166
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,400
Choose what?

167
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,460
Between...

168
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,110
Becoming my wife...

169
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,620
Or having me as your husband.

170
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,540
What will you choose?

171
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,870
Answer me.

172
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,620
Hold on, you call that choices?

173
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,130
Whether you’ll be my wife
or I’ll be your husband…

174
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,210
I’ll take good care of you
and won’t let anyone bully you.

175
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,970
Because I’ll be the one to bully you.

176
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,180
I won’t make you cry.

177
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,030
But it’s another thing if you
cry from embarrassment.

178
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,910
It's not so bad to have a cum
laude graduate as your boyfriend.

179
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:45,260
I can help you with model making,
CAD drawings, and your thesis.

180
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,090
I’m giving you such a hard sell…

181
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,090
You’ve got to buy me now.

182
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,460
I’m not gonna choose.

183
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,760
Because I’ll have both.

184
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,330
Cunning.

185
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,300
Not as much as you.

186
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,060
Then...

187
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,120
I’ve got to reward this cunning boy.

188
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,180
Really?

189
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,940
Yeah.

190
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,020
Oh Payu, you’re early today.

191
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,690
Good morning, you’re early too.

192
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,960
Did you get a new haircut?

193
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,440
It looks great on you.

194
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,720
He starts working his charm so early.
How could I resist it?

195
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,300
Hey, what’s with the big smile?

196
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,520
Do you want all the ladies
to be lovestruck with you?

197
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,320
I want only one person
to be lovestruck with me.

198
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,160
And it looks like…

199
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,700
They already are.

200
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,630
Are you sure the lovestruck one isn't you?

201
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,320
I’m at uni.
Exam's in 10 mins.

202
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,180
Get good marks and I’ll reward you.

203
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,200
What if I get bad marks?

204
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,590
Then get ready to be punished.

205
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,720
Should be on the exam.

206
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,160
For your information,
exam starts in 10 minutes.

207
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,220
I know that.
Don’t ruin my mood.

208
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,380
And do you know you’ve been staring at
your phone like it’s just confessed to you?

209
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,050
I like you.

210
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,080
Who says I was confessed to?
No! Nonsense!

211
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,350
You’re talking rubbish.

212
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,570
Rain.

213
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,200
Yes?

214
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,460
Can I talk to you after exam?

215
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,040
Rain!

216
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,950
Maybe your spring’s coming.

217
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,900
Isn't that great?

218
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,540
Well…

219
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,000
Umm…

220
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,970
The thing is...

221
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,450
Can I have the number?

222
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,940
Oh shit.

223
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,070
I would’ve been happier if I
hadn’t just gotten a husband.

224
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,860
Umm… Number...

225
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,070
My number’s 41.

226
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,840
Come on, Rain.
I didn’t ask for your shoe size.

227
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,640
I want a phone number.

228
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,520
I want...

229
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,930
P’ Payu’s number.

230
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,590
Whose number?

231
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,730
P’ Payu’s.

232
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,720
Did you think I was asking for your number?

233
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,900
Why would I do that when I already have it?

234
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,790
Why do you want my boyfr…
I mean, P’ Payu’s number?

235
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,670
Well…

236
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,310
Because...

237
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,480
Because I like him!

238
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:34,710
I thought I only admired him
because of P’ Som’s praises.

239
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,830
But after I met him in person…

240
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,760
After you met him in person…

241
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,420
Well, I fell for him!

242
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,560
This is bad!

243
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,500
Don’t look at me like that.
I’m embarrassed.

244
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,220
I didn’t wanna ask
you for a favor at first.

245
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,080
But P’ Som wouldn’t give me the number.

246
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,550
I think...

247
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,660
My brother likes P’ Payu too.

248
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,990
So I decided to ask you
because you seem close to him.

249
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,560
P’ Som too?

250
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:28,860
Yeah, I think my brother
and I like the same guy.

251
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,980
Damn these fruity siblings.

252
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,180
Hope I won’t have to deal
with Papaya or Banana too.

253
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,440
Are fruits my love rivals or something?

254
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,070
So can I have his number?

255
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,020
Ooh, the chocolate cake looks yummy.

256
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,980
- Want some?
- Don’t you have P’ Payu’s number?

257
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,890
What are you stuffing in your mouth?
Want me to get it out?

258
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,730
What’s wrong?

259
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,980
Nothing, I’m just annoyed
with a certain charmer.

260
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,290
Does that mean you don’t
wanna go to the movies anymore?

261
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,680
Of course, I want to.
You promised to take me there after exams.

262
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,470
Then smile.
I want my boyfriend to be happy.

263
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,090
Have you ever ridden a big bike?

264
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,780
What about a big bike’s pillion?

265
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,290
Then today’s your chance.

266
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,220
Really?

267
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,140
Hop on.

268
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,320
Hold properly.

269
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:53,780
If you touch something you shouldn’t,
I won’t guarantee your safety tonight.

270
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,570
Is there anything you can’t do?

271
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,460
Enviable, right?

272
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,150
Why did you hit me?

273
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,920
What I’m saying is you’re enviable.

274
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,220
Because you have such
a capable boyfriend like me.

275
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,100
Hold tight.

276
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,860
I knew it, that guy’s the culprit.
I knew from the start.

277
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,620
The ending’s kinda unexpected
but still predictable, right?

278
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,780
- Did you enjoy it?
- Yeah.

279
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,630
Are you hungry?

280
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,200
Oh, I’m starving.

281
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,080
What do you wanna eat?

282
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,930
Why are you indulging me today?

283
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,380
‘Cause I want to.

284
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,650
But I’ll become spoiled.

285
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,300
If that happens, I’ll be
the one to straighten you out.

286
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,620
Come on, I’m obviously a good boy.

287
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,470
Obedient and never talk back to you.

288
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,540
So what do you wanna eat?

289
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,990
Don’t make that face.
I’m not teasing you.

290
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,920
I just want you to be happy today.

291
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,270
Korean food.

292
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,050
- For real? Korean food?
- Yeah.

293
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,710
Don’t you look Korean enough?

294
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,100
I thought you wouldn’t tease me.

295
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,680
This isn’t teasing.
It's affection.

296
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,290
Looks more like lust to me.

297
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,550
Hey, what are you looking at?

298
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,590
Rain?

299
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,560
P’ Payu?

300
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,270
You’re holding hands.

301
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,680
You here to watch the movie?

302
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,010
Yeah.

303
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,200
Did you like it?

304
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,520
Is the popcorn good?
What’s the flavor?

305
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,360
The villain’s too predictable.

306
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,840
I think so too.

307
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,090
Do you have anything to tell me?

308
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,060
Hmm?

309
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:37,370
Umm… Well…

310
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,810
I…

311
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,580
I’m dating P’ Payu.

312
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,110
Rain, I already know that.

313
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,380
You…

314
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,020
I’m not stupid.

315
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:59,460
I found out when you smiled
at your phone like an idiot.

316
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:04,570
And you’re much more committed
than when you pursued Ple.

317
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,260
I’ve known about your
relationship with P’ Payu.

318
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,380
I was just waiting for you to tell me.

319
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,900
If you’re afraid to tell me because
P’ Payu’s a man, then you’re crazy.

320
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,590
I’m your friend, not your mom.

321
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,460
Seeing you happy…

322
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,740
That’s enough for me.

323
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,110
Sky.

324
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,630
I love you!

325
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,710
Before you say you love me,
please look at the man next to you.

326
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,970
I don’t get jealous without reasons.

327
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,880
I know that Sky is Rain’s best friend.

328
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,980
So, can Rain’s best
friend tell me who Ple is?

329
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,340
Hmm?

330
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,860
P’ Payu.

331
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:21,000
Hey, eat up.
This is the signature dish.

332
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,580
It was very delicious
the last time I ate it.

333
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,220
This restaurant’s top notch.
Eat up. Eat up.

334
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,050
- Delicious?
- Last time?

335
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,270
But this is your first time here with me.

336
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,820
- P’ Payu.
- Anoth... Another branch.

337
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,940
Sky! This bread’s good.
Eat it with this dish.

338
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,490
It goes with another dish though.

339
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,350
It goes with that dish too.

340
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,860
Please believe me, I don’t have
feelings for Ple anymore.

341
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:16,350
But didn’t you pursue me to
show Ple that I was a bad guy?

342
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,560
Who… Who says you’re bad?

343
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,000
No one!

344
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,180
You’re apparently nice.

345
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,190
Handsome.

346
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,470
Super cool.

347
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,780
And you’re the department’s god
worshipped by juniors.

348
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,570
Believe your boyfriend.

349
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,270
Please.

350
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,920
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty please.

351
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:52,200
Gosh, my friend’s become
silly after he’s got a boyfriend.

352
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,980
Nosy.

353
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,690
What? Hmm?

354
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,950
P’ Payu, eat up.
I’ll feed you.

355
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,510
Do you like it?
It’s your favorite.

356
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,300
- Feed me.
- Sure.

357
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,430
Are you serious, Stop?

358
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,600
You really got an invitation to the race?

359
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,610
Why would I lie to you?

360
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:29,650
My dad’s familiar with the
organizer, the influential Mr. Pakin.

361
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,180
I can bring you with me.

362
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,410
Is it true that this race is above the law?

363
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:45,190
People cower in fear at the
mention of the organizer’s name.

364
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,090
So who would dare arrest him?

365
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,380
What the fuck?

366
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:03,840
Do you know the golden rule is to
never mention the race in public?

367
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,360
What’s the matter, P’ Payu?
Bad mood?

368
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,920
Or are you still upset about Ple?

369
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:42,860
It’s nothing, I just met
some annoying people.

370
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,200
But I already dealt with them.

371
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,710
So you’re not angry with me anymore.

372
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,420
When did I ever get angry with you?

373
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,910
When you told your best friend about us...

374
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,850
I couldn’t have been happier.

375
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,550
So...

376
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,140
Why would you think I’d keep it a secret?

377
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,940
I assumed you were afraid that
the way he looked at you would change.

378
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,850
That’s true.

379
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,930
I was afraid Sky would change
because I suddenly liked a guy.

380
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,220
But I planned to tell him anyway.

381
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,110
If he didn’t understand,
I’d keep pestering him until he did.

382
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,710
Because I’ve chosen both choices...

383
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,820
Whether it’s being your wife
or having you as my husband.

384
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:57,550
No matter how much you bully me,
I won’t break up with you.

385
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:03,160
I tried so hard.
I’ll be a fool if I let you go.

386
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,170
Right?

387
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,940
Mama, this is Payu.

388
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:25,230
Please allow Rain to sleep
over at my house tonight.

389
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Yes.

390
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,480
Thank you.

391
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,660
Let’s go home.

392
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,480
Please.

393
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,290
Come home with me.

394
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,300
You're cheating.

395
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,140
Hungry?

396
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,970
Don’t stop.

397
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,930
You wanna hear me sing?

398
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:12,570
Okay.

399
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,700
But there are conditions.

400
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,970
You’ve still got conditions?
I’m already dog-tired because of you.

401
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:23,640
Can’t you just be obedient and do as I say?

402
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,480
You need to get some exercise.

403
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,840
I’ll make you roll a car tire
around the garage for 10 laps.

404
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,660
So what’s your decision?

405
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,340
Do you wanna hear my voice?

406
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,200
There are two rules
that you need to follow.

407
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,680
Rule No.1: Look into my eyes.

408
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,770
Rule No.2: Don’t turn your face away.

409
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,160
Can I blink?

410
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,890
Yes, you can blink.

411
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,850
But you must look at me the whole time.

412
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,580
Do you know how good things are?

413
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,760
Do you know how happy I am?

414
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:44,110
Do you know how much
my old life has changed?

415
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:50,440
Do you know how I was before I met you?

416
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:58,510
Do you know how significant
it is to have met you?

417
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:02,950
You...

418
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:08,170
You are everything...

419
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:16,360
That makes my life memorable.

420
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,990
Ever since I met you.

421
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:31,180
Thank heaven for bringing us together.

422
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:37,630
Thank the Man Upstairs
that brought you to me.

423
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,460
Thank all those fateful events.

424
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:48,130
Because they led me to...

425
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:54,540
You, my darling.

426
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:04,760
Thank heaven for bringing us together.

427
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:11,460
Thank the Man Upstairs
that brought you to me.

428
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,250
Thank all those fateful events.

429
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:22,040
Because they led me to...

430
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,420
You, my darling.

431
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:32,410
Wait!

432
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,900
Time out! You’re cheating.

433
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:41,940
You’ve lost.

434
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:45,980
It’d be a miracle if I won.

435
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,550
And I didn’t wanna compete against you.

436
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:56,370
So it means that I won.

437
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,040
Right?

438
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,140
My darling.

439
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,700
You’re cheating, P’ Payu.

440
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:41,290
Here, I’ll feed you.

441
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,000
Aren’t you just adorable?

442
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,330
Bro, did you forget I was here too?

443
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,790
So when are you gonna move out?

444
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,400
This house is a shared inheritance.

445
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,980
Right, why don’t you
bring Rain to the next race?

446
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,120
Too many assholes.

447
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:22,980
They’re just a bunch of rich kids
who wanna show off.

448
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,370
They’ll get banned if they make trouble.

449
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,780
You know how much P’ Pakin
hates troublemakers.

450
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:37,460
And you’re his favorite guy.
So you can just bring Rain with you.

451
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,980
Don’t you want Rain to see your world?

452
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:53,420
P’ Payu, please take me to the race.
I wanna watch it.

453
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:58,770
Fine, but don’t sneak in like that again.

454
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:05,590
And if anyone asks,
just say that you’re P’ Payu’s wife.

455
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,750
I'm gonna eat.

456
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,410
Try this dish.

457
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,130
Can I really come here?

458
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,120
Just do as I said.

459
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,200
Oh, you mean that?

460
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:53,800
So if anyone asks,
I can say that I’m your wife, right?

461
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,250
You already know that.

462
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:07,260
Last time I sneaked in,
I didn’t pay attention.

463
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:11,200
But to be able to close a road,
P’ Pakin’s really something.

464
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:16,340
That’s right.

465
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,990
Welcome to Street Circuit race.

466
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,090
It takes place only once a month.

467
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,450
Nobody can take action against it.

468
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:03,020
It’s the race where you can bet everything.
From fame, wealth, to lovers.

469
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,650
But if you’re here to cause trouble,
things won’t end easily.

470
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:02,130
That’s Street Circuit race for you.

471
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,500
Come on, I wanna visit
Science Faculty open house.

472
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,570
But I’m here for Architecture
Faculty open house.

473
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,910
We should go separately.

474
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,060
Just come with me.
Come on, get up. Let’s go.

475
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,220
Fine.

476
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,610
- I’m gonna be an architecture student!
- I wish you the best of luck.

477
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,730
English Subtitle by Saowalak K.

478
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:18,110
I thought you were a big shot.
But you’re just a lowly mechanic.

479
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,690
That fucker challenges you to a race.

480
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,020
Don’t crash the bike.
Don’t go to hospital.

481
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,540
Don’t get your limbs broken.
Every part of your body must be intact.

482
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,410
You’ll see how enviable you are
to have me as your boyfriend.
