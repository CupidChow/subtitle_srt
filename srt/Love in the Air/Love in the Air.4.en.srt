1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,560
Rain, wake up.

2
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,920
- What time is it now?
- 8.15.

3
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,080
No matter how hard you cry,
I won't accept your work.

4
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,000
Why am I here?

5
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,080
P' Payu.

6
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:45,200
Dry your hair properly.
Don't get sick.

7
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,440
I don't wanna take care of you.

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,840
How’s your boy?

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,200
Better.

10
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,520
Get someone to buy dinner for Rain.
He hasn’t eaten since yesterday.

11
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,360
Okay, leave it to me.

12
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,960
Payu.

13
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,040
P’ Pakin called just now.

14
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,040
Next month’s race schedule is out.

15
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,720
He said that you mustn’t
let another mistake happen.

16
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,440
Yeah, I understand.

17
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,440
I'll call him.

18
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,079
And he said that if the boy’s
naughty, just bring him along.

19
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,880
Not now.

20
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,600
Hey, what do you mean?
Payu! Payu!

21
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,120
- What are you looking at?
- The person who’s eating.

22
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,640
I know I’m eating, but I’m gonna
lose my appetite with your stare.

23
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,240
But you almost finish the food.

24
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,680
It’s because I’m hungry.

25
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,000
Seriously.

26
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,920
You're eating like a baby.
There's food on your mouth.

27
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,760
Just so you know,
I don’t date underage people.

28
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,120
I’m already 19.

29
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,000
Which means I can kiss you.

30
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,079
You already kissed me.

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,240
Does it count?
All I tasted was blood.

32
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,960
Then...

33
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
Kiss me again.

34
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Rain.

35
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Yes?

36
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,960
You shouldn’t come here anymore.

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,120
What do you mean?
Don’t joke like that.

38
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,120
You’re annoyed with me, right?

39
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,800
I know I’m annoying.
I’m sorry, I won’t bother you again.

40
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,320
I... I won’t sneak into
that racetrack again.

41
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,600
I won’t mess with you again.

42
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,240
But please don’t forbid
me from coming here.

43
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,440
Listen to me, Rain.

44
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,200
I’m not annoyed with you.

45
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
But…

46
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,200
Didn’t I tell you that I wanted
you to balance your time?

47
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,440
You’re only on your first year,
but what’s it gonna be after this?

48
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,200
Before you design a house,
you need to design your life first.

49
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,280
And if you’re really
serious about pursuing me…

50
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,320
You need to understand that I don’t
want a spur-of-the-moment relationship.

51
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,600
If you can’t be responsible
for your own life...

52
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,560
How can I expect
a more serious relationship?

53
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,560
This is how I am.

54
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,160
If you can’t accept it,
then don’t come here again.

55
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,920
What if I can prove that
I can be responsible?

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,360
Can I come here again?

57
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,240
Not until you prove it to me.

58
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,360
But now, finish your dinner
and sleep over tonight.

59
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,080
I’ll send you home tomorrow.

60
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,760
Warm Me with Your Heart

61
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,560
The window’s position isn’t right.
It shouldn’t be here.

62
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,440
- Can’t I put it here?
- No.

63
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,720
See? It’s the wrong direction.
It's blocked.

64
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,720
It should be here.

65
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,600
P’ Som, you’re so eager
when it comes to your sister.

66
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,800
Of course, she’s my favorite little sister.

67
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,200
That's for sure.

68
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,400
What’s up, Rain?

69
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,840
What’s the matter?
You look pretty down.

70
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,120
It should be here.

71
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,720
Okay, I’ll redo it.

72
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
As you wish.

73
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,400
Cheer up.

74
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,320
I was recently scolded that a
kindergartener's more creative than me.

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,720
And look at me.
I’m still fine.

76
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,640
Alright, alright.
Think of it as an advice from a senior.

77
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,720
Set four alarm clocks and
place them in four corners.

78
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
Let’s see if that can’t wake you up.

79
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
But you still go back to sleep anyway.

80
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,040
Nonsense.

81
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
That’s not true.

82
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Come on.

83
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,440
I’ll buy you lunch.

84
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,640
Okay?

85
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,280
Are you okay?

86
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,600
I’m not hungry.
You go ahead.

87
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,159
Suit yourself.
Whatever floats your boat.

88
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Rain, let’s have lunch together.

89
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,320
It’s not every day P’ Som
offers to spring for a meal.

90
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,760
Let’s go.

91
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,600
I’ve already eaten.
You should go with P’ Som.

92
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
Okay.

93
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,440
What about you?

94
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,360
I’ll be with you shortly.

95
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,240
Okay, suit yourself.

96
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,320
- Then we’ll be going first.
- Okay.

97
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,240
Okay, I’ll see you later.

98
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,919
Let’s go.

99
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,120
You don’t like Ple anymore, do you?

100
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,960
I still do.

101
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,240
They guy you’re trying to
win over is P’ Payu, right?

102
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,480
You’re not feeling down
from the teacher’s reproach.

103
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,400
You usually recover fast.

104
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,840
You’re like this because
of a different problem, right?

105
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,640
Rain, be honest with me.

106
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,000
Do you like P’ Payu?

107
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,320
I don’t.

108
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,400
Before you answered me...

109
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,560
Did you look into your heart?

110
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
Don’t worry.

111
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,240
You can take your time to think.

112
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,080
And tell me later when
you’re sure about it.

113
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,600
Because no one knows
your heart better than yourself.

114
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,640
Got it?

115
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,120
Goosebumps.

116
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,440
I’d never said something like this to you.

117
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,120
I’m leaving.

118
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
Hang in there.

119
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,120
I don’t know.

120
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,600
I just don’t wanna let you down.

121
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,520
- What’s wrong with you, Sig?
- Aren't you gonna work?

122
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,040
- Move your ass!
- Please go ahead.

123
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
See here?

124
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,600
I think there’s no need for a rooftop here.

125
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,040
Too easy.
Piece of cake.

126
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,880
- What’s your suggestion then?
- Your work’s finished?

127
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,440
- Easy.
- Finish your work first.

128
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,800
Easy?
You finished your work?

129
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,800
You’ll be short-lived if you sigh often.

130
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,840
Even so, I’ll still live
much longer than you.

131
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,040
So what’s the deal?
Lovers’ quarrel?

132
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,720
We’re not yet a couple.

133
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,080
So my guess was right.
It’s really a love problem.

134
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,320
No wonder you’ve been gloomy all day.

135
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,440
So who’s this person?
Younger? Older?

136
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Well…

137
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,000
Younger. A freshman.

138
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,840
You’re so bad.
So what’s the problem?

139
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,680
The problem is...

140
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,760
They're an architecture student.

141
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,520
I get it now.
Let me guess.

142
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,640
Too busy to answer texts, go on
dates, and have meals together.

143
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,440
Let’s just break up.

144
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,640
Personal experience?

145
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,360
Yeah.

146
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,960
First one broke up with me on 2nd year.

147
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,360
Second one ditched me on 4th year
after we dated for only three months.

148
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,120
Before she left, she lectured me
about having no time for a relationship.

149
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,840
And that I was selfish,
focused only on my works.

150
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,040
Forget it, let’s talk about you.

151
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,160
You broke up with them
or the other way around?

152
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,400
It’s not like that.

153
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,640
By the way, what’s the progress
of Sathorn's house renovation?

154
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,400
Wow, what a sudden change of subject.

155
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,160
Those guys are sleeping like corpses.

156
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,080
Let’s wake them up in an hour.

157
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,480
Sky.

158
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,240
What?

159
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Remember what we talked about last time?

160
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,920
I said that...

161
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,920
I wasn’t sure if I liked P’ Payu.

162
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,680
I still don’t know if I like him.

163
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,280
All I know is...

164
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,120
I don’t wanna give up.

165
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,720
Rain, you know what?

166
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,840
Every time I say you’re annoying...

167
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,680
I never mean it.

168
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,000
Because you never give up easily.

169
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
And I like this side of you.

170
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,360
I wanna prove it to him.

171
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,200
Then what are you waiting for?

172
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,080
You’re right.

173
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,840
I’m the kind who acts fast.

174
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,880
Yeah.

175
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,680
He’ll never see my effort if I do nothing.

176
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,880
That’s right.

177
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,000
I’m gonna prove to him that I can do it.

178
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,800
Way to go, buddy.

179
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,640
Thank you.

180
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,599
Don’t mention it.
No biggie.

181
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,680
Just buy me ice cream.

182
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,839
P’ Payu.

183
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,720
Sawasdee krub, everyone.

184
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,120
Sawasdee ka, Nong Rain.

185
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,160
Haven’t seen you in days.
You’ve been busy?

186
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,400
Sort of.

187
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,120
May I sit in the office?

188
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,600
You do it.

189
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,360
Me?

190
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,800
I’m sorry, Mr. Rain.
Boss doesn’t allow you to enter.

191
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,440
Then may I borrow a chair?

192
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Sure.

193
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,920
- Here.
- Thank you.

194
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,760
It’s hot today.
You'll really let him sit outdoor?

195
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,520
It’s not that I don’t pity him.
But who’d dare go against Boss’ order?

196
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,520
If that person’s not you,
then it’s definitely not me.

197
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,760
Let’s get back to work.

198
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,480
Didn't I tell you not to come here?

199
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,240
I just wanted a change of scenery.

200
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,080
Then go to a café or the faculty.

201
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,000
I promise I’ll sit quietly
and not disturb anyone.

202
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
But it’s an eyesore.

203
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,600
I wanted to see your face
just for a moment.

204
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,920
How many assignments
do you need to submit?

205
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,880
What about your
project for the finals?

206
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,600
I’m doing it now.

207
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,080
Then go do it at a café or the faculty.

208
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,600
You told me to be responsible.
That’s what I’m doing right now.

209
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,400
Instead of getting distracted elsewhere,
isn’t it better if I stay focused here?

210
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,880
I only need a small space for myself.
I’m not disturbing anyone.

211
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,800
Only this much.
See?

212
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,480
- Mr. Rain.
- Yes, P’ Aon?

213
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,760
Mr. Saifha tells you to go inside.

214
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,080
But P’ Payu told me not to.

215
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,680
Between you and me, someone’s
using his twin as a cover.

216
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Let’s go.

217
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,480
Weather changes can make you sick.

218
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,800
Young men these days are so mean.

219
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,840
Come on, I’ll give you a hand.

220
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,080
Thank you, P’ Payu.
You’re so handsome and kind.

221
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,560
Do you wanna get scolded?
Let’s go.

222
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,600
Oh, a meanie.

223
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,840
Don’t piss me off.

224
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,480
I’m not.
I’ll be straight with you, Big Bro.

225
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,480
It’s okay to worry that the boy
will lose focus because of you.

226
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,200
But don’t be too mean
to him or he’ll run away.

227
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,920
If I thought he’d run away,
I wouldn’t have been this invested.

228
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,320
Don’t tell me.

229
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,920
Yes, I’m confident that
Rain won’t disappoint me.

230
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
That’s true.

231
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,240
Everyone you pull tricks on
always runs away.

232
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,280
A fighter like him really suits you.

233
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,440
He’s more than just a fighter.

234
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,160
Who’s smitten with who exactly?

235
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,880
The lovestruck one’s not
the boy but you, Big Bro.

236
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,560
What are you guys doing in my dorm?

237
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,800
- Because it’s the closest place.
- Yeah.

238
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,040
Sky, lend me your underwear.

239
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,240
I’ve been wearing
the same one for three days.

240
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,920
Ew, three-way technique?

241
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,040
- Yeah. Back, front, and inside out.
- Gross. Eww.

242
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,120
Just bear with us.
It’ll be living hell again at 8.30.

243
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,920
Who’s gonna wake us up if we’re alone?

244
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,680
We’re gonna pull an all-nighter here.

245
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,720
Yeah.

246
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,040
Isn't it what you’ve been doing these days?

247
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,720
Hey, what about you?
You usually go home when it’s not urgent.

248
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,360
‘Cause your dorm’s close.

249
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,800
I’d rather spend my time
working than driving.

250
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,320
And I can stop by the garage
with the remaining time.

251
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,120
Huh? What garage?
Your car’s broken, Cloud Jizz?

252
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,120
- Shut up, Home Sig.
- Shut up, Home Sig.

253
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,560
Shut up, Home Sig.

254
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,880
Shut up, Home Sig.

255
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,600
- You’re mocking me?
- Okay, that’s enough.

256
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,600
You won’t finish it
if you stop working.

257
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,840
- He’s getting on my nerves.
- Shut up, Home Sig.

258
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,080
Shut up...

259
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,640
Stop.

260
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,240
And you’re still provoking him.

261
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,360
And you, Give me the seaweed
and I’ll let you stay.

262
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Give it to me.

263
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,440
- Here.
- Gimme, I wanna eat too.

264
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,240
- Well, you’re sure enjoying it.
- It’s tasty. I want more.

265
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,120
Here, take it.

266
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,640
- Want some, Sky?
- My dorm belongs to everyone now.

267
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,680
Finally submitted all the works.
I’m so sleepy.

268
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,520
You okay, Rain?
Wanna go sleep in my dorm?

269
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,040
Thanks, but I'm wide awake.

270
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,360
But you haven’t slept.
You’ll still go?

271
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,400
Yeah.

272
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,760
Wow.

273
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,560
Fine, suit yourself.

274
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,080
Later.

275
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,200
Bye bye.

276
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,920
Rain, did you submit the works?
Wanna have lunch together?

277
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,920
Great job, smart boy.

278
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,440
Are you seducing me?

279
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,360
You’re really not gonna wake up?

280
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,280
Ouch!

281
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,960
Why did you hit me?

282
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,160
You seduced me with your bare belly.

283
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,400
I didn't seduce you.

284
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Sleep assaulter.

285
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,680
Sleep assaulter?

286
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,680
How do you know that?
Weren’t you sleeping?

287
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,560
When did you wake up?

288
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:43,320
When you touched my cheek.

289
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,280
So you were still sleeping before that.

290
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,240
Do you wanna know what I said
while you were sleeping?

291
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,880
Why would I wanna know?

292
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,160
‘Cause I wanna tell you.

293
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,520
I said…

294
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,080
You said…

295
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,840
Looks like I’m interrupting.

296
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,560
Don’t mind me.
I’ll close the door and leave.

297
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,400
In 3, 2, 1 and continue!

298
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,080
Let’s continue.

299
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Dummy, back off.

300
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,400
Oh, I forgot.

301
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,560
You got a call,
but I told them you’d call back.

302
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,160
Anyway, don’t forget to lock the door.

303
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,400
What I wanna say is…

304
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,320
Great job, smart boy.

305
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,440
Go back to sleep.
I’ll let you rest.

306
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,480
Fighting!

307
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,440
Great job.

308
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,360
It’s done!

309
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,960
Model, check.

310
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,600
Presentation boards, check.

311
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,320
I finished two days before the deadline.

312
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,720
This is a miracle!

313
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,120
Wait, Rain.

314
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,640
Let's think over.

315
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,080
How many assignments do I have left?

316
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,600
Two.

317
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,000
Read textbooks and...

318
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,400
I’m all done!

319
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,360
My bed.

320
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,160
Seriously, Rain.
Shouldn’t you use this time to sleep?

321
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,080
Oh, Rainy Boy.

322
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,480
- P’ Saifha, Sawasdee Krub.
- Here to see Payu?

323
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,920
Since you’re here,
I’ll take you to a good place.

324
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,880
We’ve been busy with the
next month’s race preparation.

325
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,360
There, especially that guy.

326
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,360
I run the garage in public while
he takes charge behind the scenes.

327
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,000
But he won’t quit his full-time job
no matter how tired he is.

328
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,880
He’s a stubborn guy.

329
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
When he was a student...

330
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,560
He wouldn’t give up his car modification
hobby even if he was very busy.

331
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,639
Have you finished your work?

332
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,639
Jeez, just be honest
and say that you’re happy.

333
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,280
Have you finished your work?

334
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,080
A boss like me can
order people to do the job.

335
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,960
I’m gonna teach Rain how
to ride a superbike today.

336
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,720
Can you ride a motorcycle?

337
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,480
Then I’ll teach you.
Call me Ajarn Saifha.

338
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,480
Okay?

339
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,040
Go get your work done.

340
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,120
As for him, leave it to me.

341
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,120
Okay?

342
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,600
Such a dog in the manger.

343
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,840
- I finished my works.
- Did you get any sleep?

344
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,240
Yes.

345
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,280
I don’t have time to teach you today.
Can we do it another day?

346
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,600
It’s okay, you should get back to work.

347
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,000
It’s my fault I came unannounced.

348
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,120
Since you’re busy,
I should go home.

349
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Bye.

350
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,720
Stay.

351
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,960
Can you wait until I finish my work?
I’ll speed things up.

352
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,280
And I’ll take you to dinner.

353
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,320
I can wait. I’m not in a hurry.
Get back to work now.

354
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,560
You gave up sleep to come to me.

355
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,280
So why can’t I rush through
work to spend my time with you?

356
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,600
I didn’t give up sleep.

357
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,640
Thank you.

358
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,240
I’ll have someone make a bed
for you, so you can take a nap.

359
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,360
I’ll wake you up after my work’s done.

360
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,560
Sawasdee Krub, Ajarn.
This is my end-of-year project.

361
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,760
As you can see, this house is...

362
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,720
Thank you.

363
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,160
Thank you.

364
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,360
My project is inspired by…

365
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
Umm…

366
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,160
Great job.

367
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,800
Thank you.

368
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,080
The inspiration for this
house design comes from…

369
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,000
And that’s the end of my presentation.

370
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,640
It appears that you've
gained a better understanding.

371
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
Thank you.

372
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,200
Payu, there’s a problem with
roof structure at the riverside site.

373
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,200
It must be fixed today.

374
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,600
I have a meeting.
Can you go there for me now?

375
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,080
- Okay.
- I’ll leave it to you.

376
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,400
So cold.

377
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,800
Rain, what are you doing here?

378
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,360
You’re back.
I have something to tell you.

379
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,760
Why are you out in the rain?
Do you wanna catch a cold?

380
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,640
Didn’t I tell you not
to make yourself sick?

381
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,800
Listen to me, P’ Payu.

382
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,600
You told me to prove
that I could be responsible.

383
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,520
I didn’t know how to do it,
but I did my best.

384
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,360
And today, the teachers praised me.

385
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,200
So I wanted you to be
the first person to know.

386
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,720
Have I done good enough?

387
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,720
Can I stand by your side now?

388
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,480
Naughty boy.

389
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,320
You constantly stir my heart.

390
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,560
Didn’t you wanna take a bath?

391
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,960
Let me go.

392
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,480
That's what we're doing right now.

393
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,360
Because someone’s
body is cold from the rain.

394
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,400
I was waiting for you.

395
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,800
Get out, I’m gonna wash up.

396
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,600
I’m all wet too.

397
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,920
I’ll get sick as well if
I don’t wash up immediately.

398
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,560
Then go to another bathroom.

399
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,760
Stay still.

400
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,120
Rain.

401
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,960
I’m sorry my phone’s battery ran out.

402
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,440
I’m sorry I was late.

403
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,640
I’m sorry I let you sit
in the rain for hours.

404
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,920
I’m sorry.

405
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,160
I forgive you.

406
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,920
I didn’t come here for this.

407
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,760
I came to tell you about
the teachers praising me.

408
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,320
Didn't you ask me...

409
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,040
If you could be by my side?

410
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,320
This is my answer.

411
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,680
Please don’t stop me.

412
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,840
I won’t hold back anymore.

413
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,080
Will you?

414
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,880
But...

415
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,400
I’ve never…

416
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,120
I’ll teach you.

417
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,360
‘Rain belongs to P' Payu now.'
Let me hear it.

418
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,920
Rain belongs to P’ Payu now.

419
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,160
You sneaked in here to sleep again.

420
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,120
Your lips aren't covered.
How careless of you.

421
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,040
I’ll wait until you’re ready.

422
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,120
Do your best.

423
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,640
I’m waiting.

424
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,360
English Subtitle by Saowalak K.

425
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,760
I won’t let you escape.
You lost your chance.

426
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,480
Don’t you understand my feelings?

427
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,040
I wanna talk to you after the finals.

428
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,720
Spring may be coming for you.

429
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,160
Can I have your number?

430
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,240
A place where you can bet everything.
From fame, wealth, to lovers.

431
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,080
That’s the street circuit for you.
