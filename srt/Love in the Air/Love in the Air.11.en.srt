1
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm claiming ownership.

2
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,280
Do you have any siblings?

3
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm an only child.

4
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,800
I don't know what it
feels like to have siblings.

5
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,320
I'll let you win this time.

6
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,960
Whether now or later, I’ll always win.

7
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,520
Here’s the progress report on
the project from the last meeting.

8
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,800
Is there anything you’d like to add?

9
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,360
No, you can go ahead with it.

10
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,640
Umm, do you remember the restaurant
we took our clients to last time?

11
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,320
You said it had great ambience.

12
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,720
I’ve heard they’re having a special
seasonal dish on the menu tonight.

13
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,680
Yes, I remember.

14
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,240
Because the person I brought
there wasn’t quite impressed with it.

15
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
I’m looking forward to the next meeting.

16
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,040
Of course.

17
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,440
I suggest you use the phone
instead of staring at it.

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,800
Woah, since when did you agree
with personal calls at work, Namtan?

19
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,520
Since your mother said someone’s tamed you.
And I approve of that.

20
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,800
If making phone calls makes
you work harder, then be my guest.

21
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,720
Everyone’s acting like
you’re in control of me.

22
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,720
Don’t you have work to do?

23
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,920
I’ve always got time for you, Sky.
I’ll see you tonight.

24
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,079
- Don’t come.
- What time should we meet?

25
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,280
Is there anything you wanna eat?

26
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,280
Thai, Chinese, Korean,
Japanese, Vietnamese?

27
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,600
P’ Pai will search for and serve it to you.

28
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,520
I’ll tell you what I wanna eat if
you can fly to Beijing to buy it today.

29
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,680
Gotta go.
I’ve got classes.

30
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,360
Don’t dare me.

31
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,880
I want stewed eggs.

32
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,600
Looks like I’m really under his control.

33
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Voluntarily.

34
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,120
It’s fading.

35
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,360
Watcha lookin’ at?

36
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,960
You can read palms?
Read mine too.

37
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,360
How’s my love line?

38
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,640
- Smashing.
- Really?

39
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,880
Like this.

40
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,040
Has anyone ever told you not to
be inquisitive about everything?

41
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,440
Go to class already.

42
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,760
The Sky of the Wind

43
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,840
- Nong Pai, Sawasdee ka.
- Sawasdee krub, P’ Joy.

44
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,159
Here you are.
I bought these snacks for you.

45
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,200
Oh my, you shouldn’t have.

46
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,000
You always bring gifts whenever you come.
Thank you.

47
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,120
Thank you for taking care of Sky.

48
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,680
Pai, let me ask you something.
What’s your relationship with Sky?

49
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,080
What do you think?

50
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,360
As someone who’s managed a dorm
for years, you guys must be a couple.

51
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,600
Don’t be shy.
It’s normal.

52
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,400
Please don’t tell anyone.
Sky wants to keep it a secret.

53
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,200
So it’s true?

54
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,800
Oh dear.
Trust me, I’m very good at keeping secrets.

55
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,360
- Is that so?
- Of course!

56
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,360
- By the way, P’ Joy.
- Yes?

57
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,320
Sky wants a key card for me, so that
I don’t have to call him to open the door.

58
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,800
He must’ve forgotten.
Can you make a copy for me?

59
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,600
Sure, come get it at
my office when you leave.

60
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,360
- I’ll prepare one for you.
- Thank you.

61
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,640
Come on, I’ll open the door for you.

62
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,000
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

63
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,680
There’s no such thing as secrets.

64
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,200
Latest gossip from Joy’s Dorm.

65
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Nong Sky from room 207
is going out with the hottie.

66
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,400
- Really?!
- I knew ittttt.

67
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,320
- Noooo! My Sky!
- Don't tell anyone.

68
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,280
It was no longer
a secret when I told her.

69
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,800
Thank you for spreading the news.

70
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,440
You’re here, P’ Pai?

71
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,920
Yes, with stewed eggs from famous
shop that I drove for two hours to buy.

72
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,280
Have you gotten any sleep?

73
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,480
And why didn't you sleep?
Your eyes are all red.

74
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,240
I just finished my work this morning.

75
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,840
I didn't wanna sleep in,
so I went straight to class.

76
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,400
But I took a little nap in class.

77
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,680
Please come in.

78
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,360
Weather forecast for next 24 hours.
Thin fog in the morning.

79
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,920
Slight temperature rise.
Overall, it’s going to be warm.

80
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,640
Go sleep in the bedroom.

81
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Come on.

82
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,680
Change your clothes first.

83
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,920
You still waited for me
even when you’re this sleepy.

84
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,440
I wanted to.

85
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,520
You said you were coming.

86
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,040
I had to open the door or you
wouldn’t be able to get inside.

87
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,480
I had to do it before I went to sleep.

88
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
P' Pai.

89
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,520
It’s fading.
What should I do?

90
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,160
I can’t hold back anymore.

91
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,640
What should I do?

92
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,400
And what should I do when
you’ve made me like this?

93
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,200
Sweet dreams.
I’ll let you sleep.

94
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,480
I can’t guarantee your
safety if I stay here.

95
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,760
Why did you turn it off, P’ Pai?
I was enjoying it.

96
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,640
It’s a sin to be happy when
your brother’s miserable.

97
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,480
You’re miserable?

98
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,920
All I see is you pursuing
a younger guy every day.

99
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,440
Do you know how pleased Mom is?

100
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,640
She says if this boy can make you stop
sleeping around, he’ll become her favorite.

101
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,160
And she nagged me to follow your example.

102
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,440
As if you’re a good example.

103
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,600
Then get yourself a boyfriend.

104
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,040
Are you entitled to say that to me?

105
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,880
I’ll show you I can get serious too.

106
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,280
Here.

107
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,080
Do me a favor.
I’ll pay you.

108
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,320
Beautiful?

109
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,880
- Don’t tell me you drew this.
- That’s right.

110
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,400
The guy who always skipped art classes?

111
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,960
Do you miss me, Sky?

112
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,000
P’ Pai, please come see me right now!

113
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,960
Okay, I’ll be there.
Wait for me.

114
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,960
- Gotta go.
- Wait...

115
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,960
Sky! Sky!
Open the door for me.

116
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,440
Sky!

117
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,720
Keep your voice down!
It’s late.

118
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,280
Are you alright?
Why did you cry?

119
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,600
Huh?

120
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,480
What are you talking about?
I didn’t cry.

121
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,560
Come with me.
Come on, come on, come on.

122
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,920
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

123
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,880
Help me glue the boards
according to the design.

124
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,960
Don’t make it crooked.

125
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,640
The roof’s here.
Glue them here.

126
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
What?

127
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,600
Why are you looking at my face?
Look at my hands.

128
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,240
Glue them like this.

129
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,920
Oh, the roof fell.

130
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,360
You called me here to work?

131
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,880
Please help me.
I can’t finish it on my own.

132
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,560
The teacher assigned a new work
today and it's due tomorrow.

133
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,560
And there’s another work
that’s due tomorrow too.

134
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,880
I’m running out of time.
What time is it now?

135
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,440
- What should I…
- Sky!

136
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,160
- P’ Pai…
- Sky!

137
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,720
I don’t mind you calling me here.

138
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,840
I can come no matter
how far I’ve got to drive.

139
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,760
But could you at least tell me?

140
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,840
You called me and
sounded like you were crying.

141
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,200
And you didn’t answer the phone.

142
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,400
Have you ever thought
that I might be worried?

143
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,960
I might be a psychotic
stalker in your eyes.

144
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,280
But please understand
how worried I am of you.

145
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,200
- I’m sorry.
- Forget it.

146
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,640
I could only blame myself.

147
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
P’ Pai, I didn’t mean to worry you.

148
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,400
- I’m sorry.
- Aren’t you in a rush?

149
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,000
What do you want me to do?

150
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,680
I'm sorry.

151
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
Don’t be mad at me.

152
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,800
Please help me.

153
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,800
Pretty please.

154
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,320
Please.

155
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,240
Fine.
What do I’ve got to do?

156
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,680
You’re not mad?

157
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah.

158
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,840
You’re cuter when you smile.

159
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,160
Alright, I’ll show you.

160
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,280
Start by gluing the roof.
Apply the glue first.

161
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,320
Apply it like this.

162
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,640
It’s probably too hard for you.
How about assemble the tree?

163
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,880
Take a look at the design.
Assemble the tree according to the design.

164
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,520
Is it cute?
I drew it myself.

165
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,360
Or how about laying turf?
It’s the easiest part.

166
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,800
Yeah, you can lay the turf.

167
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,160
Oh, I guess you don’t
wanna stain your hands.

168
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,040
Umm, I’d better put the box cutter away.
It’s dangerous.

169
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,920
What should I let you do?

170
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,320
Just assist me then.
It’ll be lovely if we work together.

171
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,480
Right?

172
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,280
- Are you hurt?
- It's no big deal.

173
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,320
I don’t wanna understand anything anymore.

174
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,680
But please don’t be mad at me.

175
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,600
Sleep some more.

176
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,040
I’ll wake you up after I wash up.

177
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,040
Let me help.

178
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,960
Be careful when you walk.
Don’t drop it.

179
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,480
I…

180
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,640
P’ Pai, I’m sorry.

181
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,080
I didn’t mean to worry you.

182
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,880
Then let me punish you with a kiss.

183
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,360
You’re crazy.

184
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,920
What?
Did I say something wrong?

185
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,560
It’s a punishment.

186
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,720
You think it’s funny?

187
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,920
Wanna hear me laugh?

188
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,040
Believe me, I’m not angry anymore.

189
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,120
Okay.

190
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,280
I was angry last night, but not anymore.

191
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,720
You’re not mad at me
when I visit you on my own.

192
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,840
So I should be happy when you
think of me when you're in trouble.

193
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,440
Besides, the reward’s worth it.

194
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,480
What a cheap reward.

195
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,680
Working all night
in exchange for one kiss?

196
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
Sky.

197
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,760
Everyone places different
values on different things.

198
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,480
To me...

199
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,480
You’re priceless.

200
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,920
I’d better go before I can’t hold back.

201
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,400
You can always call me
when you’re in trouble.

202
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,080
But explain to me first.
Don't scare me like yesterday.

203
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Okay?

204
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,280
- Wait.
- Hmm?

205
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,480
I received the punishment.
Now get home safe.

206
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,680
Can you do it one more time?
I wasn’t prepared.

207
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,200
Just leave already!

208
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,600
Sky, if P’ Payu hadn’t helped me
last night, I would’ve been screwed.

209
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,360
I’ve got such a great boyfriend.
Don’t you think so?

210
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,120
P’ Payu’s handsome.

211
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,560
Cool.

212
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,120
And capable.

213
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,160
Though he likes to tease me,
he’s absolutely one of a kind.

214
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Sky.

215
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,400
Sky.

216
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,760
What’s the matter with you?

217
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:49,520
Whenever I brag about P’ Payu,
you usually call me annoying or a bragger.

218
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,400
Yeah, it’s good that
you’re still aware of it.

219
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,400
I’m trying to ignore you though.

220
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,120
But I wanna tell you.
Can’t you just listen to me?

221
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,560
P’ Payu’s handsome…

222
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
P’ Payu’s not the only guy
who’s handsome and cool.

223
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,320
And not the only one who's the best.

224
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,560
Shit.

225
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,680
Who are you talking about?
It’s P’ Pai, right?

226
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,800
Didn’t you say he wasn’t handsome?

227
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,040
Well?
Tell me now.

228
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,120
Tell me everything now.

229
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,040
Did you hand in all the works?

230
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,480
Jeez, don’t bring up works.
I don’t wanna talk about it.

231
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,800
My head’s about to explode.

232
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,680
There's so much to be done.
I can’t take it anymore.

233
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,360
Have you finished them?

234
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,480
Yeah.

235
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,560
Can I take a look?

236
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,400
To Sky, Get a lot of rest
and sleep. From Prapai.

237
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Rain.

238
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,120
my thoughts changed 'cause
I've had a change of heart.

239
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,320
This is bad.

240
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,560
What should I order today?

241
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,960
Are you asking me or yourself?

242
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,240
You know me so well.

243
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,640
I ordered Thai food the other day.

244
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,120
Let’s go for Vietnamese then.

245
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,160
You should apply for membership
if you often use delivery apps.

246
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,760
I already did.

247
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,720
I’m busy this week and so is he.

248
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,320
I’m afraid he’ll forget to eat,
so I order takeouts for him every day.

249
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,960
Your real intention is to receive
his texts after he gets the food.

250
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,160
How did you know?

251
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,800
If you’re a secretary who
needs to stop her boss...

252
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,280
From checking his
phone during meetings...

253
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,800
Then you'll know.

254
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,440
You keep texting me every day.
Got too much money on your hands?

255
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,800
I've got enough to take
care of you for a lifetime.

256
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
He’s so cute that I just wanna eat him up.

257
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,160
This number’s gotta go.

258
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
So does this one.

259
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,680
- I’m gonna test drive this week.
- This one’s a friend. Keep it.

260
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,840
- You have a meeting at 10 a.m.
- This one’s for work.

261
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,640
- I miss you so much, P’ Pai.
- Delete.

262
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,760
Is this one a friend?

263
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,400
This one’s for work.

264
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,080
What are you doing, P’ Pai?

265
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,080
Deleting unnecessary numbers.

266
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,880
Woah, are you really my big brother?

267
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,640
You’ve turned into
a faithful guy out of the blue.

268
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,280
Go back to your room if
you’re gonna pick a fight.

269
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,520
So you don’t want this?

270
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,000
Hey.

271
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,720
You look funny.

272
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,360
Just like the guy who drew you.

273
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,440
It’d be nice if I were like this paper.

274
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,480
No thoughts.

275
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,680
No feelings.

276
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,120
I’ve made up my mind, P’ Pai.

277
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,000
Do you need a hand today?

278
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,160
Cutting cardboards
and woods, putting tapes.

279
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,320
I can do everything.

280
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,040
Then please shut your mouth.

281
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,200
No, I want you to shut my mouth with yours.

282
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,920
You said you’d help me with everything.
Did you mean it?

283
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,320
Yes, I can do everything.

284
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
You sure?

285
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,400
Yes.
Anything for you.

286
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,640
Then…

287
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,080
Go clean the bathroom.

288
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,000
Clean the bathroom?

289
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,560
Yes, clean the bathroom.
Are you going back on your word?

290
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,000
- You don't...
- Okay.

291
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,000
I can do it.

292
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,360
I can do it.

293
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,400
Won’t it be easier
if you just go home?

294
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,600
I wouldn’t put this much
effort for a one-night stand.

295
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,120
I told you it wouldn’t
be easy to drive me out.

296
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,840
Then make it spotless.

297
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,880
Don’t forget to clean
the bookshelf’s top.

298
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,400
Yes, sir.

299
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,480
Go home if you can’t take it.

300
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,640
It’s no big deal.

301
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,160
Put the books in order.

302
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,880
Yes.

303
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,000
This is how you arrange them.
Move.

304
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,560
This one should be here.

305
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,400
This one's here.

306
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,120
This is the correct order.

307
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Thank you.

308
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,800
Do the rest yourself.
I won’t help anymore.

309
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,880
And don’t forget to clean up the desk.

310
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,640
When will you get bored of me?

311
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,720
You want an honest answer or sweet words?

312
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,360
Have I ever asked for sweet words from you?

313
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,679
I don’t know, Sky.
I won’t know until that day comes.

314
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,400
But you’ll get bored someday.

315
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,360
What are you afraid of?

316
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,520
Don’t worry, I’ll be right here.

317
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,239
I won’t leave you.

318
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,280
You said it so confidently.
How much do you like him, Pai?

319
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,639
Okay, I give in.

320
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,360
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean?

321
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,600
Please don’t joke with me.

322
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,800
I meant exactly what I said.
I won’t stop you anymore.

323
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,840
Wait a minute, I didn’t do
all that just to sleep with you.

324
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,880
Fine, I wanna do it,
but it’s not the whole reason.

325
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:23,600
I came here ‘cause I wanted to see you.
I’m satisfied with just making out.

326
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,520
But it’d be nice if I can
taste your whole body.

327
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,440
I sound like a dick.
Forget it!

328
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,440
I’m not just looking
for sex from you, okay?

329
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,520
I don't...

330
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,280
Please shut up and take me.

331
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,560
Are you sure?

332
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,480
Don’t you want me?

333
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
I do.

334
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,800
But I’ll take both
your body and your heart.

335
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,960
P’ Pai, hurry up.

336
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,560
Please get bored of me soon.

337
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,320
It’s what you want?

338
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,680
Please don’t get bored.
Don’t get bored of me, P’ Pai.

339
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,440
Sky.

340
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,440
Sky krub.

341
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,440
My Sky.

342
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,000
Will you just stop?

343
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,880
- Then can I call you ‘Darling’?
- No, I’m not your darling.

344
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,480
I slept with you so that
you’d stop pestering me.

345
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,720
Okay, you’re not my darling.

346
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,480
‘Cause you’re my honey.

347
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,840
I’m not your honey.

348
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
If you say so.

349
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,560
You still haven’t told me
about your favorite foods.

350
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,760
And yet you still buy foods for me.

351
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,320
I’ll buy what you like if you tell me.

352
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,360
I can eat everything.

353
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,800
I don’t like noodles.

354
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,400
But I can eat every dish
that’s eaten with rice.

355
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,320
Mountains or sea?

356
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,600
- Seas.
- Favorite color?

357
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Emerald green.

358
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,320
- Romantic movies or action movies?
- Action movies.

359
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,000
Right.

360
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,200
Doesn’t your dad mind that you
don’t go back home in Lopburi?

361
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
Rain told you that my home's in Lopburi?

362
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,000
He doesn't mind.

363
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,920
I’ve studied in Bangkok since high school.

364
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,240
I lived with my uncle.
He’s got many houses, so he gave one to me.

365
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,600
It was close to school and
a short commute too.

366
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,360
Did you have a hard time?

367
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,640
Come on, I can’t even call it a hard time.

368
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,280
My parents sent money to me every month.
My life was better than other kids.

369
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,840
And I was a wild child at that time.

370
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,040
Living alone at 15 felt
like I’d gained freedom.

371
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,840
I could do anything I wanted.

372
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,560
I may not look it, but I was
a troublemaker in high school.

373
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,280
So you got pierced in high school, right?

374
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,480
- Will you just leave my nipples alone?
- I can’t get them out of my mind.

375
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,360
Put on the rings.
I wanna see how they look like.

376
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,080
- Please.
- No, I don’t wear them anymore.

377
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
Please.

378
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,160
My ex is the one who did the piercing.

379
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,880
Then don't wear them.

380
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,080
Do you still like him?

381
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,680
I wouldn’t sleep with
you if that’s the case.

382
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,080
I leave behind everything about him.

383
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,200
I always come across assholes.

384
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,920
That’s not true at all.

385
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,360
You won’t find another good guy like
me even if you’re reborn three times.

386
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,000
You’re full of yourself.

387
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm so happy.

388
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,240
You should wash up.

389
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,760
Your sweat smells.

390
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,960
I don’t only smell like sweat.
I also smell like…

391
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,160
Bathroom cleaner and toilet.

392
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,000
I think I should wash up.

393
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,560
- Wanna come?
- No.

394
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,040
How could I get bored?
All I'll do is…

395
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,680
Falling for you more.

396
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,040
- You finished the work.
- Yeah.

397
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,280
Where should we eat dinner?

398
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,760
- Dinner?
- You choose.

399
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,320
Oh!
P' Pai, Sawasdee krub.

400
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,080
Finished your class?
I’m here to pick you up.

401
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,760
This?

402
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,240
It’s to assure someone that
I’ve told everyone I’m taken.

403
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,200
And that I won't disappear easily.

404
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,760
What do you mean?

405
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,440
It’s a secret.

406
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,240
Huh?
What secret?

407
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,880
I’m leaving first.

408
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,760
- Good luck. See you.
- Yeah, see you.

409
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,880
- Bye, guys.
- Sawasdee krub.

410
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,640
Sawasdee krub.

411
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:28,760
Can’t believe Sky hides an unexpected
side behind that nonchalant face.

412
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,840
What do you mean?

413
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,280
The whole class likes to tease
you ‘cause you’re so stupid.

414
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,920
It’s so obvious that you
can see it from Mars.

415
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,520
Go ask that auntie.
She knows.

416
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,360
- Auntie?
- Yeah, go ahead.

417
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,480
She’s over there.

418
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,880
Auntie...

419
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,800
- Where...
- I’ll leave it to you, Auntie!

420
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
Hey!

421
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,680
Where are you going?
My car’s here.

422
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,960
If you don’t like it,
then give me a hickey here.

423
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,480
The old one hasn’t disappeared yet.

424
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,280
I love it when you claim ownership.

425
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,640
I never say that I wanna
claim ownership with you.

426
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,480
Really?

427
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,320
Let's go home.

428
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,480
Too blurry.

429
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,120
Guess I’ve got to copy it by hand.

430
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,080
Damn, I should’ve taken an art class.

431
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,000
This is fucking hard!

432
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,920
Here you are.

433
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,320
Former business student and art.
A total disaster.

434
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,280
Let’s do it!

435
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,280
This one looks okay.

436
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,600
English Subtitle by Saowalak K.

437
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,240
You were looking for an
excuse to bring me out on a date.

438
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,800
Here, eat this.

439
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,240
You’ve gotten thinner after you got sick.

440
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,040
Do you like this room?
It’s filled with memories of you.
