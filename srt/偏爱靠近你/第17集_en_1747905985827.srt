00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,000
By the way,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,560
let's go out and have fun later.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We?

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,480
Yes.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,760
I slept well yesterday.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,880
I'm in a good mood today.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,760
I want to go out and have fun.

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,160
But you two,

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,240
don't bother me.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,680
Eat.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,760
Get up.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,160
Alright.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,060
Ahh...

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,040
Go to the mini studio band,

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
get PlanB.

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,180
memorial record

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,700
Morial record

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,800
jap,

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,800
I'm the apple that fell from the tree

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
I want a bite

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Just like the rain that's boiling in the water

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800
You're the summer

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:30,800
I'm the wind that blows from the beach

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Why do you love me so much

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm the apple that fell from the tree

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Why do you love me so much

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,800
I don't know how to search

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Show me wonder

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Show me life

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,800
It's a new beginning

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
So open your eyes

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Remember the feeling

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,800
So open your eyes

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
It's a new beginning

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,800
So open your eyes

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Summer rain or winter snow

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Spring sunshine or autumn glow

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,800
It's a new beginning

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
So open your eyes

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Remember the feeling

42
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Yubing, here you are

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Thank you

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
You're welcome

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Thank you

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
You

47
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Xiaoxiao, you

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Did we kiss and run?

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Kiss

50
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Easy, guess

51
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
You don't count

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
I've never heard of

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
The water dragon is still alive

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Really?

55
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
But I think it cares about me

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
No, no

57
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm not afraid of it

58
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
You're lying

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Okay, let's make a bet

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Okay, what if you lose

61
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
What if you lose

62
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Who loses, who quits

63
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
You said

64
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
I said

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Anyway, I won't lose

66
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
You two play

67
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Really not coming

68
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Really not coming

69
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
I can't be the color-coded ginseng

70
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Indeed, too childish

71
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
But

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
You two are cute

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I think it's pretty good

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
It's a new beginning

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
So open your eyes

76
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Remember the feeling

77
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
So open your eyes

78
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
It's a new beginning

79
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
So open your eyes

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
So open your eyes

81
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Summer rain

82
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Or winter snow

83
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Spring sunshine

84
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Why is it suddenly raining so hard

85
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
I'm done

86
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
I can't catch up with the shadow

87
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
This rain

88
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
It should be the sun

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
The plan should be stopped

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Still say

91
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
It's all your fault

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
So ugly

93
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Not at all

94
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Wasted time

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
It's obvious that you bought ice cream

96
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
You bought it for so long, okay

97
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
You two stop arguing

98
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Now it's mainly about

99
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
How to get through

100
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I have a way

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
What

102
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Come with me

103
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Again

104
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Come with me

105
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Again

106
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Come with me

107
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Again

108
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Come with me

109
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Again

110
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Come with me

111
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Again

112
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Come with me

113
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Again

114
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Come with me

115
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Again

116
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Come with me

117
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Again

118
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Come with me

119
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Again

120
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Come with me

121
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Again

122
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Come with me

123
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Again

124
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Come with me

125
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Again

126
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Come with me

127
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Again

128
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Come with me

129
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Again

130
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Come with me

131
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Again

132
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Come with me

133
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Again

134
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Come with me

135
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Again

136
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Come with me

137
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Again

138
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Come with me

139
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Again

140
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Come with me

141
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Again

142
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Come with me

143
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Again

144
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Come with me

145
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Again

146
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Come with me

147
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Again

148
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Come with me

149
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Again

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Come with me

151
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Again

152
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Come with me

153
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Again

154
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Are you sure you want to compete with each other

155
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
I think it's better to forget it

156
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
It's still a bit dangerous

157
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Nothing

158
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
There are a few people swimming

159
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
And life-saving equipment

160
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Don't worry

161
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Why

162
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
And observe life-saving equipment

163
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
I think

164
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
It's a little dangerous

165
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
I think

166
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
It's a little dangerous

167
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
I think

168
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
It's a little dangerous

169
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
What about the life-saving equipment

170
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Are you afraid

171
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
I'm afraid you'll run away from the battle

172
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
It's a deal

173
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Whoever comes out first

174
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Who loses

175
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Cut the crap

176
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I'll count to three

177
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
One, two, three

178
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
One, two, three

179
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
What's wrong

180
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Help me

181
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
I'm stuck

182
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Help

183
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,200
Help me

184
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Help me

185
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
You go out

186
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Sister Geng

187
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
What

188
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
What

189
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Say what

190
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,880
Little chuck

191
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Little chuck

192
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Say what

193
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Mom

194
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,160
Jiang Meng Han!

195
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,800
Jiang Meng Han!

196
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,160
Yu Mi, what are you doing?

197
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,080
Don't jump!

198
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,960
You can't swim!

199
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,520
Yu Mi, don't jump!

200
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,400
Jiang Meng Han!

201
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,400
Jiang Meng Han!

202
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,960
Jiang Meng Han!

203
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Jiang Meng Han!

204
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Jiang Meng Han!

205
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,280
Jiang Meng Han!

206
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,120
Jiang Meng Han, you scared me!

207
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,240
Why did you come down?

208
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
You scared me!

209
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,640
I...

210
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,600
Are you alright?

211
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll take you up.

212
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,400
Let's go.

213
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,320
You won.

214
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,080
You were shocked that day.

215
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,840
No.

216
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,240
I'm not talking about this.

217
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,200
You are a big man.

218
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,640
You don't have to be strong.

219
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,960
You are just a hero.

220
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,480
You can handle everything.

221
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
You can swim.

222
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Listen,

223
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,840
if you take care of her,

224
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,240
I won't let you down.

225
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,720
Sometimes I feel like you are like her brother.

226
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,680
Sometimes you are like her brother.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,040
You can learn from Yu Mi.

228
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,480
You can help me with the toilet.

229
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,640
I will also be there for you.

230
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,000
I will always be there for you.

231
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,720
You know that, right?

232
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,200
Alright.

233
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,800
If you really want to be like her,

234
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,080
I will also let you down.

235
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,640
But...

236
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,480
But...

237
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,520
It's not easy to be a pro.

238
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,080
What's wrong, Qiao?

239
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,080
I...

240
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,440
Where is Uncle Liu?

241
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,560
He went back.

242
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,800
What's wrong?

243
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,200
Did you two quarrel?

244
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,360
I shouldn't have let you go.

245
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,520
Hey.

246
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,040
You are so afraid of water.

247
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,160
Why did you jump?

248
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,360
I don't know.

249
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,880
Are you worried about me?

250
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,320
I was just thinking about it.

251
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,400
I don't know why I jumped.

252
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,720
You are quite brave.

253
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,440
Actually, looking at it now,

254
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,240
the water is not that scary.

255
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,560
But on the day someone got lost,

256
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,920
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,120
It's not your fault.

258
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,600
I was too useless.

259
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
I was afraid of water.

260
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,520
As soon as I got close to the water,

261
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,360
I remembered the day

262
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,960
my dad was in the water.

263
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
He seemed to know that he was leaving.

264
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,160
He desperately tried to reach the surface of the water

265
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,800
and wanted to see me again.

266
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,480
But I couldn't do anything.

267
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
He hasn't started enjoying life yet.

268
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,960
He hasn't seen me graduate yet.

269
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,960
He hasn't had time to fix the lights at the door.

270
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,280
He didn't wait until the New Year.

271
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,960
He left so suddenly

272
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,640
after eating the dumplings I made.

273
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,320
What's wrong with you?

274
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,680
Are you unhappy

275
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,720
that I told you this?

276
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,840
No.

277
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,440
Don't be sad.

278
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,240
It will all pass.

279
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,480
Leaving is an early night.

280
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,920
We have to face it.

281
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,960
He's always by your side.

282
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,480
It's just another form of existence.

283
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,880
He also hopes that you can live a happy life.

284
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,880
Actually, I really want to comfort you.

285
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,040
But I know how innocent these words are.

286
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,200
There is no real sense of touch in the world.

287
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,360
It's hard to understand

288
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,880
if you haven't lost your family

289
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,480
in this kind of mood.

290
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you want to hear my story?

291
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,120
Brother.

292
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,760
I wrote a song.

293
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,160
Please help me read the lyrics.

294
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,920
Are you in love?

295
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,800
You're so inspiring.

296
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,920
No.

297
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,720
I've prepared a surprise for you.

298
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,400
What surprise? It's so mysterious.

299
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,000
Leave it here. I'll come back and read it.

300
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,880
Please.

301
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,960
Bo Han, Bo Yang.

302
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,000
The delicious afternoon tea is ready.

303
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,880
Look.

304
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,880
It's so crowded. What day is it today?

305
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,640
Your brother's GPA this semester

306
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,360
is 4.0 again.

307
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,360
You're so good.

308
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,280
Look how good my brother is.

309
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,080
You can always get a good grade.

310
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,520
You're the best in class.

311
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,520
I'm proud of you.

312
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,440
Come on.

313
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,120
Give me a reward.

314
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,760
Come on.

315
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,280
Thank you, brother.

316
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,720
I just want to say thank you.

317
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,400
I'm so grateful that you can Champion and

318
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:42,680
그런差不多,

319
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,440
think of getting a good grade.

320
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,120
I have my daughter.

321
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:58,600
So you can applyogtion for the

322
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,800
department of reading stand up.

323
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,000
Thank you.

324
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,040
My good brother's pretty good at art.

325
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,200
monetary memorization and writing songs.

326
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
I was so angry that I forgot about him.

327
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
I completely forgot about his feelings.

328
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Later I found out how sad he had become.

329
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,200
I thought he became depressed because of the song.

330
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Why didn't he come?

331
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
It's just a performance.

332
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Why would he get so angry?

333
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Did you not let him come?

334
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Your performance didn't want me to go.

335
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Why would you blame me?

336
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
I didn't invite you because you can't see me.

337
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
You can't see my music.

338
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
You're still playing the table with me?

339
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
You have to learn to be like your brother.

340
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,200
What kind of career do you have that I don't agree with?

341
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
I just want to play the guitar.

342
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
I just want to sing.

343
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Why can't you support me?

344
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Okay, okay, I don't care about you.

345
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
But I'm telling you, Boyang.

346
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
You can't affect your brother.

347
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
He's currently applying for the school's critical period.

348
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Don't get angry and affect his mood.

349
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
Do you hear me?

350
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
He's the only one in your eyes.

351
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
I don't care.

352
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Am I your son or not?

353
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Zhang Boyang.

354
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
I'm sorry.

356
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
I'm sorry.

357
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I'm sorry.

358
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
I'm sorry.

363
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
I'm sorry.

364
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
I'm sorry.

366
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
I'm sorry.

368
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
I'm sorry.

370
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
I'm sorry.

372
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
I'm sorry.

373
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
I'm sorry.

376
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
I'm sorry.

377
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
I'm sorry.

378
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
I'm sorry.

379
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
I'm sorry.

380
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
I'm sorry.

381
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
I'm sorry.
