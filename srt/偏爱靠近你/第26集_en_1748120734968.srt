1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
The first day of the trip

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,960
The first day of the trip

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,480
Yiming

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,160
Yiming, I'm sorry

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,160
You're still in the middle of the trip

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,720
Yiming

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,000
I know I'm sorry

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Don't believe me

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,520
Don't cry

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960
I'm not thinking about it

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,720
I'll give you

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,680
The shoes they put on

13
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,160
You can wear them

14
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,320
I don't want to go

15
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,920
I'll bring them back

16
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't want to wear them

17
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This

18
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,040
Jiang Mohan is so tall

19
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,920
You don't know how to wear them

20
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,880
You can't wear them

21
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,680
They are so tall

22
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yiming

23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My feet are so dirty

24
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yiming, come out and have a look

25
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I can't come here

26
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I can't get better

27
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm getting a cramp

28
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You have to bring me back

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't have any feet

30
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You can't see anyone

31
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Little monkey

32
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I can't even touch my feet

33
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yiming

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't humor you

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You canout me

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I just love golf

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm hurting my father

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yiming

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,360
And my��

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why can't love be tolerated?

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
How can I leave?

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I heard you're going to play the wind-up.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's none of your business.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why must you participate in this match?

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No, no.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I won't let you choose.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have to go.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Cheng Su Jie.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Cheng Su Jie, your team is starting.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm different from you.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
My life

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
doesn't have a failure.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I like basketball.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want to be a professional.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't want to listen to my parents' arrangement to learn law.

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So I must participate in the match.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And I must win the championship.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I have to prove to them

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
that my choice is right.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Even if my legs don't get up

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can't live my life.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Lawyer?

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Look at me now.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Can you imagine

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
how I would look like

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
wearing a wedding dress every day?

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Next year,

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I will be there

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
to watch

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
drama,

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
love,

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and want you to go in.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What's up?

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I have a chance.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If your life rate can exceed me,

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I will let you participate in the competition.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The competition is over.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Do you think someone will let you participate in the competition?

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You lose.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I have to participate in the competition.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Otherwise, I will have no chance.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Even if my legs are not strong enough,

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I can't do it.

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I will let you participate in the competition.

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Please come in.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Welcome to the final match of the Youth Basketball Festival.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Today's competition is for the champion,

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
the first player in the first round of the Youth Basketball Festival.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He is the strongest black horse in the youth basketball team.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He is a great player.

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Everyone knows that

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
he has always been a special player in the water.

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This year is also the first time for them to enter the final match.

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No matter who wins,

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
they have created the smile record of the project.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Now, let's have a good rest

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and look forward to the exciting performance of both teams.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hello, Xiaoxi.

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
How are you?

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What are you doing there?

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Are you in the water?

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's still warm.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Keep up with me.

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Everybody, get ready.

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Everyone, get ready.

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The Youth Basketball Festival is just about to start.

116
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No problem.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I will look for you after I finish it.

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The Youth Basketball Festival is just about to start.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Bye.

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Go.

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Go.

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,800
Okay.

123
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,760
Bye.

124
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Have you caught the numbers?

125
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
You know this.

126
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,880
Birthday prep.

127
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,600
Get ready!

128
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,760
hey,

129
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,320

You love Uncle?

133
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,280
...

134
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,800
I will tell the Silo

135
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,000
about this strategy as soon

136
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,560
Don't be tooictional.

137
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,640
Inside.

138
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Don't worry.

139
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,280
I announce

140
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,160
the winning team of the New Year's basketball league

141
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,600
should start now!

142
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,520
Good luck!

143
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Good luck!

144
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,000
Alright,

145
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,960

Madес

153
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,380
After the opening, both sides are in the same level.

154
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,020
Jingcai is in the 1st and 3rd place.

155
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,620
Will Jingcai really complete the secret attack this year?

156
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,260
Nanli is using the best team to score.

157
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,380
She's under pressure.

158
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,820
Jingcai is in the 3rd place.

159
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,780
She's in the lead.

160
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,620
Nanli needs to be careful with the defense.

161
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,300
Nanli is in the lead.

162
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,220
What are you doing?

163
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,140
Just now, both sides were hit by a lot of people.

164
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,420
Nanli is in the lead.

165
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,020
Stop!

166
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,180
antine

167
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,060
I like basketball.

168
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,620
I don't want to listen to my parents' arrangement to learn law.

169
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,700
So I must participate in the competition.

170
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,060
I want to prove to them myself.

171
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,780
Even if my legs are not strong enough,

172
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,340
I can't do it.

173
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,820
Take a good rest.

174
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,220
Leave the rest to us.

175
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,060
Keep it up!

176
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,140
Chen Sujie has neglig قal Ad caramelized.

177
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,820
This match is likely to fail.

178
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,100
changed her situation before coming back.

179
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,620
The next competition will be more intense.

180
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,620
The next competition will be more intense.

181
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,620
Yunbin, come on!

182
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,620
Yunsu, keep going!

183
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,620
You can do it now!

184
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,620
You can do it with speed!

185
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,620
What are you playing?

186
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,620
You didn't even see what you were playing.

187
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,620
Can you play basketball as a food?

188
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,620
If you can't win this time, don't mention about basketball.

189
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,620
We will win this time!

190
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,620
We will win this time!

191
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,620
As for playing basketball, it's impossible.

192
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,620
Are you crazy?

193
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,620
Are you crazy?

194
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,620
I'm not crazy.

195
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,620
I'm not crazy.

196
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,620
I'm not crazy.

197
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,620
I'm not crazy.

198
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,620
Are you crazy?

199
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,620
I'm not crazy.

200
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
I'm not crazy.

201
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
Just do whatever you want.

202
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,620
I support you.

203
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,620
We will win this time.

204
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,620
I'm begging you, please find me.

205
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,620
I'm begging you, please find me.

206
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,620
I'm begging you, please find me.

207
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,620
Dad.

208
00:15:35,620 --> 00:16:05,060
Are you the 26-

209
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,620
Xiao Xi.

210
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,520
Dad.

211
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,520
What's wrong? You're still open?

212
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,020
Didn't Dad take care of you before?

213
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,220
If you keep this in mind, he won't be open again.

214
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,320
Xiao Xi, come on.

215
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Let's go.

216
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,720
Dad didn't say anything about you.

217
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,120
Dad is guarding you in front of you.

218
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,620
Listen.

219
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,620
Why did you come over here?

220
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,040
Dad, is it that I'm not going to do it again?

221
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,620
worden

222
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,200
From now on there's going to be no more talk than dangerous things in the future.

223
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,220
I've already set up an attitude.

224
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,820
2R

225
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,240
Get out of my way or I won't let you get surrounded in the course of the snow.

226
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,080
Boss, let me go there.

227
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,220
I have a couple adventures.

228
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,380
Last time that you participated,

229
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,000
I sent the ball to you.

230
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,000
Okay.

231
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,720
Every聽 of a常提,

232
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,520
will always music!

233
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,940
The ball will always be up to you!

234
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,760
Listen,
