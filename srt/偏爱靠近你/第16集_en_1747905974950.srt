1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,120
What's wrong?

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,120
You get off first. I'll take a look at the car.

4
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:28,840
Oh, right.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,680
You don't have to pick me up today.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,240
I'm going to stay here to clean the swimming pool.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,400
Why?

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,000
You're being punished again?

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,640
It's okay. I'll accompany you.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,840
Cleaning is my job.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,240
What are you thinking about?

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,280
I'm just thinking about

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,880
how to score the swimming class.

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,080
Aren't you afraid of water?

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,400
Why do you still choose swimming class?

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,400
Swimming class is a must in our school.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,440
Everyone has to choose.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,400
No one can escape.

19
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,560
It's just swimming.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,640
I'll teach you.

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,520
But you have to

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,200
try to get closer to the water.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,600
Then you'll find that

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
water itself

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,240
is not scary.

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,920
You have to

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,840
take the first step bravely.

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,880
Say it again.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,720
How's the car?

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,400
Okay.

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,840
Okay.

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,240
Get in the car.

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,000
Hurry up. I'm going to speed up.

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,840
What's wrong again?

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,080
I seem to have forgotten to charge.

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,240
I'm going to be late.

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,680
Don't worry. I won't let you be late.

38
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,760
Turn on artificial intelligence mode.

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,000
So idle.

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,880
Go!

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,400
Go!

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,040
Go!

43
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,640
When I think of you,

44
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,720
I'll look forward to

45
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,960
the end of the world.

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,040
You walked

47
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,960
into the life in the idol drama.

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,200
You are the bird, I am the gourd.

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,960
The apple fell from the tree.

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,280
A bite

51
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,240
is like a fish in the water.

52
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,960
You are the summer, I am the sea.

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,440
A gust of wind

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,320
is blowing.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,840
Why do people

56
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,880
not know

57
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,480
how to love?

58
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,880
Here we are.

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,520
I really care about you filled,

60
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,960
so I thought of all of them in that day.

61
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,640
Normally,

62
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,360
if you were somebody else,

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,900
what would have been

64
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,120
that you became?

65
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,040
Why are you still here?

66
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,080
Forget it!

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:48,120
This is just

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,780
Our sister usually comes to the circle.

69
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,780
She can share everything together.

70
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,540
Not so many friends in my dreams.

71
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,100
And Miss Zhou is breathing in me so Trumpet's

72
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,840
Reujing microphone,

73
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,380
Please buy it for me.

74
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,760
Really,

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,900
Why do you always like it so much when alike?

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,280
That's exactly her interest.

77
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,740
It's the only one of my MPD.

78
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,240
That guitar cause problem,

79
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,420
But still,

80
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,020
Do you like Jiang Bo Han?

81
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,420
If you like Jiang Bo Han,

82
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,660
I'll give you one.

83
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,580
Anyway, he's more handsome.

84
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,740
Lin Lin,

85
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,260
what do you think is like?

86
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,380
Like is

87
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,460
at the beginning,

88
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,300
you'll be very curious about him.

89
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,220
When you can't see him,

90
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,420
you'll miss him.

91
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,300
When you get close to him,

92
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,020
your heart will beat fast.

93
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,860
When you see him with someone else,

94
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,260
you'll feel uncomfortable.

95
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,100
Do you feel that way?

96
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,820
Even if I like Jiang Bo Han,

97
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,900
you've seen him

98
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,140
having a misunderstanding

99
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,100
with the former Siaoxin Weishu Ma.

100
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,460
What if it's a misunderstanding?

101
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,380
Why don't you ask him directly?

102
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,620
I won't ask him.

103
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,900
What's wrong, Mr. Jin?

104
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,740
Hello, Yiming, I'm here.

105
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,700
Okay, I'll go first.

106
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,180
Wait, you go first.

107
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,780
Okay.

108
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,980
Why don't you turn on the light?

109
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,220
Did you find out when you turned on the light?

110
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,820
Wait,

111
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,300
it's so dark.

112
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,980
How can you swim?

113
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,740
I just want to try

114
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,060
if I dare to swim.

115
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,140
If I help you overcome your fear,

116
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,500
how will you repay me?

117
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,220
What do you want?

118
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,300
Did you...

119
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,940
Try...

120
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,340
I did.

121
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,540
It's very excited.

122
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,580
Why did you think I didn't wake you?

123
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,260
It's called障哥哥.

124
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,300
Tiantian.

125
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,380
Set it down again.

126
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,420
It's called something...

127
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,620
You're so stubborn.

128
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,340
Isn't it good for you to get revenge?

129
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,140
Without brightest soil, are you like walking on thin ice?

130
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,500
I'll hit you.

131
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,980
Laoshao.

132
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,980
Hey, hey, hey, come after me.

133
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,980
Hey, hey, hey, stop running.

134
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,980
What are you doing?

135
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,980
You're practicing your piano?

136
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,980
I...

137
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,980
Come here.

138
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,980
Don't run.

139
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,980
You Jin Zhu.

140
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,980
Come here.

141
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,980
Come here.

142
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,980
Hey, hey, hey.

143
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,980
Hey.

144
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,980
Hey.

145
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,980
Hey.

146
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,980
What are you two doing?

147
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,980
Morning.

148
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,980
I'm afraid you'll leave after you brush your hair.

149
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,980
What?

150
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,980
I'm asking, what are you two doing?

151
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,980
Can't you see?

152
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,980
We're dating.

153
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,980
Really?

154
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,980
Does it have anything to do with you?

155
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,980
Does it have anything to do with you?

156
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,980
Yes.

157
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,980
It has nothing to do with me.

158
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,980
Then why didn't you reply to my message?

159
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,980
I don't want to cause any misunderstandings.

160
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,980
Why is it Qin Siyang again?

161
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
I also want to know why it's him again.

162
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,980
You didn't understand your own business. Why are you bothering me?

163
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,980
How couldn't I understand?

164
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,980
Then you two are dating?

165
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,980
It's not what you think.

166
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
Let's go.

167
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,980
Let's talk things out first.

168
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,980
Who are you?

169
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,980
Why are you yelling here?

170
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,980
What does it have to do with you?

171
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,980
What's so special about this?

172
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,980
Why are you here?

173
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,980
What are you doing?

174
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,980
Come here.

175
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,980
I'm telling you.

176
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,980
Move, Yu Mingxing.

177
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,980
Stop fighting.

178
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,980
Stop.

179
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,980
Stop.

180
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,240
Why will you be looking at me

181
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,420
Don't feel your first door

182
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,660
Let me dream from afar

183
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,240
Don't touch her

184
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,060
Are you okay

185
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,560
Are you alright?

186
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,560
This is a misunderstanding.

187
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,060
I have nothing with him.

188
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,060
I don't have any. Can you believe me once?

189
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,060
I didn't know you would have a reason.

191
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,060
Xiao Mo Han.

192
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,060
In your world, you're the only one.

193
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,060
You don't know your own future.

194
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,060
You said you liked to be a lawyer.

195
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,060
You said you liked to be a lawyer.

196
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,060
You said you liked to be a lawyer.

197
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,060
You said you liked to be a lawyer.

198
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,060
But you didn't even know about her.

199
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,060
You don't say you liked her.

200
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,060
What are you doing?

201
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,060
What are you doing?

202
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
You know it too. Get in.

203
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,060
Close the door.

204
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,060
What are you doing?

205
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,060
I'm sending you a message.

206
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,060
You're in the middle of something.

207
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,060
I'm sending you a message.

208
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,060
I'm sending you a message.

209
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,060
I'm sending you a message.

210
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,060
What is it?

211
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,060
It's a secret.

212
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,060
You're not telling me, are you?

213
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
I'll ask her myself.

214
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
It's easy to say.

215
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,060
Uncle.

216
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,060
You didn't tell me

217
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,060
because you wanted to save someone.

218
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,060
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

219
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,060
Why should I tell you?

220
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,060
When are you going to stay here?

221
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,060
I'm asking you this.

222
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,060
You're the one who's going to stay here.

223
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,060
I'm not going to stay here.

224
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,060
I'm going to stay here.

225
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,060
I'm going to stay here.

226
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,060
I'm asking you this.

227
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,060
When are you going to stop her?

228
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,060
I...

229
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,060
I've told you everything.

230
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,060
Leave now.

231
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,060
I'm leaving.

232
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
I don't know how to open that door.

233
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,060
Open it for me.

234
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,060
Sheng Chenbo.

235
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,060
I...

236
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,060
No.

237
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,060
Why are you sleeping here?

238
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,060
You're sleeping here?

239
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,060
It's not safe to go back alone at night.

240
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,060
Get up. I'll send you home.

241
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,060
No. I can't.

242
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,060
You have to carry me back.

243
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,060
No.

244
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,060
Where am I going to sleep if you sleep here?

245
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,060
You can sleep anywhere.

246
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,060
Don't bother me.

247
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
Find your own place.

248
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,060
Don't bother me.

249
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,060
I want to sleep too.

250
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
Go away.

251
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,060
Go.

252
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,060
Go.

253
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,060
Go.

254
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,060
Good morning.

255
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,060
Good morning.

256
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,060
Here.

257
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,060
Thank you.

258
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
Yun De Mian.

259
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,220
You really don't even know that he doesn't eat coriander.

260
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,380
Now you know it's late.

261
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
I don't eat it.

262
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Chen Xiao Ou.

263
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,220
You really don't even know that he doesn't eat fat meat.

264
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,420
Xia Xiao Ou.

265
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,060
Of course not.

266
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,620
You really don't even know that I don't eat shrimp feet.

267
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,620
Do you have something to do with me?

268
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,820
Are you looking for trouble?

269
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,020
Don't talk nonsense.

270
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
I eat everything. I don't have the opportunity.

271
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,620
I really don't eat shrimp feet.

272
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,540
By the way,

273
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,900
let's go out and play later.

274
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
We?

275
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,060
I want to go out.
