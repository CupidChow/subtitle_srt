1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first day of the school year

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When I was a kid, I often stopped at home

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I was very scared at home

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
One day, I found out that

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I was in a small room outside

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
with all the snowstorm

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was not scared at all

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It seems that the world is no bigger

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There is a place that can make me feel warmth

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Thank you

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It makes my birthday meaningful

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's really your birthday

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And...

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
20 minutes passed

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Why didn't you say it earlier?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I haven't celebrated my birthday in two years

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Nothing to say

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No, you can't be so casual

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Make a wish

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Forget it

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Why? Don't you want to win the basketball team?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If the wish is useful

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
so many bad things will happen in the world

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Will they disappear?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The wish is not all that time

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But it will give people some good expectations

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm looking forward to it

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why don't you just do it?

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Just make a wish

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, I'll share my wish with you

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Really?

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I just made a wish

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll go clean first

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You seem to have news

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You seem to have news

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's wrong? I'm a gun

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Congratulations

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's celebrate

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can't

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can't hold it in

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, I can't hold it in

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And I can't away me down on my fire

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And I can't away me down on my fire

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can't hold it in

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can't hold it in

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can't hold it in

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I can't hold it in

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can't hold it in

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I want to live in a distance

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm the one you want

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I want to be the apple of love

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There's a reason

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I want to live in the water

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're the summer

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm the one

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The wind is blowing

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I can't understand

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why is it so hard to understand

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How to leave

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm crying

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're the one

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm crying

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You're the one

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I was going to say

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm the one who's cute

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And the one who's eating

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm the one who's making you crazy

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No one will like me

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Do you think so?

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I...

73
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I think you're not good

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You can win

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You think I can?

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Of course

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She said something wrong

78
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No one will like you

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Your parents

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Grandmother

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Grandfather and Grandpa

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And Xiao Xi

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And me

84
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What do you mean?

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Are you confessing to me?

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Say it again

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Mom

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You should go

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Do you remember when we first met

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I saw you at the ballpark

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You were cute

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You had big eyes

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And bright eyes like a star

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Later

95
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
In the library, you followed me

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You discovered my secret

97
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,400
I decided to go to see my own leg.

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,640
I'm very grateful for your company

99
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,640
in this period of time.

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,240
You accompanied me to the hospital,

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,160
accompanied me to the clinic.

102
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,160
When we were having dinner,

103
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,640
you helped me drink.

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
You drank and drank.

105
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,200
I was very, very fond of you.

106
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,600
I didn't protect you

107
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,600
and let you drink so much for me.

108
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
During this period,

109
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,800
you've been with me.

110
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm very happy.

111
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,600
Don't let me know you more.

112
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,800
Wang Chun Nian.

113
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
I like you.

114
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,800
Can you be with me?

115
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,000
Promise me.

116
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
Sister Chun.

117
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,200
It's the first time

118
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
you're so stupid.

119
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,400
Okay.

120
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,200
Don't cry.

121
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
This is the first time

122
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
I'm so stupid with you.

123
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,000
What?

124
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,200
After all,

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
ALIK any side dog is always around.

126
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
Get up.

127
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm!!!

128
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,600
What am I dreaming of?

129
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,200
I will make the same decision as you

130
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,200
Ah Li's

131
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,100
Seconddisciple

132
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,220
What are you looking at?

133
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,540
Thick Neil'sやって

134
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,600
Thanks

135
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,420
Your favorite, stamping

136
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,800
It's still so Delicious

137
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,100
mm

138
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,600
As you were to leave

139
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,220
I am going somewhere else to eat

140
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,960
But

141
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,660
It's the tastiest thing to presence with me

142
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,560
Then do you know

143
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,400
about why I like to eat

144
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,360
Do you like Fruity White?

145
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,320
Of course.

146
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,520
Fruity White is only the most rich part of the coffee.

147
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,360
It has a better flavor,

148
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,520
with low milk content,

149
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,880
and less drinking-like products.

150
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,320
It's good for skin.

151
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,520
And...

152
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,400
it's more light and plump.

153
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,600
It's not easy to stick it on your mouth.

154
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,880
It's more elegant to drink.

155
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,840
So it's very suitable for you.

156
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
I remember you didn't like coffee before.

157
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,120
It's not because you like it.

158
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,520
I went to study it.

159
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,000
Then why did you continue to drink it?

160
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,880
I couldn't.

161
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,560
I was drunk.

162
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,680
We chatted so long.

163
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,040
We didn't get well.

164
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,440
But里 you feel better,

165
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,640
right?

166
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,800
Okay.

167
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,240
I don't want such trouble.

168
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,100
Xiaowen entered my開始.

169
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,760
Just현 caught my eye.

170
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,680
I only have two days left.

171
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,200
Don't make a big deal out of it.

172
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
I haven't seen you in a long time.

173
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,960
Are you okay now?

174
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,560
Do you still have contact after breaking up?

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,760
Two years.

176
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,200
I haven't had contact for a long time.

177
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,760
Now,

178
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,040
I don't want to contact you anymore.

179
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,800
Actually, I want to know him.

180
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,520
What?

181
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,880
Thank him.

182
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,640
If he didn't know you,

183
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,240
you would be happy to be in the family, right?

184
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,640
This is called

185
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,440
the happiness line behind the clouds.

186
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,760
I thought you would go to live in a house outside the country.

187
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,280
You forgot about us.

188
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,560
I just went abroad.

189
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,760
I'm not a beggar.

190
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,800
I envy you.

191
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,280
You are so young

192
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,120
that you can find someone you love forever.

193
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,640
You are too long.

194
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,880
You can just live well now.

195
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,880
I'm going to celebrate my birthday.

196
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,640
Are you going to give me a birthday present?

197
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
What do you think of me?

198
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
You little brat, dare to joke with me?

199
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
I won't give you a present if you don't want to.

200
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,040
Xiaoxi,

201
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,120
stay outside with Uncle for two days.

202
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,120
Now, go.

203
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,920
Why?

204
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,040
Why are you so sudden?

205
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
The people who are staying in the village are so quiet.

206
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,880
I'm worried about you.

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,520
I'm worried that they will come to you.

208
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,040
Mom, don't worry.

209
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,120
It's the legal system now.

210
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,440
They won't do anything to me.

211
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,560
No.

212
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,640
Listen to me.

213
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,600
Just go now.

214
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,040
Don't worry.

215
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,240
Remember to come back early.

216
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,120
Okay.

217
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,680
Mom, I have something to do.

218
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,880
Stop.

219
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,520
What are you running?

220
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,120
Stop.

221
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,360
Mingxi.

222
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,160
You are...

223
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,680
Get in the car.

224
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,240
Don't run.

225
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,040
Stop.

226
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,600
Let's go.

227
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,640
Hello.

228
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,160
She ran away.

229
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,880
So you are Jiang Mohan's senior?

230
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,520
Yes.

231
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,000
I graduated from the capital.

232
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Those people just now...

233
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,840
They are...

234
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,040
They are from the capital.

235
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,240
But,

236
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,240
Xue,

237
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,720
why are you at my door?

238
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,320
I came to you.

239
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,040
I want to ask you to persuade Jiang Mohan

240
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,600
to accept the invitation from Qing Lang Team.

241
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Qing Lang Team?

242
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,960
Jiang Mohan started playing basketball since primary school.

243
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,160
He was a private player in high school.

244
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,560
He also got the invitation from Qing Lang Team.

245
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,000
At that time, he was very famous.

246
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
He should have told you about Boyang.

247
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,720
Since then, he has been like a person.

248
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,240
He never mentioned foreign affairs.

249
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,080
He got the invitation too.

250
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,240
Luckily, aunt came to him.

251
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,240
It's been two years.

252
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,440
He should have looked ahead.

253
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,480
But it seems that...

254
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,200
Jiang Mohan has become very active after meeting you.

255
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,520
I know you care about him.

256
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,880
If you really want to help him,

257
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,640
you can help me persuade him.

258
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,680
But,

259
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
does he really want to listen to me?

260
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,280
I've never seen him

261
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,520
be so sad for a girl.

262
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,320
When Boyang left,

263
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
he never had a birthday.

264
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,800
But he was willing to blow the candles with you.

265
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,120
That means you already have him in your heart.

266
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,480
Go abroad with him.

267
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,040
But, Senior Sister,

268
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,040
you also know my family situation.

269
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,440
So you work hard

270
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,560
to pay off your debts?

271
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,880
Pay off your debts?

272
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,960
Senior Sister,

273
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,600
you must keep this matter a secret for me.

274
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,000
You must not tell Jiang Bohan.

275
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,160
Don't worry. I won't say it.

276
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,680
Actually, if you have a financial problem,

277
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,160
I can help you.

278
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,120
No need.

279
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,320
This is my family matter.

280
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,360
I still want to solve it myself.

281
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,960
You don't have to be polite with me.

282
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,560
I don't have to pay you back.

283
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,240
I just don't want those benefits.

284
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,160
You are young and young.

285
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,160
You can't get through the life pressure.

286
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,320
I feel bad.

287
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,040
I'm not like Jiang Bohan.

288
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,000
Or,

289
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,800
if you want to find someone to help you,

290
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,840
you can find me.

291
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,840
Trust me.

292
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
I'm a professional garbage can.

293
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,120
You've already entered his heart.

294
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,080
You should go out with him.

295
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,000
Do me a favor.

296
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,600
Don't hurt his heart.
