1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,000
What do you want to say?

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,560
Just say it here

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,720
Let's make up

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,840
I don't want to go on like this anymore

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,160
I don't want to go on like this anymore

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,240
We are just friends

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,400
Nothing good

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,840
If you still blame me for that

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,000
I can keep apologizing to you

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,160
Until you forgive me

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,760
But you can't ignore me

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,840
I don't blame you

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,800
I didn't ignore you either

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,960
I don't blame you

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,960
If you have to find a reason

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,000
Then you can just

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,880
I still can't forget that thing

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,920
I don't blame you

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,040
I don't blame you

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,400
But do you know how much I like you

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,280
But I don't deserve you to like me

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,880
Don't delay yourself

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,160
I don't think I'm delaying myself

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,560
I can go wherever you go

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,400
I've said what I should say

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,640
Rest early

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,480
Zhang Wuhan

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,760
When did you become like this?

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,840
I've always been like this

31
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,000
You are the bird, I am the apple that fell from the tree

32
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,960
I want to drink it like the fish living in the water

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:08,960
You are summer, I am the wind that blows from the beach

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,240
Why do people who love things not know how to do it

35
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,640
I'm not a bird

36
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm a bird

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm a bird

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
I'm a bird

39
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
I'm a bird

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm a bird

41
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
I'm a bird

42
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
I'm a bird

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
I'm a bird

44
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
I'm a bird

45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm a bird

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm a bird

47
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
I'm a bird

48
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
I'm a bird

49
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
I'm a bird

50
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
Hello, mom

51
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Xiaoxi, it's raining, go home early

52
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
Mom, how are you?

53
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
When will you come back?

54
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
I've got a big order in the city

55
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
I think I'll be back this evening

56
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Yes

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
What's wrong?

58
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Is there something wrong with the school?

59
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
No, nothing wrong with the school

60
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
If you need money, tell me

61
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
I will think of a way

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
You can participate in the school activities

63
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
Get along with your classmates

64
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
Don't be shy

65
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,120
My classmates and I get along well

66
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,120
I'll give you money this weekend

67
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
I'll send you money to pay the rent

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
No, mom

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,120
You can keep the money

70
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Keep it for the debt

71
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Our community is so powerful

72
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
We can pay the rent in advance

73
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Don't underestimate me

74
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
I'm about to get the scholarship

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
The rent for the next year is going to be mine

76
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
It's all my fault

77
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,120
I didn't give you a better life

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
If only your dad were here

79
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
We can only be together now

80
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,400
He's not a good match for Jingtai

81
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Don't push him

82
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Dad

83
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Dad, you said you would hold me

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
I won't fall down

85
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm sorry

86
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
I'm sorry, my daughter

87
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
I will make mistakes

88
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
You have to work hard

89
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,680
You said I wouldn't be good to you

90
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
I apologized to you

91
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
Look, you're standing up now

92
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
It doesn't matter if you fail

93
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
I'll start over with you

94
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Come on

95
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
I'll help you this time

96
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
I won't let you fall again

97
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
I'll give you another chance

98
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Xiaoqi believes in dad

99
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Dad also believes in Xiaoqi

100
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Come on

101
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Slow down

102
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Okay

103
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Dad

104
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
I miss you so much

105
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
I miss you so much

106
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
I miss you so much

107
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
I miss you so much

108
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
I miss you so much

109
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
I miss you so much

110
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I miss you so much

111
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
I miss you so much

112
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I miss you so much

113
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
I miss you so much

114
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
I miss you so much

115
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
I miss you so much

116
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
I miss you so much

117
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
I miss you so much

118
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
I miss you so much

119
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
I miss you so much

120
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
I miss you so much

121
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
I miss you so much

122
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
I miss you so much

123
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
I miss you so much

124
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
I miss you so much

125
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
I miss you so much

126
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
I miss you so much

127
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
I miss you so much

128
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
I miss you so much

129
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
I miss you so much

130
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
I miss you so much

131
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
I miss you so much

132
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
I miss you so much

133
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
I miss you so much

134
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
I miss you so much

135
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
I miss you so much

136
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
I miss you so much

137
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
I miss you so much

138
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
I miss you so much

139
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
I miss you so much

140
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
I miss you so much

141
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
I miss you so much

142
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
I miss you so much

143
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
I miss you so much

144
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
I miss you so much

145
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
I miss you so much

146
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
I miss you so much

147
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I miss you so much

148
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
I miss you so much

149
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
I miss you so much

150
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
I miss you so much

151
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
I miss you so much

152
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
I miss you so much

153
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
I miss you so much

154
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
I miss you so much

155
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
I miss you so much

156
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
I miss you so much

157
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
I miss you so much

158
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
I miss you so much

159
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
I miss you so much

160
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
I miss you so much

161
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
I miss you so much

162
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
I miss you so much

163
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Sick of waiting

164
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Lying there for days

165
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Wishing for the season to change

166
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Now you see the best in me

167
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,960
The fire burns

168
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,960
And it's in my soul

169
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,960
Oh I can't hold it in

170
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Why are you crying?

171
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Oh I can't hold it in

172
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
I just fell

173
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,960
And I'm gonna wind it down on the fire

174
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
And I'm gonna wind it down on the fire

175
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
And I'm gonna wind it down on the fire

176
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Are you here to laugh at me?

177
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,960
I can't hold it in

178
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Get in the car with me

179
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
I can't hold it in

180
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Lin Mingxi

181
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,960
And now I reach for the sky

182
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
And I see myself in it

183
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
No matter what happens

184
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,960
You have to cherish your body

185
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Just do me a favor

186
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Get in the car with me

187
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,960
I can't hold it in

188
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
I can't hold it in

189
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Can't hold it in

190
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
You can't hold it in

191
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
I can't hold it in

192
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
I can't hold it in

193
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
Just cry if you want

194
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
I won't watch

195
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
I'm sorry

196
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
I wet your car

197
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
I don't feel bad.

198
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
You're wet.

199
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,560
What if you catch a cold?

200
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,400
When I get to the front,

201
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,800
put me down.

202
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,080
Did my mom look for you again?

203
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,080
No.

204
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,720
It's my own problem.

205
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,560
It's good to hurt her.

206
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,920
And Qin Siyou.

207
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,200
It's also because of me.

208
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,080
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,240
It's not your problem.

210
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,800
It's me who's been under too much pressure.

211
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,640
Whether it's true or not,

212
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,160
I want to do something for you.

213
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,920
Otherwise, I will

214
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,360
feel guilty.

215
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,640
It's okay.

216
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,680
Lin Fanyu, you're much better.

217
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,560
Then I won't give you a umbrella next time.

218
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,640
Did you just

219
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,160
face Lin Daoyue?

220
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,800
Thanks.

221
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:49,080
Be good.

222
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,080
I'm going to show my face to the world

223
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,080
I'm going to show my face to the world

224
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,080
I'm going to show my face to the world

225
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,080
I've been staring at it all

226
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,080
I've seen too many days without light to stay in the dark

227
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:12,080
I'm going to show my face to the world

228
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,080
Because I'm not scared anymore

229
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
I'm telling you right now

230
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
I'm taking it my now

231
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,080
I'm going to show my face to the world

232
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Show my face

233
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
That's what youth is like

234
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
No matter how big the grievance and sadness are

235
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
It seems that they can be healed in an instant

236
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Passed by

237
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Show my face

238
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Here, wipe your towel first

239
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Why do you have to go down the road

240
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
Who let you follow me

241
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,080
I'm worried about you

242
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Change your clothes

243
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
You changed your pajamas

244
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
This is the pajamas we made at home

245
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
You can make it

246
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Then I'll wash your clothes for you

247
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Jiang Menghan, the bathroom is over there

248
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
I know

249
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Go

250
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080

251
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
Whose

252
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
My dad's

253
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,080
I don't think it's good to wear uncle's clothes

254
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
What if he wants to wear it

255
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
He can't wear it

256
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
After my dad left

257
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
My mom was angry with him

258
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Throw away all his things

259
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Only this dress left

260
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
What's wrong

261
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
Don't be angry

262
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Nothing

263
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
It's been more than a year

264
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
You see

265
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,080
Am I well-behaved now

266
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
What I said in the car just now

267
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
It's all counted

268
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Which sentence

269
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,080
You said you wanted to do something for me

270
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Of course

271
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,080
Can you teach me English

272
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Then start from this sentence

273
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,080
When I stand before you at the day's end

274
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,080
You shall see my scars and know

275
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,080
That I had my wounds and also my healing

276
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
What do you mean

277
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
The meaning is

278
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
When the day is over

279
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
I stand in front of you

280
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
You will see my scars

281
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
You will know that I was hurt

282
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,080
I was also healed by your hands

283
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
Too much

Just put the formula of last morning in it

Are you a fish

312

When I think of you

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
I will look at the clock on the wall

317
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
with a dazed look

318
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
I remember the first time we met

00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
when we walked on the street
