00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Love Me If You Dare

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Xiao Xi, why are you here?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,600
We just finished our dance practice.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,400
He said the team had a dinner. So we came here.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,000
What about you?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,200
I wanted to come to this restaurant a long time ago.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's go.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,800
If he asks me why I'm working with Chen Siqi,

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,600
please tell me.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,800
It's my job.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,400
Let's go.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,400
Love Me If You Dare

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,800
When I think of you,

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,400
I look at the clock on the wall with a daze.

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,200
As I walk,

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,200
I fall into the life in the idol drama.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:15,200
You are the beef stew. I am the apple that falls from the bamboo.

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Oh, I want a bite.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,200
It's like a fish swimming in the water.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:32,200
You are the summer. I am the wind that blows from the beach.

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Why do people not know how to tell a love story?

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,800
You two are a couple.

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,000
It seems that your relationship with Lin Chaoyang is not normal.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You are talking nonsense.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm kidding.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,200
We are late. Let's drink.

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,000
This rice wine is only two degrees. What's the point?

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's too high.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,400
One degree.

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,400
No matter how much it is, let's drink first.

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,200
You are taking the digestive medicine. You can't drink.

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,600
What are you two talking about? Tell us.

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,400
He just asked me who we are asking to drink.

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,600
I said you.

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Brother Qi, you are not honest.

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,200
I remember the last time we ate, it was me and my dad who sent you back.

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Let's compare. Come on.

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,600
I'm good at drinking. Comparing to me.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,600
Why is there someone who is moving the old soldiers?

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,600
Are you okay? Drink less.

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
There's a problem.

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,000
Come on. I'll make a suggestion.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,200
Celebrate our reunion. Two new members are joining.

45
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,400
Let's celebrate our basketball team.

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,000
Cheers.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,800
I'll do it.

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I'm thirsty. Let's drink.

49
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,400
Cheers.

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,800
To celebrate our team's victory,

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
I'll toast to you.

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Thank you for your hard work.

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Especially Brother Jie. This time, you did a great job.

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,200
Cheers.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,200
Brother, drink less. It's okay.

56
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,400
Who I used to be, you took everything it hurts to lose.

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,600
I can only hear with someone like you.

58
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,000
I could be stronger, thinking the hands I feel are yours.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,800
Yes, it's wrong, but it might be the only girl I love that's brand new.

60
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,400
Who told you to drink so much?

61
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,000
I promised you that I would take care of you.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,400
I will keep my promise.

63
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,600
Okay.

64
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
Keep your promise.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,400
Next time I'm not here, you better not drink.

66
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
What?

67
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,000
Are you afraid that no one will send you home?

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,400
I'm afraid that when others see you like this,

69
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,000
they won't be able to help but like you.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,800
What?

71
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,200
Nothing.

72
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,400
Chen Su Jin.

73
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,400
You have to thank me.

74
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,200
Thank you.

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,800
Thank me for what?

76
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,400
Thank you for drinking for me.

77
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
Thank you for going to the hospital with me.

78
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,200
Thank you for caring for me and taking care of me.

79
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,000
Chen Su Jin.

80
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,800
Can I ask you for a favor?

81
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
What favor?

82
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,200
Um...

83
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Just...

84
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
That...

85
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Next week's dance party,

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,400
can you be my dance partner?

87
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,200
Oh.

88
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
I can't.

89
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,600
I know.

90
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,000
You must have invited someone else, right?

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,600
It's fine.

92
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,200
I'll think of another way.

93
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,000
What way?

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,400
Stop asking.

95
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,200
Let me find a step and continue to work.

96
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,400
I can't help you because I...

97
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,200
Stop talking.

98
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,600
I was already embarrassed.

99
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
I drank too much.

100
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,400
I'm not talking nonsense, right?

101
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,200
Can you listen to me?

102
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,200
Yes.

103
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
You say it.

104
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,800
I'll be your dance partner.

105
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,000
Because I want to be your dance partner.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Not because you asked me for help.

107
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,600
It hurts.

108
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,400
You dare to fool me.

109
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,800
I have to make it clear.

110
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,000
What do you want to know?

111
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,200
Wang Chu Nian.

112
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,800
Can I officially invite you to be my dance partner?

113
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,600
I was thinking,

114
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,200
if you dare to reject me,

115
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,200
I won't forgive you anymore.

116
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,600
I won't reject anyone.

117
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Really?

118
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Really.

119
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm not going.

120
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Wang Chu Nian.

121
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,800
It's so cold.

122
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
The End

123
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
One more set.

124
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Come on.

125
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Chen Suji, I'll help you.

126
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Help me.

127
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
This move hurts my knees.

128
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Stop it.

129
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
I have no reason to stop.

130
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
I'll help you find some.

131
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Brother Qi, what's wrong?

132
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
You look down.

133
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Nothing.

134
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
I didn't sleep well last night.

135
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Didn't sleep well?

136
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
What did you do last night?

137
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
He was with me yesterday.

138
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
You two...

139
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
What are you thinking?

140
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
He went to the hospital with me yesterday.

141
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
What's wrong with you?

142
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
It's all Chen Suji's fault.

143
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
He bumped into me when he was practicing yesterday.

144
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
You promised to go with me to the review today.

145
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Have you finished practicing?

146
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
I haven't finished practicing.

147
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Can we go later?

148
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
No, we'll go now.

149
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
I'll go.

150
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
The staff is looking for me.

151
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I'll call you back.

152
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Thank you.

153
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
No.

154
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
My bag, Shou Yang.

155
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm here.

156
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,800
No. 576, Chen Suji.

157
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
I'm here.

158
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
What's your name?

159
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Chen Suji.

160
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
There will be cold blood in a while.

161
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Don't be afraid.

162
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
I'm not afraid of you.

163
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
That's good.

164
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Is it empty in the morning?

165
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
It's empty.

166
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,800
I need to go on a date in five minutes.

167
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Don't worry.

168
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Yes, let's go now.

169
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Hand can be loose now.

170
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,800
He's so young.

171
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
He's from the basketball team.

172
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Good body.

173
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,820
Canvass in Ruby

174
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,360
Thank you

175
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,300
If you're getting caught by me

176
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,360
How do you make things easier?

177
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,460
It's because network hockey

178
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,380
I'm so afraid

179
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,820
Even I worried I would give up

180
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:22,340
I made a

181
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:22,500
Cloud Un Jackey

182
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,900
Cloud soccer

183
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,380
you

184
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,260
Have a quick stopping and�

185
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,420
There is a shop

186
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,940
Thank you

187
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,180
Help me waves

188
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,940
Next time I'll help you

189
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,420
That's it

190
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,140
I will wear a très

191
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,740
Row

192
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,060
Guest food

193
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:06,380
One, two, three, two, two, three, three, two, three, four, two, three.

194
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,380
Boss.

195
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,380
What is it?

196
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,380
I recently borrowed money.

197
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,380
Can you give me the next month's salary?

198
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,380
I definitely don't have the salary.

199
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,380
Boss.

200
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
Just this once.

201
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,380
I really need money.

202
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,380
You can choose to reserve the salary.

203
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,380
But there is a condition.

204
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,380
You must pay me back.

205
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,380
I will pay you back.

206
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,380
But there is a condition.

207
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,380
Can you do it?

208
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,380
Yes.

209
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,380
Then try it like this.

210
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,380
His level is not enough.

211
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,380
I think he can do it.

212
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,380
Let him try.

213
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,380
I won't be soft-handed.

214
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,380
Okay.

215
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,380
Can you fight?

216
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,380
Can you fight?

217
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,380
It's not easy.

218
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,380
It's not easy.

219
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,380
Come on.

220
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
Again.

221
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:58,380
Let me shine the light of love around you

222
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:07,380
Let me shine the light of love around you

223
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:28,380
Let me shine the light of love around you

224
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,380
Yu Weixin, your package.

225
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,380
Coming.

226
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,380
Where is he?

227
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,380
I'm here.

228
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Wait for me at home.

229
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,380
I'm going to pick you up now.

230
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
I'm going to pick you up now.

231
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,380
I'm going to pick you up now.

232
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,380
Move away.

233
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,380
Hurry up.

234
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,380
No wonder boss beat him once.

235
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,380
He did beat him.

236
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,380
Where is your boss?

237
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Boss went to the dance party.

238
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,380
But you can't go.

239
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,380
Yan Zhenwen is still so un-create.
