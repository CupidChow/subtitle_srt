1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,400
You have to promise me a condition first

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,320
You are cruel

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,200
Then

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,160
What is the condition you want to say

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,400
Don't be weak in the future

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,080
OK

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,880
You said sixty seconds later and you went out

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,240
Sixty seconds

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,440
Think of me

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,160
Do you still want to graduate smoothly

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,200
Do you still want to continue playing basketball

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,200
Can you not always

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,520
Small topic big work

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,080
You are now

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,840
Would you rather sacrifice your future

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,560
Just to fight against me

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,040
I'm an adult

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,200
I can take responsibility for my future

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,320
You are not enough

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Can you afford your future

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,000
You go abroad during the summer vacation

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
Let your dad take care of you

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,680
By the way, ask for a team test

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,640
Don't go

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,960
You don't want to listen to me

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,680
Listen to your dad, okay?

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,520
No way

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,320
I think this is good

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,080
OK, you can do it

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,440
Rest here

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,400
go

33
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
Your blood is enough

34
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,480
Xiao Xi

35
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,040
overarching

36
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,880
Where are you

37
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,920
I'll find you now

38
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,160
I am

39
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,040
I am busy

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
I won't talk to you anymore

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,680
Don't don't

42
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,440
Turn off

43
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,720
I- I know that.

44
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,760
I was becomingolt saved.

45
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,560
I finished for you today.

46
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,640
This- cameo.

47
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,640
Who gave you the right to leave?

48
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Who gave you the right to leave?

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,800
I'll leave for the university education center joining today.

50
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,920
Oneï¿½ authorities wouldn't be willing

51
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,400
to let us leave just like the class would now.

52
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,320
You survives makes me notagramm lakh.

53
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
You're hurt.

54
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Your leg is hurt.

55
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Be quiet.

56
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,320
I'm hurt.

57
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
You're in the library.

58
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
But...

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,320
Why are you following me?

60
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,720
I'm not.

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
No?

62
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
How do you prove you're not?

63
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
How do you prove you're not?

64
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Is it enough to prove it?

65
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
It's pretty cute.

66
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
I heard...

67
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,720
You wrote love letters to many people in our school.

68
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
That's right.

69
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
I'm curious.

70
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
How did you do it

71
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
to write love letters to so many people at the same time?

72
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
You don't know

73
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,720
how hard it is to be rejected by the person you like.

74
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,720
So I divided my love into many parts.

75
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
This way, my confidence won't be so high.

76
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,720
I don't have the confidence to make others like me.

77
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
I don't have expectations.

78
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
I don't have disappointment.

79
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
I like you.

80
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
That's it.

81
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
I like you.

82
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
When did you like this kind of flavor?

83
00:06:47,720 --> 00:07:12,320
Emperor

84
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,840
My mother told me to change T-shirts

85
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,300
I can't go out to change

86
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,620
Bro.

87
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,260
Are you giving up just by fighting?

88
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,580
Xiaoxi.

89
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,980
I don't know you and Chen Sujie are together.

90
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,180
Tell me. What's the matter?

91
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,380
We just happened to meet.

92
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,980
Oh, happened to meet.

93
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,980
When you asked me to write a love letter,

94
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,980
I don't think I've ever written Chen Sujie's name.

95
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,180
Hey, there are so many guys in the basketball team.

96
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,380
Who do you like?

97
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,580
I like all the guys who look handsome.

98
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,180
Can't I?

99
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,380
Okay, okay.

100
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,980
Oh, right, Xiao Xi.

101
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,580
You just asked me to go with you to see Jiang Bo Han.

102
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,180
Why are you looking for him?

103
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,780
His phone is here. I'm going to the yellow hall.

104
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,780
Oh, right. His house?

105
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,180
How do you know his house?

106
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,580
You two...

107
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,380
No, no need. Let's go home. It's raining.

108
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:18,780
I'd like to say that my love to you is full of love in this world.

109
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,180
But you knew that I read those books adorably.

110
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,980
You should just go play the next ball.

111
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,780
I have to wear the sageness weetweder.

112
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,580
I told you to stop!

113
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,580
Don't you know that painting is a very tough subject?

114
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,780
It's none of your business to be silent.

115
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,180
But it won't be your end.

116
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,780
Look at me.

117
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,240
Baby!

118
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,260
I'm ready.

119
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,260
Ding, I'm ready.

120
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,860
Xiao Xi, run faster.

121
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,780
You'll be late.

122
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,580
Why are you here?

123
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,540
To accompany you.

124
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,820
For me?

125
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,980
You haven't had breakfast yet, right?

126
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Thank you.

127
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,300
You run so empty every morning.

128
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,980
No wonder you have a blood sugar problem.

129
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,940
I'm too busy in the morning.

130
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,620
I go to school every day.

131
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,060
That's right.

132
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,060
The convenience store is closed at night.

133
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,980
You've worked hard, Yu Mingxi.

134
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,140
I told you not to touch my hair.

135
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,700
Get in the car.

136
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,860
Today is your day off.

137
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,140
Come on.

138
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,380
If you don't, you'll be late.

139
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,580
Okay.

140
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,660
There's nowhere I'd rather be

141
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,300
I hope that you feel the same as me

142
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,180
Jiang Bohan at this time

143
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,460
is like a free wind

144
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,300
blowing into my life without knowing

145
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,340
and blowing my nervous nerves.

146
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,300
His calmness and weakness

147
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,100
and his bad looks

148
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,500
make me want everything about him.

149
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,180
Didn't you say you'd let me go in advance?

150
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,500
You're not going to do that in advance?

151
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,500
Okay, I'll go first.

152
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,900
You don't want to say thank you?

153
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,180
Thank you.

154
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,300
Sorry, I have to go to class.

155
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,060
I'm going to class.

156
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,180
What both parties know is that

157
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,100
if you don't speak up,

158
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,820
I'll cut my finger and hit you.

159
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,300
foundation

160
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,820
Eyelash

161
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,340
I think you've had enough of r perfection.

162
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,260
No pressure, it's not bad.

163
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,860
Yes.

164
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,020
But looking at me,

165
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,300
do you really want me to take this class?

166
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,460
Me?

167
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,620
Or do you want me to take the next class?

168
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,060
Sorry, go to work and you go out.

169
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,860
See you tomorrow.

170
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,860
I'm not going to put it in.

171
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,860
Hurry up.

172
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,460
I'm going to teach.

173
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,860
You can find it and teach it yourself.

174
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
Okay.

175
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,860
Xiao Xi, did you forget to sit down or bring it?

176
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,860
I wrote it down. I can't find it.

177
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,860
I'm going to write it down.

178
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,860
I'm going to write it down.

179
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,860
I'm going to write it down.

180
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,860
Okay.

181
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,860
Yu Mingxi.

182
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,860
Your recent English grades are really good.

183
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,860
You don't teach English practice papers?

184
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Your English teacher has already sent me the report.

185
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,860
Tell me.

186
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
What's going on?

187
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,860
I can't find it.

188
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,860
You can't find it or you didn't write it down?

189
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,860
I really wrote it down.

190
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
Where did you go last night?

191
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,860
I...

192
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,860
Are you working at night?

193
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,860
Because you're working, you don't have time to write English papers?

194
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,860
No, I'm not.

195
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,860
I'm not, Principal.

196
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
I've never been late for school.

197
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,860
Do you remember last time you told me you wanted to get a scholarship?

198
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,860
Don't worry, Principal.

199
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,860
I'll definitely get it.

200
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,860
Can you get an A?

201
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
All A?

202
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,860
Including English, at least five A.

203
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,860
This is the most basic requirement for applying for scholarships.

204
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,860
No problem.

205
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,860
Don't worry, Principal.

206
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,860
I'll definitely study hard.

207
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,860
Go to the teacher's office and get a new uniform.

208
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,860
Principal, my clothes are pretty good.

209
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,860
I told you to get it.

210
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,860
It's loose and it affects the school image.

211
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,860
But the school uniform...

212
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,860
This is for you.

213
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
Really?

214
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,860
Go ahead. Don't delay my work.

215
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,860
Thank you, Principal.

216
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,860
You have to fill in the English paper before tomorrow.

217
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,860
And...

218
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,860
Get me the bike from the garage.

219
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,860
Bye.

220
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,860
Go.

221
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,860
Yu Mingxi.

222
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,860
I want you to disappear from my world.

223
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,860
Our game has just begun.

224
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,860
That's great. I have a new uniform.

225
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,860
Yu Mingxi.

226
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,860
Xingxing, I was just about to look for you.

227
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
It was a misunderstanding yesterday. I can explain.

228
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
What are you doing?

229
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,860
I came to tell you.

230
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,860
Don't think that Jiang Bohan really likes you.

231
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,860
He just hasn't seen an ordinary girl like you.

232
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,860
He's just a little bit new.

233
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,860
You have to know yourself.

234
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,860
When did I ever think that Jiang Bohan liked me?

235
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,860
You two are just enemies. Why are you acting crazy here?

236
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,860
You really know how to pretend to be innocent, Yu Mingxi.

237
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,860
There's no one here. You don't have to act with me.

238
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
I'm warning you.

239
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
Don't use any mean means to get close to Jiang Bohan.

240
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,860
What did I pretend to be innocent for?

241
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,860
What mean means do I have to pretend to be innocent?

242
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,860
What mean means do I have to pretend to be innocent?

243
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
Qin Siyang.

244
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,860
Don't go too far.

245
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,860
Jiang Bohan, if you want to get close to me, you can change your partner.

246
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,860
He's just a little bit new. He's not better than me.

247
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,860
If there's anything, just come at me. Don't involve anyone else.

248
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,860
Yu Mingxi has nothing to do with this.

249
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,860
What do you mean nothing to do with it?

250
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,860
If you don't mind me in the future, I'll find him to trouble.

251
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
Qin Siyang, are you done?

252
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,860
Do you think everyone is as idle as you and don't see me working?

253
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,860
Can you two solve your own problems?

254
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,860
What do you want to say?

255
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,860
I'll give you time now.

256
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,860
Take your time.
