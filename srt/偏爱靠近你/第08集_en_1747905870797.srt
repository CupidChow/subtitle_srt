3
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,000
Jie, open it.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The Long Ballad

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why isn't Boss here yet?

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I don't know.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He didn't reply to my text or answer my calls.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Should we wait for him?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
No, we'll practice on our own.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hello.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Have you seen Jiang Bohan?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Did you need to see him?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He didn't come to school?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No. What's wrong?

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
His phone is with me.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why is his phone with you?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Where is he?

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want to ask you guys.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Ask us?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He's been acting mysterious lately.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I suspect he has someone else.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's it.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What? Did you guys fight?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is it possible that he's in danger?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
In danger?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm just saying it's possible.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He's an adult.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then...

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Who will help me get my phone back?

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How about this?

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We won't touch Boss's phone.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Go to his house and find him.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Add us on WeChat.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll send you his address.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Corn C.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Sorry.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why do people not know how to love?

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Love and Death

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Episode 18

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm tired.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I told you.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you don't go to swimming class, the teacher will punish you.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'd rather not be punished.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Xiao Xi, why don't you go to swimming class?

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Are you afraid of water?

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, right, Lin Lin.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Did you see Jiang Bo Han today?

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He should be playing basketball.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I asked him if he went to basketball.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He said he didn't.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is Jiang Bo Han's address.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You're welcome.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What are you looking at?

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What's so good about basketball?

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Xiao Xi, I've found out that I have a new target in basketball.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll go.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He's so handsome.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Last night, there was a serious fight in the city.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
A student was badly injured by being beaten.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The victim's identity is unknown.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The police informed that the relevant perpetrator had been controlled.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
According to a witness,

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
a few social workers held a stick to chase after a student.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
120 went to the scene to rescue the victim.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But the victim was not rescued.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What are you doing?

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's right.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's okay.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm not going to him.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm not going.

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm going to find her.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why didn't that guy come last time?

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
How do I know?

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He didn't go to the school today.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How about this?

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Go look for her.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
See if there's anything going on with that guy.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll help you with your work.

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You go first.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,680
Bye.

109
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,520
Niannian, where are you now?

110
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,560
Can you go with me to Jiang Bohan?

111
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,200
Xiaoxi, I have something to do now.

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,040
I'll be back later.

113
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,680
Bye.

114
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:15,920
I...

115
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,400
Are you going to see Yao Yao,

116
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,840
or do you want to stay down

117
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,880
and think carefully for three seconds?

118
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,840
I've told you,

119
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,960
I'll hit you every time I see you.

120
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
I won't go.

121
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,040
I'm just here to exchange things.

122
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,280
I didn't mean it otherwise.

123
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,120
I'm here to exchange things,

124
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,320
but I can't have any Thoughts.

125
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm only here to exchange things.

126
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,220
I don't have any other ideas.

127
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,200
Exchange my things?

128
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,160
It's okay.

129
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,560
I'm here to exchange something.

130
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,360
That's right.

131
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,000
It's fine.

132
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
I'm telling you,

133
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,840
It's okay. It's okay.

134
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Why did you come to my house?

135
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Why didn't you come to school today?

136
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
What's wrong?

137
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
Nothing.

138
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
You care about me?

139
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,840
No. It's good that you're okay. I'll go first.

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Did you come here to ask me this?

141
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
I found your phone. I'll give it back to you.

142
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,840
I came to change my phone today. Nothing else.

143
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Bye.

144
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
You're really on time.

145
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Jiang Bohan! I saw Yu Mingxi at your house!

146
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Open the door! Jiang Bohan, open the door!

147
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
I have something to tell you.

148
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Jiang Bohan!

149
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
What's the matter?

150
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Why is Yu Mingxi at your house?

151
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
It's none of your business.

152
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Don't hide. Come out.

153
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
What a coincidence.

154
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
I know Yan Zhenwen went to see you again.

155
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
He came to see me because of you.

156
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,840
I didn't ask him to do it. I apologize on his behalf.

157
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
No need.

158
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
I want to talk to you.

159
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,840
I have a guest at home today. Please go back.

161
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
Jiang Bohan!

162
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
You weren't like this before!

163
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Jiang Bohan, you...

164
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Yao Yao!

165
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Yao Yao!

166
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Why are you standing there?

167
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
It's better to do something more than something less.

168
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
It's getting late.

169
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,840
When they leave, I'll take you home.

170
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Yu Mingxi, don't stand there.

171
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
My mom isn't here. Just treat it as your own home.

172
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Do as you like.

173
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Don't be so nosy.

174
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,840
By the way, why didn't you listen to Qian Xiaobo?

175
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
What if he really wants to see you?

176
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
Are you his friend?

177
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
I don't think so.

178
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,840
By the way, I have something else for you.

180
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
This...

181
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
When did I lose it?

182
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
What?

183
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
What's wrong?

184
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Nothing.

185
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Thank you.

186
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Thank you.

187
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Yu Mingxi, you really have a way.

188
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,840
Where did I lose it?

189
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Don't expose your emotions.

190
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,840
Let others know your weakness.

191
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,840
It's good to improve skills.

192
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,840
It's good to use relationships.

193
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Any means must be achieved.

194
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Hello?

195
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
Aunt Jiang?

196
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
It's me.

197
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,840
I came to see you today.

198
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
It's okay.

199
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
I'll be gone soon.

200
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
What are you drinking?

201
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Just boiled water.

202
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
No, I'll just take it for you.

203
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Okay, thank you.

204
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Thank you.

205
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
I'll go get it.

206
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Okay.

207
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Bye.

208
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Here.

209
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,840
So, you didn't come to school today

210
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
because of me?

211
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Are you sure?

212
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
You care about me?

213
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
No.

214
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,840
But why would those people bother you?

215
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
I don't know.

216
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Fine, if you don't want to know.

217
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Anyway, I almost know.

218
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
What do you know?

219
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Because...

220
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Who is it?

221
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,840
Mom is back.

222
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
President?

223
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
What should I do?

224
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
I...

225
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
Where should I hide?

226
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
What should I do?

227
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Oh no, what should I do?

228
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
What should I do?

229
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

230
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
No.

231
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,840
Yao Yao just called and said she was here.

232
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
I saw her at the door.

233
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840
You drank the milk?

234
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,840
When did you like to drink this kind of flavor?

235
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
I like it now.

236
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
What do you want for dinner?

237
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
I'll make it for you.

238
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Whatever.

239
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,840
When did you buy so much strawberry flavored milk?

240
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,840
Zhang Bohan, your clothes are so dirty.

241
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
Why are you still wearing it?

242
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
Did you fight with someone again?

243
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Take off your clothes and come to me.

244
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,840
Zhang Bohan, what should we do now?

245
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
I'm sorry.

272
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm sorry.

273
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm sorry.

274
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
I'm sorry.

275
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
I'm sorry.

276
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
I'm sorry.

278
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
What should we do now?

279
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
What are you doing, Zhang Bohan?

280
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
My mom wants me to change my clothes.

281
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,840
I can't go out.

282
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Then you change it.

283
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
I'll go downstairs to have dinner later.

284
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
I'll ask Jiewei to let you go out.

285
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
Now?

286
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,840
I'll wait for my headmaster to sleep.

287
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
It's seven o'clock.

288
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
When my mom sleeps,

289
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,840
You want to live here?

290
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
I'll listen to you.

291
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,840
What do you think we should do now?

292
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,840
You have to promise me one condition first.

293
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,840
You're a man of your word.

294
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,840
I also...

295
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,840
What is the condition I want to break up with?

296
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,840
You don't have to hide from me anymore.

297
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,840
The most beautiful thing is the way you rely on the stars.

298
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,840
I can't believe the most sincere thing is the way you run in the rain.

299
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,840
Silence is not important.

300
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,840
As long as we're both fine,

301
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,840
we'll be brave.
