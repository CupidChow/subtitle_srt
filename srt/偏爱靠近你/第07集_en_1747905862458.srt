00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Untamed

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,000
Look at you.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What do you know how to play?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,400
You just changed the tune.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,400
And you went to Jiang Bo Han's house to make trouble.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,000
Don't you think you are embarrassing yourself?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Jiang Bo Han's House

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,600
Yao Yao won't go to school today.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
You don't have to see her off.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,200
Let her reflect on herself at home.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yao Yao

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Who let you in?

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Get lost!

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Does your head still hurt?

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
None of your business.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I bought you your favorite rock candy.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Remember to drink it.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yan Zheng Wen.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I won't go.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't be with Yu Ming Xi, okay?

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't be with Yu Ming Xi, okay?

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yan Zheng Wen

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm hungry.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You don't want to eat?

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Look what I bought for you.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Eat some and drink.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was drunk last night.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Did I say anything?

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What did you say?

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I didn't say anything.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You were drunk last night.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You slept very quietly.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You slept so well.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I didn't cry.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You didn't cry, right?

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
My mom said I kept crying.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I was shouting like a crazy person.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I was shouting like a crazy person.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know about this.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Give me your phone.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What?

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
See if you took a bad picture of me.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't have a bad picture of you in my heart.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What's the use in your heart?

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Next time you want to drink, call me.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll accompany you.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yan Zheng Wen.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Can you do me a favor?

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Sure.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm the apple that fell from the tree.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to drink it.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Like the fish living in the water.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You are summer.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm the wind blowing from the beach.

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't understand why people don't know how to love.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm the wind blowing from the beach.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What? Why are you following me?

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm going down the road.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm going to the convenience store.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm going to the convenience store too.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm going to work.

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm going to buy something.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Whatever.

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay, go outside.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Theane.

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Wu Li.

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Does your car fall into the river?

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Your car is made of carbon.

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Can you move that car quickly?

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Look.

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This stretches out.

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm not.

76
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,360
Why are you so persistent?

77
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,560
I like you. It's my business.

78
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,840
Hush.

79
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,040
Yu Mingxi, why are you hiding?

80
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,280
What are you hiding from?

81
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,200
I happen to have a witness.

82
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,440
Yu Mingxi, I like you.

83
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,280
Listen.

84
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,520
Don't listen to him.

85
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,760
Are you crazy?

86
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,800
Do you like me or not?

87
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,520
I like your hair.

88
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,080
Are you okay?

89
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,240
A little bit.

90
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,040
Are you responsible for this?

91
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,720
I'm not.

92
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,560
I didn't mean to bother you.

93
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,760
There's a security here.

94
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,640
Go on.

95
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,480
Sir,

96
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
I'll take an hour off.

97
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Let's go have a meal.

98
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,600
Li.

99
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,280
Let's go.

100
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,360
Come on.

101
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
It's important to have a relationship.

102
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Sir.

103
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,680
Let's go.

104
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,920
I...

105
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,840
Zhang Bohan,

106
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,960
can you stop joking around?

107
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,680
I can't stand it.

108
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,440
Are you heartbroken?

109
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,960
No.

110
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,800
I'm really heartbroken.

111
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,800
You're young.

112
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,920
Have you experienced any big waves?

113
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,040
I don't eat.

114
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,280
Why do you always like to eat these junk food?

115
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,560
How is this junk food?

116
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,680
I ordered fresh vegetables.

117
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,040
Salt,

118
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,120
sugar,

119
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,640
and high-protein.

120
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,040
Why is it not junk food?

121
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,400
But it's really delicious.

122
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,320
Try it.

123
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,040
Try it.

124
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,240
Try it.

125
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,080
How is it?

126
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,280
Is it delicious?

127
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,440
It's delicious.

128
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,240
It's not bad.

129
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,400
How is it possible?

130
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,200
This is the best street food in the park.

131
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,840
I really didn't treat any guests.

132
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,880
But it's only 30 yuan.

133
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,040
It's affordable and delicious.

134
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,320
Then you're quite satisfied.

135
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,800
But why did you transfer?

136
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,200
Did you make any mistakes in school?

137
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,760
I didn't.

138
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,240
My dad was a wonderful swimming coach.

139
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,720
He was a good swimmer.

140
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,080
He helped me get into the school.

141
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,840
He also paid my tuition.

142
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,960
He's a good student.

143
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,320
Then why did you go to the convenience store?

144
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,760
Because I've never stopped

145
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,320
any school activities.

146
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,480
My mom can't afford me.

147
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,640
So I can only work and study.

148
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,720
But fortunately, I have a lot of time.

149
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,360
I still have time to make money.

150
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,160
Great.

151
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,240
Excuse me,

152
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,340
is there any discount at that convenience store?

153
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,880
Yes, there is.

154
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,200
Look.

155
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,800
Do you know what the call mistake is?

156
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,840
Your call..

157
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
Where are you going?

158
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Where are you going?

159
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
What are you talking about?

160
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
This is what you said

161
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Buy some

162
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
This is all not discounted

163
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
What are you doing

164
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
What are you doing

165
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
I

166
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
You bought so much

167
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Can you finish it

168
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Don't waste it

169
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
I'm sorry

170
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
I'm sorry

171
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
I'm sorry

172
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
I'm sorry

173
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm sorry

174
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
I'm sorry

175
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
I'm sorry

176
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
I'm sorry

177
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
I'm going to work

178
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
I'm leaving

179
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Your stuff

180
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
I bought it for you

181
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
You can eat more if you like

182
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
I have this

183
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
Young people nowadays

184
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
They are so good

185
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Don't talk nonsense

186
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
I don't have anything with him

187
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
I believe you don't have anything

188
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
But he has

189
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
What is this

190
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
What is this

191
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
This is love

192
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Full of love

193
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Can't you see it

194
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Manager

195
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Don't look at me

196
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
I

197
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Take it home quickly

198
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Last time I let you take advantage

199
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
This time I want to run

200
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Xia Mo

201
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
What are you doing

202
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
A few friends

203
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Chat together

204
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Nothing to do with you

205
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
Hurry up

206
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
What a coincidence

207
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
I just want to find you

208
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Little girlfriend

209
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
I

210
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Yes

211
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
It's you

212
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
What are you doing

213
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Are you going to fight again

214
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
I'm going to call the police

215
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Why are you looking for her

216
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
Why are you so nervous

217
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
I'll talk to her

218
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Lin Minxi

219
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
I

220
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
With Yan Zhengwen

221
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Have been good friends for many years

222
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Today is mainly just talking

223
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
Nothing else

224
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
You go quickly

225
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Good

226
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Still not leaving

227
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Really

228
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Go back quickly

229
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Then I'll go first

230
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
You have fun

231
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Be careful

232
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
I'll call you

233
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Call you

234
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Let me go

235
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
What's wrong with this Jiang Pan

236
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Good for a while and bad for a while

237
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
We are together

238
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
No

239
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Something is wrong here

240
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
I'll go

241
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Go
