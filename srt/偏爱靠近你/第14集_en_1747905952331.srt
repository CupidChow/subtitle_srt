00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What is the relationship between that guy and Yu Mingxin?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
When did you start caring about her?

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,000
I care about you. You care about her. I naturally care about her.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,000
I feel that their relationship is unusual.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,600
Okay.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll ask her for you then.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,600
You're going to look for her later, right?

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
I really envy her.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're going to look for her later, right?

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:20,600
Jiang Yu

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,460
So what if he gives up his dream for me?

13
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,400
You-

14
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,280
Don't be sky cocky all the time.

15
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,840
If you be tooeedy-

16
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,400
you'll end up with soiled luck.

17
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,040
Why would you look soSmelly?

18
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,720
Just for that brat?

19
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,840
Isn't that worth-

20
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,120
That's indeed not worth it.

21
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,380
Then are you thinking of Ting Huo?

22
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,080
I'm just thinking-

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,480
I didn't do anything to prove my innocence.

24
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Let me ask you. How many friends do you have?

25
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,280
I don't know. But I have three friends now.

26
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,280
You, Niannian, and Jiang Bohan.

27
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,280
Jiang Bohan counts?

28
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,680
Yes.

29
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,280
The big data statistics.

30
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,680
Five people are close.

31
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,880
Fifteen people can chat.

32
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,480
About 100 people are in contact.

33
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,880
That's less than 150 people.

34
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,480
How many people are there in total?

35
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,080
About a few thousand.

36
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,280
How can you have so many people know you and recognize you?

37
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,680
Then they can't just turn the black and white and be free.

38
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,080
The gossip is just a means of socializing.

39
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,280
The more you are, the more you will be.

40
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,680
When you can stop caring about other people's opinions,

41
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,880
you will be free.

42
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,480
You don't care?

43
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,680
I never care.

44
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Then, you lost the whole game?

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,280
That doesn't count.

46
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,080
Anyway, people's lives are already so short.

47
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,880
I don't want to waste my time on unimportant things.

48
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
You are right.

49
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,080
So, you have to choose carefully

50
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,280
the person who can be your life partner.

51
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,680
Understand?

52
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,280
Yes.

53
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Yu Mingxin, understand?

54
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,480
What are you saying?

55
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,880
Get up.

56
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,080
Yu Mingxin, understand?

57
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,880
I understand.

58
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,680
Big brother.

59
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,080
I understand.

60
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,880
Fighting.

61
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,080
Fighting.

62
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Fighting.

63
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,080
We're here.

64
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,080
Let's go back.

65
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,680
How do we go back?

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,380
Bring each another key there.

67
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,880
I broke it.

68
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,880
I explained, I only went to the washroom to break it.

69
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,880
What do you want?

70
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,680
I just a little car wouldn't be enough.

71
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,080
Why don't you sit down?

72
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,280
Why sit down again?

73
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
I don't like you anymore.

74
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
I want to tell you now.

75
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
I think you don't deserve me.

76
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
From now on,

77
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
we are just friends.

78
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Okay, just friends.

79
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
I said these words today,

80
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
I won't betray you anymore.

81
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
I can't let myself be ashamed.

82
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
But you must go to the dance party with me.

83
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Just take it

84
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
as the last time.

85
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
I don't know

86
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
what you are thinking.

87
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,280
I really don't know what I am thinking.

88
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
New member.

89
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Manager, don't joke.

90
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
This is my brother.

91
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
You just said

92
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
you are two months older than me.

93
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
Even two months older,

94
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
he is also my brother?

95
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,440
I'll get it. I'll go get it.

96
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,600
Let's go, brother.

97
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,800
See you at the store.

98
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,800
You're in such a hurry. Are you hungry?

99
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,400
So, the food in the house

100
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,320
is from the farm?

101
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,920
Yes. I think it's pretty good.

102
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,720
This way, we can save money and not waste food.

103
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,280
I owe you a lot.

104
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,280
Why are you suddenly mentioning this?

105
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,680
How much is left? I'll help you pay it back.

106
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,480
What are you talking about? How can I let you pay it back?

107
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,880
The effect is because of my dad.

108
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,680
Your dad won't be dragged into the investment,

109
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,280
and he won't be cheated.

110
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,680
If you say so, it's my fault.

111
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,080
If my dad hadn't made me go to the gold mine,

112
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,680
you wouldn't be in such a hurry to make money.

113
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,880
And you wouldn't have taken the risk to borrow money to invest.

114
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,080
No matter what,

115
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,280
it's my dad who dragged your family into this.

116
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
I'll be responsible for it.

117
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,480
You are you. Your dad is your dad.

118
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,880
You still have your own life.

119
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,880
Then, do you have a life?

120
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,680
My mom and I have a very strict money-backing plan.

121
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,280
If we don't get the money, we'll be in trouble.

122
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,880
If there's no accident, we can pay off the debt this year.

123
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,080
I think this is pretty good.

124
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,280
You've been suspended. What's good about it?

125
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,080
Yao Qing Chu, you're so annoying.

126
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,480
Why are you so stubborn? I'm so forgetful.

127
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,880
I'll pay. I'll pay.

128
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Go back later. I'll go first. Don't fight with me.

129
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,080
Remember to turn off the lights and lock the door. Bye-bye.

130
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,880
Whoever comes home first will get a new car.

131
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,880
Why are you so slow? Yao Qing Chu, don't run!

132
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,480
Hurry, open the door.

133
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Yao Qing Chu, open the door.

134
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
If you're not ready,

135
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,480
you won't be able to get it in a month.

136
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,480
What did you eat, Mom?

137
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,280
I ate this red bean bread.

138
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,080
No, this is for Nian Nian tomorrow.

139
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm going to sleep. You should sleep too.

140
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,480
Okay.

141
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,080
Piggy, let's go now.

142
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,340
He and Qin month

143
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,280
are so serious.

144
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,680
He said that he loves you, yet you really believe it.

145
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,880
Deblbting yourself to think of this.

146
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,840
Oh no, why is he here?

148
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,280
I'm asleep.

149
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,680
Let's talk tomorrow.

150
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,400
You must tell me now.

151
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,080
I'm not going.

152
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,720
Yu Mingxi.

153
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Yu Mingxi.

154
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Yu Mingxi.

155
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm counting to ten.

156
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,240
Ten.

157
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,800
If you don't come out, I'll call.

158
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,400
Ten.

159
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,200
Five.

160
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,520
Eight.

161
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,120
Seven.

162
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,480
Six.

163
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,600
Five.

164
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,400
He's really crazy.

165
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,800
Four.

166
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,400
Three.

167
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,840
Two.

168
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,360
One.

169
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,720
Don't yell. I'm coming out.

170
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,960
Are you crazy?

171
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,440
You're going to wake the whole building up.

172
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,280
What do you want?

173
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,280
What's up?

174
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,320
Talk here?

175
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,960
Yes.

176
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,160
Why don't you answer the phone?

177
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,560
Are you angry?

178
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,080
I'm not your childhood friend.

179
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,120
Why should I be angry?

180
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,040
I don't need to be angry.

181
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,600
I really didn't do anything just now.

182
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,800
Yes, nothing.

183
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,480
Just a flower and a hug.

184
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,080
You're angry again?

185
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,880
No.

186
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,200
Let's talk about you.

187
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,400
What's wrong with me?

188
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,720
What kind of person is Liu Jingshu?

189
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,760
What kind of brother is he?

190
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,880
Why can he stay in your house?

191
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,680
His father and my father are good friends.

192
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,000
He came out on the road.

193
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,160
Of course I have to help him.

194
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,480
Then I'll rent him a house

195
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,800
and let him live outside.

196
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,680
How can I let you pay?

197
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,280
And he may not be willing to.

198
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,200
He can't live in your house all the time.

199
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,320
He just lives in my house temporarily.

200
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,000
That's not good.

201
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,800
Hello.

202
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,320
Principal.

203
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,840
Hello, Principal. What's wrong?

204
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,080
Really?

205
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Thank you, Principal.

206
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm back to school.

207
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,400
I can take the exam.

208
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,680
I can get a scholarship.

209
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
I can buy running shoes.

210
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,840
When I think of you,

211
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,280
I look at the clock on the wall.

212
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
You can get into the hug sketches

213
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,600
with this Jon advantage.

214
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,840
Are you going to clue everyone at the clinic?

215
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,000
Congratulations!

216
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,320
You made it.

217
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,680
Only Now

218
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,520
Mingzhe

219
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,080
How's your tripe?

220
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,440
It is fine now.

221
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,840
You didn't even breathe yesterday!

222
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Did the dog get Maisie?

223
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,560
Li I've found!

224
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,640
You found me!

225
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,920
How is that possible?

226
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,720
brave

227
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,960
I had a hurt this morning

228
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,800
You haven't gone to treatment board these days?

229
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,640
I'm positively komma ed

230
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,720
So I don't have time

231
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,400
What if things get worse?

232
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm not afraid of you.

233
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,440
Let's see.

234
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,440
Hey.

235
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,800
Don't fool me. I'm serious.

236
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,360
I'll change the account tomorrow.

237
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,640
Tomorrow is training.

238
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,120
Then the day after tomorrow?

239
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
The day after tomorrow is Sunday.

240
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,480
Sunday doesn't affect the change of account.

241
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,480
Let's talk about it later.

242
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,960
If you don't go,

243
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,520
I'll tell Jiang Meng Han.

244
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,880
Jiang Meng Han,

245
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,040
we should stop here and drink.

246
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,660
Nobody is too smart

247
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,180
to master this land.

248
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,520
Will you listen

249
00:18:51,200 --> 00:19:12,040
and satiate me if I
