00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Lengách

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,860
Ji mark

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,740
What am I doing

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,160
nothing

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,560
Just just messed up

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,080
Jiang Bohan sent me home

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,760
Thank you

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:29,820
thank you

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,120
No, it's fine.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,380
Is it okay?

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,480
I just finished the massage. It's okay.

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,080
I'll give you some medicine later.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,400
No need.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,780
By the way, why did you come back?

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,200
And...

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,840
Did you buy this shoe?

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,960
Where did you get so much money?

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,500
Don't blame me.

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,660
Your shoes are very expensive at first sight.

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,440
How could I have bought the shoes?

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,780
Who bought that?

22
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,900
Jiang Meng Han, you bought it, right?

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,780
I bought it.

24
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,280
Look.

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,080
These shoes must be very expensive.

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,740
I'll return them to you later.

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,740
No need.

28
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,540
That's it. I'll take my leave.

29
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,900
I'll go home now.

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,460
Bye-bye.

31
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,100
Bye-bye.

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,980
Tao.

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Where did you get the money?

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,460
It's none of your business.

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,360
Which tunnel?

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,280
cave.

37
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,680
Oh!

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,000
Who should have read this to her?

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,900
You write this約 you will be stopped.

40
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,160
And we will search for you.

41
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,700
Secret wtedy restoration.

42
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,400
You must know what's at least 1.

43
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,920
Wait.

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,120
UNITED SPINT

45
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,320
Exit.

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
No

47
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,580
No

48
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,660
Over there.

49
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,420
Make way

50
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,120
No

51
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,200
No

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,680
You are the private housekeeper.

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
I'm warning you.

54
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,200
I'm warning you.

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,320
Yes, come on.

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,080
You're warning me.

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,840
Even if you call the police,

58
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,480
they will only ask when you pay back.

59
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,080
Understand?

60
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,440
It's so funny.

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,920
Can't you just tell me again?

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,680
You've already paid the money for this month's case.

63
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,560
It's just a interest.

64
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,920
I've told you for a few days.

65
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,280
They treat us as a welfare hospital.

66
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,520
The clear-cut picture of the white-cut picture on the contract

67
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,880
is written by your father.

68
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,440
Okay.

69
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,480
But I really don't have money.

70
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,040
Look.

71
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,040
This shoe is good.

72
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,200
This is not good.

73
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,240
Why not?

74
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,200
We're playing.

75
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,880
We have money to buy shoes, but we don't have money to pay.

76
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,120
No.

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,680
This is very important to you.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,560
We'll pay you back in seven days.

79
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,720
Okay, let's talk.

80
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Don't talk to him.

81
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,200
We'll pay you back in seven days.

82
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,240
I'll pay you back.

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,680
I'll pay you back in seven days.

84
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,840
I can't take the shoes off.

85
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
Seven days.

86
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,040
Pay back.

87
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,040
Let's go.

88
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,800
Let's go.

89
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,240
We're going.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,440
Head back to work now.

91
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,240
Zhi인지.

92
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,960
What's the matter?

93
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,720
Get up.

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
I'm not afraid of you.

95
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,520
You hurt your ankle.

96
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,720
Your head is broken.

97
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
I'll go home with you.

98
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,720
I can't stand up.

99
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,120
You can't even take a step.

100
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Come on.

101
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
How is it?

102
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Not bad.

103
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
It's still bitter.

104
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
It must be very painful.

105
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
It's a little bitter.

106
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
It's a little bitter.

107
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
There's no water.

108
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Come on.

109
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Go.

110
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Come on.

111
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
What are you doing?

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
What are you doing?

113
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
You're still fighting?

114
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
I spent money to find him.

115
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
I don't know how to fight.

116
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Stop.

117
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
He signed the contract with us.

118
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Don't mind the situation.

119
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Do you think money is so good?

120
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Who is it?

121
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
It's okay.

122
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Don't worry.

123
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Come again.

124
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Come again.

125
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Are you crazy?

126
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
He told you.

127
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
It has nothing to do with you.

128
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Why does it have nothing to do with me?

129
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
If Yu Mingxi knows that your money is coming like this,

130
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
do you think he will be sad?

131
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
I won't let him know.

132
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I have to cancel the contract.

133
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Do I let him know?

134
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
How are you?

135
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Are you done?

136
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
It's still cold.

137
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Still have a cold.

138
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
I'll fight for him.

139
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
I'll fight for him.

140
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
I'll fight for him.

141
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I'll fight for him.

142
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
I'll fight for him.

143
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
I'll fight for him.

144
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Why did you follow me?

145
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
You like me?

146
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
I said it was for the sake of money.

147
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
How much can you earn?

148
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Not much.

149
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Just a small amount of money.

150
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
If you're lucky, you can win the gold.

151
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Not much.

152
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Probably a little bit more than the old money.

153
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Then are you lucky?

154
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
You didn't see me just now.

155
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
You're a crybaby.

156
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,720
People are hard to get.

157
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Who?

158
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
My dad.

159
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,720
He's our relationship.

160
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
No.

161
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
I'm a good friend.

162
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
I've been looking for money since the beginning.

163
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
I've earned a lot of money.

164
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
So I borrowed money from Yu Bin and Xida's dad.

165
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,720
In the end, they both cheated the young people.

166
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
My dad is a coward.

167
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
He doesn't care about the reality.

168
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
I sold the house.

169
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,720
I don't know where to hide my money.

170
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
After the accident,

171
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,720
I only had Yu Bin and Xida's mom.

172
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,720
They both cheated and didn't come to the party.

173
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
Where's my mom?

174
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
My mom.

175
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
My mom has already married you.

176
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
I was betrayed by my dad.

177
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Later, my mom got married.

178
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
I was so happy.

179
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
Later, my mom got married.

180
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
I was her black history.

181
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
I let her stay in the family.

182
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
I was a little bit tired.

183
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Later, I didn't bother her anymore.

184
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,720
So you went to Yu Bin and Xida's family.

185
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,720
You went to make up for her?

186
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Make up for her?

187
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
It's hard.

188
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Except for them,

189
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,720
I have no other relatives in this world.

190
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
I don't know how to make up for her.

191
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
You made up for her

192
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
to help her pay for the whole game.

193
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
You did it to help her pay for the game.

194
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
I did it before.

195
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
I'm not going to sleep now.

196
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
I didn't expect that you would be so good at making up for her.

197
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
You are my salary for two months.

198
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,720
You can't let her know about this.

199
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
Don't go to college anymore.

200
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,720
I'll pay for the money.

201
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
What are you talking about?

202
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
What does it have to do with you?

203
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
You have no other relatives in your family.

204
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,720
It has nothing to do with me.

205
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
I care about Yu Bin and Xida.

206
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
I care about you.

207
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
I care about you two.

208
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Both is all right.

209
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
Give me the drinks.

210
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Don't send me home already.

211
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,720
I'll go in to visit Yu Bin.

212
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Don't be so stubborn.

213
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Don't be so arrogant.

214
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Li Mingxi always treats you as his real brother.

215
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Then you have to call me doctor and cure me.

216
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Let's talk about it when you have a reputation.

217
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Why are you here?

218
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
I...

219
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
You two fought?

220
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Well...

221
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
I just fought with one.

222
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,720
But it's all settled.

223
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
What's wrong?

224
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Where's the pain?

225
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Where's the pain?

226
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
Where's the pain?

227
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Why are you fighting with him?

228
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Let's go home.

229
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Okay.

230
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Okay.

231
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
What's wrong with your clothes?

232
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
What's wrong with your clothes?

233
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
I just drank a coke.

234
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
I can't remember what I was doing.

235
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
You took it off?

236
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
What?

237
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
It's dirty.

238
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
It's okay.

239
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
I can wash it myself.

240
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
I can wash it myself.

241
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
I can wash it myself.

242
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
It's okay.

243
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
I can wash it myself.

244
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Hurry up.

245
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Okay.

246
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
You have to help him wash it yourself.

247
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Anyway, I have to wash it.

248
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
It's water.

249
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Youzi,

251
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
do you want to know?

252
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
What's wrong with your legs?

253
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Nothing.

254
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
I was so careless the other day.

255
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
How did you do that?

256
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
We had fun the other day.

257
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
I was so careless.

258
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Jing Chu,

259
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
why did you hurt yourself again?

260
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
It's nothing.

261
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
It's okay.

262
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Why do you hurt yourself every time?

263
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
I'm just skin care.

264
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
I can't touch it.

265
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
It's not that painful.

266
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
I'm going to wash my clothes.

267
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Sit down.

268
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Get the medicine first.

269
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Give me the clothes.

270
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
I'm telling you,

271
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
it's not for your sympathy.

272
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
It's for you.

273
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
You can't leave.

274
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
What do you mean?

275
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
You're two worlds.

276
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
You can realize your true self.

277
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
You can't leave.

278
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
You can't leave.

279
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
You can't leave.

280
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
You can't leave.

281
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
You can't leave.

282
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
I'm not good at it.

283
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
I can't leave.

284
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
We can't leave.

285
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
I don't want to go to the hospital.

286
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
I don't want to go to the hospital.

289
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,820
I'll be fine.

295
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,120
I'll be fine.

296
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,660
I'm fine.

297
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,760
I'm fine.

298
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,020
I'm fine.

299
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,420
I'm fine.

300
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,820
I'm fine.

301
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,220
I'm fine.

302
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,620
I'm fine.

303
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,020
I'm fine.

304
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,420
I'm fine.

305
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,020
That's a credit problem.

306
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,420
Yiming,

307
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,020
don't be angry.

308
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,820
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,020
I'm sorry.

310
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,620
Does it hurt?

311
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,820
No.

312
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,120
What's I normal?

313
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,020
I'm not special.

314
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,220
Fine.

315
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,020
Don't you get angry

316
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,820
if your husband's angry?

317
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,500
ck it.

318
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,020
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,820
I made a mistake.

320
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
Don't hurt it çaa這麼 bien.

321
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,620
I'm sorry.

322
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,320
Xue helpless.

323
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,020
Really hurts.

324
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,020
You're really nutty.

325
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,820
ends you're specify.

326
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,020

327
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,020
This is really hurts.

328
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,620
Make you fight.

329
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,020
Really nothing?

330
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,940
I won't fight anymore.

331
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,980
I won't fight anymore.

332
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,260
I'm leaving.
