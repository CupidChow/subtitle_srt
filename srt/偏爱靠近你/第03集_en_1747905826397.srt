00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,880
So you didn't get hurt, right?

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,920
I'm fine.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,240
How about you?

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,120
I'm fine.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,800
But why did you go so far?

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,040
In your store,

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,920
other shows say

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,440
if your boss sees you,

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,760
how will you work?

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,600
You're thoughtful.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,760
Then why did you chase after me?

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,680
I was afraid you'd get hurt

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,760
if you fought.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,680
You were worried about me?

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,960
No.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,960
But you always show up here.

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,840
Me?

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,760
I...

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,920
I just passed by.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,440
You're the only one here at night?

22
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,200
The manager is here,

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,480
but he asked for a leave today.

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,240
And there's a good surveillance camera.

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,280
Oh.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,040
Aren't you scared?

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,240
No.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,200
What happened to your hand?

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,920
Are you okay?

30
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,880
I'm fine.

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,200
Let me get you some medicine.

32
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,440
No need.

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,240
Okay.

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,240
Remember to go home and apply the medicine.

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,040
After all, I hurt you.

36
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,400
I didn't mean anything else.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,480
Okay.

38
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,120
If there's nothing else,

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
I'll leave.

40
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,720
Wait.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,600
Well...

42
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,160
My order was transferred to the playground.

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
And I heard that

44
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,760
your basketball team picked it up.

45
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,360
Can you help me ask?

46
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,640
The order...

47
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,560
It's with me.

48
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,760
Really?

49
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,680
Can you return it to me?

50
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,480
Okay. I'll give it to you tomorrow.

51
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,440
Okay. Thank you.

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
Do you want the order?

53
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,200
Oh, no.

54
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,520
Did he see the love letter?

55
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,680
You have a guest.

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,720
You can go back to your work.

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,280
Okay.

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,080
Hello?

59
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,080
Watch the movie alone.

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,000
Be careful.

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,720
Jiang Bo Han?

62
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
This is my phone.

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,280
Hello, doctor.

64
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,600
If you're in danger,

65
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,880
call me.

66
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,720
Why do you have my phone?

67
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,880
I'm not in danger.

68
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,760
I'm not in danger.

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,640
I'm not in danger.

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,480
I'm not in danger.

71
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,400
I'm not in danger.

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,280
I'm not in danger.

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,480
Why do you have my phone?

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,640
Tomorrow at seven o'clock in the morning,

75
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,400
I'll wait for you at the entrance of the school.

76
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,640
Don't be late.

77
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Love is a lie

78
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,160
Why do you love someone

79
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,720
who doesn't know how to escape

80
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,080
Girlfriend?

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
How is that possible?

82
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,520
It's true.

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,960
She said it herself.

84
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,400
She said

85
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,000
she was my girlfriend.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,960
She remembered it.

87
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,880
If I dare to bother her again,

88
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,840
I'll be so easy.

89
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,400
All these words are for her.

90
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,160
She can't compare to me.

91
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,400
Since I met Jiang Bo Han,

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,400
no girl can get close to him.

93
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,680
Where did this Yu Mingxi come from?

94
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,560
We'll find out where he came from.

95
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,800
But

96
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,520
how did they get together?

97
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,520
What?

98
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,000
When I went to pick her up last time,

99
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,680
I met that girl.

100
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,400
Don't bother Jiang Bo Han again.

101
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,800
What?

102
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,040
You feel sorry for him?

103
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,120
I like him. It's not a secret.

104
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,760
I get hurt every day.

105
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,320
I've never seen you care about me.

106
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,520
You always

107
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,000
stick your ass on my face.

108
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,520
Yan Zhenmen,

109
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,240
don't be so mean.

110
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,920
You're my brother.

111
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,760
I'll never be your brother.

112
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,760
Our parents won't have that kind of relationship.

113
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,840
You're not the one.

114
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,160
Yan Zhenmen,

115
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,360
help me find out

116
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,840
what Yu Mingxi came from.

117
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,640
Find out your true feelings?

118
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,400
When did I ever admit defeat?

119
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,080
Okay.

120
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,280
You won't turn back, right?

121
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,760
You look down on me.

122
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,360
Everything I want

123
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,400
must be mine.

124
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,680
Let me make a decision.

125
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,560
Which one should I stick out first?

126
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,280
You or Stanley.

127
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Which one?

128
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,640
I'm sorry. I'm late.

129
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,000
Two minutes.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Are you tired?

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm okay.

132
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,600
This is for you.

133
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,800
Thank you.

134
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,000
There's one more thing.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What is it?

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,400
I don't know.

137
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
What is it?

143
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
It's a piece of paper.

144
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
And it says...

145
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Love letter?

146
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Where can I get back the love letter?

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
You picked it up.

148
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
It's not for you.

149
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Of course you have to return it to me.

150
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,920
But it says my name on it.

151
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
It's not for me.

152
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,920
Is it for Lin Shao Yang?

153
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
You read it?

154
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
It's the first time I see a love letter.

155
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
How can it have a template?

156
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
You can give it to someone else

157
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
if you change the name.

158
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
How many are there?

159
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Do you get it when someone else doesn't want it?

160
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
It's not like that.

161
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
You're brave to write it

162
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
but not brave to admit it.

163
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
What do I admit?

164
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm the one who wrote the love letter.

165
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
But I'm not the one who likes you.

166
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
But it doesn't say your name on it.

167
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
How can you prove it's yours?

168
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,400
So many people in the grassland saw it.

169
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
It fell off with the ship's deck.

170
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
That doesn't prove it's you.

171
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Then you test me.

172
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
The third sentence.

173
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,400
I'm not good at faking.

174
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
I can't hide my love for someone.

175
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
The seventh sentence.

176
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,400
I have to find a way to know you

177
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,400
and hide the love in your eyes.

178
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
I want to see your hidden face

179
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
and your real smile.

180
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
It's a copy of Borges'

181
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
but it's not more than that.

182
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
You know it?

183
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
The last sentence.

184
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
This...

185
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Well...

186
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Forget it.

187
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,400
I don't know.

188
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
You don't know.

189
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
You didn't write the love letter, right?

190
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
I have a bad breath.

191
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Do you want to have a taste?

192
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,400
When I think of you

193
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,400
I look at the clock on the wall

194
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
with a dazed look.

195
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
You left

196
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
and reminded me of the first time

197
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,400
we met.

198
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Suddenly

199
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,400
this is my favorite song.

200
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Maybe I

201
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
fell into the idol drama.

202
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Yeah.

203
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
The last sentence.

204
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Huaixin.

205
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I don't like fakes.

206
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
You are a bird.

207
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,400
I am the apple that fell from the tree.

208
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
I want to eat it.

209
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,400
It's like a fish in the water.

210
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
You are summer.

211
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I am the sea.

212
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,400
I am the wind.

213
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Why is love so cruel?

214
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Look at his identity.

215
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
He likes Jiang Bohan.

216
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Video sent me.

217
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
He wants to confess.

218
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I will help him.

219
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
I am sorry.

220
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
I am late.

221
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Where have you been?

222
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,400
I was on the road.

223
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
You are not a sports student.

224
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Why are you so obsessed with running?

225
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,400
I am going to run marathon.

226
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
I don't know what happened today.

227
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
I feel a little strange.

228
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Did you not adjust your breathing?

229
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
I am fine.

230
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
I am fine.

231
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
I am fine.

232
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
I am fine.

233
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Did you not adjust your breathing?

234
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Maybe I didn't have breakfast.

235
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Are you sure you didn't get a disease from football?

236
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Let's go to the basketball team.

237
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Do you dare to find them?

238
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
No.

239
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
What are you looking at?

240
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
I will go to see.

241
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Who is this?

242
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
It's all the same.

243
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
What is this?

244
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
You are the star.

245
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
You like Jiang Bohan.

246
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Who said it was really you?

247
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Is your mouth really strawberry?

248
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I don't believe it.

249
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
I don't believe it either.

250
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I have a PDF.

251
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Do you want to see it?

252
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Don't tear it.

253
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
It's useless.

254
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
The whole classroom is full.

255
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Is this him?

256
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Is this him?

257
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Yes.

258
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
It's Sha Xi.

259
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
I don't believe it.

260
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Let's go.

261
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Let's go.

262
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Yu Mingxi.

263
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
What's going on?

264
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
It's not me.

265
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
It's really not me.

266
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
You have to believe me.

267
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Xiaoxi.

268
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
It's all because of me.

270
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,400
But you have been in class like this.

271
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Let's talk about it when I come.

272
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
I'm a street mouse now.

273
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Now we are the class president.

274
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
I don't have to see you every day.

275
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Who kicked it?

276
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Did you offend anyone?

277
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I want to know.

278
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I'm not Jiang Bohan.

279
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Did I ask him to get the love letter back?

280
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Did he make a promise to you?

281
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,400
He's suspicious.

282
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
No wonder he asked me out.

283
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
I want to know.

284
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
He looks like a man.

285
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,400
I think he doesn't look like that kind of person.

286
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
What's going on?

287
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Yu Mingxi, come out.

288
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
I have something to ask you.

289
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
What's wrong?

290
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Did you go to school?

291
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
I did.

292
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Sit down.

293
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Others will misunderstand.

294
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Xia Bohan, what are you doing?

295
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Find a place where no one is talking.

296
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Then let me go by myself.

297
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
No.

298
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Ten minutes later,

299
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:31,400
please gather in the

300
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Jiang Bohan class.

301
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
What are you doing here?

302
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
The committee is going to the basketball team.

303
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Hurry up and go to the basketball team.

304
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
The director is looking for you. I'll go first.

305
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Come here.

306
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
What are you going to say?

307
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
It's the basketball award ceremony.

308
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
You're the captain.

309
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
The director is looking for you.

310
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
I'm tired of those words.

311
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
It doesn't matter if you go or not.

312
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
If you don't go, I'll go.

313
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
You have nothing to explain to me.

314
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
You have nothing to explain to me.

315
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
What do I explain to you?

316
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Everyone thinks we have something.

317
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Everyone thinks we have something.

318
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Isn't it because you posted love letters everywhere?

319
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
I posted it. I think you posted it.

320
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Me?

321
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
You set the date and time of the meeting.

322
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
You're the most suspicious.

323
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
It's ridiculous.

324
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I don't care.

325
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Anyway, now the whole school knows I like you.

326
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
They think I like you.

327
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Do they think it's important?

328
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
It's important. You're the top student.

329
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
I just transferred here.

330
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
I haven't followed the study.

331
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Now everyone is ignoring me because of this.

332
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
I won't go.

333
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Top student.

334
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Let's go.

335
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
It's time for the meeting.

336
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Let's go.

337
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Let's go.

338
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Don't worry.

339
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
I won't let you be isolated.
