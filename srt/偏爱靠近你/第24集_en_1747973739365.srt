Episode 1

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,800
I finally found you.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,200
Why are you here?

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,000
I gave you breakfast.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,000
I was worried about you.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,200
You're a grown man.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
What's there to worry about?

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,000
Can I not worry?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,800
I heard from your aunt that

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,200
every time you have a problem,

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
you'll come here by yourself.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Tell me.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,200
What's the matter this time?

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Nothing.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,200
I just want to say something to my dad.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,200
You want to say something to my dad?

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Okay.

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,800
I'll be with you.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,600
It's good that I have something to say to uncle.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,600
What did you say?

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,600
You said that our Yumi has grown up.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,200
She can earn money by herself.

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
She can take care of herself.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
She can stop worrying about her.

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,200
But I ran too fast.

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
But because of those two minutes...

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Dad, what's wrong?

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Dad!

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Dad!

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Dad!

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Someone's coming!

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Someone's coming!

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Dad, wait for me!

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Hurry up! We're almost there.

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
It's over there.

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Dad, hang in there!

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Stay away from me!

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Stay away from me!

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,200
I beg you! Please find me again!

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,200
I beg you! Please find me again!

41
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
I beg you, uncle!

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Dad! Dad!

43
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Dad!

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
It's too late to save her.

45
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
If we find her again in two minutes,

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
I'll save her.

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
I beg you!

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
I think about it every time.

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
If I were two minutes faster,

50
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
would my dad be sorry?

51
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
It's not your fault.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Every time I come to this place,

53
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
I think about that day.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,200
It's like I'm the one who killed my dad.

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
I know I can't think like that.

56
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,200
But I don't know how to control myself.

57
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
It's okay.

58
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
We're about to play a game.

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
After you finish the game,

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
you can give me a chance.

61
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
So my dad knows that

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I've grown up.

63
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Is it dad?

64
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Dad!

65
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
How are we going to end this together?

66
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Aunt!

67
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
You're so lucky!

68
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
I miss you too.

69
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Sit down.

70
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
It's been four years, right?

71
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Why did you come back this time?

72
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

73
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Auntie, you're the one I miss the most in the country.

74
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
I've been back for a while, and I've been busy.

75
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
So I came out of the room today.

76
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
I just regret not having a daughter.

77
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
If I were so considerate like you,

78
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
I would be so happy.

79
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Jiang Bo Han is also very filial.

80
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
He is just a mouth.

81
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
I still miss you a lot.

82
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
He is always against me.

83
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Otherwise, how could Auntie come to you to help?

84
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
By the way, have you seen that girl?

85
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I have.

86
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
I think she has heard my words.

87
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Yun Ming Xi is a good child.

88
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
She works hard and is also optimistic.

89
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Actually, I also like her a lot.

90
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
But we as parents,

91
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
sometimes we tend to think about ourselves.

92
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,200
We must consider our own children first.

93
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Everyone will understand the parents' hard work.

94
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Besides, if we can really go abroad,

95
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
it's also a good thing for Yun Ming Xi.

96
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
So don't think too much.

97
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Let's hope as we wish.

98
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Yes.

99
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
This food is delicious. Try it.

100
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Okay.

101
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
I will send you the address.

102
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
President.

103
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Senior.

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
I have thought it through.

105
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,200
I am willing to go abroad with you.

106
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Really?

107
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Really?

108
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,200
I am so happy that you can think like that.

109
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
But I have a request.

110
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
I hope you can agree to it.

111
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
If you are willing,

112
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,200
I can help you apply for a trip with you and Bohai.

113
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Yes.

114
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Money is not a problem.

115
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
You can ask for it.

116
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
It's not like that.

117
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
You misunderstood.

118
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
I won't go abroad with Jiang Bohai.

119
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I will go abroad with you.

120
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,200
I just hope you can lie to me.

121
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Just keep this secret.

122
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
What are you talking about?

123
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
You are unhappy.

124
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Are you bored with them playing football?

125
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
I am thinking about Ma La Song.

126
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
I will treat you to dinner later.

127
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
You are not training anymore?

128
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
I am not doing anything.

129
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
I want to eat.

130
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
I will treat you to dinner later.

131
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
I will treat you to dinner later.

132
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
You are not training anymore?

133
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
I will treat you to dinner later.

134
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
I will take you to a place.

135
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Let's go.

136
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Boss.

137
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Where are you going?

138
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
To the date.

139
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Do you still have a headache?

140
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
I am feeling better.

141
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
I will be fine after a few days.

142
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,700
Uncle Back too.

143
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
It would be better if it was a little bit bigger than their lider.

144
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Sorry!

145
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
It's already a dead end.

146
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Jian, what did you hear?

147
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Nothing!

148
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Did not you hear anything?

149
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
I know what!

150
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,480
There you go.

151
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,040
That was

152
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,320
the place you said you promised?

153
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,480
Yes,

154
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
I promised you

155
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,120
to untute the air.

156
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,400
I thought it was for the sake of the second world.

157
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,600
You...you can't do that again.

158
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,600
What?

159
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,800
What do you think?

160
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
I'm not going to kiss you.

161
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,400
Shut up.

162
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,200
You kissed me, didn't you?

163
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Nonsense!

164
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,100
If you smoke,

165
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,200
who'll be the most blessed?

166
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,640
It didn't happen.

167
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,740
Jingfeng Shansho

168
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,120
jokes excuse you

169
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
What's the highest place you've been?

170
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
The highest...

171
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
...seal-sealing technology.

172
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,200
The average altitude of the patrol is 8000 to 10,000 meters.

173
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I'm talking about the land.

174
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
That should be...

175
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Xia Wei Yi's Monacoia volcano.

176
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
If it's not a sea-bond,

177
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
it should be the world's highest mountain.

178
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I don't know if I can say that.

179
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I don't know.

180
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
The highest place I've been to...

181
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
...should be here.

182
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
It's okay.

183
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
There will be opportunities in the future.

184
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,200
I don't want to wait for the future.

185
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
I want to go to the outside world to see.

186
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Zhang Bahan.

187
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Let's go abroad together.

188
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Why did I suddenly say that?

189
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
My father borrowed money from the outside world.

190
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
He paid the debt and investment.

191
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,200
He wanted me to go to the outside world to see.

192
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,200
So I want to go abroad.

193
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I have done his wish.

194
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Why didn't you tell me that?

195
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,200
You know the situation in my house.

196
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
What about now?

197
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,200
A few days ago, Dong Zi Hui came to me.

198
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
He said he wanted me to go abroad with you.

199
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,200
He wanted to deposit me with the tuition fee.

200
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
It's okay.

201
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I'll solve the money.

202
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
I still want to rely on myself.

203
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,200
I can apply for a scholarship to school.

204
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
I don't want to owe anyone else.

205
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Didn't you say you wanted to go to UCLA?

206
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Yes.

207
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
After I passed away,

208
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
I was complaining to my mom.

209
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,200
I think she created all of this.

210
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I think she was also angry because she wanted to.

211
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Later, there was a Youth Blue Team,

212
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
and a Youth League.

213
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
I gave up my teammates

214
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
just to fulfill my dream

215
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
and let my team down.

216
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,200
So, after the game,

217
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
did you think about it?

218
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
What about you?

219
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
I'll do what I have to do

220
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
because I want to.

221
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,200
I'll do what I have to do.

222
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
You're right.

223
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Okay.

224
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Good.

225
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
In a few days,

226
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
you'll go to the Youth League.

227
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
I'll attend the Malasong.

228
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
We'll have a good future.

229
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Let's cheer up together.

230
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
I'll stay.

231
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Never used to it.

232
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,200
That I took was to walk to you.

233
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Let's call it a day.

234
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
It's too late.

235
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
You should go back.

236
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Didn't you send them to the upstairs every day?

237
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Today is different.

238
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Why?

239
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
I went to the newspaper today.

240
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
It's raining at night.

241
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
You're going to the game soon.

242
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Don't catch a cold.

243
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
I'll be worried.

244
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Okay.

245
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Go back by yourself.

246
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
I'll go back.

247
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Bye.

248
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Bye.

249
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
I'll send you a message at home.

250
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Okay.

251
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Bye.

252
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Bye.

253
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Bye.

254
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Bye.

255
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Bye.

256
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Bye.

257
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Bye.

258
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Bye.

259
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
I've paid off your money.

260
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
What else do you want?

261
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Your dad is talking about

262
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
everything written on the contract.

263
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Reformation of the divorce payment.

264
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
You're making trouble.

265
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
I won't pay you back if you don't.

266
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
If you don't pay me back in three days,

267
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
just wait for me.

268
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Don't talk nonsense with him.

269
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Let's go.

270
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I didn't expect the best thing was the good old days.

271
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I didn't expect the most sincere thing was the good old days.

272
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
It doesn't matter what it is.

273
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,200
As long as you and I are good,

274
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I'll be brave.
