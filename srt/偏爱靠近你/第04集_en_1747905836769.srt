1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
The

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,960
The

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,960
Congratulations to the brilliant basketball team

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,960
Won the victory in last week's basketball game

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,960
Next, let's take a look

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,960
The basketball team in this game

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,960
The wonderful performance

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,960
Come to applaud

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,960
What's wrong with you

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
What's wrong with you

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,960
Is that a traffic light

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,960
Who did this

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
Turn off, turn off

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Coming, coming

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,960
Traffic light is coming

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,960
Traffic light is coming

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
Turn off

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,960
Turn it off quickly

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
What are you doing

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
What are you doing

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Go with me

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
What's wrong with you

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
It's him

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
What should I do

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,960
How many times do I have to tell you

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
You don't know

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
When did you like to do this

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
First of all

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,960
I don't know who is so boring

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
I made a poster

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
It's everywhere

32
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
But the poster is good

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Remember to give me a model

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Second

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,960
I hope to learn from these little gossip

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Otherwise, it will be like me

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Be despised and mocked

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Finally

39
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,920
I hate the people behind it

40
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
The one who does the little gossip

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Don't you want to know

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,920
Who wrote the love letter

43
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
Yes

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Just

45
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
What are you doing

46
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
First of all

47
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Today is really a good day

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Yu Mingxi was right

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
The poster is good

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
Try again

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
To be honest

52
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,920
I actually have a lot of bad things

53
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,880
But from today

54
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
I like it

55
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Kiss

56
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Kiss

57
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,880
I was crazy just now

58
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
No

59
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
I think it's pretty handsome

60
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
What if I'm in school

61
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
What should I do

62
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
Don't worry

63
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
The sky falls

64
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
You are nervous

65
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,880
I think of you

66
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,880
I will look at the clock on the wall

67
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,880
When I walk

68
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,880
I fall into the life in the idol drama

69
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
You are the cow

70
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:26,880
I am the apple that falls from the tree

71
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Take a bite

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Like a fish living in the water

73
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
You are summer

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,840
I am the wind blowing from the beach

75
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Why is the idol drama so popular

76
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,840
I don't know how to search

77
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
You order

78
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
Can you hold it

79
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Not me, do you order

80
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Easy to say

81
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
Come in

82
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
Yu Mingxi

83
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Yu Mingxi, right

84
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
You had good grades in the previous college

85
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Why are you now

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
The foundation of the double language teaching

87
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Especially academic English

88
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Can't reach the threshold of international 2 plus 2 projects

89
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Professional class full A is useless

90
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Sorry, principal

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
I will work hard to learn English

92
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Or say

93
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I didn't put my mind on learning

94
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
I'm thinking about how to write a love letter and confess

95
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Is it

96
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
No, principal

97
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
I think

98
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
You are really a misunderstanding

99
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Our wonderful dean

100
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Because of your father

101
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
To save money

102
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Transfer you to our college to study

103
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,760
But you don't work hard

104
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
Don't affect other students

105
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
Sorry, principal

106
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,760
I will work hard to learn in the future

107
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,760
This time

108
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Can you not affect

109
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,760
The amount of my application scholarship

110
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
Your situation

111
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Although it meets the application standards

112
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,720
What about the students in the second grade

113
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
With your current grades

114
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Can you stay is a problem

115
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
What scholarship

116
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
The next GPA ranking

117
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
If there is no improvement

118
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Please go back to the original college

119
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Okay, principal

120
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
This time you are doing the right thing

121
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
You are punished to write a check

122
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Don't pursue the rest

123
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
Thank you, principal

124
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Are you done

125
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
What you said

126
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
The classmate who was affected by her

127
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Isn't it me?

128
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Please ask her

129
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Which grade do you want

130
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
When is my grade

131
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Transferred to the second in the whole school

132
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
I won't be late if you come to condemn me again

133
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
Obviously

134
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
Just write a love letter

135
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
It's appropriate

136
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,680
The moral standards of your school

137
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
It's too old

138
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Jiang Bohan

139
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
You are getting more and more excessive now

140
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
No way

141
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm not a teacher

142
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Otherwise

143
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
You invite my dad

144
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,680
I also read it here

145
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
What do you think

146
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Ma

147
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Wang

148
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
Go out

149
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Go out all

150
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Wait

151
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Leave the school

152
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Put the love letter on the wall

153
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Tear it up before you go

154
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Why don't you find someone who put the love letter

155
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Come to punish

156
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
What are you two

157
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
You are the direct manager of the incident

158
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Are you wrong

159
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
What incident

160
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Writing a love letter or harming state property

161
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
None

162
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Jiang Bohan

163
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
It's not the time for you to fall in love

164
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
OK

165
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Then Jin Ran'an

166
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
You have already given us

167
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Relationship has been settled

168
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
I will do my best

169
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
I'm leaving

170
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Principal

171
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
I

172
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Yu Mingxi

173
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
I tell you very seriously

174
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
If you don't want to be expelled

175
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Just strictly follow

176
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Our wonderful rules and regulations

177
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Did you hear it

178
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,680
I heard

179
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Given your family situation

180
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
I will consider the scholarship

181
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
Go out

182
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Thank you principal

183
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
What

184
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Principal

185
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Sorry

186
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
I'm going to find someone to take a class tonight

187
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Yes, yes, yes

188
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
It's that particularly cute little girl

189
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Reciting in the house

190
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
OK, thank you principal

191
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Thank you principal

192
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Jiang Bohan, why are you still sitting

193
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
It's going to be dark before it's too late

194
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Lu Xi

195
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Do you know how much this school fee is

196
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
A year

197
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Of course you know

198
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
We spent so much money

199
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Not for us to clean up

200
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
You think i want

201
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
So how did you get it

202
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
How was it forced to be accepted

203
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
Because of my dad

204
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
It's all because of you that I was punished

205
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
I'm so annoyed

206
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
Because of me

207
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Yes

208
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Please

209
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
Give me

210
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
You can't do it

211
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
Give me

212
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
No need

213
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
Give me

214
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
No need

215
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Give me

216
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
A body of dirty water

217
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
So hard

218
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,680
Why are you wearing old school uniforms

219
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,680
You think i want

220
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
New school fee is 1880

221
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Anyway, it doesn't matter

222
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,680
The principal gave me the last pass

223
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Let me put the grades up in a short time

224
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Otherwise, I'll be in trouble

225
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
I'm sorry

226
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
I'm sorry

227
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
I'm sorry

228
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
I'm sorry

229
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
I'm sorry

230
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
I'm sorry

231
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
I'm sorry

232
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
I'm sorry

233
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Otherwise, I have to quit school

234
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Isn't it easy to get a student's grade

235
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Not so easy

236
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
I teach you

237
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Forget it

238
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
The principal said

239
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
You have more important things to do

240
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,680
And although we have nothing to do

241
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
But I also let the principal rest assured

242
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
I'd better stay away from you

243
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,680
What's the benefit of being a little farther away from me

244
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
No benefit

245
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
But before I met you

246
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
I have never been scolded

247
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Never been spread

248
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
I won't deal with these messy things

249
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
I didn't mean that

250
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Because the principal has a lot of expectations for you

251
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,680
You are his only pride

252
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,680
So we should keep a distance from each other

253
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
OK

254
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Then keep a distance

255
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
You go back

256
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
You don't have to clean up today

257
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
But I won't clean up today

258
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
I will die tomorrow

259
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
No

260
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
Remember what you said

261
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Keep a distance

262
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
Clothes

263
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Go

264
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
From today

265
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,680
You'd better keep a distance from me

266
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
Are you done

267
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
You think too much

268
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
What kind of person he is

269
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
It has nothing to do with you

270
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
I really hate strawberry flavor

271
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,680
But from today

272
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
I like

273
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
I like it

274
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
I like it

275
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
I like it

276
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
I like it

277
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Why are you so down

278
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Mom, why are you here

279
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
Just finished the school board meeting

280
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
I see on the way to the concert

281
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Why didn't you hold the porridge

282
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Did you make a mistake in rehearsal

283
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,680
When did you become so mediocre

284
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
Next concert

285
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
My daughter must hold the porridge

286
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,680
I don't want to be laughed at by other mothers

287
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
It's good to improve skills

288
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
It's good to improve skills

289
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,680
It's good to build relationships

290
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,680
You must achieve your goal by any means

291
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
I see

292
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
Mom

293
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Don't reveal your emotions easily

294
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Let others know your weakness

295
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
I see

296
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Mom

297
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
Jiang Bohan

298
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
I didn't see you today

299
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
I'm sorry

300
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,680
I'm sorry

301
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
I have no time to play with you

302
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,680
Jiang Bohan

303
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
That thing has been going on for so long

304
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Why are you still not willing to forgive me

305
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
It has nothing to do with that thing

306
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,680
And you are closer

307
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,680
I'm closer

308
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
So you treat me like this now

309
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Just for that Yunxi

310
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,680
You want me to stay away from you

311
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,680
I promise you

312
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
I'll watch you from afar

313
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Cheer for you

314
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
But you

315
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
I give you space

316
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Not to let you

317
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Love someone else

318
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Give me space

319
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
Where did you come from

320
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
So low-key to say this

321
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
Low-key

322
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
We are childhood friends

323
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
I personally want to be with you

324
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,680
No matter what

325
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
Better than him

326
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
Family, grades, appearance

327
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Where am I worse than him

328
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
I never

329
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,680
Because of material conditions

330
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Measure a person

331
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,680
And you are too biased

332
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
What you do

333
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,680
What are those things I do

334
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Don't you know

335
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
So you like it

336
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
I'm sorry

337
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
You only push me to apologize

338
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Then what is your feelings for Yunxi

339
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
It has nothing to do with you

340
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Jiang Bohan

341
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
If you dare to like him

342
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
I will not let him go

343
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Then you try
