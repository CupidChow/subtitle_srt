1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No need to look for it.

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm the one who's taking care of it.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Lin Mingxin, you go out first.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Jiang Bohai, be careful with what you say.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is my car.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Can't you see it?

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I've been helping him with his class these days.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
He needs to get a scholarship.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He needs to take the midterm exam.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You threaten him to drop out of school in the form of grades

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and then you don't let him take the exam.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Is this your way of calculating?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Are you done?

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I didn't force him to drop out of school.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
A grade like his

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
is not suitable for the international school.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He won't get an offer after graduation.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Going back to the original school

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
is a better choice for him.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's not because he has bad grades.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's because of the family.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The pressure is too great.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
His father...

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
His mother is not at home all the time.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He is his own parent.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
As a teacher, have you ever cared about him?

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm caring about him now.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Then why did you let him take the class?

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you think the school's problem

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
can be solved by me?

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I have to explain to the students, parents,

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and even the school board.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Jiang Bohai, can you take good care of yourself first?

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not going to let you go.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm going to help you.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm going to help you.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm going to help you.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm going to help you.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Can you take good care of yourself first?

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Think about your own future.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't be surrounded by this girl all day.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It will delay your future and your going abroad.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why don't you go abroad? Don't you know?

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't pretend nothing happened.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't think you have no responsibility.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I miss you.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I will look at the clock on the wall.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I will walk on the street.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I will fall into the life in the idol drama.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,220
drama

76
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,820
Diesel

77
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,000
Xiao Xi, you did nothing wrong

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,700
Why did they stop your classes?

79
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,800
The school said to follow the procedure

80
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,700
this is too much bullying

81
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,000
When did this plastic surgery happen when i was young

82
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,700
The proposal came out quickly

83
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,740
I will go to see the president

84
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,140
All right, stop, just let it go

85
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,800
Just go home and rest for a few days

86
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,920
But it's too hard on you.

87
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,760
It's okay. Go back quickly.

88
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,400
Remember to help me copy my notes.

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,640
I will always help you with the school's work.

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,480
I'm leaving.

91
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,360
She needs to take the 7th grade exam and get the scholarship.

92
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you know how important this scholarship is to her?

93
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,200
Hello, is it a haircut or a style?

94
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,400
Okay, this way please.

95
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,000
Hello, are you sure you want to sell your hair?

96
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,600
Pick it up here?

97
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,600
It's 1,200 yuan in total. I will transfer it to you later on the front desk.

98
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,040
Hello, Mom.

99
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,560
Baby, how's school going?

100
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,440
I got the scholarship this time.

101
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,280
It's 1,200 yuan in the scholarship.

102
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,440
You don't have to send me my living expenses this month.

103
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,720
to pay for my living expenses.

104
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,280
Really?

105
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,320
My daughter is so outstanding.

106
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,240
Mom,

107
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,000
when will you come back?

108
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,120
I'll treat you to a good meal.

109
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,120
You don't even want to

110
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,360
buy yourself a good meal.

111
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,400
This time, I'll treat you.

112
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,200
I've been busy at the factory.

113
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,160
I'll wait until I finish this order.

114
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,600
When I get home,

115
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,800
we'll celebrate it together.

116
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,560
Mom,

117
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,320
I miss you.

118
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,160
I miss you too.

119
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,720
Take care of yourself.

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,840
Eat well.

121
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,240
I'll hang up now.

122
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,080
Bye.

123
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,800
Keep an eye on him.

124
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,880
Okay.

125
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,440
Where's he?

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,720
He's flung there.

127
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,400
Go after him!

128
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,320
Don't let him go!

129
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,800
Put down their phone

130
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,000
I can't know

131
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,520
who will pay for this

132
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,640
You, put down your phone

133
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,720
Tell princess

134
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,640
Let her hang the phone

135
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,240
Why are you running so fast?

136
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,280
Hello.

137
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,440
What can I do for you?

138
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,760
Yu Mi?

139
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,800
It's me.

140
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,640
You Jing Chu.

141
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,880
You Jing Chu?

142
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,640
Why are you so tall?

143
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,800
You're only two months older than me.

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,200
Why haven't you grown taller?

145
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,840
I want to know that too.

146
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,920
Who are you?

147
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,760
Who are you?

148
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,520
What's your relationship?

149
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,600
What's your relationship?

150
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,680
This is my classmate.

151
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
And this is me.

152
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
We used to take a bath together when we were kids.

153
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,680
What nonsense are you talking about?

154
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,960
I'm not talking nonsense.

155
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,040
I have photos here.

156
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,560
Okay, okay, okay.

157
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,280
No need to mention it.

158
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,240
By the way,

159
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,920
why did the students chase you just now?

160
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,400
They...

161
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,120
They can't beat me.

162
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,280
They often seek revenge.

163
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,960
It seems that you're quite naughty.

164
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,480
You...

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,960
You're my classmate, right?

166
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,120
You're already wet.

167
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,320
The umbrella is too tight. Go out.

168
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,480
No.

169
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,160
No.

170
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,120
You're wet too.

171
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,960
Why are you wearing an umbrella?

172
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,200
Yu Mi and I are going home together.

173
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,040
Why don't you tell me?

174
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,120
I told you to go home together.

175
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,560
No.

176
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,720
Why can't we go home together?

177
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,560
Give it to me.

178
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,560
You go home with me.

179
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,240
No.

180
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,920
No.

181
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,960
Go out.

182
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,320
Go out.

183
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,960
You go out.

184
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,360
No.

185
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,520
Go out.

186
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,200
You go out.

187
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,160
Stop it.

188
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,280
It seems that it's not raining.

189
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,200
If it's not raining,

190
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,360
let's go home.

191
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,320
Why?

192
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,000
It's okay.

193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,760
You're so white now.

194
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,920
Do you like it?

195
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,000
Why are there three people today?

196
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,760
It's quite lively.

197
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,400
You go first.

198
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,680
Who are you?

199
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,560
It has nothing to do with you.

200
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,440
Get out of here.

201
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,360
Watch your back.

202
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,400
Help me.

203
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,600
Help me on the floor.

204
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:57,960
Help me.

205
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Let's go.

206
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Let me help you.

207
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,320
Come in.

208
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
No need to change your shoes.

209
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,920
It's the clothes room. I need to change my clothes.

210
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Wait for me.

211
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
This is the school uniform you left last time.

213
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
I washed it for you.

214
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
Thank you.

215
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Jiang Huo, Jing Chu.

216
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
Can't you wait for me to go in and change?

217
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
What are you doing?

218
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
I haven't seen it.

219
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
What are you thinking about?

220
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
I was taking a shower when I was a kid.

221
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
Give it to me.

222
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
Oh, right.

223
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
You two didn't get hurt, right?

224
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
It's okay. Don't worry.

225
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
It's okay.

226
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Who are you?

227
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Mom, you're back.

228
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
These are all my friends.

229
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
They'll be leaving soon.

230
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Hello, Auntie.

231
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
How can you talk?

232
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
Let your friends sit.

233
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Auntie,

234
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
you don't remember me?

235
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
A'chu.

236
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
A'chu.

237
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
We haven't seen each other for so many years.

238
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
You're so strong.

239
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
I'm fine.

240
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Let me help you get your things.

241
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Okay.

242
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Oh, right, Mom.

243
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,520
This is my classmate, Jiang Bo Han.

244
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Hello, Auntie.

245
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Hello.

246
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Look.

247
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Before you started school, I was worried that you'd get sick.

248
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
I'm fine.

249
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Look.

250
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Before you started school, I was worried that you'd get sick.

251
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Now that you're getting along with your classmates,

252
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
I'm relieved.

253
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
I'm getting along very well.

254
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
Mom said she'd come back early to cook for you.

255
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
She's giving you a surprise.

256
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Why are you back so early today?

257
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
You didn't go to school?

258
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
I...

259
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,520
Right. Why are you back so early today?

260
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
There's an activity at school today.

261
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
I'm going to school early.

262
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
I'll wash the fruits first and tell you.

263
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Did you skip class?

264
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
You haven't changed your habit since you were a kid.

265
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
Auntie, let me help you.

267
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Sit down.

268
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Who's calling? Why aren't you answering?

269
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
It's okay.

270
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
What is it?

271
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
Where are you?

272
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Are you with Yu Mingxi again?

273
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
I'm at his house right now.

274
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
Come back quickly. I need to talk to you.

275
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
What's the matter? You can't talk on the phone.

276
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Come back quickly.

277
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
What's wrong? Who is it?

278
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
My mom.

279
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Then you should leave quickly.

280
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Your mom must be looking for you.

281
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
It's okay.

282
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Come on. Shili.

283
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
Mom, Jiang Menghan has something to do. She has to leave first.

284
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
She's leaving?

285
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Auntie, I'll visit you another day.

286
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
So soon? Let's talk for a while.

287
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
No, her mom has something to talk to her.

288
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Let's go.

289
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Goodbye, auntie.

290
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Then I'll go.

291
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Take care.

292
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Why don't you go?

293
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
I just came.

294
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,520
I have a lot of bad words to say to auntie.

295
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Okay, then you tell auntie.

296
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
You send me Yu Mingxi.

297
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
Then I'll send her first.

298
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Okay.

299
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Jiang Menghan.

300
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
You're indeed a young man.

301
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
You even let me send you downstairs.

302
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
Jiang Menghan, what are you doing?

303
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Why did you stop suddenly?

304
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
I'm not going to stop.

305
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,520
I'm going to help you solve the problem of Ting.

306
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,520
I'm not a person who can comfort others.

307
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
If you feel wronged,

308
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
or you can bite me.

309
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Are you crazy? I'm not a dog.

310
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Why would I bite you?

311
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
There's one more thing.

312
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
What's the relationship between that boy and you?

313
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
You mean You Jingchu?

314
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
We grew up together.

315
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
I just treat him as a brother.

316
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Really?

317
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Tell that brat to go home quickly.

318
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
If there's nothing else, don't always come here.

319
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
I'm going to go.

320
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Okay.

321
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
I'll go.

322
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
Okay.

323
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
I'll go.

324
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Don't always come here.

325
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
I'm going.

326
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Okay.

327
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
Don't worry about Ting.

328
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
I'm here.

329
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Xiao Xi, that society is not sensible.

330
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
He only bullied you.

331
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Yes, look at him.

332
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
He just bit the leaves and he's still here.

333
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
He bit you again?

334
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Yes, you talk to him.

335
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
He's not that cold.

336
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Actually, I'm not that big.

337
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Xiao Xi.

338
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Chu just came.

339
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
You have to take care of him.

340
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Okay.

341
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Auntie.

342
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
I just got into physical school.

343
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
I'm not a good student.

344
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
I'm not a good student.

345
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
I'm not a good student.

346
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
I'm not a good student.

347
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
I'm not a good student.

348
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
I'm not a good student.

349
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
I just got into physical school.

350
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
I don't know much about life.

351
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
I haven't said hello to you yet.

352
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
So I'm here to ask you.

353
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,520
Don't bother.

354
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Chu, you're so rude.

355
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Your dad and Xiao Xi's dad are the same.

356
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
They are not here.

357
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
We have to meet, right?

358
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Maybe they'll continue to work at the bottom.

359
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
The grass will grow well.

360
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
Oh.

361
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
You just said what you majored in.

362
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,800
I'm a full-time driver.

363
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,560
Full-time driver?

364
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,320
Is it dangerous?

365
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,640
Is it easy to get hurt?

366
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,000
It's okay, aunt.

367
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,760
We are all professionals.

368
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We will protect ourselves.

369
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,760
Then I'm relieved.

370
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,640
From now on,

371
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,440
I will be with you and Xiao Xi at home.

372
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,480
I won't be here.

373
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Don't worry too much.

374
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,400
I just want to make you sleep on the sofa.

375
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,600
It's okay.

376
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,560
Wu Ziqiao, wake up.

377
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,000
You have a good relationship, right?

378
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Wait, mom.

379
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
He's going to live in our house?
