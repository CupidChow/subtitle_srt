00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Love Me If You Dare

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,200
Yu Mi Xi. Yu Mi Xi, wait a minute.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,600
Why did you run so fast?

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,400
Because it's embarrassing.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,600
I know you're feeling wronged, but I really didn't take that photo.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,000
And I also didn't think about taking revenge on you.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I also didn't think that there was any class difference between us.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,800
But you're right. I indeed have a lot of respect for Chu You.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,000
I can't change the way my family is.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,400
I also didn't look down on anyone because of this.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,400
Really?

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,600
Really.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
Mom, I'm sorry. I was wrong about you.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,200
Also, are you also angry with what I said last time?

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,600
Didn't you say that you wanted us to keep our distance?

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,400
I didn't want to cause you trouble. I didn't want you to argue with the principal again.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Then why are you still angry with me?

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,800
I'm not a group of old friends.

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,400
I just don't want to lose a friend like you anymore.

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,000
Friend?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,200
That's right. You are the second friend I've ever had in Jing Cai.

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,000
Then we...

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,200
We're good friends now.

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,000
I...

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,600
You're not allowed to touch my hair.

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:02:14,840
Hey, these

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:54,600
You are the cow, I am the apple that fell from the tree

29
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:01,600
I want to drink it, just like the fish that lives in the water

30
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:11,600
You are the summer, I am the wind that blows from the beach

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Why do people not know how to make love stories

32
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:58,600
You are the summer, I am the wind that blows from the beach

33
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:31,600
You are the summer, I am the wind that blows from the beach

34
00:04:41,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Why do you answer the phone

35
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Jiang Bohan, when did you become so bad?

36
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
So those things were caused by you?

37
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Do you mind?

38
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
If you do this, it will only make our relationship worse and worse

39
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
This is not what I want

40
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Then why are you targeting him?

41
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,600
I do not allow him to get close to you

42
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Allow?

43
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I took the picture, but I did not say those words

44
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Everyone knows what kind of person he is

45
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Why do you still want me to make the rumors?

46
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I do not want to hear any rumors about Yu Mingxin

47
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,600
So please handle this matter properly

48
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Jiang Bohan

49
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Jiang Bohan

50
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,600
But still it begins, and so it is

51
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Your eyes can't hide you

52
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
You build those castles in the sand

53
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
And hope with everything you have

54
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,600
The wind is calm tonight

55
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Looking for answers in the dark

56
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
You're searching endless works of art

57
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,600
To find life inside of them

58
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Oh to find light inside of them

59
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,600
The sky opens wide

60
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Because your eyes

61
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,600
So no one can blind you

62
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Still it begins, and so it is

63
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Why don't you come?

64
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Why don't you go to the room and have some water first?

65
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,600
The sky opens wide

66
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,600
You close your eyes

67
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Now it won't find you

68
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Jiang Bohan

69
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,600
I specifically played the role you like

70
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
I thought you would come

71
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Why do you let me down again and again?

72
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Make me sad

73
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,600
When are you going to punish me?

74
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I didn't punish you

75
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Let's go back to the past

76
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
I can't go back

77
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
I don't want you to say that

78
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,600
It's all because of that Yu Mingxi

79
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
What is he worth to you?

80
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
I

81
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
I can dance ballet

82
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I can also play the big violin

83
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,600
I will go to you first

84
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
I will apologize to you

85
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I will join the team for you

86
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I really like you

87
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
What's wrong with me?

88
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
What's wrong with me?

89
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Where is Liao Yang?

90
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Inside

91
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Liao Yang

92
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Liao Yang

93
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Liao Yang

94
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Liao Yang

95
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Liao Yang

96
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Liao Yang

97
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
I'm really sad

98
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,600
I don't want to cry

99
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Why are you still awake?

100
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Just now, Qin Siyou's mother gave me a call

101
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
She said she was drunk and crying

102
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I said Jiang Bohan

103
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Is she crying?

104
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,600
She said she was crying

105
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
She said she was crying

106
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
She said she was crying

107
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
She said she was crying

108
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
I said Jiang Bohan

109
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Can you two not get angry?

110
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Her mother told me

111
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
You didn't go to see her performance because of a girl

112
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
I ask you

113
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Is that girl Yu Mingxi?

114
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
What do you want to say?

115
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
What do i want to say

116
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
You too

117
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
It's not early youth

118
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Still so hot

119
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
This Yu Mingxi

120
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I told her on purpose

121
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Now focus on your studies

122
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
She doesn't care about what I say

123
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Don't make it difficult for her

124
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Now Qin Siyou's mother knows her

125
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Why do you need me to make it difficult for her?

126
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
No matter who

127
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Making it difficult for her is making it difficult for me

128
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
What do you mean?

129
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I mean

130
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I like her

131
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Jiang Bohan

132
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Are you serious?

133
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
I will confess to her tomorrow

134
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
I ran 21 minutes and 53 seconds today

135
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
You are great

136
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
You run faster and faster

137
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
But I think it's not enough

138
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
What's the matter? Practice slowly

139
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I will practice slowly

140
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
The competition is coming soon

141
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Yu Mingxi

142
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
I have something to tell you

143
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Can I talk about it after school?

144
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
No

145
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Then you say

146
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
You said Qin Shu was not written by you

147
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Who wrote that?

148
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
You

149
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
I don't remember

150
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
You have something to do with Xiaoxi, right?

151
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
If you don't want to talk about it, I'll go first

152
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
You

153
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,600
I regret it

154
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
What?

155
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
I think we should stop being friends

156
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Why? Didn't we just say it?

157
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Because I like you

158
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
What?

159
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
You can't say anything

160
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Why are you looking at me like this?

161
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
You think about it, I'll go first

162
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Come

163
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Jiang Bohan

164
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
What were you doing just now?

165
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
You saw it

166
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
I warn you

167
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
If you keep being so impulsive

168
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
I can't keep her

169
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
I also warn you

170
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
I like her

171
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
You can't control it

172
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
The End
