1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
You're not with me.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,500
You're right.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Don't be mad at him.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,800
I'm not going to get him.

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
You saw it all?

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,400
What to see? I just got here.

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,000
Why did we wait so long?

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I have waited for you for half a day.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,700
Where are you going?

10
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,700
Go home.

11
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,700
I miss you

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,700
I will stand there

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,700
Looking at the clock on the wall

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,700
You walked

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,700
And fell into the life in the idol drama

16
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,700
You are the cow, I am the snake

17
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,700
The apple fell from the tree

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,700
The apple fell from the tree

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,700
I want to eat it

20
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Like a fish in the water

21
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:45,700
You are summer, I am the wind blowing from the beach

22
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Why is love so hot that people don't know how to search

23
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
The girl in the photo

24
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Min Min

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
You are so fast

26
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,700
Thank you for taking care of me yesterday

27
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,700
You're welcome

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,700
I also want to feel like working

29
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,700
It's so fun to make money

30
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700
Where is my red bean bread

31
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,700
Wait a minute

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,700
Will you have diarrhea when eating it

33
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,540
It's just the end of the year. I'm not that stingy.

34
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,700
Besides, you won't forget to eat breakfast.

35
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,500
After school, I'll go with you to the commercial.

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,700
Okay.

37
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,500
I really can't stand you and Jiang Bo Han.

38
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,300
It's fine. I still have Lin Shaoyang, Chen Suji, and He Shuheng.

39
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,700
Okay, okay, okay. The basketball team is yours.

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,300
Oh, right. I have a secret to tell you.

41
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,300
What?

42
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,100
Jiang Bo Han is the son of the principal.

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,100
What? The principal is the mother of Jiang Bo Han?

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,700
Unallowed to tell others about his secret.

45
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
It's not appropriate, right?

46
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,100
Wait.

47
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,900
Jiang Bo Han, I'm sorry.

48
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,900
And your clothes.

49
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,100
No need.

50
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,700
Why?

51
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,900
For you.

52
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,300
No, this is very expensive.

53
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,700
Jiang Bo Han rejected you. Why are you still fighting?

54
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
You're really bad at talking.

55
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,900
Jiang Bo Han wouldn't be fooled by your dirty tricks.

56
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,900
You think he helped you get out of the hole and you're his friend?

57
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,300
Isn't your family's reaction to you?

58
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,900
So annoying.

59
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,700
What's going on between you two?

60
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,100
He was protecting you in front of so many people yesterday.

61
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,100
It's not good to be angry. It's the son of the principal.

62
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,300
The son of the principal is still so low-key.

63
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,100
He's really a nice person.

64
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,900
The End

65
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,900
Xiaoxi, can you write me another love letter?

66
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,500
Who?

67
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
But we're still in the same class.

68
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,100
No, I have to think about it.

69
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,300
You're so young and you're still thinking about it?

70
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,100
I'm not.

71
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,300
They're so close.

72
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,500
I only have one chance to confess.

73
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,500
I can't give up on the whole class because of a tree.

74
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,500
I have a strategy.

75
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
I'll arrange a big event for you tomorrow.

76
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,300
I've been watching dramas lately.

77
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,300
I think what you think would work best for this,

78
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:40,320
is to catch the

79
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,700
big event in the whole world,

80
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,700
I love you.

81
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,900
Big Head.

82
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,300
You're good at fighting.

83
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,300
You're good at your role.

84
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,300
I'm going in.

85
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,700
Only you can win.

86
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
Sit next to me.

87
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,900
Here.

88
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,100
Xiao Xi.

89
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,100
Xiao Xi.

90
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
I'm not saying this, Big Head.

91
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,300
Did you find out who posted this?

92
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,500
Can you clean it yourself?

93
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
Shut up.

94
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,500
I should have brought some handkerchiefs.

95
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
This is too hard to do.

96
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Where's Mingxin?

97
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,500
Big Head.

98
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,100
Did you two have a fight?

99
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,900
Do your work.

100
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,500
Why isn't Jie here yet?

101
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,700
He said he had something to do.

102
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,700
He'll be here later.

103
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,700
What else can he do besides basketball?

104
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,300
You're in a secret relationship.

105
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,100
Xiao Xi, I'm here.

106
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,700
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
I was wrong.

108
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,100
Why are you two here?

109
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,300
Why are you both here?

110
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,300
We're here to help you.

111
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
Let's go back.

112
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,300
I'm the only one who's being punished.

113
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,100
It's no use telling me.

114
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,500
Jiang Meng Hao.

115
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,300
Yes?

116
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,300
Tell them to go back.

117
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
You go back.

118
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,900
We'll take care of this.

119
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
No need.

120
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,300
I find you're quite interesting.

121
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,700
Yesterday you said you wanted to keep your distance.

122
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,500
But today you met me several times.

123
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,300
Why are you making me feel so anxious?

124
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Me?

125
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
If you're not, please go back.

126
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,500
Okay.

127
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,900
Let's go.

128
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,700
What are you looking at?

129
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
I'm off to work.

130
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,700
I knew it.

131
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,100
They must have had a fight.

132
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
What?

133
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,500
I don't want to leave.

134
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
No.

135
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
Jiang Meng Hao.

136
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,500
Why didn't you turn on the light?

137
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,260
I'm sorry, I can't make it.

138
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,100
What's wrong?

139
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,960
I'm talking to you.

140
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,300
You've cleaned everything up. Is there anything else you want to do?

141
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,940
I know that you asked the basketball team to clean up for him.

142
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,180
You're just using him to use me.

143
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,820
Can you stop using your own thoughts to define me?

144
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,900
How long are you going to keep making trouble with me?

145
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,780
There are a few foreign basketball teams who sent me an email.

146
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,660
They're waiting for your reply.

147
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,500
I said it.

148
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,980
I'm not going.

149
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,940
You're giving up so easily?

150
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,740
For the past six years abroad?

151
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,980
Didn't UCLA just let you in?

152
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,740
You were the one who wanted to be a basketball player.

153
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,660
Now you're giving up so easily?

154
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,500
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,540
Please stop making me do this.

156
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,860
Stop trying to persuade me.

157
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,220
They won't keep waiting for you.

158
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,820
You're not doing anything right. Are you thinking about dating?

159
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,860
It's none of your business.

160
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,580
What's the point of staying away from me?

162
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,300
There's no point.

163
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,340
But before I met you, I was never scolded.

164
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,140
I was never made up.

165
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,140
I won't deal with this kind of stuff.

166
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,420
Remember what you said.

167
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,460
Although we're not that close,

168
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,260
I'll stay away from you so that you can rest assured.

169
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,540
Did I say something that hurt him?

170
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,100
Did I say it too harshly?

171
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,740
Should I apologize to him on WeChat?

172
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,260
I find you quite interesting.

173
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,340
Yesterday you said we're distant, but today you're meeting me again and again.

174
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,420
Why are you so distant?

175
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,180
Me?

176
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,780
If you're not, please leave.

177
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,700
If he thinks of me like that, why should I apologize?

178
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,420
Dad, you've been making money to make me do the gold medal.

179
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,820
But I didn't expect the new semester to be like this.

180
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,340
You didn't do well in school and you didn't get along with your classmates.

181
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,980
I'm disappointed in you.

182
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,500
But from tomorrow, I will make everyone's eyes shine.

183
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:48,580
Five, six, seven, eight, seven, one, two, three, four, five, six,

184
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:55,500
seven, eight, two, two, three, stretch, five, six.

185
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,420
Look at the audience.

186
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,220
Okay, front and back.

187
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,860
Okay, front and back.

188
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,180
I don't want to do dance classes anymore.

189
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,940
Luckily, you're here with me.

190
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,780
One, two, three, four, five.

191
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,740
Okay, class is over.

192
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,380
What happened?

193
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,180
Xiao Xi.

194
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,060
Everyone knows about your job.

195
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,220
What?

196
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,140
Someone sent your photo to the whole school.

197
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,540
Everyone is talking about you.

198
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,420
Xiao Xi, are you okay?

199
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,340
I'm fine.

200
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,460
I'm fine.

201
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,420
Xiao Xi, are you okay?

202
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,860
I'm fine. It's just a job.

203
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,140
That's right.

204
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,340
You should do your job. I'll listen to you.

205
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,580
This Yu Mingxi is really ungrateful.

206
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,860
You must have been sent by his parents to be a great man.

207
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,180
You must have been sacrificed to be our daughter-in-law.

208
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,220
If I were him, I would have dropped out of school right away.

209
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,020
Didn't Xu Ni say that

210
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,220
he's not good at this job and the principal gave him the last pass?

211
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,660
Really?

212
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,860
It seems like he can't complete his task.

213
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,940
Of course he can't.

214
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,940
I heard that Jiang Bohan almost got into the trap.

215
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,260
Luckily, he's not in the dark anymore.

216
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,820
He must have seen his ambition.

217
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,860
What do you mean almost got into the trap? Jiang Bohan is so smart.

218
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,580
How could he get into this job?

219
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,460
He must have found out long ago.

220
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,020
He's playing tricks on him.

221
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,100
Who told you that?

222
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,820
We only heard about it.

223
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,180
You dare to do it and you're afraid of being told?

224
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,340
I'm doing my job. What do I do?

225
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,300
Stop acting, okay?

226
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,300
You're here to make a good start.

227
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,700
Now the whole school knows.

228
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,420
I don't know. Tell me who told you.

229
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,300
What are you doing?

230
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,300
The concert is about to start. Get to work.

231
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,420
Xiaoxi, don't listen to them.

232
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,180
Some people like to talk nonsense.

233
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,980
I believe you.

234
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,220
Thank you.

235
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,500
But I have to remind you.

236
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,260
This is a big deal.

237
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,500
Jiang Bohan is not a good person.

238
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,900
He's a top student in our school.

239
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,620
He's always been followed.

240
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,500
This time, you might have let him lose face.

241
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,660
Xiaoxi, I don't think Jiang Bohan is like that.

242
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,900
I'm working part-time at the store and the principal's office.

243
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,500
Only you and him know about it. Who else?

244
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,020
You can't tell, right?

245
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,100
I didn't expect him to be like this.

246
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,700
Find him.

247
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,940
Where are you going to find Jiang Bohan?

248
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,820
Right, there's a concert with Qin Siyou today.

249
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,340
Boss, you should go.

250
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,380
What for?

251
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,940
Get dressed and eat. After that, we'll go to training.

252
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,540
What? Boss, we just trained for three hours.

253
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,860
There's no need to work so hard.

254
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,860
Do you think you're in a good state recently?

255
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,460
Either go to training or wait for your loss.

256
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,140
Boss, it's not easy to deal with physical training.

257
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,940
If you can't go to the stadium, do we have a chance?

258
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,740
What did you say?

259
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,140
I don't dare to. I didn't say anything.

260
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,860
I'm the only one in the team.

261
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,140
What do you do?

262
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,740
And Chen Suo Jie, what's wrong with you recently?

263
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,740
I've been a bit tired lately.

264
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,740
Boss, you should make good relations with your mom.

265
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,540
If you really get fired,

266
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,940
do you think I want to work with the principal?

267
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,540
That's to date Yu Mingxi.

268
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,340
What Yu Mingxi?

269
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,340
Jiang Bohan, I've been telling you everything to be your good friend.

270
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,740
I didn't think you were like this.

271
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,140
You're trying to blackmail me.

272
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,540
You said I'm a bad girl who's afraid of the world.

273
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:59,360
What about you? A

274
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,540
What's going on?

275
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,940
She scolded you.

276
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,340
I'm talking about what happened in school.

277
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,160
She said you were a parasite that feeds on the

278
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,140
food of Chu You.

279
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,140
I...

280
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,940
Three hours of training and you missed out on so much.

281
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,340
This is too cruel.

282
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,140
No wonder she's so angry.

283
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,740
I'm sorry.

284
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,340
I'm sorry.

285
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,740
I'm sorry.
