1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,520
This is the last chance.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,840
Whose name do you want to write?

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,240
Jiang Bohan.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,520
Are you sure?

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,160
They were supposed to be of different names.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,280
But I calculated it last night.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,360
According to Wang Chu Nian's score,

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,440
Jiang Bohan

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,520
got 8 points.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,640
Lin Shao Yang

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,400
got 7 points.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,760
But Jiang Bohan is from the Scorpio Team.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,960
I'm from the Gemini Team.

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,600
I'm so proud of him.

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,680
So,

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,680
doesn't Lin Shao Yang have any extra points?

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,440
Yes.

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,920
He's a bit of a

20
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,480
total loser.

21
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,840
So,

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,080
he doesn't have any other strengths?

23
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,240
He seems to be

24
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,360
a bit of a long-term lover.

25
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,720
He's been in a relationship for years.

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,480
His girlfriend went abroad.

27
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,720
They broke up because of Yi Di.

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,040
What about Jiang Bohan?

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,880
Jiang Bohan?

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,240
I don't know him.

31
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,560
It seems that he's never been in a relationship.

32
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,560
I'm so bad at this.

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,040
I have to deduct 10 points.

34
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,720
But my score system

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,320
doesn't have this kind of deduction.

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,160
No.

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,880
I have to be fair and objective.

38
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,320
It's Jiang Bohan.

39
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,400
Okay.

40
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,640
You've made up your mind.

41
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,720
We'll send them off

42
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,440
after the competition.

43
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,400
But what if they say they're too many?

44
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,560
Niannian.

45
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,240
We can't be just a few people.

46
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,000
We can't be just words.

47
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,320
We can't be just too many people.

48
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,800
We have to be brave and say it out.

49
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,720
This match results in

50
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,120
the enemies' cheek.

51
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,960
If you can't say it out,

52
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,640
there will be no followers,

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
allows them to balder.

54
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,640
Anyway.

55
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,640
When you win,

56
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,920
just consider pro Connor

57
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,000
as your green light,

58
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,720
not preparing for next mister.

59
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,760
I Protestant.

60
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,840
Go and say good-bye to Ji Young.

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,920
I'm going to the budget.

62
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,200
Do you want me to go with Sang hospital?

63
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,200
Qi S Arch meng Dai.

64
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
I'm leaving.

65
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
We finally won.

66
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Let's celebrate later.

67
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
It's a win even if it's a three-pointer.

68
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Keep practicing.

69
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Boss,

70
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
we just finished the competition.

71
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Shouldn't we rest for a while?

72
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
I'm a little tired.

73
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
If you're tired, then you're thirsty.

74
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
The new date at the convenience store

75
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
is on the way.

76
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
I'll buy you a gift.

77
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
No need.

78
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
No need. Thank you.

79
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
How about I get one for me?

80
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
I said no need.

81
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
You haven't seen it yet.

82
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
How do you know if it's useful?

83
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
We're going to train.

84
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Why don't you stay with us for a while?

85
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
I'm afraid the ball will hit you.

86
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Hua Chun Tian,

87
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
come back.

88
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Come back.

89
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
I told you.

90
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Be careful.

91
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Be careful.

92
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm fine.

93
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
I'll settle the score with you when I'm back.

94
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
I didn't mean to.

95
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
I'm sorry.

96
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,200
I'm the one who fell from the beach that day.

97
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,200
I don't understand why love is so painful

98
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,200
that no one knows how to get rid of it.

99
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
The End

100
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
There's a story.

101
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
What story?

102
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Boss looked at that girl

103
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
with a wrong eye.

104
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Don't talk nonsense.

105
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Don't talk nonsense.

106
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
You're right.

107
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,160
For how long?

108
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,640
Around ten minutes.

109
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,520
Hello.

110
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,680
May I know

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
how long I slept?

112
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
About a half hour.

113
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,480
Sorry,

114
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,680
I delayed your training.

115
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,400
I am fine now.

116
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,360
I am fine.

117
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,660
The doctor said you are not healthy. There's low blood sugar and insomnia.

118
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
Eat this.

119
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,760
Thanks. Sorry, I made you trouble.

120
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,200
No need to say sorry. It's not your problem.

121
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,440
Let He Shu come back and apologize to you.

122
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,040
He didn't mean to do that.

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,800
And you have to apologize on the day off.

124
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,120
No need. I made a mistake.

125
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,160
I shouldn't have sent you a ship ticket.

126
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,120
I was too tired and didn't have time to eat.

127
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,560
I have a low blood sugar. I'll be fine soon.

128
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,760
Why didn't you eat breakfast?

129
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,120
You went to see Yu Wei again?

130
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,000
You still remember?

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm not Yu Wei.

132
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,600
Xiao Xi!

133
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,480
Are you okay?

134
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,760
Jiang Bo Han.

135
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,600
Jiang Bo Han, this is my good friend, Wang Shun Mian.

136
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
He likes you a lot.

137
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,000
The basketball team.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If there's nothing else, I'll go first.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
Let's go.

140
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
My head!

141
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,240
I think I got hit by a ball.

142
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,800
I don't know when I'll be able to get out of this back-to-back battle.

143
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm so tired.

144
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,840
I don't know when I'll be able to get out of this back-to-back battle.

145
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,960
How about this? Nian Nian is my agent.

146
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,840
If there's anything, we can contact each other.

147
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,680
Agent?

148
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,000
Back-to-back battle?

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,080
Anyway, you have to be responsible for the back-to-back battle.

150
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,480
How about this? Let's use a contact method tomorrow.

151
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,080
Okay.

152
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,480
I didn't bring my phone.

153
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,120
I didn't bring mine either.

154
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,440
Where?

155
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,600
No, no, no.

156
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,800
Wang Shun Mian is so good. He finally opened his mouth.

157
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,440
Hurry and give it to him.

158
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,960
Oh my god! Qin Shuang!

159
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,240
No.

160
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,640
Why not?

161
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,120
There's a word on the paper. If he wants it, just give it to him.

162
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,600
The doctor wants you to rest more. Don't move.

163
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,000
If there's any sequelae, contact me immediately.

164
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,040
Okay.

165
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,640
I'll go check on him.

166
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,840
Let me see.

167
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,440
Let me see.

168
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,320
Hurry.

169
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
Don't push.

170
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,160
Don't push.

171
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,680
Hurry.

172
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,080
I can't.

173
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,040
Jiang Bo Han.

174
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,960
That girl is not simple. I'm telling you to be careful.

175
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,920
What do you mean?

176
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,240
Can't you tell?

177
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,320
What can you tell?

178
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,800
She doesn't belong here.

179
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,720
She's a student in this school. Where does she belong?

180
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,120
Don't be silly.

181
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,600
I heard that some people sell their books and let their kids go to school here.

182
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,960
It's not for anything else.

183
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,120
It's to let them make friends with family and family background.

184
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,080
These people are working hard to get by.

185
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,360
They're trying to get close to you.

186
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,920
I just hope you don't get fooled.

187
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,200
Are you done?

188
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,440
You're overthinking.

189
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,640
What kind of person she is has nothing to do with you.

190
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,040
Look at you. You're all over her.

191
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,440
Also, where did you go?

192
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,280
Don't talk about me.

193
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,200
I know I always fall into a trap at critical moments.

194
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,840
But I'm not a heartless thief.

195
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,480
I know.

196
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,400
But I'm glad I got her place number.

197
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,880
Give me a minute.

198
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,080
Give me a minute.

199
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,920
Where did I leave my shirt?

200
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,840
Forget it if you can't find it.

201
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,000
That won't do.

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,200
Did someone take it away?

203
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,360
I hope so.

204
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,400
Uncle Qin is here too.

205
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,000
Are you sure you dropped it here?

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
When I was giving you a meal, I left Qin's shirt in the shirt.

207
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,080
What if the basketball team took it away

208
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,280
and Jiang Bohan saw it?

209
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,160
But I was supposed to show it to him.

210
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
He wouldn't think I wrote it, right?

211
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,520
It's okay. You wrote it.

212
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,040
Wang Chu Nan!

213
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,320
Classmate.

214
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,360
Are you looking for the passbook that fell on the ground?

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,040
The basketball team took it away.

216
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,080
I see.

217
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,040
You fainted and scared us. Are you okay?

218
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,280
I'm fine.

219
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,840
Jiang Bohan said you have low blood sugar.

220
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,040
Drink some drinks to replenish your energy.

221
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,920
Thank you.

222
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,080
It's okay. It's my duty.

223
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,560
Right, my name is Qin Siyou.

224
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,200
I'm Yu Mingxi. This is my good friend Wang Chu Nan.

225
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
You're new here, right?

226
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,640
If you need help, just let us know.

227
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,880
Sure.

228
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,840
He's so nice.

229
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,040
He's the captain of your basketball team.

230
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,760
He's the school's schoolgirl.

231
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,880
Everyone in our school wants to be friends with him.

232
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,200
He came to care for you.

233
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,000
He's blessed.

234
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,920
Letter of Decision

235
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,440
Oh, no.

236
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,480
Did I miss each takes?

237
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,720
Are there a hand 두id?

238
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,540
Step up.

239
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,400
IsCOVID-19 smart?

240
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,320
Well,...

241
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Wait for me here

242
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,500
Wait for me here

243
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,560
wants to see Unda

244
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,660
Darkness

245
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,800
went to rack

246
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,940
Am I that timid

247
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Therefore

248
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,100
Learning

249
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,200
the way others

250
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,200
really feel

251
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,220
he really time

252
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,760
makes me

253
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,640
be a child

254
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,820
and

255
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,200
don't stay

256
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
It's so sweet.

257
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,080
Hello.

258
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,280
Are you Jiang Bo Han?

259
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,800
Sorry for bothering you.

260
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,560
It's the 78th.

261
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,160
Why is it still wrong?

262
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,600
The old love letter didn't come out.

263
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,480
The old love letter is lost.

264
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,080
The phone number is gone.

265
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,680
My love life is really tough.

266
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,240
The new love letter will come out.

267
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,120
The old love letter will be found.

268
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,480
There are 22 phone numbers left.

269
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,200
Your love life hasn't started yet.

270
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,440
There are 22 left?

271
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,720
Forget it.

272
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,280
I didn't write my name on the love letter anyway.

273
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,360
I just lost it.

274
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,280
No.

275
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,200
Didn't I say it?

276
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,960
What if they think I wrote it?

277
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,640
Xiao Xi.

278
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,400
I have something to do.

279
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,440
I'm leaving.

280
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:48,920
What?

281
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,160
What is it?

282
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,480
You left the love letter to me again?

283
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,280
I'm sorry.

284
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,480
Don't be so shy.

285
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,040
Brother Gui.

286
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,760
Didn't you leave this in the office last time?

287
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,240
What a coincidence.

288
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,800
I let him run away last time.

289
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,080
This time, it's not that easy.

290
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,400
I have to write my name on the love letter.

291
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,480
You two go meet him.

292
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,080
Okay, Brother Gui.

293
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,760
Hello.

294
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,720
Are you Zhang Bo Han?

295
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,960
I called you when I was working.

296
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,120
Are you still working?

297
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
The smoke you bought last time was fake.

298
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,760
Return the money to me.

299
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,280
Why are you guys here again?

300
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,320
You still remember us?

301
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,600
Yu Mingxi.

302
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,480
I remember.

303
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,160
Let's settle the smoke first.

304
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,120
Sir.

305
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
We never sell this kind of smoke in our store.

306
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,520
The smoke was bought in your store.

307
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,960
You mean I'm looking for the smoke?

308
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,840
You've smoked it all.

309
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,680
How can you know it's fake if you don't smoke it?

310
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,680
Fine.

311
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,560
Then this customer,

312
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,040
please show us the purchase receipt.

313
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,840
Receipt?

314
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,280
Did I not make myself clear?

315
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,600
Return the money.

316
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,280
Or I won't let you open this store.

317
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,360
You don't have a receipt.

318
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,320
How can you prove that this smoke was sold by our company?

319
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,560
How can I return the money to you?

320
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,920
If you have other things,

321
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,760
you can call the call of our store.

322
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,000
If you have nothing else,

323
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,920
please leave.

324
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,040
I have work to do.

325
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:43,760
inha

326
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,080
What?

327
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,920
You guys still

328
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,800
want to boss me around?

329
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
Don't bully her.

330
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
If you're a man,

331
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,840
if you have something to do,

332
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
come at me.

333
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,840
Fine. I'll come at you today.

334
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840
I'll beat you.

335
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Pull.

336
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Find the target.

337
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,840
Jiang Bo Han, wait for me.

338
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
I'll come at you.

339
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
If you bother her again,

340
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
I won't be so easy.

341
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Who is she to you?

342
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,840
She?

343
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
Listen up.

344
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,840
She's my girlfriend.

345
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Hold it.

346
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Let's go.

347
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
What are you waiting for?

348
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
You don't know how to change?

349
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Let's go.
