1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
monetized

2
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,120
You're really amazing

3
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,640
What are you doing here again?

4
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,000
Didn't we agree

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,640
to go to Li's with you?

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,160
We'll talk about it later.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,320
What are you doing?

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,840
Are you going or not?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,760
Are you going or not?

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,960
Give me my wallet!

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,240
Give you your wallet!

12
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't return

13
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,320
it if you don't.

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,160
Give me my wallet!

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,240
They won't give it to you!

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,600
Are you a rabid rebel?

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,160
Where are you going?

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,560
Don't grab myina,you

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,600
You are the apple that fell from the tree

20
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,600
It's like a fish swimming in the water

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:22,600
You are the summer, I am the wind blowing from the beach

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I don't understand why love is so hot that no one knows how to get away

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
The situation is still a bit serious

24
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Is it good?

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
This is called Dawei

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,600
I remember to come three times a week

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Ok, that's enough

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
The needle will be needle for half an hour

29
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Call me if you feel uncomfortable

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
There are patients next to me

31
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Thank you

32
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Does it hurt?

33
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
It's ok

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Let's lie down for a while

35
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I am energetic

36
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Xiaoxi, the accident is solved

37
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
You can also add the seventh grade, great

38
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
I am so happy

39
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
How is your review at home?

40
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I think there should be hope in this scholarship

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Really?

42
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
What's wrong?

43
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Who? Chen Sujie

44
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Why is it him again?

45
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
I have been with him to see a doctor recently

46
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
See a doctor?

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Is Chen Sujie sick?

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Didn't he come to the competition a few days ago?

49
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Why are you here?

50
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Xiaoxi

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Actually I have something to hide from you

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I told you, you have to keep it a secret

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
I promised to keep it a secret for him

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
The condition is that I go to the clinic with him

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Niannian

56
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Do you really like Chen Sujie?

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Ok, it's your style

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
This time is different

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I heard the heartbeat

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Heartbeat

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
By the way, how are you and Jiang Menghan?

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm going to take the medicine

63
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Yumin, you are back

64
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
What are you shouting?

65
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
My name is Wang Shunian

66
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
I mean

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
I didn't call you

68
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Sima

69
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
This is my classmate Wang Shunian

70
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
This is my former neighbor's younger brother, You Jingchu

71
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Your former neighbor's younger brother

72
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Why would he take a bath in your house?

73
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
It's a long story

74
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Let me tell you slowly

75
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
There is no problem

76
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
And you are a good friends

77
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
It's okay

78
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
The period grow now

79
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
One and a half hours

80
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,900
Certainly it should be like this in this noted season listen to the

81
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,020
deposits in every neighbourhood

82
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,840
every street

83
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,060
There to treat your child

84
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,300
I see

85
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,140
That it should be about this

86
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,280
So you tell what we have to think

87
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,160
i've come by

88
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,860
It is in this written

89
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,360
recording

90
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,400
No

91
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,120
That's just

92
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:10,480
Then what,

93
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,100
I should bet one to one.

94
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,280
Chen rise.

95
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,880
In golf,

96
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,580
there will be someone here.

97
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,980
I'm here to learn!

98
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,100
I've got money!

99
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,660
You're awesome!

100
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,580
I'm gonna pay the rent!

101
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,020
Ning Ning!

102
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,580
Awesome!

103
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,860
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

104
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,300
Seven A's, Xiao Xi!

105
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,820
Seven F's! Seven A's!

106
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,140
But Su Yan is only 50 this time.

107
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,260
But there are only three

108
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,380
in the scholarship.

109
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,380
You're there.

110
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,460
Excuse me.

111
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,500
Excuse me.

112
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,420
Xiao Xi, it's your turn!

113
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,900
You're awesome!

114
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,820
I'm gonna pay the rent!

115
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,060
I don't know.

116
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,460
Follow me.

117
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,260
Let's go.

118
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,820
This is so nice!

119
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,220
Not bad.

120
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,580
Why didn't you tell me

121
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,780
about such a nice place?

122
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,300
You're so rude.

123
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,020
I finally got the scholarship!

124
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,060
I can pay the rent!

125
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,580
I'm gonna pay the rent!

126
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,900
My ruin...

127
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,660
Xiao Mo devo...

128
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,500
Thank you.

129
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,620
Why are you goingysłate?

130
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,700
I've been wanting to thank you...

131
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,340
ince the starting.

132
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,620
Without you,

133
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,500
and with your prize money.

134
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,460
I wouldn't have made it this far.

135
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,580
Then I'll have to accept your thanks.

136
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,820
I've already bought so many.

137
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
Then...

138
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
let's owe each other first.

139
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
No rush to change.

140
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
But I'm a good person.

141
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,820
If you're not a senior, then that's fine.

142
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
Didn't ask for my grace though.

143
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
Did you know they want you to be there?

144
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
Visit Shen Simon again.

145
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
I can help when 제작.

146
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
You can go back there by yourself.

147
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
There are balloons!

148
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,020
It's a fly.

149
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,020
No. A real one didn't cross over here.

150
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,020
Is it pretty?

151
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,020
It seems...

152
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
It really is.

153
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,020
So now,

154
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
are we going to keep our distance from each other?

155
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,020
You have a heart!

156
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,020
You still have a heart. Don't interrupt me.

157
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,020
Did you see it?

158
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,020
No.

159
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,020
You have a heart again.

160
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,020
You are the summer, I am the night

161
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:16,020
Don't say it's all just a wind blowing

162
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:22,020
Why is love so confusing?

163
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,020
How did you compare me?

164
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:29,640
Jiang Mu Han's

165
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,820
She is my dad.

166
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,980
If you get ill,

167
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,620
you have to have someone own you.

168
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,260
Xia Zhuo Nan.

169
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
I'm sorry.

170
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
I think we should stop being friends.

171
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Why? Didn't you just say that?

172
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Because I like you.

173
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
You're just a student, and you're taking photos with him.

174
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,400
Do you still like him?

175
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Jiang Bo Han.

176
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,020
You're too bad.

177
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,020
What?

178
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,020
I'm just saying.

179
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,020
Why?

180
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,020
You're just a student, and you're taking photos with him.

181
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,020
You're just a student.

182
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,020
I'm just saying.

183
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,020
You're just a student.

184
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,020
You don't need to be so humble.

185
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,020
It's not that.

186
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,020
You're just a student.

187
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,020
You're just a student.

188
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,020
I'm just saying.

189
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,020
You're just a student.

190
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,620
Nothing.

191
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,020
Do you guys

192
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,300
like your beauty

193
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,020
so you hug her?

194
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,900
Why did she hug you?

195
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,340
We're here.

196
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,660
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,700
Why is it her again?

198
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,980
Who sent me to school

199
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,140
has nothing to do with you.

200
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,060
What does it have to do with you?

201
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,100
Classmate or friend?

202
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,860
Or a childhood friend?

203
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,420
What's wrong with her again?

204
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,660
I don't want to argue with you.

205
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:54,900
Yiming.

206
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,580
Fang Xue is here to pick you up.

207
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,720
Wake up.

208
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,560
Just relax.

209
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,240
Okay.

210
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,280
What are you doing?

211
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,220
Come closer.

212
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,180
What is this beautiful spot that

213
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,460
all three of us put together.

214
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,820
Go ahead.

215
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,900
Are I crazy?

216
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Come on.

217
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
Lin Mingxin.

218
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Wait for me at school. I'll send you back.

219
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,900
Thank you. No need.

220
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,900
Okay.

221
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Everyone, go back and review.

222
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,900
Class is over.

223
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,900
What are you going to eat?

224
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
I don't know.

225
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,900
You can take me to the cafeteria or eat outside.

226
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
I want to eat outside.

227
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
I don't want to go to the cafeteria.

228
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,900
Then what do you want to eat?

229
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Isn't there a new restaurant next door?

230
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
I want to eat.

231
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Eat that?

232
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
Go, go, go.

233
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,900
Why are you hiding from me again?

234
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
School is over.

235
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
Let's go together.

236
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
No need. Let's go.

237
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,900
Lin Mingxin.

238
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,900
You stay here.

239
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
You two go out first.

240
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,900
Wait for me.

241
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,900
I heard you never go to swimming class.

242
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,900
Is it because of your father?

243
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,900
I...

244
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
No matter what, it's wrong for you to skip class.

245
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,900
The coach should punish you for cleaning the swimming pool.

246
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,900
But I want to ask you.

247
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
Are you not going to take this grade?

248
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,900
Principal.

249
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,900
Can I use the grades of other classes?

250
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,900
Basketball, field, running, and the Lala team can all be used.

251
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,900
The wonderful is the swimming special effects.

252
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Your father has always been proud of this as a coach.

253
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
Every student who is wonderful should learn to swim.

254
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
This is also a survival skill.

255
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,900
But he fell because of drowning.

256
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,900
What do you think he would want you to do if he were here?

257
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,900
This is the door card of the swimming pool.

258
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Remember to find a good coach.

259
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Be careful.

260
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,900
Thank you, principal.

261
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Don't let other students know about this.

262
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Okay.

263
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,900
What did he say to you?

264
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
Nothing.

265
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
He just told me to study hard.

266
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Really?

267
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Yes.

268
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Then why are you hiding from me?

269
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,900
I'm not.

270
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,900
You're not?

271
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Then why are you running?

272
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,900
I'm coming.

273
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
You must have waited for a long time.

274
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,900
Put on your little helmet.

275
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,900
Let's go home.

276
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,900
Are you ready?

277
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
Let's go.
