00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You're not going to school today, are you?

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm going for a run. See you.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll wait for you to come back for dinner.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No, I'll just eat some bread.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll wait for you to come back for dinner.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The apple fell from the tree.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I want a bite.

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's like a fish swimming in the water.

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're summer, I'm the wind blowing from the beach.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why do people love things that they don't know how to search?

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The King of Blaze

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hello, teacher.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I caught a cold.

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry. I can't come to class today.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I saw you jumping around yesterday.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why are you sick so soon?

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm not sick.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Have you been to the hospital?

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Remember to open the home certificate.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Teacher, I'm telling you.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Wang Chunni.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Chen Zhu, why are you here?

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're following me again.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't talk nonsense.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I came to the hospital on the right path.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I got a good reason not to go to class.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What about you?

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I caught a cold. I came to see the doctor.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What cold?

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Is it a virus or a bacteria?

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Bacteria.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're lying. You don't have a fever.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Besides, the fever is over there.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Sports, injuries and sports can be overcome.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's the bone.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You can't go.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Make it clear.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Freshly cooked wontons, no coriander.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
A spoonful of red oil, a spoonful of sweet potato.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You still remember?

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You have a good memory.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What do you mean by memory?

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm so sweet.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can't bear to leave a person who is two years old.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What kind of new queen can I eat?

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yiming.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How are you doing recently?

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm fine.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I...

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I...

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sick.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why are you sick?

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What if you get fat?

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a waste of energy.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm not fat.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm not fat.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm not fat.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm not fat.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm not fat.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm not fat.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm not fat.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm not fat.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's a waste of energy.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's eat.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You said you had eaten before.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm here.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Thank you.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're so good at taking care of people.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Have you found a girlfriend?

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What's wrong?

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Nothing.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So the basketball team doesn't know.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When did you get hurt?

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Where did you get hurt?

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's been a while.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I left the board at the private forest.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What did the doctor say?

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Can we still play basketball?

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The doctor said

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
let me sunbathe more.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I shouldn't.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's good.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's good.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why do you care so much about me?

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I care about the basketball team.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So I care about you.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I thought you only cared about me.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're the first person who knew about this.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Remember to keep it a secret.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why can't the basketball team know?

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They know.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If they know,

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
they will force me to rest.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Jiang Bohan has been banned from the competition.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I can't not participate in the competition.

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Who asked me to play well?

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I think you can.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Add two friends.

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,280
Doctor Yan'sÃ­

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:42,980
Real

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why are you so angry?

104
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,120
This is what you said.

105
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,440
You have to sacrifice Jiang Bo Han.

106
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,800
So this is the case.

107
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,600
I'll ask you if he has disappeared.

108
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,440
Everything has a price.

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,880
What do you want me to do?

110
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,360
Isn't this something you expected?

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,040
You passed the photos of Yu Mingxi, right?

112
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,880
This time it's really not me.

113
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,600
The suspension of the class has a great impact on Yu Mingxi.

114
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,080
You want me to help Yu Mingxi?

115
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,880
Let your mother cancel the punishment for Yu Mingxi.

116
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
Let her resume her class.

117
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
Are you asking me to help her?

118
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,120
I'm not asking you to help her.

119
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm asking you to help her.

120
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Are you asking me to help her?

121
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,840
I'm begging you.

122
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,640
What's the use of helping her?

123
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,320
What do you want?

124
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
I want you to date me.

125
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,680
Give me flowers at my concert.

126
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,400
No.

127
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,560
Change one.

128
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,680
Then cancel it.

129
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,080
Wait.

130
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,040
Let's date.

131
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
But only for this one day.

132
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,160
Starting now.

133
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,880
How did Qin Xiao and Jiang Bo Han go to school together?

134
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,160
Why would they go to school together?

135
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,080
You said they were childhood friends.

136
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,920
What?

137
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,760
You asked me, who are you asking?

138
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,920
If you really are Qin Mingxuan,

139
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,800
I'll cut you off.

140
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,640
Students.

141
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,000
Today, we're going to solve a three-dimensional function

142
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,800
that can be transformed.

143
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,880
It looks simple.

144
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,840
What's going on?

145
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,760
What did I do wrong?

146
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,160
You asked me.

147
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,360
Who am I asking?

148
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,640
I don't think Boss has ever taken this class.

149
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,960
It's the life and death of Sister Fang Cheng.

150
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,600
Let me ask you a question.

151
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,600
If the parameters change,

152
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,440
will Fang Cheng's root change?

153
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,640
That is, when the parameters increase,

154
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,880
how will the root number change?

155
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,880
Then you can find its origin point.

156
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,760
The correct answer is...

157
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,600
What's going on?

158
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,360
He didn't tell me he was dating.

159
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,120
Jiang Bo Han.

160
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,440
Get up and solve this question.

161
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,800
Xuan Di.

162
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,680
Teacher.

163
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,760
Please sit down.

164
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,240
Okay, sit down.

165
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,360
Listen to me.

166
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,760
Jiang Bo Han.

167
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,080
Aren't you from Class One?

168
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,960
Teacher, he's here with me.

169
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,960
Okay, okay.

170
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,160
I can help you solve the problem.

171
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
I'll help you solve it.

172
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
I'll help you solve it.

173
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
I'll help you solve it.

174
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
I'll help you solve it.

175
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,560
It's good that you can help your classmates.

176
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,760
The one with glasses in the back,

177
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,480
come up and write down the solution.

178
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
I'm sorry, teacher.

179
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,680
I don't think I know this question.

180
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,160
Congratulations.

181
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
You succeeded in your performance.

182
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,120
Thank you.

183
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,960
Thank you.

184
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,320
Is it interesting?

185
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,320
When did you become so petty?

186
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,880
Xiao Xi.

187
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,120
It's a big discovery.

188
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,840
Jiang Bo Han and Qin Siyou

189
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,240
are childhood friends.

190
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,320
They were released at school today.

191
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,720
Look at the photos I took.

192
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,520
They're really...

193
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,120
They used to be like blood and hatred.

194
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,520
Now they're showing off their love.

195
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,720
What are you looking at?

196
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,240
Are you one of their

197
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Playboys?

198
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,840
What?

199
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,600
I didn't say anything wrong.

200
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,800
You're in love, aren't you?

201
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
How did you know?

202
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,000
Actually, I've met Jiang Bo Han before.

203
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
At that time, he was with this girl.

204
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
When?

205
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
When?

206
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Such a happy road.

207
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
No eyes.

208
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
No apology.

209
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Why?

210
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
It's wonderful.

211
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,000
No wonder you're so naughty.

212
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
What do you mean?

213
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,800
I mean

214
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,000
wonderful students

215
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,600
ride bicycles at school.

216
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Let me try.

217
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Why are you so late?

218
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,000
The show is about to start.

219
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,600
Let's go.

220
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Anyway, I just

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,200
can't stand their wonderful stuff.

222
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
What's the point of having some money?

223
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,400
I'm wonderful now.

224
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
You're different.

225
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,000
Then

226
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,200
when was that?

227
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
About

228
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,000
two years ago.

229
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,200
Two years ago, they were still fine.

230
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,800
What are you thinking about?

231
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,800
Nothing.

232
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm going to the birthday party.

233
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,400
Go?

234
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,400
Where?

235
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
The dance studio.

236
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,600
What dance studio?

237
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,900
I knew it.

238
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,800
Forget it.

239
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,400
Let's go.

240
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,200
No.

241
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,000
Yuemi.

242
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,200
Yuemi.

243
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,000
Yuemi.

244
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
It's ten kilometers.

245
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Take a break.

246
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Take a break.

247
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,400
I'm here.

248
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,800
I thought you were taking revenge.

249
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,200
Stop talking nonsense.

250
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,400
We'll have a guest later.

251
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,200
I met you on the night of the Spring Wind.

252
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
It's been the same since then.

253
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,000
It's late at night.

254
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,000
I miss you even if I don't miss you.

255
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
But

256
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
it seems to be the end of the year.

257
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,200
Jiang Bo Han.

258
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
You don't understand the situation at all.

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,800
Really?

260
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
After tonight,

261
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,200
our agreement is over.

262
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,000
So I hope

263
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,400
time will pass slowly

264
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,000
and the bus will come later.

265
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,600
You're not a girl.

266
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
I'm not a girl.

267
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,200
Miss Hui has her prince.

268
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,000
You still believe in fairy tales?

269
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Why not?

270
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,200
I think our previous life

271
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
is a fairy tale.

272
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,200
Yes.

273
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,200
Our previous life

274
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,400
is quite happy.

275
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,200
Happy things

276
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,000
are worth living for a lifetime.

277
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,200
Why are you so lazy?

278
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,800
Hi.

279
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,400
What a coincidence.

280
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,800
I just finished my performance.

281
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,600
Jiang Bo Han sent me home.

282
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,000
You are...

283
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
We're here to train.

284
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm here to train with you.

285
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,400
I won't disturb you two.

286
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,000
We're leaving.

287
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,200
Bye.

288
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,400
Bye.

289
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,200
That girl

290
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
is Zhao Bei Han?

291
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,200
You're unhappy because of her?

292
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
No.

293
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,400
You just want to know

294
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,600
what's their relationship.

295
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,600
I'll go and ask her for you.

296
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,800
Why do you disturb their date?

297
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't call me Yu Mi.

298
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,400
It's just two months.

299
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,800
It's so awkward.

300
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
I'll call you then.

301
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Xiao Xi.

302
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Ming Xi.

303
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,400
Or...

304
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,800
Baby.

305
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,800
You're so annoying.

306
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,000
How dare you call me that?
