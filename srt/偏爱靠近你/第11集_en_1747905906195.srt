Getting Squ recommends special care aid

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,420
W effect

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,780
Beware

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,100
Where is your spinal node?

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,920
This could be UK

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,180
The

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,460
Let's go!

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,080
Hurry up!

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:47,660
Primary director.

10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,300
It is not a responsibility

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,080
of those who interface with me.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,580
Aren't it better to avoid the more victims?

13
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,220
I'm doing worry!

14
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,180
Yes.

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,120
I am that girl.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,060
Why yourself?

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,160
I'm taking you for a delicious dinner.

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,940
Okay.

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,140
Let's go.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,940
What was that again?

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,200
When I think of you

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,200
I will look at the clock on the wall with a daze

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I walked quietly

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,200
and fell into the life in the idol drama

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:48,200
You are the bird and I am the apple that fell from the tree

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:55,200
I want to bite you like a fish that lives in the water

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:05,200
You are the summer and I am the wind that blows from the beach

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Why is love so hot that no one knows how to escape

29
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Summer Shop

30
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
The summer shop looks expensive

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Let's change a house

32
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
I'll pay today

33
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,200
You help me to pay the rent, I'll pay you

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Next time

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
I just want to take you to this house

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,920
they are Egg

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,900
頭 changes

38
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,120
Xiaоream

39
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,220
Cai Mengai, I treat myself so nice

40
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,740
My mother is about to come

41
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,020
I can't ask her

42
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,060
I'll call her

43
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,700
You don't need

44
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,820
Panormity is so scary

45
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,420
The relationship between my mom and me

46
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,420
I don't think it will get better.

47
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,420
But I don't want you to fight because of me.

48
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,420
You're thinking too much.

49
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,420
How am I thinking too much? That's your mother.

50
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,420
Are you eating or not?

51
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,420
I...

52
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,420
I ate too much bread and I'm hungry. I won't be able to eat it later.

53
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,420
Bread in front of a meal is the best.

54
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,420
Okay.

55
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,420
This is the Filet-O-Fish steak you ordered.

56
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,420
It's five-piece. It's a ten-year-old fish sauce.

57
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,420
Okay, thank you.

58
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,420
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,420
Try it.

60
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,420
It doesn't look bad.

61
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,420
It tastes really good.

62
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,420
Okay.

63
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,420
Try it.

64
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,420
Do you want to taste it?

65
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,420
What are you doing?

66
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,420
I'm just trying to make it taste better.

67
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,420
That's the first time I've written a love letter.

68
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,420
I don't know what it is.

69
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,420
That's the first time I wrote a love letter.

70
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,420
I'm very honored.

71
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,420
But it was written for you.

72
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,420
It took me a lot of effort.

73
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,420
Good writing.

74
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Almost touched me.

75
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,420
Who can touch you?

76
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,420
Iron heart.

77
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,420
Isn't it you who has an iron heart?

78
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,420
Isn't it you?

79
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,420
Thank you, Jiang Bo Han.

80
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,420
You're welcome, Yu Min Xi.

81
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,420
If my result in this exam is improved,

82
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,420
you owe me, then you pay me back.

83
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,420
What if I don't want to pay you back?

84
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,420
What?

85
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
Fine.

86
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,420
Even if I pay you back,

87
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,420
then next,

88
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,420
it's your turn to owe me.

89
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,420
What do I owe you?

90
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,420
Don't you know what you owe me?

91
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,420
Take your time, kid.

92
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,420
Wait for me.

93
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,420
Water, pressure, passion.

94
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,420
Anticipate, hope, hope.

95
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,420
Infatuation, heart, obsession.

96
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,420
Today, I'm going to tell you

97
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,420
the truth about you.

98
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
I'm going to tell you

99
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,420
the truth about you.

100
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,420
Today's task is completed.

101
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,420
Good job.

102
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
I'll考你 tomorrow.

103
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
Thank you, Jiang Bo Han.

104
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,420
You treated me to a meal today

105
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,420
and came home with me.

106
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
I taught you for so long

107
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,420
and you still call me by my name?

108
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,420
What else can I call you?

109
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
You're pretending to be silly, aren't you?

110
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,420
Teacher Jiang.

111
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,420
Teacher Jiang.

112
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
That's more like it.

113
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,420
Call me again.

114
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,420
Teacher Jiang.

115
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,420
Why are you calling me teacher?

116
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,420
Jiang Bo Han.

117
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,420
Jiang Bo Han.

118
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
Stop right there. Don't run.

119
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,420
Jiang Bo Han.

120
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,420
Let me see.

121
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,420
Done.

122
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,420
If you don't come out, the sun will go down.

123
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,420
I've been working on the new product for five hours.

124
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,420
I didn't get lazy.

125
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420
What flavor is this?

126
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,420
I'm really lucky.

127
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,420
Your favorite, blueberry milk.

128
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,420
I need this treatment on my birthday.

129
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,420
I'll have to think about it.

130
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,420
What are you talking about?

131
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,420
I don't dare.

132
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,420
Make a wish.

133
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,420
This is good.

134
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,420
Come here.

135
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,420
Close your eyes.

136
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,420
You make a wish. Why should we close our eyes?

137
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,420
That's right.

138
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,420
If I ask you to close your eyes, you should close them.

139
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,420
You two are really little kids.

140
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,420
How old are you? You're still a kid.

141
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,420
Come on. I'll kiss you.

142
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,420
It's over.

143
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,420
How about this?

144
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,420
I'll buy you a drink.

145
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,420
You're not a kid anymore?

146
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,420
You...

147
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:37,420
If time can stop, I hope I can stay forever.

148
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,420
If my birthday wish can come true, I hope we can be happy like now forever.

149
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:55,420
I wish the wind seems to come and make me feel you.

150
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:04,420
Fighting for things so far unseen, but sure to let me see you.

151
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
I'm listening to a song.

152
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,420
I don't want you to interfere.

153
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,420
Who's so unobtrusive that they're bothering our big miss again?

154
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,420
The New York cake shop you like is opening in Beijing.

155
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,420
It's your birthday soon. I'll ask someone to get one.

156
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,420
What flavor do you want? Blueberry, roulade, or something else?

157
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,420
Who wants to eat cake?

158
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,420
The competition is about to begin. I want to control my weight.

159
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,420
Okay, okay, okay. I won't eat cake.

160
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,420
Yan Zhenwen, you've been watching over the People's Theater for me recently.

161
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,420
I know.

162
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,420
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,420
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,420
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,420
I'm sorry.

166
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,420
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,420
Yu Mingxi!

168
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,420
The history of chemistry is all here.

169
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,420
Thank you.

170
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,420
I'll give you my teacher Jiang.

171
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
Give me.

172
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,420
Stop!

173
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,420
Give it to me or not?

174
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,420
Here you go.

175
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,420
Thank you. Bye.

176
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,420
Bye.

177
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,420
Let's go, Uncle Chen.

178
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,420
Come on, let me see.

179
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,420
Let me see.

180
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,420
It's sweet.

181
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,420
I can't let Yao Yao see Jiang Bohan's face.

182
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,420
This one won't work.

183
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,420
Why are you looking for me?

184
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
I prepared a gift for you.

185
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,420
What gift?

186
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,420
Let me see.

187
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,420
You're right.

188
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,420
This is really not easy.

189
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,420
I have a wish.

190
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
What?

191
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
To make Yu Mingxi disappear.

192
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,420
This is not difficult.

193
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
But I have one condition.

194
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,420
Say it.

195
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,420
You have to let Jiang Bohan go.

196
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
What do you mean?

197
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,420
I'm just asking if you're willing.

198
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,420
Are you?

199
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,420
Why are you asking?

200
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,420
I didn't mean wrongly.

201
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,420
I got it.

202
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,420
Xiaxi, you're finally here.

203
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,420
Something serious happened.

204
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,420
What?

205
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,420
Did the successors find us together?

206
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,420
What happened?

207
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,420
Look!

208
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,420
It's said that King indicated his favor.

209
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,420
assassinate ______.

210
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:39,960
Okay.

211
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,320
Go ,¥ jog and meet me once more and

212
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,500
when i see you later.

213
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,400
You must notice this.

214
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,540
While Lin shen just visited the house,

215
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,300
Cor conception school had no activity something to do

216
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,140
It started from yesterday.

217
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,120
I don't think he'll be aware.

218
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,580
There's some trouble.

219
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,660
I want you to find a skill teacher

220
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,560
who have been in charge of me since past.

221
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,240
Now you've got upgraded to a school,

222
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,760
It's gonna be hard.

223
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,620
I don't want to hate other students.

224
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,340
and

225
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,980
Are you worried about him?

226
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,980
It's the current trend.

227
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,380
The media only likes to use the subject to make a fuss.

228
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,140
If the school doesn't handle this matter,

229
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,420
how will the media report it?

230
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,420
What will the parents think?

231
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,820
This is the critical moment of recruitment.

232
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,140
Can you take responsibility for the result alone?

233
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,100
I believe in his power.

234
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,460
What happened?

235
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,020
He'll come in a bit and we'll know.

236
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,420
I'll let the PR Department make a statement

237
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,020
to clarify the facts.

238
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,820
Do you know about his relationship with the school?

239
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,020
You're just defending him like this?

240
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,820
I forgot to tell you something.

241
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,020
About the fight between Jiang Bohan last time,

242
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,220
although I asked someone to withdraw from the hot search,

243
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,620
he was also in the video that was posted.

244
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,220
What does that have to do with this?

245
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,420
Did you not understand what I said?

246
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,020
Yu Mingxi can't represent Jingcai.

247
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,220
Jingcai is the image outside right now.

248
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,620
He must be investigated immediately.

249
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,220
Or else,

250
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,420
I can't hide the matter about Jiang Bohan.

251
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,820
If you insist on doing this to satisfy him,

252
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
then let's do it this way.

253
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,100
экспable

254
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,060
What's going on?

255
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,820
You must believe me, I was not clothed.

256
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,420
I believe you,

257
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,700
but you must tell me the true person behind this.

258
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,340
Who's in your car?

259
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,180
I can't say.

260
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,020
Why?

261
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,420
Because I don't want to lie.

262
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,260
If you don't say it clearly then how do I help you?

263
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,920
nourish your heart

264
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,440
So your missed

265
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,120
was like anoyu

266
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:25,700
tú

267
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,920
ыв

268
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:31,880
Ga

269
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,900
method.

270
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,420
Such a slow DC

271
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
I'll take one anyone can buy

272
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,740
What about you?

273
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,680
Just buy me one

274
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,260
No one can buy you, just buy me one

275
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,180
Then what about my work

276
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,080
Line up

277
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,640
and buy me one

278
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,860
No one can buy you

279
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,700
No one can buy me
