00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,800
You're really a soul-seeker.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,400
I told you. I'll hit you once.

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,000
I'll hit you until you're dead.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,800
I didn't expect you, Yan Zhenwen,

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,800
to be so talkative.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,800
What nonsense?

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,600
What are you doing?

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,800
Why are you bullying a man?

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,400
Kid, go home after school.

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,600
Don't look for trouble.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,800
You're not allowed to fight.

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,600
If you fight again, I'll call the police.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,800
You're not leaving?

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,800
If you don't leave, I'll beat you up.

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,200
You're not leaving?

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
I'll beat you up.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,800
You're not leaving?

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,400
I'll beat you up.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll beat you up.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
You're not leaving?

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,000
You're not leaving?

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,800
I'll beat you up.

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Run!

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,600
Go!

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,800
I can't stand here!

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,800
This way.

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Get up.

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,200
Where are you?

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
Are you a sportsman?

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,600
How do you know?

32
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,800
You've been fighting for so long and running for so long.

33
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,200
You don't look tired at all.

34
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,000
Are you a sportsman too?

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm not.

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,800
But I've been preparing for a competition related to sports.

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
What competition?

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
A marathon.

39
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,800
A marathon?

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
I'm not a sportsman.

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm not a sportsman.

42
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,200
I'm not a sportsman.

43
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,800
I'm not a sportsman.

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,200
A marathon.

45
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,400
You're small, but you can run a marathon?

46
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,800
Who are you looking down on?

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,200
I helped you just now, okay?

48
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,800
Did you help me?

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,400
How come I don't know?

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,200
I...

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,200
Enough.

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Just treat it as you helped me just now.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
What's your name?

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,000
Hello, I'm Yu Mingxin.

56
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,600
Zhang Mohan.

57
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,000
Zhang Mohan.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Zhang Mohan.

59
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,200
What's wrong?

60
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,000
Why didn't you call the police?

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,400
Forget it. I won't do it again.

62
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,800
What do you want to do next time?

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,200
Without me, you wouldn't be so lucky.

64
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,600
Yan Zheng Wen wouldn't do anything to me.

65
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,200
You know each other?

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,000
You can say that.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,400
Then you two should have a good chat.

68
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,000
You can't always fight.

69
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
You're quite worried.

70
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,000
No matter what, after school,

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,200
I have to hurry home.

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,400
Didn't your mom tell you?

73
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,000
She told me.

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,000
By the way, you just got a serious injury.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,200
Do you want to go to the hospital?

76
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,800
No, I'll be fine in a few days.

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,400
It was just a bruise on my behalf.

78
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
It's okay.

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
You have a loss.

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
We can just call it a draw.

81
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,000
No need to feel guilty.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,200
What loss?

83
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,400
Didn't you lose your meal?

84
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,600
You just said you lost it.

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,000
My meal...

86
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
When country become like this,

87
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Don't forget you.

88
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,800
You should have put up yours, too.

89
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,000
You meant-

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,400
the things my dad told me?

91
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Yes.

92
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,760
If you vraiment have to worry,

93
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,160
come over here.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I miss you

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I will look at the clock on the wall

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
When I walk on the street

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I fall into the life in the idol drama

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You are the cow, I am the snake

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I am the snake

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You are the cow, I am the apple that fell from the tree

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I want to eat it like a fish living in the water

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You are the summer, I am the wind that blows from the beach

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Why do people not know how to search for love?

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
When I wrote this love letter, I felt the tenderness in my heart

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can't stand the secrets in my heart anymore

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I have to confess to you

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I love you deeply

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I am never good at faking

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can't hide the love of a person

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No matter what decision you make

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I will respect and cherish your decision

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So my mouth is strawberry

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Do you want to taste it?

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You are really the best in writing

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You are so good at writing love letters

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I just use all the lessons I learned in my life

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
My love letter is a great success

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's a pity that I don't give you time to confess

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No, don't bring me with you

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
My goal is to study hard and improve every day

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You are so smart

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I just want to send my first kiss before I graduate from college

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I want to fall in love

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't know what it feels like to fall in love

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't know either

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Here, you can send a gift if you write a name

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But who are you going to give it to?

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Of course, the basketball team

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You are so good

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You are so talented

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Lin Shaoyang

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Come on

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Lin Shaoyang

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Come on

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Lin Shaoyang

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Which young man is Yang?

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Young man, young man, he is Yang

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Hello, Uncle He

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Hello, Uncle He

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hello, Uncle He

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000

Hello, Uncle He

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hello, Uncle He

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What?

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Jackie Chan

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Jackie Chan

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Come on

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Jackie Chan

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Come on

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Jiang Bo Han

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Jiang Bo Han

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Come on

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I want to know what to do

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Jiang Bo Han

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Come on

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Come on

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Jiang Bo Han

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Come on

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Come on

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let go

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Let go

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Xiao Xi.

166
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
I've changed my mind.

167
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,240
I like Jiang Bohan more.

168
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Basketball captain.

169
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
A brilliant student.

170
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,800
Basketball genius.

171
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,720
Jiang.

172
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,040
Bohan.

173
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,000
Hello, I'm a star.

174
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,640
Jiang Bohan.

175
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,200
Xiao Xi.

176
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,160
Xiao Xi.

177
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,800
Jiang Bohan just looked at me.

178
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,520
What does he mean?

179
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,640
Is it possible that you just shouted too loudly?

180
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,240
Xu Mingxi.

181
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,720
I've decided.

182
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,720
Write Jiang Bohan a love letter.

183
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,800
I've already written a good name for him.

184
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,080
I have a pen and paper.

185
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,760
I can't see it on the screen.

186
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,280
It's not good.

187
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,440
I can take it.

188
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,440
Okay.

189
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,720
Okay.

190
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,240
Let's go.

191
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,200
They'll be here soon.

192
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Just go straight.

193
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,640
I'm afraid I can't see it.

194
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,440
It's okay.

195
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,320
Trust me.

196
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,120
You...

197
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,360
Come on.

198
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Hurry up.

199
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,080
There are two girls ahead.

200
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,760
Are they going to send a love letter to boss again?

201
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,000
There are too many people at the school gate today.

202
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,960
I dare not.

203
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,000
I'll do my best to avoid making a big deal.

204
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,600
Here.

205
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
My stomach hurts.

206
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,600
I'll go first.

207
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,360
Come back.

208
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,080
No.

209
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,720
Come back.

210
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,000
I guess the girl with short hair...

211
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,120
is a sportsman.

212
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,000
She's not.

213
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,000
You want to know?

214
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,040
Go and ask her.

215
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,200
What?

216
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,120
Say something.

217
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,240
What?

218
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,320
Roasted sausage with soy milk.

219
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,200
Roasted sausage with soy milk?

220
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,680
When did boss like roasted sausage?

221
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,360
Tell me.

222
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,320
Why are you so shy

223
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,720
in such a good situation?

224
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,360
I'm really satisfied.

225
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,520
A man who loves a woman

226
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,160
is not a man who doesn't love her.

227
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,800
Isn't that a rejection?

228
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,680
You're an artist.

229
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,320
You're brave to say that you love a woman.

230
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,840
You don't know me.

231
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,560
I've written the love letter.

232
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,360
Why did I write it for nothing?

233
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,600
Just send it.

234
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,400
I'll definitely send it.

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,640
Xiao Xi.

236
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
I think you're right.

237
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,720
It's not good to change the love letter with a pen.

238
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,840
Can you write it again?

239
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,800
I've given you my file.

240
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,560
Isn't it more sincere to write it yourself?

241
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,400
You wrote it yourself.

242
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,760
I'm really interested in it.

243
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,120
But Niannian.

244
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,680
You like Jiang Bohan so much.

245
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Do you know him?

246
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,400
I know him.

247
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,000
Jiang Bohan.

248
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,640
He's 186 cm tall.

249
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,800
He weighs 140 kg.

250
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,000
He's 53 cm tall.

251
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,000
He's 100 cm tall.

252
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,760
He's handsome and has a good family background.

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,840
He's never lost a basketball game.

254
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,840
Where did you hear about this?

255
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,440
I'm a teacher at a school.

256
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,000
You know him so well.

257
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,000
It seems that you really like Jiang Bohan.

258
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,560
Of course I like him.

259
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,880
I also know Lin Shao Yang.

260
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,840
He's a good uncle.

261
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,840
He's a good son.

262
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,840
Do you want to know?

263
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,200
No, thank you.

264
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,160
But Niannian.

265
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,440
I want to tell you something.

266
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,800
Jiang Bohan's social relationship

267
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,840
may be a little complicated.

268
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,160
How is it complicated?

269
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,440
When I first came to school.

270
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,240
The following news.

271
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,120
Last night, in the social crowd of the 50th anniversary of the incident,

272
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
it is said that students from the wonderful international school

273
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,280
were involved in it.

274
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,320
Three students were beaten by society.

275
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,160
The society is widely concerned.

276
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,800
The school has reported the situation to relevant departments.

277
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,280
The incident is being investigated.

278
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,000
The subsequent case will continue to be paid attention.

279
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,400
It's nonsense.

280
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,160
The wonderful and many years of reputation

281
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,400
has been ruined by this.

282
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,400
How can I explain to the school next week?

283
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,560
Principal.

284
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,120
Principal, please be careful.

285
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,720
When the case is investigated clearly,

286
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,560
there will be a misunderstanding in our competition.

287
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,920
You said you were the first year.

288
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,880
How dare you fight with Xiao Huan?

289
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,520
It's a joke.

290
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,560
Yes, yes, yes.

291
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,480
Principal is right.

292
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,320
Remember.

293
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,560
Jiang Bohan's name must be kept secret.

294
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,560
You can't have anything to do with this.

295
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,560
It's too much.

296
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,760
The school is also attacking.

297
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
The enemy is also attacking.

298
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,760
Fighting is fighting.

299
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,120
Outsiders don't care so much.

300
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,440
What time is it?

301
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,440
The student who transferred to our school today

302
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
hasn't come yet?

303
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,080
Report.

304
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,720
Report.

305
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,160
Hello, principal.

306
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm Yu Mingxi.

307
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Is he the one in the school news?

308
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,120
Jiang Bohan should be very handsome.

309
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,720
No.

310
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,560
I should go.

311
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,000
Where are you going?

312
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,920
I'm going to school.

313
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,680
Go, go, go.

314
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,560
Xiao Zhi,

315
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,880
remember to help me learn the chess.

316
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,400

you are the leading exhausting teacher with strong black hair.

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,680
so you didn't attain it.

323
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,200
I was helping pretty heavily.

324
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,240
What?

325
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Be charming?

326
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,480
I really like you.

327
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,560

You should rest. You have class tomorrow.

331
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,080
Manager, I was waiting for you.

332
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
A scholarship?

333
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,080
It's a good scholarship. How can you apply for a scholarship?

334
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,080
I just wanted to try.

335
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
You don't want to apply?

336
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Not this time.

337
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,080
I ran out of shoes and wanted to buy a new pair.

338
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
Are you really going to our store?

339
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
I thought you were talking about my son.

340
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Of course I'm going.

341
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
When?

342
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,080
Two months later.

343
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Okay, I'll give you a scholarship then.

344
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
That's interesting.

345
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
By the way, manager.

346
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,080
Do you still have the part-time job for the delivery order?

347
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,080
How about I go to school tomorrow and give our delivery order a promotion?

348
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
Delivery orders are not profitable.

349
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,080
The meat of the restaurant is small, but it's meat.

350
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,080
So much money?

351
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
Okay.

352
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
Try it.

353
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
Thank you, manager. I'll go first.

354
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
Wait a minute.

355
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Take these snacks.

356
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,080
Remember, you can't eat the same food tomorrow.

357
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
It's just expired. It's very fresh.

358
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,080
You can eat it the day after tomorrow.

359
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Uncle said you can't waste food.

360
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Keep it a secret.

361
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
Bye.

362
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Go home.

363
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
We finally won.

364
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Go to celebrate later.

365
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
Three points is a win.

366
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
Continue practicing.

367
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Boss, I just finished the game.

368
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
I have to rest for a while.

369
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
I'm a little tired.

370
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
I'm tired.

371
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
The convenience store has a new discount.

372
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
I'll buy you a delivery.

373
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
No need. Thank you.

374
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
How about I get one for you?

375
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
I said no need.

376
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,080
You haven't seen it yet.

377
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
How do you know if it's useful?

378
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,080
We are going to practice.

379
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Why don't you stay by the school for a while?

380
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
I'm afraid you'll get tired.

381
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,080
I don't want to.

382
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,080
Come back.

383
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,080
Come back.

384
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
I said...

385
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
Go out. Be careful.

386
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
Be careful.

387
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Go out.
