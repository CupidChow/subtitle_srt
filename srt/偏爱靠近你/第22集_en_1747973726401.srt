1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I've just a stand where I stand

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Never a step that I took was to walk to you

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Sister Xu, why are you back?

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If I'm not back, I don't know if you're going through the storm

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't tease me

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I know you're a good guy, but you have to be careful

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The body of the athlete is the most precious

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is for you

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You see LA sent it

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's been more than a year

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is your last chance

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You're my mom, right?

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Who sent me here?

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Isn't this your dream?

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't give up your future because of anyone

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll think about it

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Tell me

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
How's your marriage life?

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not sure

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How's your marriage life?

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How can I? Of course it's good

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But I heard you have a new situation recently

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
When did you let me meet that girl?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I really want to know who can take our Young Master Jiang down

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't talk about me

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You talk about yourself

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You didn't do it for love

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You're still going abroad to get married

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm not back now?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Did you give up your position and regret it?

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I regret it

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I didn't finish my studies without regret

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't go back now

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You said that because you wanted to persuade me

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I think your friend circle is very smooth

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Your friend circle is smooth

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What about your sister?

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She didn't come back with you this time

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
She has other things

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
When you are waiting for you

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You will be looking forward to the end of your dream

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You can walk

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You can enter the idol drama

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You are the one who has me

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You are the apple that falls off

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
There is a hook

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Like a fish living in the water

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You are summer, I am the one

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The wind that blows in the sea

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why is love so hot?

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How to walk?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The 2020 Le Ang Bay autumn half-time marathon

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
will be held in Wuhan on October 27

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The winner of this competition is announced

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The result will be announced at the end of the month

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Xiao Xi

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What are you looking at?

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Just running

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You've seen this pair many times

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How about I help you choose?

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Actually I have chosen it

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Then buy it

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's not the end yet

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Wait for the result to come out

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What are you talking about?

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Look, this looks delicious

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They make the cake with the money

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's more than 20 times

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's eat it too

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But it doesn't look very cheap

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm asking you

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No, it's simple

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you really want to eat it, I'll go with you

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Really?

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hello

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Xiao Xi, you finally come back

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I heard your tone

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Why are you here to tell me?

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Tell me

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What's wrong with Uncle Jiang?

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Uncle Jiang has been lost by the school

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The school's students

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Because he doesn't talk to us

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Is it that serious?

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Then Uncle Jiang doesn't want to go abroad

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Is it for him?

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Actually I don't quite understand

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why does Uncle Jiang suddenly want to go abroad?

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
After Boyang left

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He is like a enemy to me

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No matter what

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The team has given him the last pass

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is his last chance

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Xiao Xi, you must persuade him

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Can't let him give up his future for others

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I will talk to him

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But he is an adult

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We have to respect his own will

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let him arrange his own life

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He is in a head-on

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If he missed this opportunity

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He will regret it forever

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I prepared a surprise for you

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I will bring it to you later

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What's wrong?

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What's wrong?

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Brother Jie, are you confessing?

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Are you serious?

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You are a liar

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I didn't see it before

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You are a forbidden play

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You can't give up your money

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Shut up

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't know

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't know

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Shut up

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I will arrange it for you

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Tell me the truth

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You are a liar

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You don't understand

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You are a soldier

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I know

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hello, good afternoon, students

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Welcome to my sharing meeting

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Some of you may not know me

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You can call me Zi Hui

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Today I want to share some of my study experience

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I hope I can provide some help to you in the future

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Let's watch a video first

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I have some requirements such as academic performance

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Language proficiency

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Standardized exams

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Congratulations on the achievement made

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Next time if you have any questions

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You can ask me

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What is it?

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Miss, can I ask you any questions?

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Of course

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But I will answer any questions

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, then

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
How do you confess to your favorite girl?

147
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It depends on what kind of girl she is

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But I think no matter what she is

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The most important thing is the truth

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay, who are you going to confess to?

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No, no

152
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I am asking you a friend's question

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Any questions?

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's your birthday today

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I ordered a dinner for you

156
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You can come over here

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Thank you

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No need

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But you haven't had a baby for two years

160
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You are finally back

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You have to refuse

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I said no need

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If you want to

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You can ask me

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No need to say

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Anyone else?

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How long will you stay?

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
About a month

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Okay, that's all for today

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Thank you

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Long time no see

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
How are you?

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Isn't the life abroad like that?

174
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Qianxiang, why do you want my cake?

175
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Cake?

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Sorry, I thought it was some rubbish

177
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You did it on purpose

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Don't waste your time

179
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Jiangbo doesn't like this kind of little tricks

180
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What are you talking about?

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I am just a cake

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
How much? I will pay you when I get there

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Don't leave, I want to be clear

184
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I have nothing to say to you

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You are a wild man

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Qianxiang, you are bothering me

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Lin Yunxi

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let go

189
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Let go

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You go first

191
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let go

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Jiangbo, you are a wild man

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You are just a wild man

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What are you talking about? You said I am a cake

195
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You even pushed me

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You are not even my girlfriend

197
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Okay, I will pay you

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You pay me first

199
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Here you are

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You can wear it

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You pay me first

202
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay, how much?

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
How much?

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I will pay you

205
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I did it myself

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You pay me the same as Yimou

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You did it, it is more unworthy

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You pay me the same as Yimou

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You pay me the same as Yimou

210
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You pay me the same as Yimou

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You pay me the same as Yimou

212
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Don't pull me

213
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Here you are

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Don't be too much

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I will pay you the same as Yimou

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
None of your business

217
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This cake was made by Xiaoxi

218
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Not for Jiang Mohan

219
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He is smart

220
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
He is more smart

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What about you?

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You have been in the basketball team

223
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You think you are not annoying

224
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You are also a Jiang Mohan

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What right do you have to say that?

226
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I am more qualified than you

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You don't have to be so angry

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I am not

229
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Your temper is so bad

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You are more annoying

231
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I feel better

232
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Your dance is so bad

233
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You are not good at managing your body

234
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Are you ashamed to eat cake?

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I have never seen a girl like you

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Every day except pretending to be cute

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What else do you do?

238
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No one will like you

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Chen Siyou, don't be too much

240
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Are you okay?

241
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I am fine

242
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I am fine

243
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Where are you going?

244
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Let go

245
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's my fault

246
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Why did you pull me out?

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I didn't pull you

248
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I pulled Qin Siyou

249
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Fine, I will pull you out

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I haven't told you

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What is your temper with me?

252
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What is your temper with me?

253
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What is your relationship with Youjin?

254
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Why does he live in your house every day?

255
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Didn't I say that before?

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You can beat up your brother

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and fight with him every day

258
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We don't fight with him

259
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You are the one who fights with him

260
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Fine, I will tell you the truth

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I see you are happy

262
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
when you are together

263
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I am not saying that you are worried about your heart

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't care about you

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You are not...

266
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You are not happy

267
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Tell me clearly

268
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What is our relationship?

269
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We are not

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You don't want to say it?

271
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Forget it, I am tired

272
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Xiao Mohan

273
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I like you

274
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I will think about it

275
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Are you jealous?

276
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't need to change my shoes

277
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Youjin

278
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Youjin

279
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think

280
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
she was too nervous when she left

281
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and she was so cold

282
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's okay

283
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
She is quite stubborn

284
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Where did she go?

285
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
She went to the outside to play

286
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
She might come back in a few days

287
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Why did you stop?

288
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I am old and I will be fine

289
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Wait for me

290
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You sent the cake to Wang Shunian

291
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You made it yourself?

292
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yes, I made it

293
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But I can't think of it

294
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't mind it

295
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
How can I mind it?

296
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's delicious

297
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Come here

298
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I want to eat

299
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I am hungry

300
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I will eat

301
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I am hungry

302
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I am hungry

303
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I am hungry

304
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I am hungry

305
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I am hungry

306
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I am hungry
