00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You look handsome today.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
When am I not?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What do you mean?

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,560
Jiang Jing'an

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What are you doing?

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,000
unexpected

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Me?

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Me?

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Go to see my sister!

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
Do you like it?

13
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,040
It's a pity that it will be sold out tomorrow.

14
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,920
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

15
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,360
This flower won't be sold tomorrow.

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,360
It won't be sold in the future.

17
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,120
Why did you give me roses?

18
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,600
You're so mean.

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,360
Have you heard the story of the little prince and the rose?

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,360
When I think of you,

21
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,360
I look at the clock on the wall.

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
I walked down the street,

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,360
and I fell into the life in the idol drama.

24
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,360
You are the bird, I am the god.

25
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,360
The apple fell from the tree.

26
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
I want to eat it.

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,360
It's like a fish living in the water.

28
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,360
You are summer, I am the wind

29
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,360
blowing from the beach.

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,360
I don't understand why idol is so popular.

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,360
I don't know how to search.

32
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Episode 2

33
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Sorry, the number you dialed is not available for the moment.

34
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Please call again later.

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Sorry, the number you dialed is not available for the moment.

36
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Why isn't he answering the phone?

37
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Please call again later.

38
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Sorry, the number you dialed is not available for the moment.

39
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Niannian.

40
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Xiao Xi, where are you?

41
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
I'm almost there.

42
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
I'm almost there.

43
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Wait for me.

44
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Yunmin, come down.

45
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
My meeting is going to be late.

46
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
You Jing Chu?

47
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Jiang Bohan is late.

48
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
I'll send you there.

49
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Coming.

50
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Coming.

51
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Go.

52
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
I'm a little nervous.

53
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
It's okay.

54
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
You look good today.

55
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Go.

56
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
I'll come and see you.

57
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
I'm leaving then.

58
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Bye.

59
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
It's you.

60
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
It's you.

61
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
It's what you said.

62
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Do you still remember?

63
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Do you still care?

64
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,360
I want to go back to that moment.

65
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
Hold your hand and don't let go.

66
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,360
Can our story continue?

67
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Can it continue?

71
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
This ugly duck has become a swan.

72
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm talking to you.

73
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Why are you so rude?

74
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
I thought you were screaming.

75
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
You.

76
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Shut up.

77
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
You look good today.

78
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Thank you.

79
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,360
But it's good to look good.

80
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,360
It's just that I feel like something is missing.

81
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
It's not the same as us.

82
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,360
But I can help you.

83
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
This one is pretty.

84
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
What are you doing?

85
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
Don't be nervous.

86
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,360
I just think that as Jiang Bohan's dance partner,

87
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,360
you should be worthy of her in her outfit.

88
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
This is Ou Bai.

89
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Isn't she pretty?

90
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,360
In the past, her dance partner was me.

91
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
But now, she's my dance partner.

92
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
I'm not going to be able to do that.

93
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
I'm going to be the dance partner.

94
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
I'm going to be the dance partner.

95
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
I'm going to be the dance partner.

96
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
In the past, her dance partner was me.

97
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Now it's your turn.

98
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
You have to dance well.

99
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Don't embarrass her.

100
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
I'm doing this for your own good.

101
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
I don't mean anything else.

102
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Thank you, Qin Xiao.

103
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
But what about Jiang Bohan?

104
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Did he just turn back on the clock?

105
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Then you don't have to worry.

106
00:07:49,360 --> 00:08:15,360
JuMUSIC

107
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Half chicken in half a month

108
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
You bought new shoes?

109
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
This is your favorite pair.

110
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Didn't you give this to me?

111
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
No.

112
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Who is that?

113
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
Jiang Bohan.

114
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Didn't he go to pick you up?

115
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
He...

116
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Maybe he has something to do.

117
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Is it good?

118
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,360
It's good.

119
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Good evening, everyone.

120
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
In this starry night,

121
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
the moonlight is like water.

122
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
We gather in a hall

123
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
to celebrate this dance party.

124
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
This is the meeting point of dreams and youth.

125
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
It's a meeting point of friendship and passion.

126
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Let's release the energy of youth

127
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,360
in the rhythm of the dance.

128
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Enjoy this wonderful night.

129
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Wang Chunian.

130
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Do you want to dance?

131
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Can your knees dance?

132
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
The second word is fine.

133
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
Go.

134
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
The third word is fine.

135
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Go.

136
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
The fourth word is fine.

137
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
Go.

138
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,360
The fifth word is fine.

139
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Go.

140
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
The sixth word is fine.

141
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Go.

142
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,360
The seventh word is fine.

143
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Go.

144
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
The seventh word is fine.

145
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Go.

146
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,360
The seventh word is fine.

147
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Go.

148
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
The seventh word is fine.

149
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Go.

150
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
The seventh word is fine.

151
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Go.

152
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,360
The seventh word is fine.

153
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Go.

154
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,360
The seventh word is fine.

155
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Go.

156
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,360
The seventh word is fine.

157
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
Go.

158
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
The seventh word is fine.

159
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Go.

160
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
The seventh word is fine.

161
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Go.

162
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
The seventh word is fine.

163
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
Go.

164
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
The seventh word is fine.

165
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Go.

166
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,360
I was his dance partner every year.

167
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Now it's your turn.

168
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
You have to dance well.

169
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
Don't embarrass him.

170
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Maybe I'm not your dance partner.

171
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Where are you going?

172
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
Why are you so late?

173
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Sorry.

174
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
I'm a little late.

175
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
What's wrong?

176
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
It doesn't matter.

177
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Let's go in.

178
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Look, Jiang Bo Han is here.

179
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Let's go.

180
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Boss, why is Chen Chen here?

181
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
Didn't you say Jiang Bo Han wouldn't come?

182
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Jiang Bo Han's dance partner was Sister Xiaoxiao.

183
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,360
She's not a Yuminxi.

184
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
She doesn't deserve him.

185
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Right.

186
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
But without Jiang Bo Han,

187
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
will Sister Xiaoxiao get the prom queen?

188
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,360
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360

197
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360

199
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360

00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,360
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
I'm sorry.

226
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360

I'm sorry.

230
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,000
So pretty.

231
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,840
There are enblambles.

232
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,500
You are so pretty.

233
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,020
Stop it.

234
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,020
Look at the smile.

235
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,480
How can you be enblambled?

236
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,180
So pretty.

237
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,420
So charming.

238
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,400
You have a beauty mark on your face.

239
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,880
Really

240
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So attractive.

241
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
So naughty.

242
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,840
Why is he going up again?

243
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,600
What's that?

244
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,360
He really wants to compete with Qin Siyou.

245
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,120
Yu Mingxi is going to perform a dance for everyone.

246
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,920
Let's go.

247
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,640
He really thinks he's the boss.

248
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,680
He's nothing without Jiang Guohan.

249
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
He's just a clown.

250
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,840
Exactly.

251
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,400
Help me hold it.

252
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,600
Where's the music?

253
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,760
Play the music.

254
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,800
Yu Mingxi is going to perform.

255
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,840
This is not for them?

256
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,200
In that case, play some music.

257
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I've been waiting for all my life

258
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Today is the day I've been waiting for

259
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Waiting for all my life

260
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I've been waiting for all my life

261
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Waiting for all my life

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What are you thinking about?

263
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Nothing

264
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm just thinking about the dance party today

265
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Today, you really make me look forward to it

266
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Thank you

267
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Thank you

268
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Just now, Qin Xiao and Yan Zhen were too violent

269
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Such a romantic moment

270
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You mentioned them to me

271
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I just sighed

272
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
They

273
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You're not envious of them, are you?

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Envy

275
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Isn't it just a kiss?

276
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
This is not a difficult thing

277
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What did you say?

278
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What did you say?

279
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What are you thinking about?

280
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You're home so fast

281
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What else have you got to say?

282
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Today, I'll be the prom queen for the dance party

283
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You'll be prom queen

284
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Thank you, Jiang BaHan

285
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Calling me by my last name again

286
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Thank you, Ms. Jiang

287
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Thank you, Teacher Jiang.

288
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,320
Why are you biting me?

289
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,120
You asked me to bite you.

290
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,600
Jiang Kai, what are you doing?

291
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,240
Bite me?

292
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,640
You're getting bolder.

293
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,000
My head hurts.

294
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,400
You were hit by the soccer team before.

295
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,080
I said I'd take responsibility.

296
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,840
Then...

297
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,320
how are you going to take responsibility?
