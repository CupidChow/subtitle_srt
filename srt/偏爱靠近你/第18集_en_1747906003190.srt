00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,840
Am I your son or not?

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Zhang Boyang.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,120
I thought you would come back today.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,920
Zhang Bohan.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,240
Come back.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,240
He's in his youth.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,520
He's always like this.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,440
He'll come back when he's ready.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,720
You have to rest early today for the physical test tomorrow.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,720
I thought about it countless times.

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,360
If I had gone after him,

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,120
would it be different?

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,760
I didn't expect that

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,480
was the last time I saw him.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,360
I felt like I was dreaming on the funeral day.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,360
I thought maybe he went to play somewhere.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,640
He just left the door and came back after a while.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,680
Maybe it's all my fault.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,960
Hey.

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,360
Cry if you want to.

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,720
I won't look at it.

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,600
I'm looking for the paper.

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,160
Did you not expect

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,280
that I have such a mysterious reason?

26
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,640
Don't worry.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,960
This is a secret between us.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,200
I won't tell anyone.

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,480
When I'm sad,

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,520
I just need to cry a little.

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,440
Yu Binqi.

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,440
You're the best person in the world.

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
You too.

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,080
I admit.

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,800
Yu Binqi is the best person in the world.

36
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,960
Jiang Bohan.

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,000
You're the best too.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,520
But I'm not the best.

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,520
Yu Binqi, you're the best.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,960
You're better than Jiang Bohan.

41
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,280
How about you, you're the best.

42
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,360
I'm looking for the paper.

43
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,560
Come on.

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,520
This is the paper.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,880
This is the paper, get behind it.

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,760
Actually,

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,400
we're both hands.

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:02,400
You are the beef stew, I am the apple that fell from the tree

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Oh, I want a bite, just like a fish in the water

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:18,400
You are summer, I am the wind that blows from the beach

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I don't understand why people don't know how to love

52
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Can you really teach me how to swim?

53
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,400
It's not difficult. Come down and try

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
I'm a bit scared now

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
It's okay, come down, I'll hold you

56
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
No, no, no, no, I'm scared

57
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
You told me to teach you how to swim, how can I teach you if you don't come down?

58
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Okay, come and help me down

59
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
That's more like it

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:15,400
You are the beef stew, I am the apple that fell from the tree

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Oh, I want a bite, just like a fish in the water

62
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:32,400
You are summer, I am the wind that blows from the beach

63
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,400
I don't understand why people don't know how to love

64
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Hold on, don't let go

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Relax

66
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
How's the chicken?

67
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
I think I should be fine

68
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Really?

69
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
I'm not sure

70
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
How about you let go and I'll try

71
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Then I'll let go

72
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Are you okay?

73
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Why are you letting go?

74
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Didn't you tell me to let go and try?

75
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Are you angry?

76
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
I won't let go, I'm wrong

77
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
You swear?

78
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
I swear

79
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,400
I knew I had a few problems with the wrong ones

80
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,400
I don't even want to think about it anyway

81
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
You are learning fast today

82
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
I'm a master of math

83
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
I think you'll be able to learn in a few days

84
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
How are you going to repay me after you get your scholarship?

85
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,400
You can ask, I'll do my best to satisfy you

86
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Really?

87
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Really

88
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
You can't fail, you'll come back

89
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
I'll do my best

90
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Then I have to think about it

91
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Thank you for taking me home

92
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
It's my pleasure

93
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
By the way, aren't you curious

94
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Why do I have the key to the swimming pool?

95
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
My mom told you to keep it a secret

96
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Didn't I make it hard for you?

97
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
You knew it all

98
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm not deaf

99
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
But the principal is actually very popular

100
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
He's the best

101
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
He's the best

102
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
He's the best

103
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
He's actually very popular

104
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
He's the best

105
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
You bought it with a key

106
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Did he play well?

107
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
No

108
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Okay

109
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
It's late, go home early

110
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I'm leaving

111
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Bye

112
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Bye

113
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Yun Minxin

114
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Can you come out on Wednesday?

115
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
What's wrong?

116
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Next Friday

117
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
I want to invite you to be my partner

118
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Really?

119
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
I'm leaving, bye

120
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Bye

121
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Bye

122
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,400
After work

123
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Jiang Bohan

124
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Why are you not back yet?

125
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
What do you have to do

126
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
You have to block the進入

127
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
I come to your house

128
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
I just want you to choose

129
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,560
�類伴褥衣

130
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,160
I want to wear a light pink dress.

131
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,760
What do you think?

132
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,960
Sorry.

133
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,760
I've already invited Yu Mingxi to my dance party this year.

134
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
What did you say?

135
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,360
I said that this year's dance party,

136
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,760
Yu Mingxi is my dance partner.

137
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,960
Jiang Bohan, you don't even tell me that you're changing dance partners.

138
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,160
Have you ever respected me?

139
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,960
You don't even tell me that you're changing dance partners every year.

140
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,360
You just pretend that I'm your dance partner.

141
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,560
Have you ever respected me?

142
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,760
Every year, we are the prom king and queen of the school.

143
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,160
This is the highest honor of the dance club.

144
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,160
You won't just choose the big game just for a Yu Mingxi, right?

145
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,560
What is the big game?

146
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,160
You're the big game?

147
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,160
He can't even get on the stage.

148
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,760
You haven't seen him dance, right?

149
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,760
He can't even keep up with the rhythm of the four steps.

150
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,360
He will only embarrass you on stage.

151
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,960
If it's really like what you said,

152
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,960
I'd rather sit with him under the stage.

153
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,360
Don't forget what you said before.

154
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,200
Junury

155
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,560
Yao Yao, what are you doing?

156
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,640
Let me go!

157
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,120
Are you crazy? What if you get yourself in trouble?

158
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,080
You must be out of your mind. Why can't you get through with your skirt?

159
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,800
I'm going to the dance today. I'm not going.

160
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,440
Which one of them is bothering you? Tell me. I'll teach him a lesson.

161
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,400
Jiang Bo Han invited Yu Mingxi to be his dance partner.

162
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,800
I'm his dance partner.

163
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,800
What will people think of me?

164
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Don't be sad. I'm here. No one will say anything bad about us.

165
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,680
I don't want to see him dance with Yu Mingxi's hands.

166
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,680
Don't worry. They can't dance.

167
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,640
Jiang Bo Han

168
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,040
Am I tooaken with Jiang Bo Han?

169
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,760
Why can't you dance with Jiang Bo Han?

170
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,540
You're really a no-★

171
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,080
I'm going to work at a mail store on Friday and Tuesday.

172
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,800
I had tonga cash and check offence.

173
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,080
And I'm not really accustomed to the place.

174
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Then I'll just forget it.

175
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,840
You must go.

176
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,520
No one invited me.

177
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,920
If you go back,

178
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,560
I'll be left alone.

179
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,960
There are so many people in the basketball team.

180
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,640
Go invite them.

181
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,520
What if they don't agree?

182
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,640
They...

183
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,280
Xiao Qi, I only have you.

184
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,440
Okay.

185
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,240
What clothes and shoes are you wearing?

186
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,480
We can wear a sister look.

187
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,080
I can make clothes myself.

188
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,080
But shoes...

189
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,560
Shoes are easy. You can wear mine.

190
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,640
You're a girl, I'm a girl. How can I wear yours?

191
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,880
If you can't, I'll wear sports shoes.

192
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,560
Maybe I can earn more money than others.

193
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,360
Xiao Qi, can you help me choose clothes and shoes?

194
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,640
Sure. Let's go.

195
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,480
Let's go.

196
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,280
Let's go.

197
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,560
I picked these out.

198
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,880
Help me choose.

199
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,680
But I think these are all pretty.

200
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
You must choose one.

201
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,480
This one.

202
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
Where's the princess dress?

203
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,480
Is it too grand?

204
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,280
It has to be grand.

205
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,480
You have to dress pretty.

206
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,480
I picked these shoes.

207
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,880
They're my favorite, FZ.

208
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,480
Who's FZ?

209
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Fiona Zhang.

210
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,880
She's the most famous shoe designer in China.

211
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,280
They're all pretty.

212
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,880
This one.

213
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,680
I'll wear this when I go to school.

214
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,880
This one is pretty too.

215
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
I think these two are pretty too.

216
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,480
But I'll buy this pink one.

217
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
It's bigger than the dress.

218
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,880
I'll buy this pair of shoes next time.

219
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,680
But this pair of shoes is really pretty.

220
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,880
Right? I like this designer.

221
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,480
What's her name?

222
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,480
Fiona Zhang.

223
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,280
You'll look really pretty in this pair of shoes.

224
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,080
You'll be the prettiest one.

225
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,080
Forget it. These shoes are too expensive. I can't afford them.

226
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,680
How do you know how to dance?

227
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,280
I'm a Chinese.

228
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,080
Chinese.

229
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,880
I have a dance party every year.

230
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,280
Then what's your dance style before I came?

231
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
It's none of your business.

232
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,080
But I'm curious.

233
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,280
I'm not telling you. I'm afraid you'll get mad.

234
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,280
I'm not mad.

235
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,080
Really?

236
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,480
Why?

237
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Because I believe you.

238
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,280
I'm not mad.

239
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
I'm not mad.

240
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
I'm not mad.

241
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
I'm not mad.

242
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,280
I'm not mad.

243
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
I'm not mad.

244
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
I'm not mad.

245
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
I'm not mad.

246
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
I'm not mad.

247
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I'm not mad.

248
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
I'm not mad.

249
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
I'm not mad.

250
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,280
I'm not mad.

251
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,280
I'm not mad.

252
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
I'm not mad.

253
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
I'm not mad.

254
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
I'm not mad.

255
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
I'm not mad.

256
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
I'm not mad.

257
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
I'm not mad.

258
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
I'm not mad.

259
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
I'm not mad.

260
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
I'm not mad.

261
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
I'm not mad.

262
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
I'm not mad.

263
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
I'm not mad.

264
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
I'm not mad.

265
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
I'm not mad.

266
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,280
I'm not mad.

267
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,280
I'm not mad.
