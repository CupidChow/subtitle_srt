1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
The Pleling Man

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,320
Nice.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,040
Come on!

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,700
Next.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,500
Nice.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Hurry up.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Hold your hands.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Keep your hands steady.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Keep your hands steady.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Jump higher.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Chen Siqi.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
What's wrong with your leg?

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
It's nothing.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
It's just a bruise.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
I'm leaving.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Go back and rest.

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Boss.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Boss.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I've made an appointment to have dinner with you.

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
I'm leaving.

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
What's the matter?

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Boss.

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Didn't you have a date with Yu Mingxi?

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Don't hang out with my dad.

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
I'm not hanging out with him.

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
I'm just caring about my teammates.

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Do you know how Jie is

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
with Wang Chu Nian?

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Last time, Jie trained him

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
and hit Wang Chu Nian's leg.

31
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I said Jie has to be responsible for this.

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Then Jie goes to the hospital every day.

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
He's been training for a long time.

34
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
He's been doing it for a long time.

35
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I didn't see Wang Chu Nian's leg getting hurt.

36
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
What do you mean?

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
You just say that this is fate.

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
I miss you.

39
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I'll be looking forward to the moment of my surrender.

40
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
I can't walk.

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,500
I'm lost in the life in the idol drama.

42
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,500
I'm the one you left.

43
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,500
I'm like a piece of paper.

44
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm the one you left.

45
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
I'm the one you left.

46
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,500
I'm the apple you left.

47
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:31,500
I'm like a fish that lives in the water.

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:41,500
You are the one who made me fall in love with you.

49
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Why is love so unknowingly?

50
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
How can I get through it?

51
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,500
The End

52
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Why didn't you come to the training camp this afternoon?

53
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Today is basketball training.

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Basketball training?

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
You're always training basketball.

56
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
You didn't even see what you guys were doing.

57
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Didn't you say that I won the championship?

58
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
You didn't object to me playing basketball?

59
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
What's the point of basketball?

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Can you go to the meal?

61
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Did something happen to you?

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
I can hide something from you.

63
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
What happened to your head?

64
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Didn't I tell you?

65
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
I've found it.

66
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
It's good to rest.

67
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
It won't affect the game.

68
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Chen Su Jie.

69
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Don't let me down.

70
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
I'll tell you if anything happens.

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
I'll ask you one last time.

72
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,500
What's wrong with your leg?

73
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,880
The

74
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
White Moon White Moon is in Sili.

75
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
How long has it been?

76
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
I don't know.

77
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Are you crazy?

78
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
You've been hiding it from me for so long.

79
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
You said I was fine.

80
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
You're still looking at yourself.

81
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
I can play basketball.

82
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
You're just a kid.

83
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
You can beat me.

84
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
You can scold me.

85
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
But I have to win the game.

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,500
You're not qualified to compete with me.

87
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
You're the only one who knows the treatment.

88
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
You only have surgery.

89
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
And you're getting better.

90
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
As for playing basketball,

91
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
it's impossible.

92
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
I'll hold on for a bit longer.

93
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Doctor Zhang,

94
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
can you play a game of the wind?

95
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Although it can be a short time,

96
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
it's painful to bite.

97
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
But it can't be predicted

98
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,500
by the serious level of injury.

99
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
You're a player.

100
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
You're a player.

101
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Don't ruin your future

102
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
for a game.

103
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Can you play the game?

104
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
You have to think about it.

105
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
If you decide,

106
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
come to me before the game.

107
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Thank you, doctor.

108
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Chief,

109
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
the wind is too dangerous.

110
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
It's okay.

111
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Don't worry.

112
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
The team needs training.

113
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
I'll go first.

114
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
You don't need training.

115
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Open it.

116
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Come on.

117
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Come on.

118
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Come on.

119
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
What's wrong?

120
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
You're not coming.

121
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Come on.

122
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Come on.

123
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Come on.

124
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
What's wrong?

125
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Come on.

126
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Come on.

127
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Come on.

128
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Come on.

129
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Come on.

130
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Come on.

131
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
You're fat.

132
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
This girl is called...

133
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Mishi.

134
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Right.

135
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
She's not bad.

136
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,500
If you sell this video,

137
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
you should earn two dollars.

138
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
I have a big brother.

139
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
I'll take it for you.

140
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
How much is it?

141
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Brother,

142
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
this is fire.

143
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
You didn't bring it.

144
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
What do you mean?

145
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
I heard that

146
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
there's a good thing about

147
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
a small video.

148
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Can you show it to me?

149
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
No.

150
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
You're wrong.

151
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Come on.

152
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
What are you doing?

153
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Sell it to me.

154
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
How much do you want to eat?

155
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Open your eyes.

156
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Come on.

157
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
It's over.

158
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
It's over.

159
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
What do you mean?

160
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Nothing.

161
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Just keep it.

162
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Nothing to do with it.

163
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Don't worry, brother.

164
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
You'll know the rules.

165
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Brother.

166
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
I'm the most capable man.

167
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Brother.

168
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Why do you have two phones?

169
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
This is Yun Mingxi?

170
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Where did he come from?

171
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Yun Mingxi is a man

172
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
who doesn't know

173
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
what he's done.

174
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
These two

175
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
took his video

176
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
and went to his place.

177
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
The result was that

178
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
he was hit by me.

179
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Who made him so scared?

180
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Are you sure

181
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
he didn't do anything else?

182
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I'm sure.

183
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
No.

184
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
I'll go back.

185
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Wait.

186
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
What?

187
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Why are you hurt again?

188
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
They're more miserable than me.

189
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
What are you doing?

190
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Do you want to get seen?

191
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
What are you talking about?

192
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
What's this?

193
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
You took the video?

194
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
When did I use

195
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
this kind of handphone?

196
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
I don't know.

197
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
I just want to know

198
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
how long it's been used.

199
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
I'll go back and look for it.

200
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Do you want to know

201
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
if you can find it?

202
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
I'm not sure.

203
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
I'll go back to the room

204
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
and take a look.

205
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
I'll go back to the room.

206
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
I don't know who you've found.

207
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
These videos

208
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
were bought by those people.

209
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Are you here to help me

210
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
or to threaten me?

211
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Don't worry.

212
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
My phone is safe here.

213
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
But I have a condition.

214
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
What condition?

215
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
You promised

216
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
that you wouldn't

217
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
bother about the Bohan.

218
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
I'll delete these videos.

219
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Don't threaten me.

220
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Don't worry.

221
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
We won't be together.

222
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
She has a foreign country.

223
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
I'll stay here.

224
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Why are you so sure

225
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
that she'll leave?

226
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Because

227
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
she promised to be with me.

228
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I hope you can

229
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
keep this secret for me.

230
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
You're going to lie to her.

231
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
She won't forgive you for the rest of her life.

232
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
It's not that important.

233
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
I'm sorry.

236
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
I'm back.

237
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
What are you doing here?

238
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Nothing.

239
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
I'm just

240
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
a shoe that I lost a few days ago.

241
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
You lost it?

242
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
It's okay.

243
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
I can keep it for 30 days.

244
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
I'll go back and send it to my brother-in-law.

245
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
How do you know

246
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
that the repair period is 30 days?

247
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Such a expensive shoe

248
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
is usually 30 days.

249
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Did you buy it?

250
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Why are you laughing?

251
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
It's so expensive.

252
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
How can I afford it?

253
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
You're lying to me again.

254
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
I didn't mean to lie to you.

255
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
I just want you to

256
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
be happy

257
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
in the dance club.

258
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
How can you afford it?

259
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
And

260
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
what happened

261
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
to your fight with Jiang Man last time?

262
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Why did you hide it from me?

263
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
I...

264
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
I'm still a little bit timid.

265
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Stop it!

266
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
What's wrong?

267
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I didn't mean it.

269
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Are you okay?

270
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
No.

271
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
It's not your fault.

272
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
It's just that I was too busy

273
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
with my training a few days ago.

274
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
I accidentally broke my arm.

275
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
I'll be fine in a few days.

276
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
You went to train for others?

277
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
I...

278
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Listen to me.
