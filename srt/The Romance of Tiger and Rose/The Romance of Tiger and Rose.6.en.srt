23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 6)

24
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,300
Drink the Dragon Bone soup.

25
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,140
Drink it immediately.

26
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,740
Otherwise, it will become stinkier when it's cold.

27
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,180
Qianqian stole Dragon Bone for Han Shuo.

28
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,420
It seems she really loves him.

29
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,100
But till now

30
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,060
they haven't slept together.

31
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,300
Could Qianqian be blamed?

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,140
Han Shuo is an ambitious man.

33
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,860
I was so careless.

34
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,980
I think he just want to use Qianqian

35
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,300
to steal the Dragon Bone.

36
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,700
But...

37
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,060
But just now Young Master Han

38
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,260
fed the first spoon of Dragon Bone soup

39
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,580
to Her Highness.

40
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,500
He just pretended to be nice.

41
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,020
At last, the Dragon Bone soup

42
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,860
was drunk up by him.

43
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,740
He is the first person

44
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,340
who dared to play tricks under my eyes.

45
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,300
I will turn Han Shuo

46
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,820
into an ordinary person again.

47
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,740
Then, how about Her Highness?

48
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,100
If I must raise a dog,

49
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,420
I will raise an obedient dog.

50
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,180
Good morning, Young Master Han.

51
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,780
I heard that you had drunk Dragon Bone soup.

52
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,780
I just sent this good news to Xuanhu City.

53
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,220
I never thought that people
from Xuanhu City could know it.

54
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,140
It is my pleasure to meet you.

55
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,940
Minister Yang.

56
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,500
I must say that you're very thoughtful.

57
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,260
Thanks to a firework show
at the Third Princess's Mansion last night,

58
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,740
I found that the Second Princess was tracing me.

59
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,340
So I could find this chance to meet you.

60
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,180
The firework show last night

61
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,620
was not my idea.

62
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,060
I am not that smart.

63
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,020
You're so humble.

64
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,740
Now, you have got rid of your heart disease.

65
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,460
We are halfway to success.

66
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,940
Next, when a chance arises,

67
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,100
our well-equipped troops will move southward

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,660
and conquer Huayuan City.

69
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,780
The black stone mine of Huayuan City

70
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,380
will become Hu's.

71
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,740
Minister Yang is a woman.

72
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,580
Wouldn't you be happier
if you stay in Huayuan City?

73
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,660
Why do you want to work for me?

74
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,460
Though I am in Huayuan City,

75
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,660
I concern about families of Xuanhu City.

76
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,620
I wish to do everything for you.

77
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,180
If that is so,

78
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,540
could you do me a favor?

79
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,140
Please tell me.

80
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,220
In future, if anyone
argues about the Third Princess,

81
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,180
please defend her

82
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,340
and protect her.

83
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,380
I don't want Qianqian
to fall into any trouble again.

84
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,820
Yes.

85
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,980
Your Highness.

86
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,660
We had better report to Her Majesty.

87
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,100
Our mission failed last night.

88
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,260
If my mother knows it,

89
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,180
she will think that I am useless.

90
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,000
But your wound is severe.

91
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,380
Perhaps if Her Majesty sees your wound,

92
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,900
she will not blame you.

93
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,660
My mother took care of Qianqian
at Yueli Mansion all night yesterday.

94
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,580
Please don't bother her.

95
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,180
I heard the Third Princess went to Ancestral Hall
and grabbed the Dragon Bone away.

96
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,260
She cured the heart disease
of Young Master Han.

97
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,060
In the past,
only Her Majesty and the Crown Princess

98
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,220
know the whereabouts of the Dragon Bone.

99
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,020
How did the Third Princess know that

100
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,020
the Dragon Bone was hidden at Ancestral Hall?

101
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,060
Has Her Majesty
decided to pass the throne to...

102
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,940
Zi Zhu.

103
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,700
Don't be suspicious without reason.

104
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,620
There must be something we don't know.

105
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,260
I guess that Qianqian

106
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,500
found the Dragon Bone by chance.

107
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,900
She fired fireworks
at the mansion last night.

108
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,100
Is that a coincidence too?

109
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,860
She also made you severely injured.

110
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,060
What are you watching?

111
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,540
This is a serial drama.

112
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,900
Don't think that stealing
a Dragon Bone is all I want to do.

113
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,860
I still want to do other things.

114
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,020
What are those things?

115
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,300
Is everything ready?

116
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,380
Young Master, please rest assured.

117
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,940
I don't know if she likes to eat it.

118
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,380
It is expensive.

119
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,580
Where did my Kung Fu go?

120
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,380
I am a worthless person.

121
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,780
What should I do?

122
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,780
I never heard that Soul Missing Powder
has such a side effect.

123
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,100
Qianqian.

124
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,540
Qianqian, what is wrong with you?

125
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,860
After I was poisoned,

126
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,500
I found myself
losing the ability of fighting.

127
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,940
I will be

128
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,740
a worthless person forever.

129
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,580
My mother will set up
a Kung Fu contest for me.

130
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,700
But I can't attend it anymore.

131
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,340
Come on.

132
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,220
How do you feel now?

133
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,980
Hope

134
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:57,820
-less.

135
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,060
How strange! I want to eat pomegranates.

136
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,780
There should be
no pomegranates in this season.

137
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,140
That's right.

138
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,860
A person without Kung Fu

139
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,420
doesn't deserve to eat pomegranates.

140
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,820
Bai Ji, go to buy pomegranates.

141
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,620
Yes, sir.

142
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,660
Young Master, pomegranates.

143
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,260
Pomegranates.

144
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,620
I just want to see if they are available.

145
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,540
Now I am relieved.

146
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,940
I don't have appetite.

147
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,380
I can't eat now.

148
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,100
Take away.

149
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,900
Han Shuo.

150
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,980
Why don't I write a letter

151
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,860
to dissolve our marriage contract?

152
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,460
You can seek refuge with Chen Chuchu.

153
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,660
No. You...

154
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,580
I am a commoner already.

155
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,380
Everyone supports Chuchu.
She will have a bright future.

156
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,540
She can protect you.

157
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,100
The Second Princess is severely injured.

158
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,980
She is not well.

159
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,100
What's wrong with her?

160
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,180
Who dared to

161
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,100
injure her? Bastard!

162
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,620
The Second Princess was conducting
a secret mission that night.

163
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,460
It was agreed that fireworks
should be the signal for action.

164
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,700
But someone fired fireworks in advance.

165
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,340
We don't know who that person is.

166
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,900
The secret mission
of the Second Princess was unveiled.

167
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,260
So she fought with enemies.

168
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,900
Why did fireworks hurt Chuchu?

169
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,420
The lighting of fireworks

170
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,060
perhaps was an accident.

171
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,940
Young Master Han should consider

172
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,980
Chuchu...

173
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,580
I will not leave you.

174
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,260
Your Highness should take a rest.

175
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,300
If there is anything you want,

176
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,140
please ask me.

177
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,500
Go.

178
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,940
I will teach you a lesson.

179
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,820
They have gone.

180
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,580
He refused to leave.

181
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,500
Fine.

182
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,620
I will find another chance

183
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,300
to send him to Chuchu in the future.

184
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,980
He will not stay
with a good-for-nothing forever.

185
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,500
To save my life,

186
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,540
I have already used up
my strength and acting skills.

187
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,420
Pomegranates.

188
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,020
Your Highness.

189
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,860
Lord Sangqi is dispatching
an order of Her Majesty.

190
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,420
Dispatching an order?

191
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,900
What is the order?

192
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,540
By the order of Her Majesty...

193
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,940
Take care.

194
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,260
The Crown Prince of Xuanhu City Han Shuo

195
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,900
coaxed the Third Princess Chen Qianqian
to steal the Dragon Bone.

196
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,340
It is decreed that a bone
should be taken from Han Shuo,

197
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,860
so as to ensure a correct understanding
of the matter and give peace to the people.

198
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,260
Take what?

199
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,860
Don't move.

200
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,660
Han Shuo.

201
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,100
Han Shuo. Let me go.

202
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,140
Han Shuo.

203
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,220
Let me go. Han Shuo.

204
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,780
Sangqi.

205
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,860
Your Highness.

206
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,300
After you stole the Dragon Bone,

207
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,060
civilians and officials in the city

208
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,020
all wanted the justice to be served.

209
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,180
That's why Her Majesty came up this idea.

210
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,260
She only wants to protect you.

211
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,860
I...

212
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,220
The City Owner is coming.

213
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,340
That can't be true.

214
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,460
I brought a big trouble to Han Shuo.

215
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,780
Let me go.

216
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,260
Mother.

217
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,140
Mother.

218
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,060
Mother. Why are you doing this?

219
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,380
Because Han Shuo drank up Dragon Bone soup,

220
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,300
he damaged the fortune of Huayuan City.

221
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,260
I am the City Owner of Huayuan City.

222
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,420
I will take a bone from his body

223
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,660
to assuage the people's anger.

224
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,060
Take a bone?

225
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,780
How big should be the bone?

226
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,500
Is this big enough?

227
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,860
Silly girl.

228
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,660
That is depend on
the size of the Dragon Bone.

229
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:15,900
Guards.

230
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

231
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,460
Take a rib from Han Shuo's body.

232
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,900
Don't do that.

233
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,020
Don't do that. Han Shuo.

234
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,180
Let me go.

235
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,660
Han Shuo.

236
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,060
Don't approach him.

237
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,940
Han Shuo.

238
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,140
Mother.

239
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,140
Han Shuo.

240
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,860
Han Shuo.

241
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,780
Han Shuo.

242
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,180
Mother.

243
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,500
Mother. I beg you. Mother.

244
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,580
Let me go.

245
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,740
Han Shuo.

246
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,140
Go away.

247
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,740
Go away. Go away.

248
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,620
Mother. Mother.

249
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,180
I stole the Dragon Bone alone.

250
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,380
It has nothing to do with Han Shuo.

251
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,380
If you take a rib from his body,

252
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,700
he will be either disabled or died.

253
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,220
Mother. Han Shuo is a proud man.

254
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,540
You had better kill him than disable him.

255
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,300
Killing him is better.

256
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,580
Without his coaxing,

257
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,620
you would not make such a big trouble.

258
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,180
Do you know what people say nowadays?

259
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,740
You have become a bane of civilians.

260
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,180
Don't move.

261
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,460
Mother.

262
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,380
I will bear all the consequences.

263
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
I forced Han Shuo to drink Dragon Bone soup.

264
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,140
If you want to take a bone, take my bone.

265
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,500
I am his rib.

266
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,780
Don't move.

267
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,300
Drag Chen Qianqian away.

268
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,580
Please don't. Please don't.

269
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,140
Han Shuo. Han Shuo.

270
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:34,860
Your Highness.

271
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,900
Han Shuo. Wake up.

272
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,060
Han Shuo. Han Shuo. Wake up.

273
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,940
If you don't wake up,
I can't protect you. Han Shuo.

274
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,060
Separate them.

275
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,100
Please don't. Please don't.

276
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,300
Mother.

277
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,100
You don't know

278
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,340
how important Han Shuo is to me?

279
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,620
Let me go.

280
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,100
Pull her away. Pull her away.

281
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,460
Han Shuo. Wake up.

282
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,700
All right.

283
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,060
You can take my bone.

284
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,460
I know you don't dare to do that.

285
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,820
Mother.

286
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,180
You can punish me if you wish.

287
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,540
Drag Chen Qianqian away.

288
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,780
I know you will not hurt me.

289
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,580
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

290
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,340
I am not.

291
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,580
I am ashamed of you.

292
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,420
Drag her away.

293
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,100
Please don't.

294
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,980
Please don't.

295
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,900
Han Shuo.

296
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,660
Qianqian.

297
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,300
Han Shuo. You have woken up.

298
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:27,980
Qianqian.

299
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,780
Han Shuo. You have woken up.

300
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,820
I will not release my hands.

301
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,380
If I release my hands, they will hurt you.

302
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,460
Han Shuo.

303
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,660
Han Shuo. Sorry.

304
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,180
I don't know things
will turn out to be like this.

305
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,540
I just wanted to cure your heart disease.

306
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,260
But I never thought
that you would be punished for my mistake.

307
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,860
You are pressing my wound.

308
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,900
Besides,

309
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,260
if you keep hugging me like this,

310
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,420
I will not be able to use my Kung Fu.

311
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,980
Do you want to know

312
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,380
how powerful I am after

313
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,900
I was cured by you?

314
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,540
Han Shuo. Han Shuo.

315
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,860
Don't hurt him.

316
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,260
Don't hurt him.

317
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,860
Don't hurt him.

318
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,620
Who dares to hurt her?

319
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,380
Nobody wants to hurt her.

320
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,500
We just want to hurt you.

321
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,340
Let Her Highness go.

322
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,420
Please don't cry.

323
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,900
I am alright.

324
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,300
Sorry.

325
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,740
It is my fault.

326
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
If you keep crying,

327
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,220
I will get a heart disease again.

328
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,780
How can it be possible?

329
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,500
The Dragon Bone I stole is real.

330
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,980
Is it true if you take a bone from my body,

331
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,220
you will never blame Qianqian

332
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,900
for stealing the Dragon Bone?

333
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,180
Please do it.

334
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,460
You are crazy.

335
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,580
You will lose so much blood
and your wound will get infected.

336
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,020
Eventually you will die.

337
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,940
Please don't blame Qianqian anymore.

338
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,540
Do you really want to risk your life

339
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,140
for Qianqian?

340
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,340
Let's calm down.

341
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,420
I think that there should be other options.

342
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,940
You don't understand how important
the Dragon Bone means to civilians.

343
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,980
You stole the Dragon Bone

344
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,340
to cure my heart disease.

345
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,980
I must be punished.

346
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,660
Then you can be exonerated.

347
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,500
Qianqian.

348
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,220
You are a princess of the city.

349
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,860
People call you the Third Princess.

350
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,660
You have to shoulder

351
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,140
your responsibility.

352
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,060
Princess.

353
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,140
Is that mean if I was not a princess,

354
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,580
I would not shoulder any responsibility?

355
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,260
Do you know what you are talking about?

356
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,220
Mother.

357
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,140
I am not good
at either literature or Kung Fu.

358
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,540
I am a good-for-nothing.

359
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,340
Please abolish my title
and let me be a commoner.

360
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,140
I will not be

361
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,980
the Third Princess anymore.

362
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,980
Nonsense.

363
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,820
You are my daughter.

364
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,660
How can you refuse to be a princess?

365
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,940
Your Majesty. It looks that Her Highness

366
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,340
loves Young Master Han very much.

367
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,860
If we don't make a compromise,

368
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,980
I am afraid that it will
be harder for Her Highness

369
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,500
to handle the situation.

370
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,420
Qianqian.

371
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,020
Do you know what will become of you

372
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,980
if you are a commoner?

373
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,140
Han Shuo will stay with me.

374
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,860
I am not afraid.

375
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,940
Do you really trust me?

376
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,980
By the order of Her Majesty,
(City Owner's Mansion)

377
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,580
Chen Qianqian, the daughter of
City Owner, is stubborn and disobedient.

378
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,700
Disregarding ancestral traditions,

379
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,380
she stole the Dragon Bone
and damaged the fortune of the city.

380
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,740
Therefore, it is decreed
that she should become a ccommoner

381
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,740
and be deprived of any special rights.

382
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,260
She should go back
to the mansion to reflect on her mistakes.

383
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,980
Without being summoned by Her Majesty,

384
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,580
she should not leave the mansion.

385
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,900
Isn't the Third Princess
the most favorite daughter of Her Majesty?

386
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,940
Why was she deprived of the title?

387
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,380
I am so surprised.

388
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,460
Now how should we read

389
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,620
the announcement
about punishing the Third Princess?

390
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,900
Her Majesty has gained
the upper hand by taking the initiative.

391
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,100
Since the Third Princess has become a commoner,

392
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,780
shall we wind up

393
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,420
the case of stealing the Dragon Bone?

394
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,660
I agree.

395
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,180
Then the Crown Princess will be...

396
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,820
OK. Dismiss.

397
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,380
(Pei's Mansion)

398
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,140
Minister Pei.

399
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,780
I heard that

400
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,260
because the Third Princess stole the Dragon Bone,

401
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,300
she had been deprived
of the title and become a commoner.

402
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,460
What did you say?

403
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,740
There are rumors that

404
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,340
the disease of Young Master has been cured,

405
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,100
but the Third Princess
has been deprived of the title.

406
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,780
It is true.

407
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,660
People all say that

408
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,980
the heart disease
of Young Master Han has been cured.

409
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,540
He can defeat ten persons at one time.

410
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,300
How could that be?

411
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,700
Young Master Han will die
before his 20th birthday.

412
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,740
If he does not die,

413
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,700
how could our master

414
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,500
marry the Third Princess?

415
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,700
She is not the Third Princess anymore.

416
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,180
I don't know how Lin Qi

417
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,220
will treat the Third Princess.

418
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,860
Spendthrift Chen Qianqian
was deprived of the title.

419
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,260
She has fallen from grace.

420
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,860
She stole the Dragon Bone
and damaged the fortune of the city.

421
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,620
Only she could do such kind of things.

422
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,220
If Huayuan City is governed
by such a kind of person,

423
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,380
our lives will be doomed.

424
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,580
Now, she not only
has been deprived of the title,

425
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,980
but also has lost the ability of fighting.

426
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,660
Doesn't that mean
she is just a worthless person?

427
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,380
The creditors will go to her house
and ask her to pay pack money.

428
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,940
Do you think that

429
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,020
the Third Princess will still

430
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,420
come to the clan school?

431
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,420
Only princesses
and female relatives of officials

432
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,500
can go to the clan school.

433
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,980
She is no longer a princess.

434
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,220
Of course she can't come here.

435
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,420
Do you think she did it on purpose?

436
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,780
Then the Third Princess doesn't need
to go to school anymore.

437
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,700
She just want to evade school.

438
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,020
We should stop calling her the Third Princess.

439
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,020
Let's go.

440
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,740
Your Highness.

441
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,860
Why don't you worry about the Third Princess?

442
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,300
She dares to steal the Dragon Bone.

443
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,460
There's no need for me to worry about her.

444
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,780
My feet have been disabled
by poison for many years.

445
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,300
She never said
that she would steal the Dragon Bone

446
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,460
to treat me.

447
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,260
But the Dragon Bone
can't cure your disease.

448
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,100
But what if it can cure me?

449
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,180
Your Highness.

450
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,980
Forget it.

451
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,060
Actually, I think that

452
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,260
she is better than before.

453
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,780
In order to save another person's life,

454
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,220
she is willing to give up her title.

455
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,540
Anyway, my mother loves her.

456
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,540
Whether she is a princess or not

457
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,740
makes no difference to her.

458
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,020
Zi Nian.

459
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,940
Bring the shawl for me.

460
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,740
Yes.

461
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,700
Is this the book that Your Highness

462
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,300
is looking for?

463
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,860
Your Highness.

464
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,700
If you need anything,

465
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,740
just ask me.

466
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,700
Please don't ask Su Mu for help.

467
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,820
Why can't I ask him for help?

468
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,300
He is not qualified to serve Your Highness.

469
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,540
Why?

470
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,340
He is a musician.

471
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,100
I don't know why

472
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,460
he is at the clan school?

473
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,140
I think

474
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,460
musicians are not different from

475
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,740
ordinary people.

476
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,980
Please don't talk about
others behind their backs.

477
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,180
Your Highness, you always only
mind your own business.

478
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,660
Why did you speak for Su Mu today?

479
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,180
He is the only one

480
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,980
who has squatted down
to talk to me in all these years.

481
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,900
It is my negligence.

482
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,380
That's all right.

483
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,740
I just think

484
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,100
he treats me differently.

485
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,580
You can't enter Yueli Mansion
without permission.

486
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,060
Chen Qianqian is just a commoner.

487
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,860
She is nobody.

488
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,860
I am afraid of nothing.

489
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,780
Get out of the way.

490
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,980
Pay back money. Pay the debt.

491
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,940
You can't go in.

492
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,500
Lin Qi.

493
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,900
What are you doing here?

494
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,900
Of course for revenge
and protecting our rights.

495
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,900
Now, everyone can speak.

496
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,020
I have a complaint.

497
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,700
The Third Princess lives in luxury.

498
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,740
Yueli Mansion ordered
some glazed utensils from my shop.

499
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,380
Five hundred pieces in total.

500
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,380
They only paid a half tael
of silver for the deposit.

501
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,780
It's been two years.

502
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,060
The remaining 3,000 taels
of silver have not been paid.

503
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,060
I have been reminding them to make payment.

504
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,540
But they just said
that they would pay tomorrow.

505
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,980
On the next day, they said the same thing.

506
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,140
As days went by,

507
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,740
my shop fell into debt.

508
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,580
Is that true?

509
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,780
Zi Rui. You...

510
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,260
I have a grocery store.

511
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,220
Zi Rui placed orders to us.
He is the Third Princess's favorite servant.

512
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,860
Under the name of Princess's Mansion,

513
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,420
he asked my shop

514
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,780
to produce a bamboo tube
at a price far lower than the market price.

515
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,780
He also asked us to send 499 bamboo tubes

516
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,780
to the Third Princess free of charge.

517
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,980
The Third Princess drove us too hard.

518
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,260
It is your honor to

519
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,380
serve the Third Princess.

520
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,980
But today,

521
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,540
shouldn't she pay the debts?

522
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,340
You...

523
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,900
The Third Princess should pay our debts.

524
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,860
Pay our debts.

525
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,660
We have brought account books.

526
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,460
Chen Qianqian.

527
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
Pay back money.

528
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,300
Take them to settle the accounts.

529
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,380
Pay back all the money we owed them.

530
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,820
We must pay all debts
even if it means emptying Yueli Mansion.

531
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,220
But...

532
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,900
Go.

533
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,420
Move everything out.

534
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,340
OK. Go.

535
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,180
Move everything out.

536
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,860
Go.

537
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,500
What are you doing?

538
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,820
You can't enter the house.

539
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,660
What are you doing?

540
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,620
You can't enter the house.

541
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,260
You can't enter the house.

542
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,940
No trespass.

543
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,660
I want this.

544
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,460
-You can't enter. -You can't enter.

545
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,380
I want this.

546
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,180
What are you doing?

547
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,100
Put things down.

548
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,060
Don't take them away.

549
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
Don't take them. Put things down.

550
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,180
I want this.

551
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,140
Miss Lin is very impressive today

552
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,980
just like I was before.

553
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,140
Be careful, because every dog has his day.

554
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,740
Your Highness.

555
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,620
They are moving everything away.

556
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,620
It doesn't matter.

557
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,500
I don't need them.

558
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,620
They are taking away antiques.

559
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,700
No. I don't need them.

560
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,220
They are taking away
jade articles and jewelry.

561
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,700
It doesn't matter.

562
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,100
Your Highness.

563
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,260
Would you please stand up?

564
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,660
It looks that the chair
you are sitting on is nice.

565
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,060
It is at least worth a few taels of silver.

566
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,380
Zi Rui.

567
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,140
Calm down.

568
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,500
Go.

569
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,860
Lin Qi.

570
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,820
Money and articles

571
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,300
all have been taken away. Are you satisfied?

572
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,900
That is only a warm-up.

573
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,820
The show is about to begin.

574
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,460
Someone. Bring the victim.

575
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,780
You see. You see.

576
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,860
On the day when Your Highness
kidnapped the bridegroom,

577
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,820
you rode a horse on the street.

578
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,860
My leg was broken by the horse.

579
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,460
I am now a disabled man.

580
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,580
It has been long since that thing happened.

581
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,980
Why didn't you come here until today?

582
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,300
Proof. Please show me the proof.

583
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,540
Everyone knows that

584
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,340
you don't observe laws.

585
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,140
You galloped on the street carelessly.

586
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,540
It is not strange
that someone was knocked down by you.

587
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,700
Don't you think so?

588
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,060
You want to cheat me.

589
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,860
The leg...

590
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,260
I know that

591
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,300
I lost position and would be
subjected to humiliation.

592
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,340
I have nothing now

593
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,500
except my life.

594
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,260
If you want
to do anything with me, just do it.

595
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,860
Anyway, I am a worthless person.

596
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,820
I cannot resist you.

597
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,380
In that case,

598
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,380
please beat me.

599
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,740
Han Shuo.

600
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,060
I will deal with it.

601
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,300
Even if they move everything
out of Yueli Mansion,

602
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,660
I will support you.

603
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,260
That is real love.

604
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,860
I am here. Who dares to touch her?

605
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,500
In the past, I was a little bit afraid of you

606
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,940
because of your position.

607
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,380
But now, you are nothing but a civilian.

608
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,780
You are only the Crown Prince of Xuanhu City.

609
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,420
I want to see

610
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,140
how capable you can be.

611
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,540
Who dares to touch her?

612
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,020
Pei Heng.

613
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,620
Aren't they ministry footmen of the
late Minister of Defense Pei?

614
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,020
Yes. Minister Pei came too.

615
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,980
Yes. Why did he bring soldiers here?

616
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,420
Whether Qianqian
is still the Third Princess or not,

617
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,020
she is still my fiancée.

618
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,660
We have been engaged for more than ten years.

619
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,820
I will pay back

620
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,140
what she owed you.

621
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,460
Whether she owed you money or people,

622
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,460
you can go to Pei's Mansion
and settle the accounts.

623
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,380
Speaking about the leg,

624
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,220
you can take it from my body.

625
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,860
She is now a commoner.

626
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,180
She is not good enough for you.

627
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,340
Besides,

628
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,860
Han Shuo had drunk
Dragon Bone soup. He is robust.

629
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,380
Even if you wait for another two decades,

630
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,500
you will get nothing.

631
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,700
Whether Young Master Han
had drunk Dragon Bone soup or not,

632
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,300
the teacher and student relationship between

633
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,180
Qianqian and I will never change.

634
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,580
Minister Pei.

635
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,300
Qianqian's mother

636
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,540
is the City Owner.

637
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,180
Qianqian's sister

638
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,780
is the future City Owner.

639
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,780
Even though Qianqian is a commoner,

640
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,940
she is accompanied
by the young master of Xuanhu City.

641
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,620
She is still engaged to me.

642
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
Qianqian

643
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,660
is still the most honorable woman
in Huayuan City.

644
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,460
I know that you always protect her.

645
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,700
-Qianqian. -Qianqian.

646
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,300
I didn't use much force.

647
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,340
You are deceiving me.

648
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,620
Thanks.

649
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,940
Let me accompany you.

650
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,940
Take a rest early.

651
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,700
It feels good to be taken care of

652
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,780
in sickness.

653
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,140
I will leave after you fall into sleep.

654
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,700
I can't sleep.

655
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,500
Do you remember when we were kids,

656
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,180
if you couldn't sleep,

657
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,020
you would ask me to play the Qin for you.

658
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,020
If I didn't want to play,

659
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,740
you would punish me.

660
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,540
Pei Heng. You are so good to me.

661
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,300
Are you leaving?

662
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,500
It is getting late.

663
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,740
After all, we are not married.

664
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,260
OK. I shall let you go.

665
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,980
I will come back tomorrow morning.

666
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,660
The man of Huayuan City

667
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,580
can't be trusted.

668
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,300
He said he would not play the Qin.

669
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,140
Actually, he practices the Qin secretly
to seduce women.

670
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,660
He is shameless.

671
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,580
It is time to take medicine.

672
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,820
Why are you drinking so fast?

673
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,780
Isn't it because you pour
too much medicine into my mouth?

674
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,940
I can't play the Qin.

675
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,100
I can only feed you with medicine,

676
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,580
so that you can get well soon.

677
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,180
I don't need you to play Qin for me.

678
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,540
I am very grateful to you

679
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,980
for taking care of me.

680
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,340
In the past, I was alone when I got sick.

681
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,060
I am here with you this time.

682
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,700
Drink it.

683
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,460
In the past, when I got sick,

684
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,220
I also had to write script.

685
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,380
They would urge me to finish the script
if I hadn't finished it.

686
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,180
The film production crew
was waiting for my script.

687
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,500
What is film production?

688
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,380
I didn't dare to get sick.

689
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,780
I didn't have time for dating.

690
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,300
I couldn't write a good love drama.

691
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,580
I was mocked by actors.

692
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,180
Drink slowly.

693
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,900
What nonsense are you talking about?

694
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,540
You are the daughter of Her Majesty.

695
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,660
Who dares to force you?

696
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,860
You.

697
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,940
Big tiger.

698
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,420
I...

699
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,300
Her Highness has got sick.

700
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,540
She needs a good rest.

701
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,580
Tomorrow morning,

702
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,740
you should lock up the door.

703
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,900
No one is allowed to enter the house,

704
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,260
especially Pei Heng.

705
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,700
Understood.

706
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,180
Chen Qianqian

707
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,860
is really a long-lasting curse.

708
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,140
No one can beat her.

709
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,060
The business nowadays is not good.

710
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,460
We lost a lot of money.

711
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,220
Lady. You had better think more about

712
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,740
family businesses.

713
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,820
We only lost money on small businesses.

714
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,900
I can live on the mines of Lin family

715
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,380
for several lifetimes.

716
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,620
What do you worry about?

717
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,460
Though they are small businesses,

718
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,780
we can't let them lose more money.

719
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,780
Apart from other businesses,

720
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,860
in our family,

721
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,380
the most profitable businesses include mines

722
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,380
and the Music and Dance Academy.

723
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,700
But musicians
were taken away by the Third Princess.

724
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,500
Speaking about the Music
and Dance Academy, I am very angry.

725
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,540
Though the Second Princess
sent back all musicians.

726
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,100
If not Chen Qianqian,

727
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:48,940
could the business
of the Music and Dance Academy

728
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,660
be so bad?

729
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,180
She even allowed Lu Peng
to play the lead role.

730
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,980
Lady. Don't be mad.

731
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,300
Chen Qianqian is having a hard time too.

732
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,700
She is scolded by thousands of people

733
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,540
because of the case of Dragon Bone.

734
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,300
She will get worse.

735
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,100
She deserves it.

736
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,260
Zi Rui. Look.

737
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,020
These trees were planted by me.

738
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,260
Yes. Only a few trees are left.

739
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,700
You don't understand.

740
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,100
There is a saying goes,

741
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,980
if I have Han Shuo,
I will have everything in the world.

742
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,940
Though I have no money and power,

743
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,500
I live at ease.

744
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,020
I don't have to struggle for a living.

745
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,900
I am very happy.

746
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,540
Young Master Han is from Xuanhu City
and he has no power and influence here.

747
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,660
He even can't protect himself.

748
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,260
How could he protect you?

749
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,300
You don't know how capable he is.

750
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:37,740
Yes.

751
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,900
Don't be deceived by his appearance.

752
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,940
But you...

753
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,180
You are so weak.

754
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,820
Why are you standing in the wind?

755
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,580
Han Shuo. Eat fruit.

756
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,740
Is it sweet?

757
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,740
Yes.

758
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,900
Cooks in our family have all gone.

759
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,500
I asked Bai Ji to buy some food
from a restaurant.

760
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,540
Have a try

761
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,620
and see if you like it.

762
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,020
Why did you buy so much food?

763
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,700
It is too extravagant.

764
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,180
You know my situation.

765
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,740
I don't know
where my next meal is coming from.

766
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,380
If...

767
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,580
Please don't worry.

768
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,900
I have enough money

769
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,940
to support you.

770
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,620
Your money?

771
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,660
Are you talking about your dowry?

772
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,180
You should call them betrothal presents.

773
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,500
Something is wrong.

774
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,700
The small coffer
you brought from Xuanhu City.

775
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,420
If you say that they are dowry.

776
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,100
I have nothing to say.

777
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,060
But if you say
that they are betrothal presents,

778
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,380
shouldn't you give them to me?

779
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,220
You are right.

780
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,900
Young Master. Think it twice.

781
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,700
Do you want to manage my money?

782
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,060
No. No.

783
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,580
Why do you think that way?

784
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,780
I just want to make it clear.

785
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,420
Are they betrothal presents or dowry?

786
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,860
Bai Ji.

787
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,340
Bring the account book.

788
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,980
Why are you trying
to argue with Her Highness?

789
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,620
Let Her Highness
call them dowry if she likes.

790
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,460
There is one thing.

791
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,020
Since I have given you my account book,

792
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,220
shouldn't you call me husband instead?

793
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,780
What?

794
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,420
It doesn't matter.

795
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,180
You are a lady of dignity.

796
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,100
I will not force you.
