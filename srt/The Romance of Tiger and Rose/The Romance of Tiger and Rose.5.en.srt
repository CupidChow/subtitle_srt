(Episode 5)

24
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,260
The Second Princess is a good archer.

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,060
Her skill is not worse than yours
when you were young.

26
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,020
Good job!

27
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,900
Your Highness, you have great learning

28
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,140
and you're good at Kung Fu.

29
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,820
The Crown Princess Election is around the corner.

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,900
You have to practice hard.

31
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,940
I hope you can become a military officer.

32
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,460
I still need your support in the future.

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
Trust me.

34
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,540
We've been friends since childhood.

35
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,220
When you become the Crown Princess,

36
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,620
I'll do all I can to assist you.

37
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,980
As for the Crown Princess Election,

38
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,100
both Qianqian and I are candidates.

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,140
It's not known who can be elected.

40
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,700
Just wait and see.

41
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,620
Chen Qianqian couldn't make it.

42
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,540
Don't mention this matter again.

43
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,740
Your Highness.

44
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,820
Chen Qianqian!

45
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,580
Let's have a competition.

46
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,740
My wound hasn't healed.

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,020
When I'm fully recovered,

48
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,420
I'll defeat you to convince you.

49
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,580
When did you become so vulnerable?

50
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,460
It's just a joint dislocation.
It must have healed already.

51
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,900
You're just afraid

52
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,300
you'll lose, right?

53
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,380
Me?

54
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,140
Yes, I am.

55
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,020
I won't lose if I don't compete.

56
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,060
Chen Qianqian,

57
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,620
don't you feel ashamed?

58
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,980
Stay away from Minister Pei.

59
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,100
Why is she...

60
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,940
She can't...

61
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,740
Chen Qianqian can't do Kung Fu anymore?

62
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,660
Mother, you want to see me?

63
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,380
Qianqian, I hear you've
been diligent these days.

64
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,940
Yes. I've been quite obedient recently.

65
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,860
I've been overcautious

66
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,460
to avoid making trouble.

67
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,780
I hear

68
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,300
you've got more musicians in your mansion.

69
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,180
So, you want to live for enjoyment?

70
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,620
Have you forgotten that

71
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,420
you're a princess?

72
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,660
Mother, you're right.

73
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,900
I did it wrong.

74
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,980
No. Mother,

75
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,980
you misunderstood Chuchu.

76
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,100
It's Han Shuo

77
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,100
that sent those guys to her mansion.

78
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,580
She knew nothing about it.

79
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,900
Alright.

80
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,660
I know you care about your sister.

81
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,860
Stop making excuses for her.

82
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,220
Your Majesty,

83
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,540
as for the Crown Princess Election,

84
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,700
I have a suggestion.

85
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,780
I'm wondering if I should say it out.

86
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,900
Go ahead.

87
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,420
In Huayuan City, women have the decisive say.

88
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,660
Even Minister of Defense

89
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,020
is a woman.

90
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,580
The Crown Princess, as the future City Owner

91
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,460
should master both civil and military skills.

92
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,420
But over the years,

93
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,020
only a literacy test
and a discourse on politics

94
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,100
have been considered
during the Crown Princess Election.

95
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,060
Your Majesty,

96
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,020
how about letting all princesses
take a Kung Fu test?

97
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,020
A Kung Fu test?

98
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,220
Both the Second and the Third Princesses
are good at Kung Fu,

99
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,460
especially the latter.

100
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,260
She has extraordinary skill.

101
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,300
In Huayuan,

102
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,820
nobody dares to claim to be the first

103
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,820
if Chen Qianqian says she ranks second.

104
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,940
Does everyone think

105
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,460
I'm sure to fail in the competition

106
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,980
so that they want to give me
a chance to earn extra points?

107
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,020
How could Lin Qi be so nice to me?

108
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,740
The Second Princess Chen Chuchu
isn't the Her Majesty's real daughter.

109
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,460
Chen Chuchu isn't her real daughter?

110
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,780
And Chen Yuanyuan is disabled.

111
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,620
So, Chen Qianqian will be

112
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
the only successor of Huayuan City!

113
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,980
If we poison Chen Qianqian,

114
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
Her Majesty will certainly save her
with the Dragon Bone.

115
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,660
That'll be our chance to take it,

116
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,460
and your heart disease will be cured finally!

117
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,060
Young Master,

118
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,340
are you still thinking
about saving your own life

119
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,820
or Chen Qianqian's?

120
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,180
As for the tip-off given away,

121
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,500
I've found out who's the one behind that.

122
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,900
Who is it?

123
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,180
Lin Qi, how will they do the Kung Fu test?

124
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,780
By giving an open challenge.

125
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,380
Oh no. I've given myself away.

126
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,180
Lin Qi has found out I couldn't do Kung Fu.

127
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,660
No.

128
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
No way.

129
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,580
It's unfair.

130
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,380
Mother, think about it.

131
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,820
Everyone knows that I'm good at Kung Fu.

132
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,500
If a Kung Fu test is added,

133
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,660
everyone will think I've pulled strings.

134
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,180
It's unfair.

135
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,540
Mother.

136
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,020
Qianqian,

137
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,260
this is an exception we make for you.

138
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,580
I don't expect you to win out

139
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,700
in the literacy test
or about discourse on politics.

140
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,860
But the Kung Fu test,

141
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,020
you'll win, right?

142
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,300
No.

143
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,300
Don't be self-willed.

144
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,540
Qianqian, you're a skilled fighter.

145
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Remember to stop at
where it should when you fight.

146
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,380
Don't get others seriously injured.

147
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,380
What if

148
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,860
I'm injured by others?

149
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,020
You naughty girl.

150
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,100
If you let others do that on purpose,

151
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,060
I'll give you a heavy punishment.

152
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,340
Alright. So much for today.

153
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,100
No.

154
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,580
Lin Qi.

155
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,900
Your Highness,

156
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,900
your mother agreed to add a Kung Fu test

157
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,780
because she has placed great hopes on you.

158
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,460
Don't let her down.

159
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,740
Qianqian.

160
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,460
Chuchu.

161
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,100
When Lin Qi proposed to add a Kung Fu test,

162
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,180
why didn't you object to it?

163
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,740
It's against you.

164
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,660
Mother hasn't gone far.

165
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,340
Let's go talk to her.

166
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,220
Hurry.

167
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,780
A successor should be adept with both the pen
and the sword to convince people.

168
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,700
It's understandable to add a Kung Fu test.

169
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,980
If the two of us become rivals
during the test,

170
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,900
don't let me win

171
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,580
just because I'm your sister.

172
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,100
I wish I could do this.

173
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,060
You're forcing a donkey to dance.

174
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,620
We've been fighting since childhood.

175
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,740
I'm glad we'll finally have a showdown

176
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,780
with each other in an impressive way.

177
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,220
See you on the arena.

178
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,420
Life has finally decided to

179
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,540
teach me a good lesson.

180
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,620
Your Highness.

181
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,860
What's up?

182
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,300
You look unhappy.

183
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,260
No way.

184
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,180
I have to figure out a way
to avoid the Kung Fu test.

185
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,140
Han Shuo.

186
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,300
He can help me out.

187
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,260
Where did you get it?

188
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,580
In the backyard's kitchen.

189
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,260
The grocery guy said

190
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,060
it was custom-made for Zi Rui,
Chen Qianqian's servant.

191
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,540
He's ordered 500.

192
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,340
All of them are piled in the backyard.

193
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
I heard

194
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,100
Chuchu was going to catch
a spy of Xuanhu City

195
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,140
and I specially went to help you out.

196
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,700
I had no idea you'd put me in that situation.

197
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,860
Han Shuo,

198
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,980
I've really taken pains to help you.

199
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,580
Why on earth did you try to save me?

200
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,220
Because I'm on your side.

201
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,100
Could it be

202
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,780
she misled me on purpose

203
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,780
to gain my trust?

204
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,620
Not only do I know your birthday date,

205
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,140
I also know you are 186cm in height,

206
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,620
you weigh 75 kg, your blood type is O.

207
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,020
You like black,

208
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,620
don't like rainy days,

209
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,140
your favorite food is noodle soup
cooked by your mom,

210
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
you don't like ginger.

211
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,180
No wonder she knows me well.

212
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,580
It turns out she has investigated me.

213
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,580
She's making a fool of me.

214
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,900
The Third Princess

215
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,900
is not guarded against me at all.

216
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,620
She even induced me to lower my guard.

217
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,740
She's sinister and insidious.

218
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,420
Seemingly, she was devoted to me
and got me out of trouble,

219
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,020
but actually, she framed me

220
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,540
with a tip-off.

221
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,700
Young Master,

222
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,260
the doctor said

223
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,340
you couldn't lose your temper.

224
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,740
Chen Qianqian is just a bitch.

225
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,180
Young Master.

226
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,020
Han Shuo, help me.

227
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
I don't want to compete.

228
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,020
I don't want to do tests.

229
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,740
I don't want to be the Crown Princess.

230
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,740
Is he asleep?

231
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,660
Your Highness.

232
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,820
You're asking me to save him?

233
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,380
If anything happens to him,

234
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,700
I won't leave it at that.

235
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,660
Han Shuo.

236
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,100
Zi Rui.

237
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,140
Go away.

238
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,740
Han Shuo.

239
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,940
Beast!

240
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,420
Let go of our Young Master.

241
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,660
Can't you see he's in danger?

242
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,620
Go open the window wider
and give him more fresh air.

243
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,260
Hurry.

244
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,340
Go open the window wider
and give him more fresh air.

245
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,140
Hurry.

246
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,980
Han Shuo. Where is the medicine?

247
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,220
Quick-Acting Heart Reliever
or Ginseng lozenge.

248
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,340
Anything that can save his life.

249
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,700
Medicine. Hurry up.

250
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,580
Here it is.

251
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Such a big pill?

252
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,740
He's fainted. Do you want
to choke him to death?

253
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,940
Please save...

254
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,300
The taste...

255
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,180
You're awake?

256
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,220
You're finally awake.

257
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,700
You can't die, Han Shuo.

258
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,620
Luckily...

259
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,140
Don't you want to see me die?

260
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,980
Stop your false display of affection.

261
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,820
This...

262
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,900
This bamboo tube...

263
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,820
Right.

264
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,020
Bamboo tube.

265
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,420
Someone made a sealing wax bamboo tube

266
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,460
and tried to frame me for colluding
with Xuanhu's spy.

267
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,660
Do you still remember?

268
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,780
I'm done for.

269
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,620
You knew it?

270
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,260
I'm done for.

271
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,180
Why did I say it out?

272
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,020
How will you explain it?

273
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,300
Why did you frame me?

274
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,900
Why did you lie to me?

275
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
Don't panic.

276
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,260
Let me think about it.

277
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,220
I...

278
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,220
I did it wrong.

279
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,900
Your Highness,

280
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,140
even if you did it wrong,

281
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,380
you can't kneel down.

282
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,980
Girls of Huayuan are dignified.

283
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,660
You can only kneel to Heaven,
Earth and Her Majesty.

284
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,140
How can you kneel to your husband?

285
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,180
Get up.

286
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,460
My legs are too weak. I can't stand up.

287
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,740
Get up.

288
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
My legs are weak.

289
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,220
I really did it wrong.

290
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,100
I don't understand.

291
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,980
What did you do wrong?

292
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,660
As for you colluding with Xuanhu's spy,

293
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,740
I made it up.

294
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,500
I told Chuchu to catch you,

295
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,860
but I really didn't put any defense map

296
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,060
on the boat.

297
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,940
I couldn't really get you into trouble.

298
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,940
I know you've known the truth.

299
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,340
I didn't aim to hide you from it,

300
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,380
or

301
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,700
I must have long destroyed

302
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,900
such an obvious evidence.

303
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,140
Right?

304
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,780
Yes. That's right.

305
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,660
If we aimed to hide you,

306
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,660
we couldn't have ordered 500 bamboo tubes.

307
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,180
Right.

308
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,580
And we couldn't have
placed them in the backyard.

309
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,620
I'm not stupid.

310
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,460
Five hundred?

311
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,460
In the backyard?

312
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
That explains how they found it out.

313
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,900
Come on. You and Bai Ji
are really a good match.

314
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,780
Han Shuo,

315
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,980
do you know why I did that?

316
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,740
Why?

317
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,020
I just wanted you

318
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,740
to think highly of me.

319
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,860
Since the first time we met,

320
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,900
I've known from your eyes that

321
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,460
you dislike me.

322
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,660
I don't care what other people think of me.

323
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,660
But I don't want you to look down upon me

324
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,580
or misunderstand me.

325
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,540
I tried to frame you,

326
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,580
just because I wanted to have a chance

327
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,140
to save you

328
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,700
after putting you in trouble.

329
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,140
In this case, you'd change
your attitude towards me

330
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,260
and trust me more.

331
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,100
Right?

332
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,100
Do you mean

333
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,420
you framed me

334
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,260
to win my favor?

335
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,940
You can say that.

336
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,620
Colluding with the enemy is a capital crime.

337
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,860
How can you do that

338
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,780
to show your affection for me?

339
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,460
I'm afraid

340
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,020
I can't afford to bear it.

341
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,540
We won't believe you again.

342
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
I know

343
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,980
I did it in a very stupid way.

344
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,980
If you really don't believe me,

345
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,060
I'll order them

346
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,140
to make fireworks

347
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,260
with the rest 498 bamboo tubes

348
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,740
to show my apology, okay?

349
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,980
Great.

350
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,900
What do you mean?

351
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,540
I mean the moonlight tonight will be great.

352
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,100
How about you and me

353
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,860
enjoy the glorious moon in the garden?

354
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,620
And then?

355
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,900
We can drink some vintage wine.

356
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,740
(Qingfeng Tea House)

357
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,740
Dear all,

358
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,180
here is the story.

359
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,020
After knowing that orange
made a fool of him,

360
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,100
banana changed his mind again
and decided to kill her.

361
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,300
Is there anything

362
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,100
we can do to turn the tide

363
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,980
so that orange can be saved?

364
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,700
Orange is really tough.

365
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,260
I can't believe she's still alive.

366
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,580
It's because banana is
so merciful and kind-hearted

367
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,980
as to spare her life.

368
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,300
She framed him

369
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,140
and then deceived him with sweet words.

370
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,420
She deserves more than death.

371
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,380
You can't say that.

372
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,180
It's not all orange's fault.

373
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,900
She didn't mean it. Right?

374
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,620
She has a stupid teammate

375
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,540
who got things wrong.

376
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,180
Your Highness,

377
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,620
do you know

378
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,420
what banana's Achilles' heel is?

379
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,580
He is born with a weak heart.

380
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,740
He couldn't live to 20.

381
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,660
If orange helps banana get cured,

382
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,740
he may give up the idea of killing her.

383
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,580
Your Highness,

384
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,780
when we create a story,

385
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,100
we'll let the protagonists return
a favor with a favor.

386
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,300
You're nice to him

387
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,220
and he'll pay you back.

388
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,780
But I'm not a doctor.

389
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,420
There is no medicine that can cure him.

390
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,940
How can I get...

391
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,500
Dragon Bone?

392
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,100
Oh, my god.

393
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,940
One of the main reasons

394
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,220
Han Shuo agreed to marry into Huayuan City

395
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,580
was to get Dragon Bone

396
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,900
and cure himself.

397
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,820
In my original script,

398
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,580
Chuchu made a lot of preparations
to get Dragon Bone for Han Shuo

399
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,460
after she became the Crown Princess.

400
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,620
Then he began to regard her
with special respect.

401
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,460
If I can get Dragon Bone

402
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,900
and cure Han Shuo's heart disease,

403
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,700
he's sure to let me go.

404
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,820
What's wrong?

405
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,580
Your Highness,

406
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,700
Dragon Bone is Huayuan City's
most precious treasure.

407
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,660
To stop others casting greedy eyes on it,

408
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,900
only Her Majesty and her successor

409
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,580
know where it is.

410
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,340
We're just common people.

411
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,940
We even don't dare to dream of it,

412
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,140
let alone write it down in a story.

413
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,180
Dragon Bone can never be used

414
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,140
to cure any disease.

415
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,540
Your Highness,

416
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,980
such a thing has never happened before.

417
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,820
It can, because I said so.

418
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,500
Who am I?

419
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,620
I'm the Third Princess
who's afraid of nothing.

420
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,660
Get up.

421
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,300
Your Highness, please think twice.

422
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,900
Get up.

423
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,380
Do you know how to eat a banana?

424
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,260
By peeling it.

425
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,500
Exactly. By peeling it.

426
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,020
This time, I'll peel him.

427
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,100
How dare he fight a screenwriter?

428
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,660
Let me show you how
I'll become a drama queen.

429
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,740
Dragon Bone.

430
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,780
Dragon Bone protects Huayuan.

431
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,060
Dragon Bone...

432
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,100
Enough. Madam. It's annoying.

433
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,340
Your Highness,

434
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,140
Dragon Bone is Huayuan City's rare treasure.

435
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,940
It's been handed down for generations.

436
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,100
Only Her Majesty
and the Crown Princess can touch it.

437
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,180
I remember it's put here
according to the script.

438
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,900
What does it look like?

439
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,420
Could it be...

440
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,300
Dragon Bone is not here.

441
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,380
Right. It's not here.

442
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
Not here?

443
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,340
Stop lying.

444
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,980
Drop the act.

445
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,220
Dragon Bone must be here.

446
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,740
Your Highness, you can't do this.

447
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,300
Your Highness.

448
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,420
Your Highness,

449
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,580
your mother has told you about this?

450
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,300
Is it all cut and dried

451
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,740
before the Crown Princess Election is held?

452
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,180
Your Highness, stop searching.

453
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,620
Please, Your Highness.

454
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,940
Your Highness, think twice.

455
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,260
Dragon Bone is Huayuan City's
most precious treasure.

456
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,380
It'll be handed on from age to age.

457
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,540
If you want to touch it,

458
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,380
you must take a bath and burn incense.

459
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,980
You must also ask the Administration
of Heavenly Observatory about a lucky day.

460
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,580
And you need Her Majesty's approval

461
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,980
and all officials to be there
as eyewitnesses.

462
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,980
If

463
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,780
Her Majesty doesn't approve

464
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,300
or the Administration of Heavenly Observatory
can't find a lucky day,

465
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,700
anyone who touches it will be executed.

466
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,020
You'll be killed, Your Highness.

467
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,420
It...

468
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,780
That's the relics...

469
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,620
Beautiful.

470
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,340
...found among the cremated ashes of

471
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,780
your great-grandmother after she passed away.

472
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,500
Amitabha.

473
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,660
Your Highness.

474
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,140
I did it wrong.

475
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,380
It...

476
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,660
Your Highness,

477
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,620
this is the colorful coronet used
by the first City Owner

478
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,700
when she founded Huayuan City.

479
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,140
It has no equal in this world.

480
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,900
I'm sorry.

481
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,700
I'll put it back.

482
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,620
It...

483
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,980
It's easy. I was too excited.

484
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,660
I didn't touch her.

485
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,620
Sorry.

486
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,500
I'm sorry.

487
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,460
Sorry.

488
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,100
Your Highness.

489
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,700
Your Highness, please spare us.

490
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,100
You can't do that.

491
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,580
Your Highness.

492
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,540
Dragon Bone?

493
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,300
Your Highness.

494
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,340
Heaven wants to destroy Huayuan!

495
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,260
I can't live anymore.

496
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
I have to die at my post.

497
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,540
Don't.

498
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,020
If I don't die today,

499
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,540
I'm sure to report it to Her Majesty.

500
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,940
Don't let her go anywhere.

501
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,940
Sorry, madam.

502
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,780
No wonder they say

503
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,540
the Third Princess can't be entrusted
with any important post.

504
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,620
Your Highness, you've got Dragon Bone.

505
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,700
What to do?

506
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,700
Stew it.

507
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,660
Okay. Stew it.

508
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,820
Stew...

509
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,860
Your Highness, please spare us.

510
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,060
Spare my life.

511
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,260
Fine.

512
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,780
You cowards.

513
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,380
I won't get you into trouble.
I'll do it myself.

514
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,100
Heat up water.

515
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,420
Add star anise to remove the fishy flavor.

516
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,980
Don't, Your Highness.

517
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,420
Think twice, Your Highness.

518
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,140
Why does it stink so much?

519
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,380
Is it edible?

520
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,540
Anyway, we're stewing it.

521
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,660
Your Highness.

522
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,340
Young Master Han has prepared
good wine and delicacies.

523
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,780
He asked me to take you to the garden.

524
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,900
What will be, will be.

525
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,100
Okay.

526
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,620
Tell your Young Master

527
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,660
I'll...

528
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,420
I'll be there soon.

529
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,980
Got it.

530
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,980
I tried to show my concern for him,

531
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,540
but he wants to kill me.

532
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,020
Such being the case,

533
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,900
get me a chair.

534
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,020
What does Her Highness want to do?

535
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,780
Mind your own business.

536
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,900
She even dares to stew Dragon Bone.

537
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,380
There is nothing she doesn't dare to do.

538
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,980
Prop master, is the wine prepared?

539
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,900
Yes, it is.

540
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,740
As you wish,

541
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,740
it's a cup of water. You couldn't get drunk.

542
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,900
Actor, have you recited your lines?

543
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,780
It's a little long,

544
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,780
but I'm good at it.

545
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,020
I still need a special effect artist.

546
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,500
You.

547
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,380
Go boil down some syrup.

548
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,660
Make it thicker and redder.
Like real blood. Got it?

549
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,820
Got it.

550
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,300
Besides, have the bamboo tubes been remade?

551
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,860
Yes, as you ordered.

552
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,820
Four hundred and ninety-eight bangs.

553
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,860
You can count if you don't believe.

554
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,140
Next, it depends on my
on-the-spot performance.

555
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,260
Tonight, in the garden,

556
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,380
do everything at my command.

557
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,020
Obey my orders.

558
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,580
We have to succeed at one go.

559
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,500
There is no second chance.

560
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,300
Got it?

561
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,020
-Got it. -Got it.

562
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,100
Remember.

563
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,380
Fireworks will be our signal.

564
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,940
Remember.

565
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,580
Fireworks will be our signal.

566
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,420
This time, either we succeed
in catching Xuanhu's spy,

567
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,940
or we die.

568
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,340
Even so, you don't need to risk your life.

569
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,140
Everything has been set.

570
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,780
There is no risk at all.

571
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,340
It's heavily guarded.

572
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:08,980
Remember.

573
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,100
Without my order,

574
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,100
don't act rashly to give away yourselves.

575
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,740
Set out.

576
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,980
Got it.

577
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,660
What?

578
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,860
You can leave.

579
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,580
Why so flustered?

580
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,900
I knew Chuchu

581
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,820
had gone to catch Xuanhu's spy.

582
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,020
The Third Princess...

583
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,300
She...

584
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,740
What could she do to shock you?

585
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,540
She can just cause some tiny little troubles.

586
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,060
There is nothing to be surprised at.

587
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,820
The Third Princess...

588
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,940
She broke into the ancestral hall.

589
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,940
Did she tear it down?

590
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,780
She took Dragon Bone away.

591
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,860
She's so disobedient.

592
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,620
I'll hit her to death today.

593
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,860
Let's go to Yueli Mansion.

594
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

595
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,100
Han Shuo, sorry for having kept you waiting.

596
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,580
Han Shuo.

597
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,220
I'll ask you for the last time.

598
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,700
I'm feeling a little under the weather.

599
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,620
Is it okay

600
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,420
if I don't drink?

601
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,060
I took the good wine here from Xuanhu City.

602
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,900
It's top-quality.

603
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,100
Have a taste.

604
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,020
There is no harm in trying it.

605
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,020
Okay.

606
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,700
In this case,

607
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,820
you know what I'm like when I get drunk,

608
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,300
so I'll make things clear before we start.

609
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,820
I know I'm stupid.

610
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,340
I'm good for nothing.

611
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,700
I'm terrible at studying.

612
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,460
I often go to the Music and Dance Academy.

613
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,780
My mother often scolded me.

614
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,220
She said it was difficult
to alter my character

615
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,980
and I was hopeless,

616
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,780
like scrap iron.

617
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,580
I think you did a good job,

618
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,580
especially in playing dumb
to get what you want.

619
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,780
It's amazing.

620
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,620
Well. You too.

621
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,820
Drinking three cups of wine is
a good way to show respect.

622
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,300
I'll drink up three cups first.

623
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,300
Han Shuo, since you came here,

624
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,500
you've been having a rough time.

625
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,140
Actually,

626
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,660
the first time

627
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,980
I saw you and decided to marry you,

628
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,860
I've found that you're in poor health

629
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,940
by observing your looks.

630
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,020
After these days we spent together,

631
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,300
I found out

632
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,020
you had always been bothered
by your heart disease.

633
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,260
It makes me quite worried.

634
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,180
Don't.

635
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,380
I haven't finished my words.

636
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,620
Han Shuo,

637
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,820
I know I did a lot of things wrong,

638
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,900
but I was forced to.

639
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,620
You're so broad-minded and generous

640
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,820
that you've forgiven me,

641
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,540
but I still feel very guilty deep inside.

642
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,140
As the saying goes,

643
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,860
one day together as husband and wife
means endless devotion the rest of your life.

644
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,020
A couple is a team.

645
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,820
I'll definitely think about your interests

646
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,580
no matter what I do.

647
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,180
So,

648
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,140
I've got you

649
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,380
a guiding drug

650
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,820
to make sure you can be cured

651
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,300
and the two of us will
live together until old age.

652
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,060
To cure my disease,

653
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,300
you have to get one thing.

654
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,460
Do you know what it is?

655
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,100
Dragon Bone.

656
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,380
I've got it for you.

657
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,060
You must be joking.

658
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,020
Dragon Bone is so precious.

659
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,540
How could you get it so easily?

660
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,780
You don't believe?

661
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,220
In this case,

662
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,540
you can go have a look in the kitchen.

663
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,820
It's being stewed.

664
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,260
Based on the cooking time,

665
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,860
I think it's almost ready.

666
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,540
If you're interested,

667
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,740
you can also smell it.

668
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,500
Young Master,

669
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,500
a pot of water turns into a bowl of soup.

670
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,700
All the essence is condensed here.

671
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,980
Dragon Bone

672
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,140
is Huayuan City's most precious treasure.

673
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,580
Did Chen Qianqian really get it
for our Young Master?

674
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,780
Of course.

675
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,380
It's absolutely true.

676
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,420
Legend has it that

677
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,260
the first City Owner of Huayuan

678
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,380
found this medicinal material by accident.

679
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,420
It can remove all poison
and cure all disease.

680
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,860
It's considered as an auspicious sign
and named Dragon Bone.

681
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,020
The founder of Huayuan got Dragon Bone

682
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,380
and then the black stone mine

683
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,500
before she founded the city.

684
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,140
Every City Owner of Huayuan believes

685
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,540
the city is safe because of Dragon Bone

686
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,060
and the city develops because of the mine.

687
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,020
You can keep exploiting the mine,

688
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,380
but there is only one piece of Dragon Bone.

689
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,380
Don't you think it's precious?

690
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,180
Stop bragging.

691
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,980
Pitifully,

692
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,740
the Third Princess has stewed Dragon Bone

693
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,260
so that Young Master Han can get cured,

694
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,540
but what will she do

695
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,940
when her mother blames her

696
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,020
for doing that?

697
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,540
The smell explains why it's most precious.

698
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,060
Is Chen Qianqian really so nice to me?

699
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,540
Young Master, she's still in the garden.

700
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,420
Damn.

701
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,220
The terrain is open ahead.

702
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,460
Let's branch out into two columns.

703
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,980
Launch a converging attack
when you see fireworks.

704
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,980
Be careful.

705
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,820
Don't let them find us and escape.

706
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,460
Got it.

707
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,820
Want to fight me?

708
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,700
Now that you're a character in a script,

709
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,140
the screenwriter has the final say.

710
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,500
Even if you force me into a corner,

711
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,420
I can still

712
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,420
turn things around.

713
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Qianqian, no!

714
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:54,940
Qianqian.

715
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,820
Han Shuo.

716
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,860
The wine is poisoned. Don't drink it.

717
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,740
Han Shuo.

718
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,980
Be careful!

719
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,460
Qianqian. Qianqian.

720
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,140
Qianqian.

721
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,700
Chen Qianqian, don't die!

722
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,900
Hurry up.

723
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,940
Hurry.

724
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,820
(Yueli Mansion)
Hurry.

725
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,820
Your Majesty.

726
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,860
Why did I have such a disobedient daughter?

727
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,140
Go to the kitchen.

728
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

729
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,260
(Yueli Mansion)

730
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,420
Can you get Dragon Bone out?

731
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Please spare my life.

732
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,620
It's melted.

733
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,260
The Third Princess ordered us to do it.

734
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,780
What a disobedient girl.

735
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,540
I'll beat her to death,

736
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,900
or I don't deserve to be the City Owner.

737
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,860
Your Majesty.

738
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,060
Your Majesty, the Third Princess is poisoned.

739
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,060
What?

740
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,140
How is she doing?

741
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,700
I'm not sure if she's alive or not.

742
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,580
It...

743
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,460
Your Majesty, don't panic.

744
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,580
Dragon Bone can remove all poison
and cure all disease.

745
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,100
Send for Yuanyuan.

746
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

747
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,140
Sangqi,

748
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,500
take Dragon Bone and follow me.

749
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

750
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
You good-for-nothings.

751
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,820
Your Highness, what do you think?

752
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,740
I don't think it's fatal.

753
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,260
As for the rest,

754
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,940
I'm not sure.

755
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,380
Hurry. Take Dragon Bone here.

756
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,380
Young Master.

757
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:36,980
Han Shuo,

758
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,820
Dragon Bone is Huayuan City's
most precious treasure.

759
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,100
It can remove all poison
and cure all disease.

760
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,380
There has been only one piece
in the past 1,000 years.

761
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,580
I see.

762
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,780
Qianqian got it for you

763
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,180
at the risk of her life.

764
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,700
Won't you take it

765
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,580
to cure your heart disease?

766
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,220
She has done so much for me.

767
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,700
I can't let her die like this.

768
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,220
As I said, the Third Princess is alright.

769
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,180
Dragon Bone deserves its reputation.

770
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,460
It works like a charm.

771
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,460
Maybe I'm not seriously poisoned,

772
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,340
so I get better with only one sip.

773
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,620
Han Shuo,

774
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,940
it can cure your heart disease.

775
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,220
Take it.

776
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,700
It took me so much effort

777
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,220
to get Dragon Bone,

778
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,940
but you're not grateful at all.

779
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,580
Take it now.

780
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,580
I don't dare to.

781
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,900
My only wish

782
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,900
is to cure your heart disease.

783
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,900
If you don't take it,

784
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,740
I'll be heartbroken. I feel dizzy.
I want to die.

785
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,780
Your Highness, calm down.

786
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,940
Anxiety is bad for your health.

787
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,940
Take it.

788
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,340
She's threatening you with her own life.

789
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,860
Under the circumstances...

790
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,780
I know.

791
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,740
I know I let you down

792
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,580
because of the bamboo tube thing.

793
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,700
I feel guilty of you.

794
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,860
When you had heart attacks that day...

795
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,460
I don't have the heart to see you suffer.

796
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,260
Drink the Dragon Bone soup.

797
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,100
Drink it immediately.

798
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,860
Otherwise, it will become stinkier when it's cold.

799
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,380
How are you feeling?

800
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,820
Are you feeling full of energy?

801
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,020
I'm not feeling anything special.

802
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,860
It's just...

803
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,820
You've taken Dragon Bone.

804
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,420
Your heart disease will be cured.

805
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,300
You're sure to recover

806
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,140
after taking Dragon Bone.

807
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,300
In this case,

808
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,700
I'll

809
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,660
be relieved.

810
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,020
Hurry.

811
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,700
Mother?

812
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,980
Qianqian, you're really awake?

813
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,340
Mother, I'm fine.

814
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,140
Go back and rest up.

815
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,420
Qianqian,

816
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,300
you're feeling sorry for me now?

817
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,380
Why didn't you think about me

818
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,180
when you decided to stew Dragon Bone?

819
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,340
It has been handed down
for so many generations,

820
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,180
but now it's destroyed.

821
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,340
How should I explain to my ancestors?

822
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,100
How could the common people and officials

823
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,300
let you go?

824
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,900
Mother, I did it wrong. I'm sorry.

825
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,940
Your Majesty.

826
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,740
Take it.

827
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,060
Mother.

828
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,460
Don't be afraid.

829
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
You've just stewed one piece of Dragon Bone.

830
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,700
I'll protect you.

831
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,580
As long as I'm here,

832
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,060
nobody can hurt you.

833
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,460
Alright. Take it.

834
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,100
