23

(Episode 8)

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,140
(Xiangtai Restaurant)

25
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,580
Give me a grape.

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,940
The biggest one.

27
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,700
Give me a date.

28
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,980
Why is it so noisy there?

29
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,100
Suddenly there was a loud bang.

30
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,540
Guess what?

31
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,300
What's up?

32
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,700
There was an explosion in the mine.

33
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,700
The Third Princess saw it.

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,980
She rushed to the exit.

35
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,740
She began to remove the stones by hand

36
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,660
to save the people below.

37
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,020
It was not long before

38
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,100
Lin Qi, along with her family,

39
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,100
hurried to the scene.

40
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,300
Lin Qi

41
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,620
had been at odds
with the Third Princess since childhood.

42
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,860
Now,

43
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,980
she saw the Third Princess had destroyed
her family's black stone mine.

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,500
She got very furious.

45
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,660
Would she let it go easily?

46
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,620
Definitely not.

47
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,580
No.

48
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,260
Yeah.

49
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,380
Lin Qi gnashed her teeth and said:

50
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,700
"Whoever kills the Third Princess
will get huge reward."

51
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,340
Huge reward?

52
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,260
Do you know

53
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,220
what the Third Princess was doing at that time?

54
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,140
What?

55
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,220
She took no notice of Lin Qi's words

56
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,900
and still kept removing
the stones like crazy.

57
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,700
Her ten fingers were bleeding heavily

58
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,060
with her skin cut open and flesh torn.

59
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,660
You could even see the bones inside.

60
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,940
The knuckles were also disjointed.

61
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,860
But she didn't stop.

62
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,980
She kept removing the stones.

63
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,820
She was intent on saving all the people.

64
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,940
Just at the critical moment when Lin Qi
and everyone surrounded the Third Princess

65
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,660
and were about to kill her,

66
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,780
luckily, Young Master Han was by her side

67
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,980
and protected her.

68
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,340
Wearing a plain blue topcoat

69
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,980
and holding a Breeze Sword in hand,

70
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,820
Young Master Han was like a real killer

71
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,460
with awe-inspiring looking
and bellicose presence.

72
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,380
With him guarding a place,

73
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,100
even ten thousand people
could not get through.

74
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,380
Great.

75
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,020
He wielded the sword,
all the people fell to the ground.

76
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,900
Blood flowed like a river.

77
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,580
Wherever his sword went,

78
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,980
all living creatures

79
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,140
became dead bodies.

80
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,060
It was like a living hell.

81
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,780
Why was Young Master Han so powerful?

82
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,100
Who was his teacher and where was he from?

83
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,700
If you want to learn more,

84
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,820
please listen to the next chapter.

85
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,140
Tell us more.

86
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,900
Yeah. Tell us more. I want to hear it.

87
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,420
Let me eat it myself.

88
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,220
Is it good?

89
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,220
I also want it.

90
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,340
Do you want it?

91
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,940
Not for you.

92
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,460
So sweet.

93
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,220
You want me to eat this?

94
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,780
It's enough. It'll be a waste of food
if you cannot finish it off.

95
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,300
There was merely an explosion
in our family's mine.

96
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,620
Why do I have to be treated like this?

97
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,260
Lady, I know that

98
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,260
you and the Third Princess have been
fighting with each other since childhood.

99
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,380
Even though you've never won
in all these years,

100
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,860
you just ended up breaking something
or losing some money.

101
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,500
It was no big deal.

102
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,980
But since the Third Princess got married,

103
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,820
she was like getting God's help.

104
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,660
Lady, look at this account book.

105
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,420
It's all in the red.

106
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,020
It's all caused by the Third Princess.

107
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,300
Our family has lost

108
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,300
the Music and Dance Academy and the mine.

109
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,460
Now, we have only the restaurant
to barely get by.

110
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,940
Lady, you'd better

111
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,740
live a more frugal life later.

112
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,700
Chen Qianqian...

113
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,460
(Blew up the Fortune Lode - Found the Black Water Mine -)

114
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,620
(Solved the Problem - Twist - Saved the miners)

115
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,700
Blew up the fortune lode,

116
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,860
saved the miners,

117
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,100
found the black water mine

118
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,860
and solved her own problem.

119
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,580
Suddenly, the story has taken a new twist.

120
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,460
What a drama!

121
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,780
But none of these things
were done by the heroine.

122
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,540
Had I known it,
I would have persuaded Chuchu to do more,

123
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,900
which could have brought more credit to her

124
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,020
and made it more possible

125
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,060
for her to be the City Owner.

126
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,820
At that time, your life was in dire danger.

127
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,660
But you were still thinking
about other person's credit.

128
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,700
Pei Heng.

129
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,100
I have just said that I would express
my gratitude personally to you.

130
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,900
I didn't expect you to come.

131
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,460
The other day,

132
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,900
it was you who took me out.

133
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,140
There is no need for us
to say thank you to each other.

134
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,460
Qianqian.

135
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,060
Now, everyone holds you

136
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,300
in deep respect.

137
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,460
You deserve to be the Third Princess.

138
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,820
There're so many people saying it

139
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,100
that I feel embarrassed.

140
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,940
Many people?

141
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,460
Who else?

142
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,900
Han Shuo?

143
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,340
The other day I saw Han Shuo
step forward bravely to protect you.

144
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,940
For the first time I admired
men from Xuanhu City.

145
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,700
They can learn literary knowledge,
practice Kung Fu and lead troops in a battle.

146
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,380
In times of crisis,

147
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,100
they can

148
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,620
step forward to protect their women.

149
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,140
It doesn't matter that
you don't practice Kung Fu.

150
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,580
I don't practice Kung Fu.

151
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,580
What's more,

152
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,580
it's not that only those who practice Kung Fu

153
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,820
can lead troops in a battle.

154
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,940
Pei Heng, do you believe me?

155
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,380
Believe you in what?

156
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,460
I have a hunch that

157
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,260
in the future you will be a

158
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,540
famous leader of the City Guards,

159
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,340
taking on the mantle
of Minister of Defense Pei.

160
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,660
Minister of Defense?

161
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,580
But in Huayuan City,

162
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,860
there has never been a man
who became Minister of Defense.

163
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,060
Whatever you do, there'll be the first time.

164
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,140
Why can't you be the first one?

165
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,580
What's more,

166
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,300
although you are a man,

167
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,580
you have taken the position
of Minister of Education.

168
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,740
It's unprecedented in history.

169
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,740
One's prospect is not related to his gender.

170
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,100
Not related to his gender?

171
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,980
It's just like when you
were saving those miners

172
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,700
you didn't consider whether the people below

173
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,620
was a man or a woman.

174
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,500
Yes.

175
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,140
No wonder after Her Majesty
resumed your identity,

176
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,220
she asked me to oversee your learning.

177
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,380
She places great hopes
on your Crown Princess Election.

178
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,100
Qianqian.

179
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,620
If you get the first place
in the Crown Princess Election

180
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,700
and become the Crown Princess,

181
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,140
you can surely take on great responsibilities
of all common people.

182
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,940
After making such a scene,

183
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,260
I still cannot avoid Crown Princess Election.

184
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,940
No. I won't go.

185
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,100
I won't take the test.

186
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,620
Do not fall short of everyone's expectations.

187
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,380
I think that those people
who made me offer sacrifice to Heaven

188
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,540
are the same ones as those

189
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,940
who now want me to join Crown Princess Election.

190
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,260
No matter which I choose, offering sacrifice to Heaven
or joining the Crown Princess Election,

191
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,100
they don't want me to feel good.

192
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,100
Better late than never.

193
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,980
I'll help you get the first place
in the election.

194
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,460
But I don't have the least intention
of being the Crown Princess.

195
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,580
(Aiming High)

196
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,980
There are so many books.

197
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,340
Han Shuo, you don't need to come.

198
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,700
Be careful.

199
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,460
It is related to the Third Princess' future.

200
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,820
Minister Pei...

201
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,740
Even an outsider like
Minister Pei comes to help you.

202
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,420
I am the male owner of Yueli Mansion.

203
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,940
Without doubt,

204
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,460
I must help her.

205
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,500
Qianqian.

206
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,500
The character has been wrongly written.

207
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,540
(Noble birth, Spur the horse, Safe and sound)

208
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,940
Which one?

209
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,940
This one.

210
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,540
It should be like this.

211
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,100
Now when I write a stroke on your back,

212
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,220
you write the same one on the paper.

213
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,500
Okay, done.

214
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,540
(Respectful form of you)

215
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,460
It's correct this time.

216
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,580
"Ni(you)" should be above "Xin(heart)"
(A pun, also means you are in my heart.)

217
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,340
Well, you'd better

218
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,140
help me with my homework immediately.

219
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,780
Qianqian.

220
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,500
I studied

221
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,620
all the literary test paper
of Crown Princess Election

222
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,420
and found some regular patterns in it.

223
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,140
On this basis,

224
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,340
I drafted some test questions

225
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,300
and made comments on them.

226
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,420
If you have any question,

227
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,900
make sure to ask me.

228
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,260
Recently, you should resist
the temptation to play.

229
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,820
The literary test is the first part
of the Crown Princess Election.

230
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,940
You can't afford to be careless.

231
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,620
So many questions!

232
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,220
It seems that Minister Pei
does not know Qianqian very well.

233
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,380
(Pei Heng's Election Test Outline)

234
00:11:59,380 --> 00:11:59,700
(Northern Xia Prince Han Shuo's Account Book)

235
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,340
There are so many questions here.

236
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,980
She won't try to answer these questions,

237
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,220
nor will she even take a look at them.

238
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,300
It's good that I also looked through

239
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,220
all the literary test paper
of the Crown Princess Election.

240
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,740
I also found some regular patterns

241
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,980
and drafted some test questions.

242
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,540
But they are all in this slim volume.

243
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,580
These questions are all carefully chosen.

244
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,700
If you memorize all the questions in it,

245
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,260
you can easily pass the test.

246
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,540
You carefully chose these questions.

247
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,380
Are you predicting the test questions or
are you simply revealing the questions?

248
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,180
Tell me the truth.

249
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,940
Did you get these questions illegally,

250
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,620
like, if discovered,
you would be sent to prison?

251
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,820
You can rest assured that

252
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,420
if you study this book carefully,

253
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,580
you will surely pass the test.

254
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,900
Young Master Han, I think you are overconfident.

255
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,020
You know that

256
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,300
this test is related to Qianqian's future

257
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,860
and she should never be
too careless when dealing with it.

258
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,340
Then you should urge her

259
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,020
to spend more time on it.

260
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,260
Yes.

261
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,620
If time permits, she can take her time.

262
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,900
But it's less than ten days
before the Crown Princess Election.

263
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,740
Do you think she has the ability to

264
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,180
memorize so many questions?

265
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,660
If she can't,

266
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,220
all your efforts are in vain.

267
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,420
Let's not get personal here.

268
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,980
I have a good brain.

269
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,820
Qianqian.

270
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,500
Why don't you memorize
the questions in this volume today

271
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,220
and prove that to Young Master Han?

272
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,180
What Young Master Han said makes sense.

273
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,540
I haven't got much brain.

274
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,060
Minister Pei.

275
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,100
You missed the mark.

276
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,220
It turns out that I know Qianqian better.

277
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,660
I grew up with Qianqian

278
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,660
since childhood.

279
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,980
She is being self-deprecating.

280
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,380
I've been married with her for many days.

281
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,900
She is very different from

282
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,420
who she was before.

283
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,780
I don't think...

284
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,860
Why do you think that

285
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,460
the person you know

286
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,420
is real "her"?

287
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,300
Whether the person is real "her" or not,

288
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,020
I will have time to figure it out.

289
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,820
Don't bother yourself about it.

290
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,260
Qianqian.

291
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,220
(Qingfeng Tea House)

292
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,140
The Second Princess, the Third Princess.

293
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,460
Guess who can win?

294
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,700
Make a bet now.

295
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,380
Make a bet now.

296
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,740
Once you bet, keep your hands off the table.

297
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,020
The Second Princess, the Third Princess.

298
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,660
Get out of my way.

299
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,660
The Second Princess or the Third Princess?

300
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,460
The Third Princess is kind and intelligent.

301
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,860
She must be a good City Owner.

302
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,260
She can write script for storytelling.

303
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,580
She has a sense of affection,
loyalty and responsibility.

304
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,500
Who are you betting on?

305
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,580
We will surely bet on

306
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,180
Your Highess.

307
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,180
Give me a receipt.

308
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,100
Excuse me,

309
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,540
you...

310
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,420
you have no confidence

311
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,020
in the Third Princess, do you?

312
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,140
Are you kidding?

313
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,780
Why don't you bet on her
if you have confidence in her?

314
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,900
You'll lose a lot of money.

315
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,060
Let's get out of here.

316
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,500
Do we have to

317
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,420
wait for the Third Princess to write script?

318
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,540
We will soon get a lot of money.

319
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,660
We don't need to serve
wealthy people anymore.

320
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,420
Let's go.

321
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,220
Come on.

322
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,740
Getting rich overnight without working.

323
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,820
Is it true?

324
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,460
Let me see.

325
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,940
Your Highness.

326
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,460
This is

327
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,660
big seasoned durian-flavoured thin-skin
melon seeds straight out of the oven.

328
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,220
This pack is for you.

329
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,180
This pack

330
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,500
will be given to Young Master Han as you ordered.

331
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,420
Excuse me, Miss?

332
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,220
Who did you bet on?

333
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,740
You mean the Crown Princess Election?

334
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,060
This side is for the Third Princess.

335
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,460
That side is for the Second Princess.

336
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,620
You can put the stake on the one you like.

337
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,820
I'll bet.

338
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,140
There is no stake here.

339
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,060
The majority's view is proved to be correct.

340
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,780
Make a bet on the Second Princess.

341
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,540
You will surely win.

342
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,180
Everyone knows that

343
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,340
the Third Princess is an ignorant naughty girl.

344
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,340
Yes.

345
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,180
Although the Third Princess made some progress

346
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,940
and found the black water mine,

347
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,740
the Second Princess is good at writing,
Kung Fu, riding and shooting.

348
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,620
When it comes to the Crown Princess Election,

349
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,540
the Second Princess is sure
to win in every aspect.

350
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:16,940
That makes sense.

351
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,580
I'll bet on her.

352
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,380
Boss.

353
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,540
I'll bet all my money on

354
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,660
the Second Princess Chen Chuchu.

355
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,020
Miss, a verbal statement is no guarantee.
Where is your money?

356
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,180
Wait a second.

357
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,660
Zi Rui, come here!

358
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,740
Go back and

359
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,540
bring all the valuable things here.

360
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,380
Be quick!

361
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,740
Your Highness, you'd better think it over.

362
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,780
Don't worry.

363
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,980
After the Crown Princess Election,

364
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,820
we will have nice sleep and

365
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,700
amass a great wealth.

366
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,540
Go quickly.

367
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,220
I'll go right now.

368
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,700
Be quick.

369
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,020
(Qingfeng Tea House)

370
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,460
Excuse me.

371
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,500
I did see Zi Rui sneak in just now.

372
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,580
Thank you.

373
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,420
Be sure to make a good count.

374
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,740
I bet all my money on
the Second Princess Chen Chuchu.

375
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,100
Who is it?

376
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,100
Han Shuo.

377
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,220
Qianqian.

378
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,780
How did you recognize me?

379
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,060
I should have dressed you up.

380
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,100
We should learn a lesson next time.

381
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,020
Next time?

382
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,540
No, no next time.

383
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,700
I'll go back quickly
to study the test questions

384
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,020
and prepare for
the Crown Princess Election carefully.

385
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,540
I won't let you and Minister Pei...

386
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,420
Actually the person I mean is you.

387
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,620
You're the most important.

388
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,340
I won't let you down.

389
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,220
Well.

390
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,140
Where are the melon seeds for Young Master Han?

391
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,940
Look, I went out

392
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,820
especially to buy melon seeds for you.

393
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,180
Don't blame me.

394
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,460
That's not true.

395
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,500
The Third Princess

396
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,660
is obviously fooling Young Master Han.

397
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
No, she isn't.

398
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,860
This is specially prepared for Young Master Han.

399
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,380
Now I'm gonna go back and

400
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,460
review my lessons carefully.

401
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,420
Bye-bye.

402
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,700
Excuse me. Make some room for us.

403
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,020
Even out the stakes between them.

404
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,660
Even out the stakes?

405
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,100
Chuchu.

406
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,020
Chuchu. I'm coming.

407
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,780
The tea house is having a bet
on the Crown Princess Election.

408
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,780
Do you know that?

409
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,220
Yes, I do.

410
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,460
You have just regained
your position as a princess

411
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,460
and became popular among people
because of the mine disaster.

412
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,500
Why did you bet on me?

413
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,500
Do you really have no confidence in yourself?

414
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,860
Chuchu, look at me. Who am I?

415
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,340
I am Qianqian,

416
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,900
who has kept causing trouble
day and night since childhood.

417
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,860
How could this kind of person like me

418
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,820
be the Crown Princess?

419
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,780
Don't look down upon yourself.

420
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,660
But Chuchu,

421
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,300
these things are widely known.

422
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,820
Chuchu, I'm expecting highly of you.

423
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,980
I bet all my money on you.

424
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,100
You must...

425
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,900
I am looking forward to making
a lot of money by betting on you.

426
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,100
Do you really think so?

427
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,420
Definitely.

428
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,420
Not only me,

429
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,860
mother must think so too.

430
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,500
Mother is usually strict with you.

431
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,420
That's because she expects highly of you.

432
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,540
On the contrary, look at me.

433
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,460
She doesn't have any expectation of me.

434
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,820
So no matter how big the mistake I make,

435
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,420
she doesn't take that too seriously.

436
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,660
Chuchu, you're so smart.

437
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,900
You must be aware of

438
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,100
such a simple fact.

439
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,620
If what you said is true,

440
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,100
how can you explain

441
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,140
I left those miners unattended?

442
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,740
That's because

443
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,820
at that time you were Minister of Defense.

444
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,180
You should certainly stick to
what you should do.

445
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,020
If given another chance,

446
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,980
you'd surely choose to save people.

447
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,860
Right?

448
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,660
You'd better prepare for the Crown Princess Election

449
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,300
in a steady and careful way.

450
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,700
Zi Rui.

451
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,260
Have a look at what I brought you.

452
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,700
These are test questions predicted
by various famous teachers.

453
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,380
Chuchu, you must not fall short of

454
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,900
my expectations of you.

455
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,140
Qianqian, you are so...

456
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,140
It doesn't matter.

457
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,340
If you have exercise books

458
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,620
that you have finished off,

459
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,340
you can give them to me and I'll...

460
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,300
Exercise books I've finished off?

461
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,620
I want to review them after I go back.

462
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,900
Zi Zhu.

463
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,460
Chuchu, I'm gonna go.

464
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,300
Good luck!

465
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,620
The Third Princess is getting more
and more mature.

466
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,340
Her words sound perfectly organized.

467
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,100
Qianqian has been innocent since childhood.

468
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,940
She was frank
and rarely deceived other people.

469
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,300
Perhaps I am narrow-minded.

470
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,100
Since childhood,

471
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,780
mother has been strict about my homework.

472
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,860
Especially when it comes to management,

473
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,420
she taught me all that she knew.

474
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,660
I didn't get the overall view
of the situation,

475
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,900
didn't give it deep thinking

476
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,620
and took it out on Qianqian.

477
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,180
Every time the Third Princess

478
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,180
took something from you,

479
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,340
she did it in a secret way.

480
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,020
But you still trust her so much.

481
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,860
Zi Zhu.

482
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
Think about Young Master Han.

483
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,660
Her Majesty had planned
to make him marry you.

484
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,780
How could the Third Princess
shamelessly take him away by force?

485
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,420
I've been taking care of Qianqian
for more than ten years.

486
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,460
No matter what had happened,

487
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,020
she didn't guard against me

488
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,140
and always thought about things for my sake.

489
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,220
Otherwise,

490
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,620
she wouldn't have given me
these exercise books today.

491
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,460
The Third Princess took away the exercise books

492
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,900
you have finished off.

493
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,540
Who knows what she is plotting.

494
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,820
It doesn't matter.

495
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,620
Your Highness.

496
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,300
These exercise books have been used.

497
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,340
What are you gonna do with them?

498
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,500
You don't understand.

499
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,900
They are very useful.

500
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,740
Listen up,

501
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,340
when you see Young Master later,

502
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,900
you tell him that these
are all written by me.

503
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,820
Are you clear?

504
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,980
Yes.

505
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,460
He's coming.

506
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,580
Come on. Wake up.

507
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,180
Why don't you have a rest, Your Highness.

508
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,500
No. This question is too hard.

509
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,140
Young Master.

510
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,420
It's you.

511
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,140
These questions are done.

512
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,620
Can I have a rest now?

513
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,180
I've been thinking for so long.

514
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,060
What's up?

515
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,940
The Crown Princess Election is around the corner.

516
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,860
I come here to help you
with the discourse on politics.

517
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,460
The discourse on politics?

518
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,060
Isn't that debating?

519
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,740
Don't worry.

520
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,900
I have a talent for speaking.

521
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,220
You are so confident.

522
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,820
Why don't we have a bet?

523
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,860
On what?

524
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,380
If I win,

525
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,500
you kiss me.

526
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,740
What if I win?

527
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,500
I kiss you.

528
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,060
You are testing me on how well I can
deal with changing situation, aren't you?

529
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,020
This is no kidding.

530
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
Let me ask you a question.

531
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,580
In Huayuan city,

532
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,620
the relationship between father-in-law
and son-in-law is always hard to be settled.

533
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,660
Not only can father-in-law beat
and scold his son-in-law at will,

534
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,340
but he can also make the decision
to divorce him.

535
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,860
If one day

536
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,660
the father-in-law is arguing
with the son-in-law,

537
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,220
should the son-in-law make a compromise

538
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,540
or should he argue strongly
with the father-in-law?

539
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,460
I think he should argue strongly.

540
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,060
Isn't it like the conflicts between
mother-in-law and daughter-in-law?

541
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,740
It's no big deal.

542
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,260
Since you chose the negative side,

543
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,780
I choose the positive side.

544
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,780
I think he should make a compromise.

545
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,300
The conflict between
father-in-law and son-in-law

546
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,860
is nothing but some trivial matters.

547
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,780
No matter how strongly
they argue with each other,

548
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,180
they won't get a result.

549
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,820
And even if you do get
the upper hand in the conflict,

550
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,060
you won't get much benefit.

551
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,540
Why can't they restrain themselves a little
for the sake of the family

552
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,860
and make peace with each other?

553
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,060
Actually the spouse is uncomfortable

554
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,100
being stuck in between.

555
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,180
That is to say,

556
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,860
if one day

557
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,420
you have an argument with my mother,

558
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,860
you will make a compromise for me?

559
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,220
Don't worry.

560
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,740
I won't let you be harmed.

561
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,820
And my mother will surely love

562
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,300
the one I love.

563
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,220
What are you talking about?

564
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,660
Well.

565
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,900
This time,

566
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,580
you win.

567
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,420
Zi Rui, I'm hungry. Let's go.

568
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,380
He is weird.

569
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,380
He is not weird.

570
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,380
Young Master Han must have fallen in love with you.

571
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,860
That makes sense.

572
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,900
I'm his wife in name.

573
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,020
He is afraid that Her Majesty may
use our relationship to give him a hard life.

574
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,220
It doesn't matter.

575
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,940
We'll have to split up
sooner or later anyway.

576
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,180
What are you doing?

577
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,180
If you have something on your mind,
you can talk with me.

578
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,660
But don't resort to violence.

579
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,780
Young Master said

580
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,020
everyone in the mansion
can ask Your Highness questions.

581
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,140
I'd like to ask you

582
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,620
whether a man who acts cute
will live a good life.

583
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,820
Actually.

584
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,220
Both men and women act cute sometimes.

585
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,220
It's no big deal.

586
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,020
It's like a lubricant.

587
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,620
Let's say there is a conflict
between a man and a woman.

588
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,980
If you act cute and make a compromise,

589
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,380
showing respect for the other side

590
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,260
and gaining benefit from her,

591
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,100
you'll find that the conflict is eased

592
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,380
or has disappeared.

593
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,380
So acting cute is good

594
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,500
for both sides.

595
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,140
A man who acts cute will live a good life.

596
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,500
I cannot lift it up.

597
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,580
Is there a young lady who can help me?

598
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,980
I'm not a young lady.

599
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,860
Once again?

600
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
Sorry to bother you,

601
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,380
but I'm wondering

602
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,860
could men be allowed to take the test

603
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,340
and get an official position of some kind.

604
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,420
Yes.

605
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,180
When it comes to job,

606
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,940
there should not be sex discrimination.

607
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,380
Why can't a man be an official?

608
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,540
Time to have dinner.

609
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,820
Young Master Han said

610
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,780
only after you answer the question
seriously can you begin to eat.

611
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,100
I just want to have some food.

612
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,460
But now I have to get into an argument.

613
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,780
Is it reasonable?

614
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,340
Well.

615
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,060
I'm not gonna eat.

616
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,740
I'm not gonna eat. Is that okay?

617
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,780
Young Master has good intentions.

618
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,660
But you...

619
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,340
Good intentions?

620
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,100
If he had good intentions,
he wouldn't have been hard on me like this.

621
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,540
I'm telling you,

622
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,300
I don't want to take the test.

623
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,460
I don't want to be the Crown Princess.

624
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:15,980
From now on,

625
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,220
no one is allowed to talk to me.

626
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,740
Leave me alone.

627
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,420
But this.

628
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,220
Take it.

629
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,500
The chicken made no mistake.

630
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,300
Even the rooster is at odds
with me, isn't it?

631
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,420
(Risheng Mansion)

632
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,580
Your Highness.

633
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,980
It's said that many people are betting
on the Crown Princess Election.

634
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,900
The Third Princess went so far as to

635
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,260
bet all her money on the Second Princess.

636
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,460
I fully understand what she is thinking.

637
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,260
She used to be arrogant
by virtue of her Kung Fu.

638
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,380
But now she cannot practice Kung Fu anymore.

639
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,500
The disappointment

640
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,340
can only be understood by the person
with the same experience.

641
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,420
I'm gonna visit her.

642
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,140
Forget about it.

643
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,020
It's windy outside.

644
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,860
If by any chance I catch cold

645
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,540
and have a cough with lungs infected

646
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,180
or even go into a coma
and cannot take medicine,

647
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,780
I'm gonna die.

648
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,380
Your Highness, you're making an excuse.

649
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,340
Well, it's important to visit Qianqian.

650
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,060
There won't be any trouble
if I wear more clothes.

651
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,180
Young Master,

652
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,140
I have something to tell you

653
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,740
and I don't want to wait any longer.

654
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,620
Just say it.

655
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,660
Look at me.

656
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,220
I

657
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,460
don't want to win the literacy test

658
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,820
or the Kung Fu test

659
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,780
or the discourse on politics.

660
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,420
I don't want to get involved in any fight
related to Crown Princess.

661
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,780
Although I was not good
at literary writing before,

662
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,940
I excelled in Kung Fu.

663
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,900
But now

664
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,340
I'm good at nothing.

665
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,580
I'm nobody.

666
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,620
But you

667
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,940
were forcing me again and again

668
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,620
to fight against others.

669
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,860
Do you think it is reasonable?

670
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,140
Qianqian, if you don't have a try,

671
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,500
how do you know you won't make it?

672
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,300
What's more, I'm here.

673
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,220
I'll come up with a foolproof plan

674
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,380
to let you win.

675
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,980
Look at this.

676
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,780
I wrote down the answers.

677
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,020
All you have to do
is to bear them in your mind.

678
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,900
Even if I win the literacy test,

679
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
what can it bring me?

680
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,380
Can it bring me less humiliation?

681
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,740
Or can it bring me less ridicule?

682
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,980
No, it can't.

683
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,340
No matter how hard I try

684
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,860
and how much effort I make,

685
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,820
I'm still a worthless person,

686
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,180
a fat worthless person who
is ridiculed by the whole world.

687
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,860
I see.

688
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,260
Your Highness, don't take it personally.

689
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,980
The Third Princess

690
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,460
was talking about herself.

691
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,820
Let's go.

692
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,660
But what she said makes sense.

693
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,700
How does a worthless person

694
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,860
have the nerve to run
for the Crown Princess Election?

695
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,980
Even if I win the literacy test
and the discourse on politics,

696
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,980
will that change the latter half of my life?

697
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,020
Am I able to stand up again?

698
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,300
Your Highness.

699
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,300
Mr. Su.

700
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,380
Zi Nian.

701
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,860
Minister Pei asked me to

702
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,500
ask why Her Highness

703
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,940
was absent from class
for no reason these days.

704
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,700
Her Highness is in no mood to study.

705
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,860
Why?

706
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,340
It's all because of the Third Princess.

707
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,300
Not only did she give herself up,

708
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,420
but she had set a bad example
and make Her Highness follow suit.

709
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,860
Would you please deliver
a message to Her Highness?

710
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,940
Tell Her Highness that

711
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,220
I came here to visit her.

712
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,260
Your Highness.

713
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,900
Your Highness. The garden overflows
with the beauty of spring.

714
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,380
Let me

715
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,260
accompany Your Highness to have a walk.

716
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,420
Don't bother.

717
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,860
No matter how beautiful it is,

718
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,700
it will decline sometime.

719
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,260
I don't want the bleak sight in the future

720
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,980
remind me of today's beauty,

721
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,900
thus making me feel sad.

722
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,860
Your Highness.

723
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,060
You are kind-hearted.

724
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,900
You should see

725
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,500
the pleasant things in the world.

726
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,780
As seasons alternate,

727
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,380
even the bleakest flowers

728
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,660
will bloom again one day.

729
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,860
Right?

730
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,980
How did Yuanyuan overhear the words

731
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,500
that I spoke to Han Shuo?

732
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,340
Why?

733
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,940
Your Highness.

734
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,060
You're straightforward and open-minded.

735
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,420
But Her Highness is intelligent.

736
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,300
I'm afraid she takes things too seriously

737
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,380
and gets herself into a dead end.

738
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,100
I see.

739
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,940
You want me to comfort her.

740
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,140
I'd appreciate it very much.

741
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,420
Su Mu, why do you thank me
on behalf of Yuanyuan?

742
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,820
Her Highness once said that

743
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,980
it doesn't matter where a hero comes from.

744
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,020
Although I am working at clan school now,

745
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,220
but everyone who knows me

746
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,660
regards me as a musician

747
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,220
from the Music and Dance Academy.

748
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,740
Only Her Highness

749
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,780
regards me as an ordinary person.

750
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,100
That's right.

751
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,460
You and Yuanyuan are
indeed linked by ties of fate.

752
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,660
That's not the case.

753
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,020
It's just that Her Highness and
Your Highness felt compassion for me

754
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,060
and had a good opinion of me.

755
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,780
Okay, I'll go and explain to Yuanyuan.

756
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,740
Things are not as she heard them.

757
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,940
I appreciate it very much. Your Highness.

758
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,220
(The 20th draft of Will)

759
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,900
Yuanyuan. Yuanyuan.

760
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,100
Your Highness.

761
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,460
Didn't I tell you to stop her?

762
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,580
If I want to come in, who dares to stop me?

763
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,500
(I'm a worthless person to Huayuan City...)

764
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,060
Yuanyuan. What are you doing?

765
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,140
You don't want to take the test?

766
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,940
As a worthless person,

767
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,220
I will only be ridiculed
by the whole world no matter what.

768
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,220
Isn't that what you said?

769
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,100
No, Yuanyuan.

770
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,300
I was talking about myself.

771
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,060
It was none of your business.

772
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,780
Don't take it personally.

773
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,820
It's my business to decide
whether to take the test or not.

774
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,300
You have no right to decide it for me.

775
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,940
Your Highness, what are you doing?

776
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,060
Chen Qianqian.

777
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,860
Are you humiliating me?

778
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,020
No. That's not the case.

779
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,420
Yuanyuan, I'm caring about you.

780
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,500
I don't want to see you
give yourself up like this.

781
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,860
Caring about me?

782
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,500
I'm really caring about you.

783
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,700
I've made some preparation.

784
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,780
I'm not kidding.

785
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,500
Look.

786
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,060
This is what I've sorted out
from a lot of books.

787
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,940
I've done it for some days.

788
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,460
I've been planning

789
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,700
to give it to you when I get the chance.

790
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,420
I don't know if it is useful.

791
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,740
But perhaps these can help you

792
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,660
to stand up again.

793
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,620
No matter how they work,

794
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,740
you should try them.

795
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,660
You found these cures for me.

796
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,740
Do you think that

797
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,940
your medical skill is better than mine?

798
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,420
Your medical skill is absolutely good.

799
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,700
But for so many years

800
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,660
you haven't given medical care to your legs.

801
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,380
Your Highness, please stop.

802
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,980
Because you don't dare to, do you?

803
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,500
Because you are afraid
that you cannot cure your legs.

804
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,700
So over the years,

805
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,580
you haven't tried

806
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,180
to let yourself stand up again.

807
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,140
(Rehabilitation Guideline)

808
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,820
You want to make me stand up again.

809
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,660
It's just like you want to win the Kung Fu test
though you are unable to practice Kung Fu.

810
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,420
Do you think it is possible?

811
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,220
You get out of here.

812
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:22,860
Yuanyuan.

813
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,100
Your Highness, please go back.

814
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,700
(Your humble daughter Chen Yuanyuan bows to Your Majesty)

815
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,540
(Rehabilitation Guideline)

816
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,820
Stop drinking.

817
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,100
Zi Rui, why can't this wine make me drunk?

818
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,100
It's full of fruit juice inside.

819
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,380
It's impossible to get drunk.

820
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,300
What's more,

821
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,580
Young Master Han told me not to let you drink wine.

822
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,620
Drinking wine is harmful to health.

823
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,700
Why does Han Shuo want to
dominate my life in every aspect?

824
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,660
Eh...

825
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,980
Excuse me, Miss,

826
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,300
what are you worrying about?

827
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,540
What are you gonna do by doing this?

828
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,940
I'm not a kid.

829
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,740
It's my apology.

830
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,540
Qianqian.

831
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,660
Since you don't want to prepare for the test,

832
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,340
I won't push you anymore.

833
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,140
That's good.

834
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,860
What?

835
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,580
Don't you feel this doll

836
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,700
is much like you?

837
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,900
Yeah. It looks like me.

838
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,460
What about this one?

839
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,460
Who does it look like?

840
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,020
This...

841
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,780
Sorry, I broke it.

842
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,220
It doesn't matter.

843
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,020
It'd be okay if I put its legs back.

844
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,380
Legs cannot be put back again.

845
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,500
It's all my fault.

846
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,660
It's just a doll.

847
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,500
Why are you so sad?

848
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,460
Did it ever occur to you that

849
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,140
for the common people,

850
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,820
we are at a dominating position
which can never be reached.

851
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,900
Even a casual sentence

852
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,900
can easily change someone's fate.

853
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,460
They are

854
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,140
just like this clay figurine.

855
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,380
Something I've done before

856
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,820
easily changed someone else's fate.

857
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,700
But I've never asked

858
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,180
that person's idea and feeling.

859
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,980
Ever since I was diagnosed
with heart disease,

860
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,100
I've visited famous doctors across the world.

861
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,540
They all said that I would die before 20.

862
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,140
I had thought that

863
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,940
I would die like this in a foreign land.

864
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,900
But it never occurred to me that

865
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,140
you appeared.

866
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,740
It was you who got the Dragon Bone for me

867
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,340
and cured my heart disease.

868
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,300
Until then I came to realize that

869
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,300
no one's fate is predestined.

870
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,300
Perhaps all of it can be changed.

871
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,700
Just like me.

872
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,740
(Rehabilitation Guideline)
You want to make me stand up again.

873
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,460
It's just like you want to win the Kung Fu test
though you are unable to practice Kung Fu.

874
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,300
Do you think it is possible?

875
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,140
Do you think that

876
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,660
I can win the Kung Fu test

877
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,540
though I'm unable to practice Kung Fu?

878
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,740
Miss Lin Qi, you invited me out,

879
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,820
what do you want from me?

880
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,980
If Miss Lin Qi want me to do something,

881
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,340
you can just tell me.

882
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,020
There's no need to present
such a generous gift.

883
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,180
I feel...

884
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,060
very embarrassed.

885
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,260
Listen to me.

886
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,740
I want you to

887
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,860
make Chen Qianqian fight
against me at the Kung Fu test

888
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,100
no matter what the agenda is.

889
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,660
The Third Princess?

890
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,580
But...

891
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,220
It is just the deposit.

892
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,940
You'll absolutely

893
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,860
get the rest.

894
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,180
I will go all out to do

895
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,300
what you tell me to do.

896
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,020
I'm gonna fix her myself

897
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,340
and bring disgrace on her publicly.

898
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,420
I have good news and bad news.

899
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,740
Which do you want to hear first?

900
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,540
Bad news first.

901
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,420
Let me hear what news could be worse.

902
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,060
It's said that Lin Qi bought off
the Kung Fu test officer.

903
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,980
She wanted to fight against you herself.

904
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,620
Since I've got myself into this situation,

905
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
I don't think there's any good news.

906
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,860
The good news is

907
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,220
I can let you win.

908
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,020
Your Highness, Your Highness.

909
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,340
My master doesn't want
to meet any guest today.

910
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,380
I just want to say two sentences.
Just two sentences.

911
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,700
Yuanyuan.

912
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,060
Your Highness, please go back.

913
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,780
Her Highness said that

914
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,940
she doesn't want to see you recently.

915
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,620
Yuanyuan.

916
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,340
I come here today just to ask you

917
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,700
if I win

918
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,180
the Kung Fu test at the Crown Princess Election,

919
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,940
can you promise me
to do rehabilitation training

920
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,980
and make efforts to stand up again?

921
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,060
Your Highness, please
don't make things difficult for me.

922
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,180
Her Highness won't see you today.

923
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,060
Yuanyuan.

924
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,380
Yuanyuan, if you don't say a word.

925
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,540
I take it as your acquiescence.

926
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,580
I'm telling you,

927
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,020
I'll surely win the Kung Fu test.

928
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,140
At that time you should not
act shamelessly and deny it.

929
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,940
Who on earth is acting shamelessly?

930
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,620
Yuanyuan.

931
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,580
However hard it is, I will make it.
