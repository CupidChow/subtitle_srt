23

(Episode 3)

24
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,260
What... what did you say?

25
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,660
I mean

26
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,620
that I didn't intend

27
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,700
to humiliate Han Shuo today.

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,180
You compared him with a musician
at the Music and Dance Academy.

29
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,580
You don't think that's humiliation?

30
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,460
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,780
You're... sorry?

32
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,340
I know.

33
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,380
I made a mistake.

34
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,220
You... You are really apologizing?

35
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,340
I understand how Han Shuo feels.

36
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,300
You had a sleep

37
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,420
and found that everything had changed.

38
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,460
You looked around

39
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,420
and there wasn't a single person you know.

40
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,500
You have to exhaust yourself

41
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,420
handling people around you every day.

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,860
You can't have a proper meal

43
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,460
and you're afraid other people will harm you.

44
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,340
You also fear that you'll mess it up

45
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,780
and then you can't go home.

46
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,340
Perhaps you'll even be beheaded

47
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,780
or shot to death.

48
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,780
I've got it.

49
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,540
I'll go and apologize to Han Shuo now.

50
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,340
Pei Heng,

51
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,860
I know you hated me before.

52
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,100
But I'm different now.

53
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,260
Don't be disappointed in me, will you?

54
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
Okay.

55
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,580
Mr. Pei,

56
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,100
you said you'd break off your engagement

57
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,140
and Her Highness was so nervous and sad.

58
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,180
It's really new to me.

59
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,420
When has she ever

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,100
yielded over the years?

61
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,500
She's willing

62
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,140
to apologize to Young Master Han for you.

63
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,780
It seems

64
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,980
she cares very much about you.

65
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,380
Don't request Her Majesty

66
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,380
to cancel your engagement.

67
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,460
(Accumulate achievements
to influence the descendants)

68
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,460
Ready.

69
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,300
To its full extent.

70
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,260
Come on, Xiaoqian.

71
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,900
Han Shuo is not the same as another one.

72
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,020
I can get along with him.

73
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,060
You can do it.

74
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,620
Wait.

75
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,340
What is it you came for at this late hour?

76
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:08,980
Do you think

77
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,860
you haven't humiliated me enough?

78
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,980
Han Shuo.

79
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,460
Young Master Han,

80
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,180
I did the wrong thing today.

81
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,780
I was reckless and inconsiderate.

82
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,660
You're a forgiving person.

83
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,180
Don't take it to heart.

84
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,700
Are you apologizing?

85
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,180
Do you think I'll believe you?

86
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,700
If you don't believe me,

87
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,180
there's only one thing I can do.

88
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,300
You were almost stripped in public today.

89
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,500
I'll make amends to you.

90
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,580
You...

91
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,060
Even if people in Huayuan City
always do what they want,

92
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,020
few are as brazen as you.

93
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,740
After I did this,

94
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,500
we're even, aren't we?

95
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,820
How...

96
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,380
how can they be the same?

97
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,180
Oh, yes.

98
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,100
You were also watched by a crowd today.

99
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,180
Okay,

100
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,140
I'll go and walk around the street.

101
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,460
Stop.

102
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,540
Ready.

103
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,860
Nominally you're my wife.

104
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,740
You can't dress like this in the street.

105
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,540
Don't look at me.

106
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,020
What do you think I should do, then?

107
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,260
I...

108
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,540
I'll take one more piece of clothes off?

109
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,260
What are you doing?

110
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,260
Does Young Master Han want to do it himself?

111
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,340
You rascal!

112
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,180
-I... -You rascal.

113
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,300
I didn't do anything.

114
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,940
What were you yelling for?

115
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,980
You yourself is the rascal.

116
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:10,940
What shall we do?

117
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,860
You crazy woman,

118
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,140
you picked me up

119
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,340
when we first met in the street.

120
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,700
You wanted to see beauties

121
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,540
and took me to a brothel.

122
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,420
When you saw Pei Heng,
you were giddy with happiness

123
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,980
and got entangled with him.

124
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,220
The baby you're carrying

125
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,420
is his, isn't it?

126
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,300
You've violated the Seven Regulations

127
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,180
and ethics for women. You're dissipated

128
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,180
by nature and... and... and...

129
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,780
How come you still have your gecko cinnabar?

130
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,660
So you're a complicated man, aren't you?

131
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,820
Cold, unfeeling, shy and bewildered

132
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,500
can all be used to describe you, right?

133
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,140
I have my gecko cinnabar.

134
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,420
What's wrong with that?

135
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,380
Don't be fussy.

136
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,940
But...

137
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,460
You... you are not pregnant?

138
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,260
I had to tell mother I was pregnant

139
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,580
to save you.

140
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,860
You disregarded your honor

141
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,980
to save me?

142
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,420
Compared with someone's life,

143
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,820
my honor is not important.

144
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,300
I really wanted to save you.

145
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,460
Besides,

146
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,620
how much is my honor worth?

147
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,100
That's right.

148
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,140
If the rumors are true,

149
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,300
you can certainly

150
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,420
discard your reputation.

151
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,820
Han Shuo,

152
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,300
let's make an agreement.

153
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,420
In public,

154
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,460
we'll obey rules of Huayuan City

155
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
and you'll listen to me.

156
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,340
In private,

157
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,220
we'll obey rules of Xuanhu City

158
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,820
and I'll listen to you.

159
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,140
You show me some respect

160
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,460
and I'll show you more.

161
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,620
This is our way to be

162
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,100
a nominal couple.

163
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,860
That's settled.

164
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,020
Don't go back on it.

165
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,860
Stop.

166
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,700
What now?

167
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,020
Put on your clothes first.

168
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,340
It's no big deal.

169
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,740
She's outside. What do we do?

170
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,300
Ready. To its full extent.

171
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,540
Oh, no.

172
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,460
It's late and cold.

173
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,140
Okay.

174
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,420
Thank you.

175
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,740
Zi Zhu!

176
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,660
Zi Zhu!

177
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,580
Zi Zhu.

178
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,100
Zi Zhu.

179
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,580
Your Highness, I've done my best.

180
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,820
Zi Zhu!

181
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,500
Chuchu,

182
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,700
I've waited for this day

183
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,700
since the moment I entered Huayuan City.

184
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,420
You and I were destined to fight.

185
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,860
Accept defeat.

186
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,060
Han Shuo,

187
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,740
I had never suspected you,

188
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,660
yet you treated me so cruelly.

189
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,100
Today is the Double Seventh Festival.

190
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,380
You injured my mother seriously

191
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,780
when she was strolling in the street,

192
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,100
lit the beacon

193
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,820
and attacked our city.

194
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,820
And Lin Qi.

195
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,140
How many people around me have you killed?

196
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
That's not all.

197
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,780
I've also killed your sister,
Chen Qianqian who you always love,

198
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,220
with a cup of poisoned wine

199
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,220
on the wedding night.

200
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,460
Qianqian was also killed by you?

201
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,740
Han Shuo is really ruthless.

202
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,060
Though I've survived

203
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,940
from his poisoned wine and arrows,

204
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,740
I have to hang on till the ending

205
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,980
so that I can go home.

206
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,980
I can't die.

207
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,380
I mustn't die.

208
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,780
Do you get me?

209
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,980
Now I don't want to know

210
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,540
how the apple and the banana can be together.

211
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,020
I just want to know

212
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,340
how the orange can save herself

213
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,100
when the banana is bent on killing her.

214
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,020
You're all outstanding members

215
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,340
of the storytellers.

216
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
Help me think of a way

217
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,300
to make up the story

218
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,220
so that the orange will be saved.

219
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,020
Does the orange have a bad reputation?

220
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,260
She has done many evil deeds

221
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,340
and she's notorious.

222
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,380
Did the orange offend the banana?

223
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,020
She first took him for marriage,

224
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,100
then put him in prison

225
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,380
and humiliated him in public.

226
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,620
The banana is merciless and vengeful.

227
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,780
He's a deep man

228
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,180
and never hesitates to kill.

229
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,220
Now he's licking his wounds

230
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,500
and waiting for a window of opportunity.

231
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,420
When he recovers

232
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,100
and builds up his strength,

233
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,180
he... he'll be like a tiger
dashing down the mountain

234
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,580
and a king fighting a war.

235
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,660
He'll simply

236
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,900
do everything he wants.

237
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,940
No one can stop him except the apple.

238
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,300
In that case,

239
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,220
why don't you just...

240
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,060
You can't write anything
without killing someone, can you?

241
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,500
The banana will live.

242
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,980
He'll be useful in the future.

243
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,060
Change his mind with love, then.

244
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,340
Talk some sense into him

245
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,900
so that he'll repent and find a way out.

246
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,380
I don't know how to do that.

247
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,180
You need some events to change

248
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,580
people's opinion of a character, don't you?

249
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,100
The lines alone aren't enough.

250
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,540
There's nothing I can suggest, then.

251
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,220
The orange's death

252
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,700
is inevitable and everyone expects it.

253
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,540
Yes.

254
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,420
Your Highness,

255
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,180
why are you so bent on saving the orange?

256
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,980
Because Party A demands it.

257
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,460
She invests in the drama

258
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,020
and wants to live a few more days, okay?

259
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,900
What... what's Party A?

260
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,580
Me.

261
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,900
I'm Party A.

262
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,900
I order you

263
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,420
to think of a way

264
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,620
to save this orange now.

265
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,820
Understood?

266
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,500
Party A is quite willful.

267
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,020
She's rich.

268
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,900
Your Highness,

269
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,300
the orange

270
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,860
has to have some advantage, hasn't she?

271
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,860
She's rich,

272
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,620
powerful

273
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,580
and maybe a little pretty.

274
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,860
Those intrinsic ones.

275
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,140
Smart, resourceful and quick-witted.

276
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,340
What about her skills?

277
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,980
She knows what will happen. Does it count?

278
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,580
The orange knows the whole story

279
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,940
like the back of her hand.

280
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,020
She knows how the banana will kill her,

281
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,620
lure the apple,

282
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,340
scheme and order his men

283
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,500
to stir up trouble in secret

284
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,820
and get the thing to continue to live

285
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,140
from the apple.

286
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,340
She knows all these things.

287
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,860
Your Highness,

288
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,660
why didn't you say that earlier?

289
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,900
Think about it.

290
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,060
Now that the orange is good at divination,

291
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,980
she definitely knows

292
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,700
how she can avoid danger

293
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,300
and change it into her advantage.

294
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,540
Be more specific.

295
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,540
Use anything that betrays the banana,

296
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,820
save him, help him, protect him,

297
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,460
earn his trust,

298
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,100
change his impression of you

299
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,540
and lower his guard.

300
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,820
Won't I be currying favor with him?

301
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,100
You have to do that when you should.

302
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,420
Right.

303
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,100
How about this,

304
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,540
gentlemen?

305
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,180
Suppose

306
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,060
when the banana is seeing a spy,

307
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,420
the apple comes to encircle them

308
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,420
and the orange turns up in front

309
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,740
of the banana and rescues him,

310
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,580
do you think

311
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,180
the orange

312
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,660
can earn the banana's trust?

313
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,820
Guys,

314
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,340
was there such a story before?

315
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,580
There was

316
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
if I want it.

317
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,940
Young Master.

318
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,780
Our spy has got
the defense map of Huayuan City

319
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,340
and wants to meet us at half past eleven

320
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,740
on the moat tonight.

321
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,380
Defense map?

322
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,620
(Defense Map of Huayuan City)

323
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,260
Your Highness, I've received a tip-off.

324
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,500
Someone will meet a spy of Xuanhu City

325
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,180
at half past eleven tonight on the moat.

326
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,340
Who sent it?

327
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,100
I have no idea.

328
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,060
Your Highness, Her Majesty
is wary of Xuanhu City.

329
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,140
If you can catch its spy,

330
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,740
she'll definitely regard you with favor.

331
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,220
As for the tip-off,

332
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,660
it's better

333
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,860
to believe it.

334
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,420
Qianqian has just married Han Shuo.

335
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,980
If the spy of Xuanhu City is exposed now...

336
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,860
You can't always think of the Third Princess.

337
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,300
Your Highness, Her Majesty
let you take charge

338
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,740
of the army without thinking about it.

339
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,460
She has great expectations of you.

340
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,220
He's here. He's here.

341
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,060
The fish has bitten.

342
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,380
Listen,

343
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,900
we'll do it

344
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,100
when Chuchu is going

345
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,220
to catch Han Shuo.

346
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,100
I'll say

347
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,300
I'm the person who's meeting Han Shuo here

348
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,100
and there isn't a spy of Xuanhu City.

349
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,580
And then

350
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,940
I'll get Han Shuo out of trouble

351
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,060
and he'll think I'm on his side.

352
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,340
What a brilliant idea.

353
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,420
You're framing Young Master Han again.

354
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,300
If Her Majesty knows, she'll punish you.

355
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,620
My mother is fond of me.

356
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,740
She won't do that.

357
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,380
Han Shuo is sick.

358
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,500
He suffers from paranoia.

359
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,380
I've got to cure him.

360
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,660
The time has come. Let's go.

361
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,060
Why is no one here?

362
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,780
Did they know we'd come?

363
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,740
Your Highness, someone's here.

364
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:07,900
On alert.

365
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,900
I'm here!

366
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,740
Qianqian, why is it you?

367
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,460
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

368
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,940
You're going to meet someone here?

369
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,700
Yes.

370
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,740
Where's he?

371
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,180
He...

372
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,460
he...

373
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,060
he...

374
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,740
he didn't... he didn't come.

375
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,900
Where's Han Shuo?

376
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,020
Did you arrange to meet him?

377
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,900
Your Highness,

378
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,940
think it over before you tell us

379
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,380
who you're going to meet here.

380
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,740
I'm going to meet...

381
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,100
No.

382
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,380
Chuchu, did you get something wrong?

383
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,860
So you are the person who's going

384
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,660
to meet a spy of Xuanhu City.

385
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,660
Colluding with the enemy
is a capital offense.

386
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,900
Collude with the enemy? Me?

387
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,740
Is that possible?

388
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,980
Don't talk nonsense.

389
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,700
Han Shuo wasn't tricked
but tricked me instead.

390
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,740
This is an important matter

391
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,700
and I can't decide.

392
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,060
But I'll intercede with mother for you.

393
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,820
Yes. Her Majesty loves you.

394
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,540
Even if you collude with the enemy,

395
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,260
you'll be demoted to a commoner at worst.

396
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,620
Oh, come to think of it,

397
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,420
I came because I received a tip-off

398
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,580
and it said someone was going

399
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,500
to meet a spy of Xuanhu City here.

400
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,420
I came to catch them.

401
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,820
With Zi Rui?

402
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,940
You are really eloquent,

403
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,220
Your Highness.

404
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,180
You said I colluded with the enemy.

405
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,380
Do you have any evidence?

406
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,780
Chuchu, let me tell you the truth.

407
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Actually I'm here to admire the moon.

408
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,860
Tonight

409
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,700
the moon is full, so I came.

410
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,780
And I happened to meet you here.

411
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,900
I'm sleepy.

412
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,140
Zi Rui, let's go back.

413
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,220
Yes.

414
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,540
Your Highness,

415
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,500
you just let her go?

416
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,780
Her Majesty dotes on her and neglects you.

417
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,220
It was such a good chance.

418
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,460
Qianqian seems to be

419
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,540
afraid of nothing

420
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,860
but actually she's the most cowardly.

421
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,180
She doesn't dare to collude with the enemy.

422
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,940
I guess

423
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,620
if there's really such a spy of Xuanhu City,

424
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,340
it must be related to Han Shuo.

425
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,900
Perhaps

426
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,460
Qianqian was used by him.

427
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,260
I'll have something on
Han Shuo sooner or later.

428
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,100
This way.

429
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:35,900
Quick.

430
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,540
This is suspicious.

431
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,860
What shall we do?

432
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,500
We'll make use of this trap

433
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,580
and find the person behind it.

434
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,620
I told you he suffered from paranoia.

435
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,820
It's okay.

436
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,660
Watch how I turn the tables.

437
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,700
Have you heard of this, Han Shuo?

438
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,820
Without faith, a man can't establish himself,

439
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,340
a business can't prosper

440
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,780
and a country will wane.

441
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,460
Shouldn't we keep faith with other people?

442
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,660
You were invited to go there.

443
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,660
Why did you incriminate other people?

444
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,420
Are you talking about the moat?

445
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,460
You could just ignore it

446
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,700
but you went there and tricked me

447
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,820
into going on the boat. I was almost wronged.

448
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,140
It isn't right.

449
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,140
You're quite honest.

450
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,380
Let me ask you.

451
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,580
I was almost tricked tonight.

452
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,060
Was it your doing?

453
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,660
I tricked you?

454
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,900
Do you know how much I worried about you?

455
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,820
I heard

456
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,660
Chuchu was going to catch
a spy of Xuanhu City

457
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,020
and I specially went to help you out.

458
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,700
I had no idea you'd put me in that situation.

459
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,140
How could you be so sure

460
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,860
I was the person the Second Princess
was going to catch?

461
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,060
How come I was sure?

462
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,540
I was afraid.

463
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,140
I should go there

464
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,060
in case it was you, shouldn't I?

465
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,980
That's to say,

466
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,500
you weren't trying to frame me

467
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,460
but to save me?

468
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,500
Han Shuo,

469
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,380
I've really taken pains to help you.

470
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,420
Is that so?

471
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,180
Don't move.

472
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,660
You're hurt.

473
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,380
Yes,

474
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,060
I am hurt.

475
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,700
I am hurt in order to save you.

476
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,180
Why on earth did you try to save me?

477
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,100
Because I'm on your side.

478
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,460
Can you be

479
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,140
on my side, too?

480
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,100
Tell me if you have any problems.

481
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,700
I will go all out

482
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,700
to solve them for you

483
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,900
and be of service to you.

484
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,300
Why are you willing to do
so many things for me?

485
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,380
Because...

486
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,980
because I want you to be happy.

487
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,900
You want me

488
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,420
to be happy?

489
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,740
It's useless talking so much.

490
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,380
I'll prove it with my actions

491
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,740
that I'm good and I'm not clingy.

492
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,940
You'll be satisfied.

493
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,300
It'll be a shame if I die.

494
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,180
Well,

495
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,340
it's a good thing you didn't go there.

496
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,220
Chuchu was so horrible.

497
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,460
I've got to have a late-night snack

498
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,620
and ginseng soup to steady my nerves.

499
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,300
Have a good rest.

500
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,020
Young Master,

501
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,700
do you think we can believe the Third Princess?

502
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,380
Yes.

503
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,900
But how come I always feel

504
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,740
it was her trickery?

505
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,300
Think about this.

506
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,220
She's always moody,

507
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,580
unpredictable and dishonest.

508
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,620
That's because she's an innocent girl.

509
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,580
This matter is related to the defense map

510
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,540
and a sealing wax bamboo tube
that we use to communicate.

511
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,740
The person who could get these two things

512
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,220
would never be Chen Qianqian, an idiot.

513
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,980
The Second Princess, Chen Chuchu,

514
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,860
is a prudent person.

515
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,940
It was most likely her doing.

516
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,900
The Second Princess harmed us

517
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,020
because the two cities detest each other

518
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,220
and she wanted to distinguish herself.

519
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,780
But why did the Third Princess save us?

520
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,860
Does she want something in return?

521
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,020
That should be true.

522
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,500
Does she know our city is powerful

523
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,220
and we can take Huayuan City any time?

524
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,700
Does she know our city is populous

525
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,860
and awash with money?

526
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,300
She doesn't want our forces

527
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,220
or money.

528
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,340
What does she want?

529
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,820
Me.

530
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,380
This woman

531
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,380
adores me.

532
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,100
She fell in love with you?

533
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,460
That day her horse was panicked.

534
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,180
I lent her a hand

535
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,900
and she was attracted to me

536
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,340
and took me for marriage.

537
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,740
But she put you in prison
on your wedding night.

538
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,580
She was trying to save me.

539
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,860
She even professed that she was pregnant.

540
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,140
She also humiliated you in public.

541
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,100
She regretted it right away

542
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,700
and apologized to me. She even...

543
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,300
made amends to me.

544
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,140
Young Master,

545
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,740
even if the Third Princess has feelings for you,

546
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,140
she's useless.

547
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,220
She has no abilities or morals

548
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,460
and she's infamous.

549
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,860
Will she be of help to us?

550
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,660
I can use her to get the Dragon Bone.

551
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,540
How about the Second Princess?

552
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,740
Weren't you going to use her?

553
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,620
You said she was the most
excellent princess of Huayuan City

554
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,300
and she'd hopefully be the City Owner.

555
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,700
Also, if you married her,
you'd get the Dragon Bone

556
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,620
and the black stone mine,

557
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,580
right?

558
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
I was wrong.

559
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,260
Now the Third Princess,

560
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,940
Chen Qianqian, should be the one

561
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,780
who the owner of Huayuan City favors.

562
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,060
She's also kind of clever.

563
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,460
If I give advice behind her,

564
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,740
she can definitely do great things.

565
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,060
Young Master.

566
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,060
You've seen it.

567
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,740
The Second Princess cold-shouldered me

568
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,180
and even plotted against me.

569
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,180
The Third Princess, Chen Qianqian,

570
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,460
has protected me a hundred times.

571
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,900
Why should we ignore Chen Qianqian

572
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,540
and take the trouble

573
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,460
to approach the Second Princess?

574
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,420
That's

575
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,620
reasonable.

576
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,500
Young Master,

577
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,380
brilliant.

578
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,620
So all along no one showed up

579
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,900
and you didn't find anything, right?

580
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,940
I'm incompetent.

581
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,980
Of course you are.

582
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,220
You've alerted the enemy.

583
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,340
Now it's even harder for us

584
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,780
to have something on them.

585
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,820
I was being negligent. I'm sorry.

586
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
Does this matter

587
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,300
really have nothing to do with Han Shuo?

588
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,900
It indeed has nothing to do with him.

589
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,580
I don't know

590
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,180
who gave us the information.

591
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,620
You were

592
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,180
too eager for honors

593
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,620
to lack the judgment.

594
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,420
Xuanhu City married a patient

595
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,620
to Huayuan City.

596
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,460
There must be a follow-up to it.

597
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,500
Yes.

598
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,900
Don't be angry, mother.

599
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,220
She's so careless.

600
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,140
How can I let her

601
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,460
be the City Owner?

602
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,900
Your Majesty,

603
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,540
the Second Princess

604
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,900
has been doing well.

605
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,340
Give her more time and chances.

606
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,620
I believe the Second Princess

607
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,740
won't let you down.

608
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,700
And Qianqian.

609
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,780
She's disobedient and capable of nothing.

610
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,500
I've really given up on her.

611
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,220
The Second and the Third Princesses are on good terms

612
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,100
and they're like real sisters.

613
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,860
When the Second Princess succeeds you,

614
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,780
I believe

615
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,700
she will take care of the Third Princess

616
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,820
and let her be free
and well off all her life.

617
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,780
I hope so.

618
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,540
My youngest daughter is incompetent

619
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,500
and the eldest one is always sick.

620
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,060
My successor

621
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,820
shall be Chuchu.

622
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,060
(An aura of orchid's elegance)

623
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,620
Your Highness.

624
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,740
Tomorrow Qianqian will go back

625
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,900
to clan school after her leave.

626
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,540
I hear Young Master Han
will enter the school, too.

627
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,700
Help me ask Minister Pei for leave.

628
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,140
Don't, Your Highness.

629
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,060
You can't be absent from school

630
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
to avoid the Third Princess.

631
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,380
In my opinion,

632
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,940
you should see and talk to people

633
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,820
and relax a bit.

634
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,620
You'll get worse if you're always alone.

635
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,580
How worse can it be?

636
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,500
My mother has forgotten about me

637
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,060
and my sisters never think of me

638
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,180
as their elder sister.

639
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,300
Perhaps

640
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,180
The Third Princess will be mature
after she got married

641
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,220
and stop causing you trouble.

642
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,940
Can marriage change a person?

643
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,900
Han Shuo has done a good job, then.

644
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,140
When you meet someone you fancy,

645
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
you'll also be different.

646
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,540
I'm afraid I'll die before that.

647
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,820
(The Tenth Draft of Will)

648
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,820
Put my new will away.

649
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,700
(The Tenth Draft of Will)

650
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,500
Why am I losing hair?

651
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,220
Zi Nian, close the door. Quickly.

652
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,620
Don't let the wind in.

653
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,940
And fetch me the barley, black sesame seeds,

654
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,140
black beans, Euryale seeds, lotus stamen

655
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,420
and walnuts that I prepared.

656
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,300
Yes, Your Highness.

657
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,980
What kind of fate I'm suffering?

658
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,340
I have to study and take exams
even in my dream.

659
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,700
I gotta wake up quickly.

660
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,900
Luckily Han Shuo won't think
about killing me now.

661
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,860
Does that mean

662
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,740
I can pair him off with Chuchu?

663
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,740
What are you doing?

664
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,340
I'm a little deaf.

665
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,060
I need to sit closer.

666
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,500
Don't think I don't know.

667
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,180
You just want to be close to Minister Pei.

668
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,660
You've married Han Shuo.

669
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,620
Mind what you say and see.

670
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,420
You're married.

671
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,980
You'd better stay away from other men.

672
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,300
No, no, no.

673
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,020
I just want to have a class.

674
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,060
Forget it. This stupid man
can't see the light.

675
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,220
There's nothing I can do.

676
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,460
According to rules of Huayuan City,

677
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,940
in the future, the princesses

678
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,740
will all need to take the Crown Princess Election

679
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,700
which consists of a literacy test

680
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,780
and discourse on politics.

681
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,260
The one who does best in it

682
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,780
will be invested as the Crown Princess

683
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,260
by Her Majesty.

684
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,740
Daughters of officials
will hold different positions

685
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,980
according to your performances.

686
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,060
You're all assets to our city

687
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,700
and have a heavy schedule.

688
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,220
Today we'll play a game.

689
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,940
I will come first in archery.

690
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,220
The game is not about the Five Arts.

691
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,780
The Six Arts

692
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,940
are rites, music, archery, chariot racing,
calligraphy and mathematics.

693
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,180
What are the Five Arts?

694
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,980
Performing music

695
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,740
is just a method of pleasing women.

696
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,900
How can it be bracketed with the others?

697
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,820
We won't talk about classics
or history today.

698
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,020
We'll compose verses.

699
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,260
The titles are "Wind", "Flowers",
"Snow" and "Moon".

700
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,620
Choose one of them

701
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,540
and say two lines.

702
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,380
They don't have to be
of seven or five characters,

703
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,300
or form a metrical poem or a quatrain.

704
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,140
What matters is the rhyme.

705
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,380
Let's start

706
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,100
from the Second Princess.

707
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,340
I'll choose wind.

708
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,140
Wind.

709
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,140
The water is blown and rippled.

710
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,660
Trees on the mountains are steady.

711
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,100
Your Highness, you've mastered it

712
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,500
and you can think big.

713
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,700
Princess Royal, it's your turn.

714
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,340
Flowers.

715
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,500
Can not be red forever.

716
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,180
Always vanish like a flash.

717
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,940
Princess Royal,

718
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,980
you win some and you lose some.

719
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,940
Don't be too pessimistic.

720
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,500
Miss Lin Qi, please.

721
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,180
Snow.

722
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,020
Snow.

723
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,540
I don't know what to say about snow.

724
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,820
Chen Qianqian,

725
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,700
what are you laughing for?

726
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,940
Can you do it?

727
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,340
I'm no better than you.

728
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,180
Of course I can't do it either.

729
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,460
Why did you laugh, then?

730
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,500
I hear the Third Princess

731
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,820
has made progress recently.

732
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,780
Why don't you give it a try?

733
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,540
Minister Pei,

734
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,540
don't stump her.

735
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,980
Everyone knows

736
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,820
she can read few words.

737
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,780
How about this?

738
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,140
We'll take a bet.

739
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,900
If you can do it,

740
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,380
I'll

741
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,860
clean the toilet.

742
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,180
If you can't,

743
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,620
you will clean the toilet.

744
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,780
Are you so sure

745
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,020
that I can't do it?

746
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,180
Just say if you dare or not.

747
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:15,940
I dare not.

748
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:17,780
I'm too lazy.

749
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,100
I bet the Third Princess will win.

750
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,300
If you lose,

751
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,380
I'll clean the toilet for you.

752
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,340
Must you do this?

753
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,660
You involved yourself

754
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,300
to see me lose face.

755
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,900
It's just composing a verse.

756
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,260
I wrote all your lines.

757
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,980
It's a piece of cake for me.

758
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,660
But Chen Qianqian is an illiterate person

759
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,780
who can't compose verses.

760
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,700
That's hard.

761
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,780
If Han Shuo cleans the toilet for me,

762
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,660
that will be hell.

763
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,500
Why? Are you afraid?

764
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,900
That's nonsense.

765
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,140
I got it.

766
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,740
Wind.

767
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,980
Ham,

768
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,020
salted fish,

769
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,260
sausage.

770
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,780
Suckling pigs,

771
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:12,940
baked pancakes,

772
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,940
whole lamb.

773
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:19,940
Good.

774
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,020
Why is it good?

775
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,340
Ham, salted fish and sausage

776
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,420
are all air-dried.

777
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,180
Roast suckling pigs, baked pancakes
and roast whole lamb

778
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,100
all need to be made with bellows.

779
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,300
I...

780
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,340
I'll have to clean the toilet, then?

781
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,300
I don't accept it.

782
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,220
What?

783
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,700
Okay, I'll make you accept it today.

784
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,860
Flowers.

785
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,820
Cakes, desserts, red ginger.

786
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,260
Scented tea, good and mellow wine.

787
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,580
Good.

788
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,260
Are they still about flowers?

789
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,580
Cakes, desserts and red ginger cakes

790
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,140
are usually made in the shape of flowers.

791
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,700
I don't need to explain flower teas

792
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,620
and wines, do I?

793
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,140
There's food and drink.

794
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,300
It's more interesting

795
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,620
than the former one about wind.

796
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,980
These verses are wretched.

797
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,060
Compose ones on

798
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,860
snow and the moon if you can.

799
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,500
Snow.

800
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,140
Blancmange, cold platter and cool cake

801
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,540
can be made when it snows.

802
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,140
Jujube paste, five nuts and egg yolks

803
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,620
can be eaten when the moon is full.

804
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,660
Lin Qi,

805
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,340
clean the toilet, please.

806
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,580
Thank you.

807
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,180
Minister Pei.

808
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,540
Looks like

809
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,820
you've really made

810
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,380
progress in your studies.

811
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,140
What are you doing?

812
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,540
(Music and Dance Academy)

813
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,100
You're back, my lady.

814
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,420
You...

815
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,900
What's the smell?

816
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,100
What's so smelly?

817
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,100
It's too smelly.

818
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,380
Get lost!

819
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
Who asked you to come over?

820
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,180
How dare you say that I'm smelly?

821
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,020
Why do you always get mad at the Third Princess?

822
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,460
She's the daughter of Her Majesty.

823
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,540
I just can't accept it.

824
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,140
Chuchu is better than her in every respect

825
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,140
but Her Majesty always likes Chen Qianqian

826
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,500
and picks on Chuchu.

827
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,940
I know you and the Second Princess
are good friends.

828
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,220
Don't worry.

829
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,260
The Second Princess is sure to be

830
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,220
the Crown Princess to the City Owner.

831
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,820
The Third Princess has such a bad reputation.

832
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,180
She's not worthy.

833
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,700
That's true.

834
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,500
Chen Qianqian is lacking in virtue.

835
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,220
How can she be the City Owner?

836
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,140
Wait.

837
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,700
Are these all given by Chen Qianqian?

838
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,660
Yes.

839
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,500
Her things are not allowed to be here.

840
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,180
You always flirt with each other.

841
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,540
She embarrassed me today.

842
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,020
I'll vent my anger on her man!

843
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,660
My lady,

844
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,820
he's also your man.

845
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,540
What if you beat him to death?

846
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,540
Lin Qi beat you?

847
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,900
I infuriated Miss Lin

848
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,860
and she ordered me

849
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,460
to return these things to you.

850
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,660
Lin Qi has obviously sent you

851
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,860
to piss me off.

852
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,900
She's too unruly.

853
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,740
I displeased her

854
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,540
and she took it all out on you.

855
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,340
She wasn't hitting you

856
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,820
but me.

857
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,180
Your Highness, don't mind it.

858
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,340
It didn't hurt when she whipped me.

859
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,580
But if

860
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,100
you're angered,

861
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,140
my heart

862
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,580
will ache.
