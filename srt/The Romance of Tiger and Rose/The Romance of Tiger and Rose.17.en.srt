=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 17)

24
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,100
Where is Su Mu?

25
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,380
Why is Lu Peng here?

26
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,020
I thought he married the Princess Royal.

27
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,900
Yeah.

28
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,420
Where is Su Mu?

29
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,820
Forget it.

30
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,420
The Princess Royal ignored him.

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,660
She sent people to invite
Su Mu from time to time.

32
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,340
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,980
Coquettish.

34
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,660
A musician's manners.

35
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,020
What's wrong with being a musician?

36
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,540
You're a musician yourself.

37
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,900
I'm different from him.

38
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,300
The Princess Royal picked me.

39
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,780
He only managed to use

40
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,060
his best musician's fame

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,580
to enchant her for a while.

42
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,860
Now I've been engaged to her.

43
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,220
And you're still pestering her.

44
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,700
She won't marry you.

45
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,260
A musician

46
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,900
doesn't deserve her.

47
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,340
She's a cripple who can't walk.

48
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,140
She has no right to detest me.

49
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,780
Dare you say that

50
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,540
again?!

51
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,140
I'm not saying it
just because you told me to.

52
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,700
A musician

53
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,820
can't order me around.

54
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,020
They are fighting.

55
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,540
After I get married,

56
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,900
I'll make you all fear me.

57
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,220
The Princess Royal.

58
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,300
I'll make the Princess Royal dote on me.

59
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,980
Let me go.

60
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,980
All those who stand in
the Second Princess's way

61
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,260
must die.

62
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,900
Why are there still so many documents left?

63
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,660
The City Owner's job is so tiring.

64
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,260
Take a rest if you are tired.

65
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,260
We can read these documents another day.

66
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,220
That won't do.

67
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,540
Folk people have their problems

68
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,460
and situations.

69
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,300
As the Crown Princess, I can't put them off.

70
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,140
I know.

71
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,220
I miss you too.

72
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,180
The mangoes and...

73
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,460
This is tiresome.

74
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,540
How come

75
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,580
every official

76
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,620
wrote crap?

77
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,860
Have you finished carving the stamp?

78
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,740
Yes, I have.

79
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,500
(I got it.)

80
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,260
The City Owner's job is so tiring.

81
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,500
I have to handle government affairs

82
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,740
and guard against the hostile people
from Xuanhu City.

83
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,860
Don't worry.

84
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,260
As long as I'm here,

85
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,220
Xuanhu City won't attack.

86
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,540
This way is easier.

87
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,580
Young Master, Your Highness.

88
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,580
Lu Peng is dead.

89
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Dead?

90
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,780
He was found dead this morning

91
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,940
in an alley.

92
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,740
I knew he was cannon fodder.

93
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,180
Pushing him into the spotlight
incurred heaven's punishment.

94
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,540
Wait.

95
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,980
I thought Lu Peng's death

96
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,100
had disappeared from the plot.

97
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,140
Why is the plot back on track?

98
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,220
Is the plot still moving forward?

99
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,900
Masters.

100
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,020
Didn't you say

101
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,860
a lot of things in the plot wouldn't happen?

102
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,740
But that musician still died.

103
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,900
You said

104
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,420
that musician was redundant.

105
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,740
Now you sound like

106
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,260
you're reluctant to let him go.

107
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,300
I'm worried about Banana.

108
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,620
Have you noticed

109
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,260
that even though many things
in the plot didn't happen,

110
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,300
the fate of the characters had no change?

111
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,100
Banana didn't blow up the city.

112
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,460
But Apple's mother still fell ill.

113
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,980
Crooked Melon didn't kill.

114
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,700
But that musician still died.

115
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,820
I'm worried.

116
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,420
I'm worried that Banana

117
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,100
will end up like he did in the plot I wrote.

118
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,500
Then how did Banana

119
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,940
end up in the plot?

120
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,620
According to the Crown Princess,

121
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,380
Apple destroyed Banana.

122
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,260
What does destroy mean here?

123
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,820
Xuanhu destroyed Huayuan.

124
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,700
Han Shuo spared Chuchu for their love.

125
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,380
But he didn't know

126
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,460
Chuchu would build up her strength

127
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,900
and make a comeback with Su Ziying's help.

128
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,740
The two of them eventually had a showdown.

129
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,900
Bai Ji!

130
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,580
Bai Ji.

131
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,180
Young Master.

132
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,940
Forgive me for taking one step ahead.

133
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,340
When you occupied Huayuan City
on the night of the Double Seventh Festival,

134
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,540
did you predict

135
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
my return?

136
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,500
I shouldn't have spared you back then.

137
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,500
Yes.

138
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,900
That's your biggest mistake.

139
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,940
Unfortunately,

140
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,300
you have no chance to make amends.

141
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,580
Under these circumstances,

142
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,420
only one of us

143
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,500
can live.

144
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,340
Banana

145
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,740
can't resist the beauty eventually.

146
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,860
There's no beauty.

147
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,500
He's nowhere near Apple right now.

148
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,700
The process doesn't matter.

149
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,260
What matters is the result.

150
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,380
He won't confront Apple now.

151
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,540
So he won't be stabbed in the heart.

152
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,220
But I'm afraid.

153
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,500
I'm afraid that he'll end up
like Orange's mother,

154
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,820
like that musician.

155
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,660
He may be able to avoid the stab,

156
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,460
but he'll still have the same ending.

157
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,820
If he really dies,

158
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,980
what should I do?

159
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,180
It's inevitable.

160
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,540
You designed him

161
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,500
as a tragic character in the first place.

162
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,180
Lin Qi, also known as Crooked Melon,

163
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,540
killed Lu Peng to save her black stone mine

164
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,700
and framed Han Shuo for the murder.

165
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,140
Crooked Melon.

166
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,540
Have you done the job as I said?

167
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,180
I've paid the coroner

168
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,900
to confirm the cause of Lu Peng's death.

169
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,460
We've secretly made a murder weapon
that matches the wound.

170
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,860
But I don't understand

171
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,460
why you'd frame Han Shuo

172
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,020
for Lu Peng's death.

173
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,740
Han Shuo

174
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,780
should be honored by Chuchu's affection.

175
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:51,980
Who'd have thought that

176
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,180
he would love that useless Chen Qianqian?

177
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,340
He made Minister Pei so mad

178
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,500
that Minister Pei left the clan school.

179
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,860
However,

180
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Lu Peng died at the right time.

181
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,500
I might as well seize the chance

182
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,140
to help Chuchu get even with him

183
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,620
and

184
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,980
teach Chen Qianqian a lesson.

185
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,020
My lady,

186
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,980
Han Shuo is the Young Master of Xuanhu City.

187
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,700
Do you think the City Owner

188
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,340
will punish him for killing a musician?

189
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,980
Lu Peng was no ordinary musician.

190
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,620
He was the Princess Royal's fiance.

191
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,700
Even if Han Shuo doesn't die this time,

192
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,620
he'll pay a grave price.

193
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,060
And he'd better be thrown

194
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,540
into the Music and Dance
Academy as punishment,

195
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,180
so I could discipline him.

196
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,420
By then,

197
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,740
I'd like to see Chen Qianqian's face.

198
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,380
Have you got the things ready?

199
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,580
The murder weapon
and physical evidence are ready.

200
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,340
Once your order is given,

201
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,540
those things will be sent to
Young Master Han in Yueli Mansion.

202
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,460
Good.

203
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,780
Let's do as planned tonight.

204
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,500
What are you planning to do tonight?

205
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Chen Qianqian?

206
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,660
Why are you here?

207
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,820
I'm here to investigate a case.

208
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,220
Lin Qi,

209
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,540
don't assume that I don't know

210
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,900
you killed Lu Peng.

211
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,180
You even intended to frame Han Shuo.

212
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,660
Chen Qianqian,

213
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,180
it's true that the two of us

214
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,300
want each other dead,

215
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,860
but you shouldn't

216
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,620
blame me for everything.

217
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,300
Quit making accusations without evidence.

218
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,900
Where is your evidence?

219
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,260
Search this place.

220
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:32,860
Yes.

221
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,100
Don't move.

222
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,180
The account book.

223
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,700
The account book.

224
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,460
(Musician Lu Peng of the Music
and Dance Academy was murdered)

225
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,700
One chi long and three cun wide.

226
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,900
According to the Criminal Minister,

227
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,740
it's the size of the weapon
used to kill Lu Peng.

228
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,660
Why did you draw this?

229
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,540
Why did you draw this?

230
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,580
For customization.

231
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,420
Keep on searching.

232
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,380
Your Highness.

233
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,580
How can you deny it now?

234
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,740
The murder weapon is here.

235
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,700
I... I made it for my own use.

236
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,540
That's right.

237
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,220
It's for your own use.

238
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,300
And you killed Lu Peng.

239
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,260
Chen Qianqian, stop slandering me.

240
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,340
Why would I kill Lu Peng

241
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,700
for no reason?

242
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,500
Why would I want to frame Han Shuo?

243
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,660
(Han Shuo)
The shingle.

244
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,140
You even made the shingle.

245
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,220
Are you waiting for Han Shuo
to hang out the shingle

246
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,100
at the Music and Dance Academy tomorrow?

247
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,820
You dare to touch my man.

248
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,620
Arrest her.

249
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,540
Chen Qianqian.

250
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,580
The whole Huayuan City doesn't belong to you

251
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,300
even if Her Majesty
isn't taking charge.

252
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,300
You are right.

253
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,500
Huayuan City belongs to me now.

254
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,260
You should know who Han Shuo is.

255
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,660
How dare you touch him?

256
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,220
You won't get to frame Han Shuo.

257
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,300
You have no regard for human lives.

258
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,900
Take her away and lock her up.

259
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,180
I'll decide her punishment.

260
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,540
Chen Qianqian, I thought you changed.

261
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,740
But you're still that rascal.

262
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,100
You... You are settling the case?

263
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,660
Why don't you investigate first?

264
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,340
Those storytellers were right.

265
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,860
Lin Qi really did it.

266
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,860
Things didn't turn out

267
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,140
as the plot designed.

268
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,140
I just didn't know

269
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,900
Lin Qi was playing tricks in the dark.

270
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,300
Now I can rest easy.

271
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,660
I heard

272
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,220
Chen Qianqian searched
the Music and Dance Academy.

273
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,540
So I went there to watch the disturbance.

274
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,780
Lin Qi?

275
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,340
What trouble has she caused this time?

276
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,180
Chen Qianqian found
the weapon used to kill Lu Peng

277
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,780
at Miss Lin Qi's place.

278
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,220
Lin Qi

279
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,060
always does more harm than good.

280
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,860
Everyone knows she is close to me.

281
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,380
She shouldn't have interfered.

282
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,500
If she isn't cautious enough,

283
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,780
she'll make me look suspicious.

284
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,580
If the Lin family withdraws her statement,

285
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,260
the case will definitely
be investigated thoroughly.

286
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,340
Maybe we should

287
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,860
prove Miss Lin Qi guilty

288
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,780
to close Lu Peng's case.

289
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,300
Your Highness, it's just my idea.

290
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,780
It has nothing to do with you.

291
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,300
Lin Qi of the Music and Dance Academy

292
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
murdered the Princess Royal's fiance Lu Peng

293
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,180
and attempted to frame
the Crown Princess's husband Han Shuo.

294
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,340
How are you going to handle the case?

295
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,580
Miss Lin Qi

296
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,580
is the only daughter
of the Lin family, after all.

297
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,260
No matter who pleads for her,

298
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,420
I won't spare her.

299
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,380
Even Chuchu can't change my mind.

300
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,740
Please sentence Lin Qi

301
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
to death.

302
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,620
Death?

303
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,020
Wait.

304
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,260
I killed off Lin Qi in the plot.

305
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,820
Sentencing her to death

306
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,020
only proves

307
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,260
that I can't change
the fate of the characters

308
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,500
even though I've changed the plot.

309
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,140
Then Han Shuo will...

310
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,140
Must not die.

311
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,460
Lin Qi must not die.

312
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,820
Lin Qi has made mistakes.

313
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,780
But considering the Lin family

314
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,820
has served Huayuan City for years,

315
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,460
I'll spare her life for now.

316
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
I handled the case on impulse yesterday.

317
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,900
I didn't carry out a thorough investigation.

318
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,740
We have testimony and physical evidence.

319
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,020
What's the need for investigation?

320
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,700
Your Highness,

321
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,340
did Lin Qi attempt to frame Han Shuo?

322
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,940
Yes.

323
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,460
Did Lin Qi's weapon

324
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,380
match the weapon used to kill Lu Peng?

325
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,260
Yes.

326
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,980
As the Crown Princess,

327
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,220
you surely can convict the owner

328
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,940
of the Music and Dance Academy.

329
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,380
You've been friends
with Lin Qi for many years.

330
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,180
You two even called
each other sisters yesterday.

331
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,860
How come you want her dead today?

332
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,180
I'm judging the case as it stands.

333
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,180
You're too emotional

334
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,820
while handling affairs.

335
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,300
Shouldn't you be grounded?

336
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,820
Why are you here?

337
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,940
It concerns Lin Qi.

338
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,940
To maintain Huayuan City's law,

339
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,220
of course I should set an example,

340
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,180
lest you show mercy

341
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,180
to a criminal for my sake.

342
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,540
You want her dead so badly?

343
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,940
Your Highness, make a decision.

344
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,660
What should we do about Lin Qi?

345
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,140
Lin Qi, you have a visitor.

346
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,860
Chuchu?

347
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,940
It must be hard for you

348
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,660
to come here to have a good laugh at me.

349
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,500
You're

350
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,980
pampered, overweening,

351
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
and conditioned to act willfully.

352
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,300
Change yourself.

353
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,740
Are you calling me willful?

354
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,260
Seriously?

355
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,860
Who snatched a groom on the street,

356
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,340
stole the Dragon Bone and
released the mountain bandits?

357
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,820
In terms of willfulness,

358
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,820
nobody can surpass you,

359
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,380
Chen Qianqian.

360
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,820
I don't understand.

361
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,820
Why have you always been playing against me?

362
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,660
Because you always play against Chuchu.

363
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,500
You stole Chuchu's stuff.

364
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,140
And I'll steal the stuff back for her.

365
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,140
I know

366
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,300
you grew up with Chuchu.

367
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,700
Compared to me, you are more like her sister.

368
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,060
But you should know that

369
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,620
people can change.

370
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,460
Bullshit.

371
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,020
At this point,

372
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,300
you're still sowing discord.

373
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,380
You think Chuchu is heartless like you?

374
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,380
Perhaps you killed Lu Peng

375
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,380
and framed me.

376
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,860
Fine.

377
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,260
Fine. I did it all.

378
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,220
Maybe it can make you feel better.

379
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,900
I

380
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,100
planned to sentence you to death.

381
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,500
Chuchu kept begging me

382
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,220
to spare your life.

383
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,380
Alright?

384
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,940
I knew it.

385
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,500
Your life can be spared,
but you can't escape punishment.

386
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,140
I'll banish you.

387
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,300
To what place?

388
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,260
A good place.

389
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,300
Xuanhu City.

390
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,780
Xuanhu City?

391
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,460
Where men take charge?

392
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,700
You might as well kill me.

393
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,740
With this golden token,

394
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,900
you won't be stopped
by anyone in Huayuan City.

395
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,580
You're banishing me to Xuanhu City.

396
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,500
What's the use of
Huayuan City's golden token?

397
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,300
You think I'm stupid

398
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,580
and I should thank you?

399
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,060
Are you sure you don't want it?

400
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,940
Lin Qi,

401
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,100
you are getting banished.

402
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,780
This is the most valuable thing
you could have.

403
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,100
At least you can trade it for food.

404
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,900
It's made of pure gold, after all.

405
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,980
You don't want it?

406
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,420
Whatever.

407
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,900
Stop!

408
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,940
Why hasn't Chuchu visited me?

409
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,540
I grounded her.

410
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,100
She pestered me and pleaded for you
every day. It was so annoying.

411
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,820
I'd rather not see her.

412
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,060
Chen Qianqian! You jerk!

413
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,940
You... You should come at me.

414
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,100
Set Chuchu free!

415
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,300
Let Chuchu go!

416
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,780
Chen Qianqian!

417
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,820
I've finally saved Lin Qi's life.

418
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,300
As long as Lin Qi is safe,

419
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,580
Han Shuo should be safe.

420
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,820
According to the original story line,

421
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,500
the ending is around the corner.

422
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,340
If nothing happens

423
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,140
during this time,

424
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,460
everything is going to be fine.

425
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,260
(I got it.)

426
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,500
Lately, it's been found that
the envoys of Xuanhu City

427
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,780
and their men have been lurking
on the borders of Huayuan City,

428
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,020
ready to make moves.

429
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,020
Please take a decision as soon as possible.

430
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,020
Xuanhu City's envoys haven't left.

431
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,980
Did they know about
mother's critical illness?

432
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,380
What's on your mind?

433
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,860
Nothing.

434
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,700
I know

435
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,300
you're stuck between
Xuanhu City and Huayuan City

436
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,860
and things are difficult for you.

437
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,340
I'll send them a letter

438
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,340
to tell them that
Huayuan City has no weakness

439
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,540
and they shouldn't stay here for long.

440
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,140
They'll be back soon.

441
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,420
Don't worry.

442
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,820
As long as I'm in Huayuan City,

443
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,340
the two cities won't make war

444
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,620
and the people won't live in misery.

445
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,420
Will you always stay in Huayuan?

446
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,300
This question never crossed my mind.

447
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,180
I was just asking.

448
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,300
We can talk about our future later.

449
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,980
We are like an ink pad and a stamp.

450
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,780
Without the ink pad, the stamp

451
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,340
is an useless rock.

452
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,380
Without the stamp, the ink pad

453
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,140
is an ordinary pigment.

454
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,820
They are like you and me.

455
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,500
They'd never separate.

456
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,140
Your Highness.

457
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,740
What's the matter?

458
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
It's late. Go to bed.

459
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,660
Mind your own business.

460
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,020
Stop paying attention to my sleep.

461
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,340
Your Highness, I have important news
for the Young Master.

462
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,300
No matter what it is, leave it for tomorrow.

463
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,740
Nobody must disturb us here.

464
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,620
Alright.

465
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,620
Now,

466
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,980
nobody will disturb us again.

467
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Let's

468
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,660
carry on.

469
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,700
Your Highness.

470
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,900
Your Highness, Miss Lin Qi has set off.

471
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,500
As you ordered,

472
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,300
I have asked the City Guards
to take care of her on the way.

473
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,540
You didn't have to tell me that.

474
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,020
I'm not close to her.

475
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,780
What's the deal now, my lady?

476
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,540
I can't keep on walking.

477
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,940
We have not gone far.

478
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,460
You'd spend ten days to complete
a three-day journey.

479
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,540
You're going so slowly,

480
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,740
when will we arrive in Xuanhu City?

481
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,100
I'm not going.

482
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,100
What can you do to me?

483
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,220
You two can go without me.

484
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,460
It's okay. It's okay.

485
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,460
She's just tired.

486
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,540
We'll continue our journey after a rest.

487
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,780
Release me from the shackles.

488
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,900
If our superior hadn't

489
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,060
ordered us to take care of you,

490
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,700
we wouldn't have cared about your feelings.

491
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,860
The Second Princess
ordered you to take care of me.

492
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,580
So you have to take care of me.

493
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,380
Otherwise, I'll write a letter to Chuchu

494
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,460
after arriving in Xuanhu City,

495
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,100
asking her to kill you two.

496
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,220
The Second Princess?

497
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,260
The Second Princess wasn't
the person who ordered us.

498
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,820
Yeah.

499
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,060
Not Chuchu?

500
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,140
Is it the Princess Royal Yuanyuan?

501
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,260
It's the Crown...

502
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,260
Chen Qianqian?

503
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,540
You are Chuchu's subordinate.

504
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,020
I want to see Su Mu.

505
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,660
Your Highness,

506
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,860
the Music and Dance Academy

507
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,500
is going through big changes

508
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,020
in utter chaos.

509
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,780
Your timing is unfortunate.

510
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,820
I want to see Su Mu.

511
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,980
But we are closed.

512
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,060
Do you want to drink?

513
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,220
Or do you want music?

514
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,020
We musicians of the Music and Dance Academy

515
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,020
are highly skilled

516
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,060
and able to serve you well.

517
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,820
I waited for you in my mansion every day.

518
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,540
You didn't show up.

519
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,940
I had no choice but to come here
and look for you.

520
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,980
I see. You want to have fun

521
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,300
in the Music and Dance Academy.

522
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,580
You once said

523
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,860
the Music and Dance Academy's beauty

524
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,340
mostly manifested in you.

525
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,860
The service of all musicians

526
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,220
couldn't outdo your hearty smile.

527
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,020
Why would you rather have
other people keep me company

528
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,620
than smile at me?

529
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,100
I'm willing to serve

530
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,900
the dignitaries and nobles in Huayuan City.

531
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,700
But I'm unwilling to associate

532
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,500
with you.

533
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,060
Zi Nian.

534
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,020
Escort the Princess Royal
back to her mansion.

535
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,940
Your Highness.

536
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,620
I'll be here tomorrow.

537
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,980
If you don't change your mind,

538
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,100
I'll choose another one of these musicians

539
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,420
as my husband.

540
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,660
We dare not marry you.

541
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,220
Your Highness, please spare us.

542
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,940
We dare not follow in Lu Peng's footsteps.

543
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,660
What are you doing?

544
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,580
Extend your hand.

545
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,900
I have something for you.

546
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,380
What is it?

547
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,540
Me.

548
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,420
I carved a new stamp for you.

549
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,340
Heart-shaped.

550
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,700
Good to see you smile.

551
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,660
You've been feeling distraught these days.

552
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,940
What happened?

553
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,860
Is it about

554
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,100
the City Owner's illness?

555
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,940
Or is it about the annoying
government affairs?

556
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,900
Maybe,

557
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,660
too many unforeseen events
have happened recently.

558
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,540
Lu Peng died.

559
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,820
But there's still a barrier

560
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,060
between Su Mu and Yuanyuan.

561
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,860
I really don't understand.

562
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,300
How nice it would be

563
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,980
if two people in a relationship
were open and honest.

564
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,260
Why must they

565
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,540
make one-sided sacrifices

566
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,500
for each other's sake?

567
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,580
It only hurts them.

568
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,180
If you really think so,

569
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,820
then let's make a deal.

570
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,300
No matter what happens in the future,

571
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,540
you must not make decisions alone

572
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,700
like Su Mu.

573
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,140
We should talk things out.

574
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,660
If you make this deal with me,

575
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,340
I'll go with you and try
to talk some sense into Su Mu.

576
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,780
Even if I have to tie him up

577
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,700
and put a blade on his neck,

578
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,700
I'll make him accept the marriage.

579
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,900
I'll make this deal with you.

580
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,260
We'll come up with solutions together.

581
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,620
And I want you to promise me one thing.

582
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,900
No matter what happens in the future,

583
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,660
we won't hide things from each other
or lie to each other.

584
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,740
Okay?

585
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,660
Wait.

586
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,020
(Do not disturb.)

587
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,220
Nobody will disturb us now.

588
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,540
Your Highness!

589
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,180
(Do not disturb.)

590
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,620
Bad news! Lin Qi is dead!

591
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,260
Your Highness.

592
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,460
The story is about to end.

593
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,820
You can't change Banana's fate now.

594
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,860
Banana was destined to die.

595
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,500
If you wanted to change it,

596
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,660
you would need to start from the beginning.

597
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,620
Start from the beginning?

598
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,820
I shouldn't have written the wedding scene
where the groom was taken.

599
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,900
It's karma at work.

600
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,180
But Orange

601
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,660
should have been dead long ago.

602
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,300
She has lived to this day.

603
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,540
Your Highness,

604
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,300
let's be honest,

605
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,060
is this Orange

606
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,340
still the same Orange?

607
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,700
I see.

608
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,500
I set the trap.

609
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,820
But now I'm involved.

610
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,060
I've lost control of many aspects.

611
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,420
To protect him

612
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,820
from his original fate,

613
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,780
I have to push him out.

614
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,140
After all, the outsiders are the safest.

615
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,700
I'll change Banana's fate.

616
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,580
Then Banana will end
his part in the story earlier.

617
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,780
It won't do.

618
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,740
From Orange's perspective,

619
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,780
this story won't be a comedy anymore.

620
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,060
Even in those so-called comedies,

621
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,420
reality always contradicts hopes.

622
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,140
That's why people say
"great joy leads to sadness."

623
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,940
Even the happiest ending

624
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,020
can include happy tears.

625
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,180
Tragedy and comedy

626
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,700
have always been sharing the same root.

627
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,820
In that case,

628
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,900
Banana will only know

629
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,620
part of the truth.

630
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,660
He'll hate Orange very much.

631
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,660
Yeah.

632
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,100
When heaven is about to confer
a great responsibility on any Orange,

633
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,940
it'll remove Orange's skin and seed,

634
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,460
cut Orange into four pieces
and extract Orange's juice.

635
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,180
Happiness only comes after suffering.

636
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,620
It's the hardship

637
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,740
Orange must endure.

638
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,140
Your Highness, where are you going?

639
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,700
I'll go find Pei Heng and Su Mu.

640
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,060
The screenplay has been completed.

641
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,460
It's time to bring in the actors.

642
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,820
Your Highness.

643
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,260
I need to adjust my mode.

644
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,180
I'll be shooting a heart-breaking scene soon.

645
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,220
Are you scared by what happened to Lin Qi?

646
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,140
You've been spacing out all day.

647
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,740
Here.

648
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,620
Calm your nerves.

649
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,140
It's not about Lin Qi.

650
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,260
It's about Yuanyuan and Su Mu.

651
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,540
If I put myself in their shoes

652
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,220
as the Young Master

653
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,660
of Xuanhu City

654
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,260
who fell for a courtesan

655
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,460
and insisted on marrying her,

656
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,540
the people of Xuanhu City would judge me.

657
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,220
Su Mu's concern

658
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,740
isn't groundless.

659
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,860
He really is thinking for Yuanyuan,

660
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,460
fearing that others
might attack her for this.

661
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,180
Since you know where the problem lies,

662
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,020
you should try to talk some sense into Su Mu.

663
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,660
I made an appointment with him

664
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,220
in the tea house.

665
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,380
Okay.

666
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,740
I'll go there in your stead.

667
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,740
And I'll visit mother
in the City Owner's mansion.

668
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,340
Alright.

669
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,620
Zi Rui.

670
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,460
Your Highness.

671
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,780
Let's go find Pei Heng.

672
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,900
You're treating Young Master Han
like this again.

673
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,380
Have you forgotten about the erotic pictures?

674
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,580
Actually,

675
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,100
it's not a big deal

676
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,220
seeking comfort from Mr. Pei secretly.

677
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,500
After all, it's a mistake every woman makes.

678
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,340
But you've got to toughen up.

679
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,940
When Young Master Han found out,

680
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,380
you knelt on the ground right away.

681
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,020
You even pulled me down with you.

682
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,580
You weren't honorable at all.

683
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,660
Weak legs don't matter.

684
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,780
I'm afraid things
will be different this time.

685
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,740
He'll not only scold me,

686
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,620
but also take a blade to kill me.

687
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,100
Qianqian, you wanted to see me?

688
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,980
Pei Heng, I need to ask you a favor.

689
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,140
I'd do anything for you.

690
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,340
Mr. Su, sorry for keeping you waiting.

691
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,900
I just arrived.

692
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,300
Where is the Crown Princess?

693
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,700
She's taking care of the City Owner.

694
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,180
And she couldn't leave for now.

695
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,580
So she asked me to come in her stead.

696
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,880
After you.

697
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,700
Thank you.

698
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,900
Who's in that room?

699
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,100
Young Master Han and Su Mu.

700
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,420
Your Highness, you should go back.

701
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,140
He still refused to see me?

702
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,300
It's not that Mr. Su refused to see you.

703
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,220
He went out to meet Young Master Han

704
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,780
and didn't return the whole night.

705
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,060
He didn't return the whole night?

706
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,460
Yeah.

707
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,380
Where can he be?

708
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,740
We musicians

709
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,340
have nowhere to go

710
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,500
except the Music and Dance Academy.

711
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,780
I hope that he hadn't ended up like Lu Peng.

712
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,060
Su Mu has gone missing?

713
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,900
The Criminal Minister is on this case.

714
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,860
The last victim Lu Peng

715
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,220
also came from the Music and Dance Academy.

716
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,020
I have a feeling that he
has been sexually assaulted.

717
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,780
Who did it

718
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,340
before I could do it?

719
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,060
(Man Lost)
My dear Mr. Su.

720
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,380
Still worrying about Su Mu?

721
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,220
It's my fault.

722
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,140
After meeting him in the tea house yesterday,

723
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,300
I didn't send him back to
the Music and Dance Academy.

724
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,820
I'm a little scared.

725
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:06,980
Of what?

726
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,060
Mother had an accident
and slipped into a coma.

727
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,980
Su Ziying attempted to harm me,

728
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,420
but then disappeared.

729
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,460
Lu Peng walked on the street

730
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,980
until his throat was cut open.

731
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,980
Not to mention Lin Qi.

732
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,900
Huayuan City hasn't been peaceful lately.

733
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,660
The City Guards are controlled by Chuchu.

734
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,940
You can't stay with me around the clock.

735
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,660
When you aren't with me,

736
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,140
who will keep me safe?

737
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,780
Don't think wildly.

738
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,500
I've sent people

739
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,940
to investigate Su Mu's case.

740
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,580
Did you bring some shadow guards

741
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,780
when you came from Xuanhu City?

742
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,260
Are you using them
to probe and pass on messages.

743
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,740
Bai Ji.

744
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,180
Why do you guard against me?

745
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,060
I'm not asking the Young Master

746
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,340
for the guards.

747
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,860
I can let you have them.

748
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:05,900
It's just...

749
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,900
It's just I don't know Kung Fu

750
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,340
to protect myself right now.

751
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,740
If I knew Kung Fu,
I wouldn't be afraid of robbers and bandits.

752
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,940
If they dared come,

753
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,260
I'd take their lives.

754
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,140
Unfortunately,

755
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,540
one cup of poisoned wine

756
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,220
dissolved my Kung Fu which I had
been practicing for over ten years.

757
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,340
Young Master, this isn't wise.

758
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,220
(Xuanhu)

759
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,660
This is your...

760
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,460
This is the only token
that can order my guards.

761
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,660
They'd risk their lives
to protect the token's owner.

762
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,860
Now

763
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,260
it's yours.

764
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,220
For real?

765
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,980
I asked you for it and you just gave me.

766
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:40,980
The guards

767
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,140
are your only trump in Huayuan City.

768
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,660
Now you let me have this token.

769
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,700
What if... What if I don't deserve it?

770
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,260
Of course you do.

771
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,580
I gave you my possessions and life.

772
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,140
But I don't hear anyone calling me husband.

773
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,060
Husband.

774
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,420
What did you call me?

775
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:10,860
Alright.

776
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,220
Let's go find Su Mu.

777
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,620
I'm worried about him.

778
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,860
Only by pushing Han Shuo out
of the story completely,

779
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,940
can I save his life.
