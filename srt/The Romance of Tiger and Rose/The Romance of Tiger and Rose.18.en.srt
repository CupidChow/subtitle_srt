=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 18)

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,620
(Music and Dance Academy)

25
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,300
Yesterday Young Master Han and Su Mu
went to the tea house

26
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,340
and took a separate room.

27
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,100
We didn't know

28
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,660
what they talked about

29
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,500
but we heard cups being broken

30
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,060
and people quarreling.

31
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,620
I think Su Mu was killed by Young Master Han.

32
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,140
But there's no enmity between Su Mu

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,620
and Young Master Han.

34
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,300
It's for the Crown Princess.

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,060
Young Master Han and Mr. Pei are

36
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,020
also on bad terms because of her.

37
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,820
But didn't Su Mu

38
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,860
often go to the Princess Royal's mansion?

39
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,820
That proves it.

40
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,340
It's because of the Crown Princess

41
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,700
that he didn't catch the embroidered ball.

42
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,580
Do you think

43
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,500
it's because they both hated

44
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,380
Young Master Han

45
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,020
that Su Mu and Mr. Pei got along?

46
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,220
I asked you to tell me about the murderer.

47
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,020
Don't talk any gossip.

48
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,820
Your Excellency,

49
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,780
the last person

50
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,620
Su Mu saw yesterday is Young Master Han.

51
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,340
That's all that we know.

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,340
That's to say,

53
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,380
Young Master Han is the most suspicious.

54
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,140
The Crown Princess was going
to meet Su Mu yesterday

55
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,260
and I did go in her stead.

56
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,620
What's he doing here?

57
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,020
Do you have any evidence, Criminal Minister?

58
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,140
We found Su Mu's belt in the alley

59
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,780
around the Music and Dance Academy.

60
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,580
There were footprints
like this on the ground.

61
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,820
It's said that in Huayuan City,

62
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,220
only Young Master Han has

63
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,700
such a pair of shoes.

64
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,980
Here's the evidence.

65
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,100
Yes, that's the evidence.

66
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,260
I thought it was going to rain

67
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,220
so I wore the shoes you made for me.

68
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
That's true.

69
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,540
They're waterproof, non-slip and wear well.

70
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,300
Do you mean

71
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,540
you admit

72
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,460
that you had an argument
with Su Mu last night?

73
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,980
When did I admit that?

74
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,300
Your Highness, you've always obeyed the law.

75
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,580
I wonder how I should decide this matter.

76
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,620
Why don't you just

77
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,380
be cooperative

78
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,900
and go with them?

79
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,900
I'll take you home

80
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,540
when things are clear.

81
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,540
Honey,

82
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,100
she just said I always obeyed the law.

83
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,380
It can't turn out to be false here, can it?

84
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,180
You didn't do it, anyway.

85
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,140
Just cooperate with them.

86
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,860
Okay,

87
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,820
I'll do it for your sake.

88
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,780
Let's go, Criminal Minister.

89
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,140
Han Shuo.

90
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,540
The Crown Princess ordered

91
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,060
that you should have enough to eat and drink.

92
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,740
She also sent someone

93
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,620
to bring you your tea leaves and tea set.

94
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,740
Your Excellency,

95
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,540
we found new evidence.

96
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,860
(Xuanhu)

97
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,980
For real?

98
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,860
The guards

99
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,380
are your only trump in Huayuan City.

100
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,020
Now you let me have this token.

101
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,580
What if I don't deserve it?

102
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,380
I thought it was going to rain

103
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,740
so I wore the shoes you made for me.

104
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,740
That's true.

105
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,100
They're waterproof, non-slip and wear well.

106
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,860
(The Prison)

107
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,980
Here is the Crown Princess's order.

108
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,020
As the husband of the Crown Princess
of Huayuan City,

109
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,140
Han Shuo was supposed
to serve his wife properly

110
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,940
but he killed an innocent musician
out of jealousy.

111
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,700
He should be beheaded for this heinous crime

112
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,940
but in view of his marriage
to the Crown Princess,

113
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,420
he'll be banished
to the south frontier and guarded.

114
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,220
He's not allowed to come back to Huayuan

115
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,100
or go back to Xuanhu.

116
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,660
Han Shuo, take the order.

117
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,740
Where's Qianqian?

118
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,980
I want to see her.

119
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,380
(Divorce Letter)

120
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,180
This is a divorce letter she wrote to you.

121
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,340
She's keeping something from me.

122
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,900
Or you turned her against me.

123
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,820
Xiaoqian won't do this to me.

124
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,500
Qianqian said you'd refuse to accept it.

125
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,580
Fine.

126
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,340
I can let you see her.

127
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,700
Young Master,

128
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,340
the Crown Princess is waiting for you inside.

129
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
Why?

130
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,820
What reasons shall I give you?

131
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,740
I just got bored with you
and love you no more.

132
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,780
Are you keeping something from me?

133
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,180
Tell me.

134
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,500
We can solve it together.

135
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,100
You promised me

136
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,580
no matter what happened,

137
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,940
you would discuss it with me

138
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,940
and you wouldn't decide anything without me.

139
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,180
Of course I'm keeping something from you.

140
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,140
Didn't you also keep something from me,

141
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,300
Young Master Han?

142
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,300
If I have done anything wrong,

143
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,260
I can change.

144
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,540
You're so devoted to me.

145
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,820
I didn't expect you to say that.

146
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,460
Did you forget who you are?

147
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,980
Let me remind you.

148
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,740
Remind me.

149
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,620
About what?

150
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,260
Xuanhu City coveted
the black stone mine of Huayuan,

151
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,180
pretended to sue for peace

152
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,860
and sent you here for a marriage.

153
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,180
Outwardly, you treated us like family

154
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,820
but actually you were scheming
to attack the city for the mine.

155
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,980
Xuanhu City is good at
making explosives and weapons.

156
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,700
We couldn't meet force with force

157
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,340
so I made use of your own trick

158
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,660
and offered to marry you.

159
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,740
So the love at first sight

160
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,900
is a lie.

161
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,860
In order to earn your trust,

162
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,740
I stole the Dragon Bone

163
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,780
and turned it into a bowl of soup.

164
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,220
Curing my heart disease is also a lie.

165
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,780
No.

166
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,580
That's true.

167
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,660
Because the Dragon Bone

168
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,900
wasn't that important to me.

169
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,060
What did I keep an object for?

170
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,860
As long as you're in my hands,

171
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Xuanhu City won't dare to step out of line.

172
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,100
You're a living amulet.

173
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,140
What about

174
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,340
the Soul Missing Powder you took by mistake?

175
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,300
Syrup.

176
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,020
It was syrup.

177
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,820
You thought I couldn't practice Kung Fu
after being poisoned

178
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,180
and felt guilty.

179
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,980
It was all a lie.

180
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,820
I just wanted your pity.

181
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,740
From then on,

182
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,980
you became so obedient.

183
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,500
You were a tiger

184
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,660
but you were as well-behaved as a little cat.

185
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,540
You put on the bracelet

186
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,300
and changed the explosives into fireworks.

187
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,460
You even gave your token to me.

188
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,780
Now you're all alone.

189
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,620
Except the idiot, Bai Ji,

190
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,180
no one can be of use to you.

191
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,020
I know there are a lot of spies
from Xuanhu City here

192
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,620
and I won't stupidly banish you
to the south frontier

193
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,580
and allow them to save you.

194
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,420
I chose a good place for you.

195
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,100
Just go there.

196
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,660
In this world,

197
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,100
except me,

198
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,460
no one will know where you are.

199
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,660
But don't think about escaping.

200
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,980
I'll lock you in every day

201
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,540
and you'll be heavily guarded.

202
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,220
If Xuanhu City schemes to save you,

203
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,460
I'll give an order

204
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,140
and your City Owner will see your corpse.

205
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,660
Only then

206
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,940
will Xuanhu City keep its nose clean.

207
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,980
You're the only child
of your City Owner, after all.

208
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,220
Did you do so many things

209
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,580
just to make me a hostage?

210
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,940
Did you ever have a little bit
true feelings for me,

211
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,620
even just for a moment?

212
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,980
No.

213
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,820
Why are you still taking it with you?

214
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,940
Just forgot to throw it away.

215
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,500
By the way,

216
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,540
I forgot to tell you.

217
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,340
Stamps don't need ink pads in some places.

218
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,020
In that case,

219
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,420

Your Highness,

263
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,780
why did you join hands with Mr. Pei

264
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,340
and Mr. Su

265
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,340
to frame Young Master Han?

266
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,940
Why did you divorce him?

267
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,900
Don't you think he's pitiful?

268
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,420
Why did you ask me
to bed the white jade bottle

269
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,580
in the wall?

270
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,500
Zi Rui.

271
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,340
I'll take him back.

272
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,180
No.

273
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,020
Let me be alone for a while.

274
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,780
(Huayuan)

275
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,420
Stop drinking.

276
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,180
I... I knew it.

277
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,060
I don't need Han Shuo.

278
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,980
We can't give up the whole forest

279
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,340
for a single tree, can we?

280
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,700
Enjoy it while it lasts.

281
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,220
You're just acting happy.

282
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,740
Actually deep down,

283
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,460
you care very much about Young Master Han.

284
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,420
You just didn't admit it.

285
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,500
Otherwise, why did you
order Meng Guo to follow him

286
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,180
and send you his news?

287
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,940
You're wrong.

288
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,940
Women should be mentally independent.

289
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,340
Can't we live without men?

290
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,980
Can't we live?

291
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,980
We can.

292
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,660
Dance.

293
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,700
You... you stop playing.

294
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,940
Get up and dance.

295
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,700
Wake up, Che Pi.

296
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,540
Your Highness,

297
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,620
you've played dice,

298
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,140
sung songs,

299
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,020
and danced.

300
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,620
But why didn't you smile a bit?

301
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,100
I'm happy.

302
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,060
We are not.

303
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
You've been like this for days.

304
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,300
Please change for another batch of men.

305
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,620
Please let us go, Your Highness.

306
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,500
Stop torturing us, please.

307
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,500
We'd rather die than keep doing this.

308
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,860
If you keep torturing us, I...

309
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,900
I really can't hold on any longer.

310
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

311
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,060
Quick, quick. Go, go, go.

312
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,380
Come on. Come on.

313
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,860
I'm exhausted.

314
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,860
I won't ever betray you,

315
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,100
or I'll die a violent death...

316
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,260
From now on,

317
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,300
you and I

318
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,660
are through.

319
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,100
It's for Han Shuo

320
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,820
that I stayed in this dream.

321
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,820
How shall I live my life now?

322
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,620
Don't touch them.

323
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,260
Don't hurt your hands.

324
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,700
He's gone.

325
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,300
He's really gone.

326
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,420
Give them to me.

327
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,100
I'll repair it for you.

328
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,260
Thanks.

329
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,660
Are you still thinking about Han Shuo?

330
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,580
No.

331
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,980
I just think this stamp is pretty

332
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,180
so I keep it.

333
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,900
Qianqian,

334
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,300
you don't have to disguise anything

335
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
in front of me.

336
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,220
Han Shuo has left

337
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,660
but I'm still here.

338
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,820
If you can't overcome your sadness,

339
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,060
just consider me as him.

340
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,300
I'll keep you company.

341
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,060
Pei Heng,

342
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,780
thanks but no.

343
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,180
Your Highness, I'm here.

344
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,460
Now that you have no feelings for me,

345
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,780
there's no need for you to bid me farewell.

346
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,580
Your Highness,

347
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,540
you must take care of yourself.

348
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,980
Have your meals on the dot.

349
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,420
Don't drink too much cold tea

350
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,180
or sit in a draught at night.

351
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,380
Don't just read medical books.

352
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,900
You can read

353
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,940
comic books and laugh

354
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,220
like the Crown Princess does.

355
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,620
Su Mu,

356
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,820
I don't understand.

357
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,220
Do you care about me or not?

358
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,100
People all think of me as a plaything.

359
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,580
Only you understand

360
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,300
and appreciate me.

361
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,780
I'm grateful for your admiration.

362
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,540
If I am determined to be with you,

363
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,060
surely our relationship will be
a constant topic of conversation.

364
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,180
Won't I repay

365
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,780
good with evil, then?

366
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,820
So you're leaving

367
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,260
because of that.

368
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,180
But I don't care what people think at all.

369
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,540
♪Matters have been downplayed.♪

370
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,900
♪The wind blows and the string breaks.♪

371
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,900

you can stand up and walk.

404
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,620
Don't cry, Your Highness.

405
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,980
He said

406
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,780
he doesn't like me.

407
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,740
(A pure heart and spirit)

408
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,500
Mother,

409
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,500
I made a lot of mistakes recently

410
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,820
because I really didn't know what to do.

411
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,700
I sent Han Shuo away

412
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,460
but I did it for his own good.

413
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,220
Because I'm scared.

414
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,700
I'm afraid his life will go on

415
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,540
according to the ending I wrote.

416
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,180
I can't bear to watch him die.

417
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,820
I want him to live

418
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,220
safe and sound

419
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,140
but not to be with me for a few days and die.

420
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,140
As the City Owner,

421
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,860
you must have also done

422
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,420
things like this against your will.

423
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,220
You understand me, don't you?

424
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,420
If you have had

425
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,380
to deal with it,

426
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,860
I guess you'd have been crueler than me.

427
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,940
So what I did

428
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,740
wasn't too far, was it?

429
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,460
Qianqian.

430
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,940
Qianqian.

431
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,300
You woke up.

432
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,980
I was half awake and you said

433
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,180
you sent Han Shuo away.

434
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,060
What mischief did you get into again?

435
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,660
Help me up.

436
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,020
Your Highness,

437
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,900
when Her Majesty was in a coma,

438
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,780
none of the doctors could cure her.

439
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,580
It must be

440
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,980
because of your filial piety
that she woke up.

441
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,460
That's nonsense.

442
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,260
It's because she angered me.

443
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,660
Mother, when you were asleep,

444
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,700
I successfully maintained order
in Huayuan City.

445
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,500
But you sent Han Shuo away.

446
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,700
I took great pains

447
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,060
to test his feelings for you.

448
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,940
Never mind. I'll say no more about it.

449
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,580
Let's talk about Yuanyuan first.

450
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,020
It's time she got married.

451
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,820
Lu Peng was murdered.

452
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,100
What?

453
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,660
Yuanyuan is also sick.

454
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,300
So for the next few days,

455
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,340
let's not mention the engagement

456
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,860
in front of her.

457
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,620
I'm to blame.

458
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,620
That day Lu Peng came

459
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,820
to discuss their wedding with me.

460
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,300
Unexpectedly, I passed out

461
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,220
and held up this matter.

462
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,580
What... what did you say?

463
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,380
On the day when you quarreled with Chuchu,

464
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,500
Lu Peng was also there?

465
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,580
Does that mean

466
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,620
Lu Peng heard you quarreling with Chuchu?

467
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,140
Chuchu...

468
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,820
what has the Second Princess
been doing in her mansion?

469
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,260
Your Highness,

470
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,420
she has been copying out
"the Classic of Filial Piety" every day.

471
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,780
Every day?

472
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,860
Yes. She sent what she wrote here every day.

473
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,660
I think something's wrong.

474
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,180
(The Classic of Filial Piety)

475
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,580
Take it to the City Owner's mansion.

476
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,900
Remember. Be careful when you speak.

477
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,940
Don't let anyone know
the Second Princess has left the city.

478
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,660
Yes.

479
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,100
Young Master, look.

480
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,460
The Crown Princess still cares about you.

481
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,180
She prepared nice wine

482
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,580
and dishes for every meal of yours.

483
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,740
The longer I live,

484
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,700
the better it is for her.

485
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,140
Don't worry, Young Master.

486
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,700
Her Highness has got it all sorted.

487
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,220
No one knows where we are.

488
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,620
And don't try to escape.

489
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,220
Live according to Her Highness's arrangements

490
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,020
and you'll still have a good life.

491
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,060
Young Master,

492
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,100
I left a mark for Minister Yang
before we left.

493
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,100
It's been a couple of days

494
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,540
and her men should have arrived.

495
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,660
How come there's no news at all?

496
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,740
Chen Qianqian is cunning.

497
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,700
Certainly she has done it after knowing

498
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,820
all my cards.

499
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,660
Minister Yang

500
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,940
is not useful now.

501
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,420
But before she actually locks me in,

502
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,180
she should check whether someone agrees.

503
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,660
Who is it?

504
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,180
Your Highness, please drink some water.

505
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,380
Chen Qianqian is not a complete fool.

506
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,980
She didn't want us to find Han Shuo

507
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,140
and tried to trick us with an empty cart.

508
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,660
The skills you learned in the army

509
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,380
came in handy at a critical juncture.

510
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,540
I happen to be good at looking for people.

511
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,140
There are just a few maps
in Chen Qianqian's study.

512
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,060
According to those signs of wear,

513
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,300
it's easy to guess

514
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,900
where she wants to hide Han Shuo.

515
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,180
It must be hard for her.

516
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,580
She expelled her love.

517
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,540
Chen Qianqian is faithless by nature

518
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,260
and Han Shuo is unforgiving

519
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,540
and vengeful.

520
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,260
Your Highness, if you seize this chance

521
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,740
to co-opt Han Shuo,

522
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,220
you'll be able

523
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,020
to oust Chen Qianqian through him.

524
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,660
Just eat something.

525
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,500
As the saying goes,

526
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,300
"It's hard to do anything
with an empty belly."

527
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,820
We'll rest here tonight

528
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,140
and leave early in the morning.

529
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,020
If you don't eat anything,
I'm not eating either.

530
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,180
I didn't expect you would take risks

531
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,180
to come to my rescue, Your Highness.

532
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,980
You saved me on Weimeng Mountain.

533
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,700
When you were in trouble,

534
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,340
of course I wouldn't sit by.

535
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,580
Thanks for your kindness.

536
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,220
Now you know

537
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,100
what Chen Qianqian is like, don't you?

538
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,540
It was a painful memory.

539
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,020
I have an idea

540
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,860
and I wonder if you're interested in it.

541
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,060
Go on, please.

542
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,980
Chen Qianqian exiled you.

543
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,260
Even I can't bear to watch this happening.

544
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,020
How can you

545
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,220
resign yourself to it?

546
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,420
I kept thinking about it
and I want to help you.

547
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,860
I have the token to deploy
the City Guards of Huayuan

548
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,580
and you have...

549
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,020
The City Guards token?

550
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,780
You're still being confined, aren't you?

551
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,980
It's hard for you to come after me already.

552
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,380
How are you going to deploy the City Guards?

553
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,860
So you're not sincere in what you said.

554
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,020
It's not that you want to help me

555
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,300
but you need me

556
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,780
to help you.

557
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,180
True.

558
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,700
I can't use the token for the moment

559
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,500
because of being confined.

560
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,580
But I do have the ability to change

561
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,740
the situations of Huayuan City.

562
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,140
The defense map?

563
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,180
You need me to help you

564
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,300
get back the City Guards of Huayuan.

565
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,780
And I also need you to help me

566
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,540
get something.

567
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,780
What do you want?

568
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,300
I want the black water mine

569
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,260
that was just found in Huayuan City.

570
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,580
You only want the mine?

571
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,340
Or what?

572
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,100
Deal.

573
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,980
Young Master, we're free already.

574
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,940
Why didn't we go back to Xuanhu

575
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,900
but join hands with this woman?

576
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,900
Don't worry.

577
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,780
I won't trust

578
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,460
any woman in Huayuan City ever again.

579
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,980
Chen Qianqian,

580
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,380
one mine

581
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,580
is not enough for what you did to me.

582
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,820
What I want

583
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,140
is the whole Huayuan City.

584
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,700
Bai Ji, send a letter to Huayuan City.

585
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,620
(Puzzle: Mother caught a stroke -
Chuchu called in Lu Peng -)

586
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,740
(Lu Peng got Yuanyuan's embroidered ball -
Su Mu suppressed Lu Peng -)

587
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,580
(Lin Qi whipped Lu Peng)

588
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,740
Why do I feel

589
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,580
Chuchu is more motivated
than Lin Qi to kill Lu Peng?

590
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,540
Where on earth am I wrong?

591
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,180
Mother has woken up now.

592
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,300
If I find out

593
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,940
how Lin Qi and Lu Peng died,

594
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,940
will there be room for me
to change Han Shuo's destiny?

595
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,100
Your Highness.

596
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,620
The letter just arrived.

597
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,180
Meng Guo should have sent it three days ago.

598
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,180
A suspicious caravan is going with them.

599
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,660
They sell a variety of goods. Lingnan...

600
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,740
merchants...

601
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,660
Yes, sell.

602
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,980
Sell... sell specialties of Lingbei.

603
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,140
They're not at all sweet for me.

604
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,780
I... I saw a man

605
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,860
who was small, thin but nippy.

606
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,860
I couldn't help but think of Su

607
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,380
and miss...

608
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,820
What nonsense did Meng Guo write to me?

609
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,460
I sent him to follow

610
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,580
and watch Han Shuo.

611
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,460
What did he write about Su Ziying for?

612
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,620
Who can tell me how Han Shuo is now?

613
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,620
(Huayuan City)

614
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,860
The Crown Princess ordered
that the city be sealed off.

615
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,340
(Huayuan City)

616
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,180
Wait.

617
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,100
(Huayuan City)

618
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:23,900
Who are you?

619
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,860
This is Second Princess.

620
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,580
Make way, all of you.

621
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,540
Your Highness,

622
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,820
weren't you confined by the Crown Princess?

623
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,860
(Huayuan City)

624
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,260
