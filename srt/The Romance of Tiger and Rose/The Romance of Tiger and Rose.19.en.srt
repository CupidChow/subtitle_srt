23

(Episode 19)

24
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,620
This is how guards are placed
in the City Owner's Mansion.

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,300
I'll go in first and arrange things.

26
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,260
An hour later,

27
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,020
you go in with soldiers and help me out.

28
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,140
Within a short time,

29
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,100
I'll be able to deploy

30
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,700
the City Guards of Huayuan again.

31
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,980
(Defense Map of Huayuan City)
With Your Highness' assistance,

32
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,340
I'm in my element.

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,700
Your Highness,

34
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,820
the Crown Princess is here.

35
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,820
What is she here for?

36
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,200
Young Master, let's go.

37
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,900
Let her in.

38
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,060
Yes.

39
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,960
So

40
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,920
you serve Chen Chuchu.

41
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,790
No wonder you repeatedly tried
to kill Chen Qianqian

42
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,250
on Weimeng Mountain.

43
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,620
The Crown Princess is immoral.

44
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,650
She doesn't deserve to be
the owner of Huayuan City.

45
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,740
Do you know why I came?

46
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,740
How am I supposed to know

47
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,140
what you came for?

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,500
Is it to have a heart-to-heart talk with me?

49
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,700
Did you kill Lu Peng?

50
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,700
Wasn't he killed by Lin Qi?

51
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,020
You exiled her in person.

52
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,340
Why are you accusing me now?

53
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,820
Did you kill him or not?

54
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,940
Lu Peng witnessed your argument with Mother.

55
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,060
Your reason to kill him is more plausible.

56
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,500
Speaking of that,

57
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,660
weren't you always against

58
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,340
Lu Peng marrying Yuanyuan?

59
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,580
You have a reason to kill him, too.

60
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,460
It's indeed you.

61
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,820
Now that you had reached a conclusion,

62
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,320
why did you come and ask me?

63
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,770
Chen Chuchu,

64
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,940
if you didn't want him to blab about it,

65
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,940
you could just threaten him.

66
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,400
Why must you kill him?

67
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,040
So now you know life is precious.

68
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,670
When you wronged Young Master Han

69
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,590
and confined him for life,

70
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,440
did it cross your mind
that life was precious?

71
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,680
Treating him like that

72
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,110
is even crueler than killing him.

73
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,820
What did you mention Han Shuo for?

74
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,420
Certainly,

75
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,780
an insignificant Young Master

76
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,260
of Xuanhu City is just

77
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,220
a plaything to you.

78
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,140
Without Han Shuo,

79
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,580
you still have Minister Pei.

80
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,980
I heard that

81
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,980
after Young Master Han left,

82
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,100
music was played

83
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,820
and songs were sung

84
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,220
every night in your mansion.

85
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,340
I finally know

86
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,500
why Mother would fall ill.

87
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,140
If I had heart disease,

88
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,380
I would suffer an attack right now!

89
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,180
Didn't you hear it all?

90
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,180
You are not important

91
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,540
at all to her.

92
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,460
Watch the Second Princess closely.

93
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,620
No one's allowed to enter
or leave Xingzi Mansion.

94
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,740
Yes.

95
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,200
The hero left.

96
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,240
The heroine turned into a villain.

97
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,220
The supporting roles are dead.

98
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,420
No Wi-Fi.

99
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,420
No phones.

100
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,540
Only distress is left.

101
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,580
I sent Han Shuo away

102
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,600
and stopped Xuanhu from conquering Huayuan.

103
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,500
But my story also stopped here.

104
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,780
No progress at all.

105
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,540
Is Huayuan heading for its doom?

106
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,940
The Crown Princess is always like that.

107
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,700
She's simply hopeless.

108
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,320
Stop drinking.

109
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,220
If you really miss Han Shuo,

110
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,620
you can absolve him

111
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,980
and order him to come back.

112
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,460
Don't make yourself suffer.

113
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,220
Han Shuo can never

114
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,140
return to Xuanhu or Huayuan.

115
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,620
I messed it up.

116
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,420
If Lin Qi hadn't died,

117
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,080
there could be room for changing everything.

118
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,260
Then he and I would

119
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,580
be able to be together forever

120
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,460
and didn't have to leave each other.

121
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,220
I'll drink the rest of the wine

122
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,660
with you.

123
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,340
(Many talents compete in splendor)

124
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,940
Han Shuo.

125
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,460
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,540
I said I didn't like you before.

127
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,140
I was lying.

128
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,060
I want to be with you forever so much.

129
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Me, too.

130
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,340
Bai Ji.

131
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,980
Young Master,

132
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,380
you said you were going
to check defense of the city.

133
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,820
Of course I came to see clearly

134
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,260
so that we can act tonight.

135
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,220
Your Majesty.

136
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
I hear

137
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,260
Qianqian went to
the Music and Dance Academy again.

138
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,060
Looks like this child

139
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,980
is still stricken by love.

140
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,500
Sangqi, to be honest,

141
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,580
Chuchu is fitter than Qianqian

142
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,780
to be the City Owner.

143
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,500
Your Majesty,

144
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,540
these two princesses

145
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,820
are both pillars of the city.

146
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,140
The Second Princess is brave and resourceful

147
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,300
and the Crown Princess is flexible.

148
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,220
They both have their strong points.

149
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,420
But after Han Shuo left,

150
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,580
Qianqian

151
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,180
is no longer the person who loves her city.

152
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,780
I'll reconsider my decision.

153
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,860
Although Chuchu talked back to me,

154
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,260
after that matter,

155
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,940
she'll be steadier

156
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,540
and less impetuous.

157
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,180
She's still cut out for it.

158
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,620
I don't need her filial affection.

159
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,900
She's not my own child, anyway.

160
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,780
I only need her

161
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,660
to be kind to Huayuan people.

162
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,300
So I think

163
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,780
I'll lift her confinement.

164
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,940
Your Majesty!

165
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,860
Someone has besieged the city
and is attacking your mansion.

166
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,900
What?

167
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,260
When I was in a coma,

168
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,340
did Qianqian confiscate
Chuchu's flower token?

169
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,220
No.

170
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,180
The Crown Princess considered their relation

171
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,780
and only confined her.

172
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,740
What?

173
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,660
Your Majesty.

174
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,300
Let's go back.

175
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,660
Chen Chuchu.

176
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,340
What nonsense did Meng Guo write again?

177
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,560
The weather was sunny.

178
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,620
I was caught in a sandstorm again.

179
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,900
Everywhere...

180
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,340
So much nonsense.

181
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,660
The sandstorm was over. I lost track of them.

182
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,460
How could he lose track of him?!

183
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,580
Oh, he's here.

184
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,500
You... come and help me to my bed. Come.

185
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,260
How long are you gonna sleep?

186
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,060
If I can,

187
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,780
I wanna sleep until the end of the play.

188
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,180
I'll wait for you however long it takes.

189
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,620
If I say I did it

190
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,580
for your own good,

191
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,660
will you believe me?

192
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,060
Go on, please.

193
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,980
Forget it. Even I myself don't believe it.

194
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,700
Come. Guard this place.

195
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,460
What... what's going on?

196
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,940
What's happening outside?

197
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,260
Young Master, we've besieged
the City Owner's Mansion.

198
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,860
You besieged the city?

199
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,940
I asked you not to make so much noise

200
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,060
and wake her up.

201
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,300
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,060
When I was on my way to exile,

203
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,140
I thought even if you were just a bit sad,

204
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,500
I would forgive you.

205
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,380
But what I saw was...

206
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,580
No, I...

207
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,580
Do... do you know what acting happy is?

208
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,780
I have been really sad.

209
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,180
I can even cry now.

210
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,460
Then I'll think you were shedding

211
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,100
tears of happiness.

212
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,780
No.

213
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,020
It... it's just about comedy.

214
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,260
Actually I think the plot is still

215
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,740
quite campy so far.

216
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,980
During the thirteen days I was away,

217
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,660
I missed you every day.

218
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,500
What did you miss me for?

219
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,460
Young Master.

220
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,660
This is a gift for you.

221
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,380
You didn't have to.

222
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,180
You could just come without any gifts.

223
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,220
What...

224
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,300
Your Highness,

225
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,260
drink one every day.

226
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,820
What... what are these?

227
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,100
Should be honey water.

228
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,460
Right.

229
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,980
If you don't drink them,

230
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,260
your mother will have no medicine to take.

231
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,900
She is in my hands now.

232
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,180
Are they all honey water?

233
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,020
One contains Soul Missing Powder.

234
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,420
Which one?

235
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,900
Guess.

236
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,340
Try one now, Your Highness.

237
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,940
No big deal. I'll just die here.

238
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,460
Your mother's medicine.

239
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,340
It's not honey water.

240
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,580
It's bitter melon juice.

241
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,020
Confine the Crown Princess.

242
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,660
Yes.

243
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,620
What did I do those things for?

244
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,300
I tried so hard to prevent

245
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,820
Xuanhu from taking over Huayuan

246
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,420
and it still happened.

247
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,580
Order from the higher authorities.

248
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,780
Close the gate. No one's allowed
to enter or leave the city.

249
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,780
Let us out.

250
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,360
Young Master Han is back.

251
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,340
Soldiers from Xuanhu City are everywhere.

252
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,140
If we stay here,

253
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,500
we'll all have to die.

254
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,700
Let us out. Let us out.

255
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,820
What about the Princess Royal?

256
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,140
What about the Princess Royal?

257
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,260
What's going on in Risheng Mansion?

258
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,820
What's going on in Risheng Mansion?

259
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,140
Risheng Mansion has been besieged.

260
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,660
It's dangerous there. Flee right now.

261
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,500
Let us out.

262
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,180
(An aura of orchid's elegance)

263
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,780
(Quietness and Elegance)
Don't touch that, you bastard.

264
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,220
Will?

265
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,940
Your Highness has been lame for years

266
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,420
and has always been writing wills.

267
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,740
How come you have never even

268
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,260
tried to kill yourself once?

269
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,700
Let's go.

270
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,860
(Quietness and Elegance)

271
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,780
Your Highness.

272
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,680
Your Highness.

273
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,860
Your Highness.

274
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,780
Su Mu.

275
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,580
Your Highness, please get up.

276
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,580
Zi Nian, take it.

277
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,030
Your Highness,

278
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,380
were you hurt?

279
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,130
Now you're back.

280
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,940
You really flatter yourself.

281
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,500
I thought you said

282
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,620
you didn't like me.

283
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,140
I've changed.

284
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,780
I didn't like you before

285
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,700
but now I do.

286
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,660
That's to say

287
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,180
you admit it?

288
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,700
You have feelings for me.

289
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,620
Don't you mind that you're a musician now?

290
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,060
The city has been captured.

291
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,320
It doesn't matter who I am now.

292
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,440
But you may be in trouble, too.

293
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,960
I, Su Mu,

294
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,620
was fortunate to be liked by Your Highness.

295
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,980
From now on, I'll stay with you

296
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,580
until death do us apart.

297
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,380
I would rather you didn't admit it.

298
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,540
Now we're like

299
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,380
a couple on the run.

300
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,820
Your Highness.

301
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,900
These are all your wishes.

302
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,620
Now most of them have

303
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,580
gone up in smoke.

304
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,380
Luckily this one is still here.

305
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,980
Your Highness,

306
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,540
look. To win someone's heart.

307
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,580
Your Highness.

308
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,220
Young Master Han Shuo
of Xuanhu viciously attacked

309
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,780
Huayuan City after Qianqian
humiliated and exiled him.

310
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,340
Han Shuo rebelled but I'm still here.

311
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,340
I've sent guards to protect your mansion.

312
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,940
You'll be safe, Mother.

313
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,480
You're indeed my good girl.

314
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,340
I've taught you well.

315
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,620
With you,

316
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,620
I'll rest easy.

317
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,180
Where's Qianqian?

318
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,260
Is she in Han Shuo's hands

319
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,660
or Chuchu's?

320
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,300
She's with Young Master Han.

321
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,340
The first thing he did after he came back

322
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,220
was surrounding the Crown Princess.

323
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,420
Just surrounded her?

324
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,420
Yes, he just surrounded her.

325
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,060
Good. That's a good thing.

326
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,700
Yes. If Her Highness
is with Young Master Han,

327
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,420
she'll be safe and sound.

328
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,740
(City Owner's Mansion)

329
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,820
Her Majesty doesn't feel well today

330
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,620
and there are city affairs to handle.

331
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,220
The Second Princess, Chen Chuchu,
is promising,

332
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,740
brave and resourceful.
She can be of great use.

333
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,300
Thus, the Second Princess,
Chen Chuchu, is specially

334
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,300
assigned to act in the City Owner's stead.

335
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,780
If Her Majesty is not well,

336
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,540
it should be the Crown Princess who fills in.

337
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,220
Your Highness,

338
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,700
isn't it against the rules for you to meddle

339
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,140
in affairs of Huayuan City?

340
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,160
Soldiers.

341
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,810
The Second Princess Chen Chuchu

342
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,240
disregards rules set by the ancestors.

343
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,360
Does anyone else object?

344
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,780
Where's Sangqi? Ask him to send...

345
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,380
Anyone else?

346
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,140
Minister Liu, you always put

347
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,420
in a word for the Second Princess.

348
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,820
Why didn't you step forward

349
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,420
and congratulate Her Highness now?

350
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,860
Leave.

351
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,020
You can't go in. You can't go in.

352
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,580
Go away.

353
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,420
It's not too late for you to repent now.

354
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,340
What made you say that, Minister Pei?

355
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,420
Answer me.

356
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,060
Why did Han Shuo come back?

357
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,220
The disappearance of Su Mu

358
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,420
was fabricated by Chen Qianqian.

359
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,060
Han Shuo is never guilty.

360
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,500
Let me ask you again.

361
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,500
Are the guards who besieged
the City Owner's Mansion

362
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,580
your men

363
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,900
or Han Shuo's?

364
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,460
Chuchu,

365
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,580
I know you won't take my words seriously.

366
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,260
But I still need to say this.

367
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,820
Everything you want

368
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,980
would belong to you.

369
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,460
But if you grab it yourself,

370
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,700
it'll no longer be yours.

371
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,220
Now that it's mine,

372
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,420
it's just a matter of time

373
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,740
before I get them.

374
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,260
Don't be bothered, Minister Pei.

375
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,980
Oh, no. You're not
the Minister of Education now.

376
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,220
I still call you Minister Pei

377
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,260
just for the late
Minister of Defense Pei's sake.

378
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,820
The late Minister of Defense.
If my mother knows...

379
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,700
Young Master Han.

380
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,100
You have had a tiring day.

381
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,060
Let's discuss what to do tomorrow.

382
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,140
Young Master Han

383
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,220
was uneasy when he saw Minister Pei.

384
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,900
Does he still have feelings

385
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,460
for the Crown Princess?

386
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,020
Han Shuo is vengeful.

387
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,060
If Pei Heng goes to save Chen Qianqian,

388
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,780
he won't be able to help her

389
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,260
but infuriate Han Shuo instead.

390
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,380
(Yueli Mansion)

391
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,480
Don't go in, Mr. Pei.

392
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,480
You don't have any real powers or forces.

393
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,680
You're no match for Han Shuo

394
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,480
with our guards alone.

395
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,420
If you barge in now,

396
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,010
you'll be courting death.

397
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,380
Even if you worry about the Crown Princess,

398
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,700
you still need to think twice.

399
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,130
I have no idea how Han Shuo
will treat Qianqian.

400
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
I must save her.

401
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,140
Mr. Pei,

402
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,420
you can't save Her Highness alone.

403
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,260
I must try even if I can't.

404
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,700
Mr. Pei. Mr. Pei.

405
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,860
Mr. Pei.

406
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,980
If you keep doing this,

407
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,100
you'll never win Qianqian's heart.

408
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,140
But you can't even have her body.

409
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,500
If you hurt her,

410
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,820
you'll be unworthy of her affection for you.

411
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,540
Her affection?

412
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,380
What about mine?

413
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,220
You've been divorced.

414
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,380
I'm taking Qianqian away.

415
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,180
Mr. Pei. Mr. Pei. Mr. Pei.

416
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,700
Let go of me. Mr. Pei.

417
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,300
Try it.

418
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,540
Her divorce letter

419
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,180
only complies with rules of Huayuan City.

420
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,740
Now we'll obey those of Xuanhu City.

421
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,300
She's my wife.

422
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,460
She's staying with me forever.

423
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,220
Pei Heng.

424
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,980
Are you okay?

425
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,340
Stop.

426
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,980
Qianqian.

427
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,100
Qianqian.

428
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,780
What are you doing?

429
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,460
Han Shuo, let go of her.

430
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,380
What are you doing, Han Shuo?

431
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,900
Put me down, Han Shuo.

432
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,860
Let go.

433
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,780
Let go of me, Han Shuo.

434
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,300
Qianqian.

435
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940
Qianqian! Qianqian!

436
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,780
Go.

437
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,460
Qianqian!

438
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,220
Please let Qianqian go, Young Master Han!

439
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,220
Han Shuo.

440
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,980
Han Shuo.

441
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,260
You and Pei Heng were really a pitiful sight.

442
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,980
You begged me for each other.

443
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,300
What are you doing?

444
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,860
Stay away from me.

445
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,740
I once loved you,

446
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,500
respected you and cherished you.

447
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,740
And you

448
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,220
were so unworthy.

449
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,220
Don't you dare, Han Shuo.

450
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,780
Of course I dare.

451
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,980
And no one will stop us now.

452
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,500
Listen, Han Shuo.

453
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,260
Nothing forcibly done
is going to be agreeable.

454
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,900
You won't know for sure

455
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,820
before you try.

456
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,460
Help!

457
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,540
Help! Help!

458
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,660
Han Shuo, don't do it.

459
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,020
Han Shuo, don't be like this. Han Shuo.

460
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,700
Help! Help! Go away!

461
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,900
Han Shuo.

462
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,220
Han Shuo, don't be like this. I'm scared.

463
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,900
I'm really scared.

464
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,060
What a spoilsport.

465
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,140
Huayuan women

466
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,820
really disappoint people.

467
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,980
She indeed can't do Kung Fu anymore.

468
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,380
She just never speaks a true word.

469
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,980
But what was I doing?

470
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,540
Han Shuo,

471
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,700
you beast.

472
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,620
I was doing what a couple
will do with my wife.

473
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,740
Did I break any rules?

474
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,260
And you are still here.

475
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,060
Did you enjoy Chen Qianqian's yells?

476
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,940
You don't love her.

477
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,340
You don't love her at all!

478
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,100
Love!

479
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,380
You love her. Does she care?

480
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,220
Chen Qianqian only loves herself.

481
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,380
She doesn't love anyone else.

482
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,100
I'll treat her the same way

483
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,260
she once treated me.

484
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,700
Nobody gets away with doing that to me.

485
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,060
You'd better give up as soon as possible.

486
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,060
If I find that you try

487
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,340
to steal my wife again,

488
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,780
I won't be kind to you.

489
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,060
Escort Minister Pei back to his mansion.

490
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,540
What's that look of yours?

491
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,900
You're so good at saying hurtful words

492
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,460
but once you saw Her Highness,
your heart melted.

493
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,700
You came out within such a short time.

494
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,260
If you really can't do it,

495
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,860
shall I help you?

496
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,660
You help me?

497
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,540
Do what you failed to do

498
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,780
on Weimeng Mountain.

499
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,260
Get lost.

500
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,460
Come back.

501
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,700
Replace everyone

502
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,860
with our soldiers
according to the defense map.

503
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,540
Chen Chuchu is not reliable.

504
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,780
Mr. Pei. Mr. Pei.

505
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,060
Mr. Pei.

506
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,380
Han Shuo, do you think

507
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,380
I'll give up Qianqian like this?

508
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,940
Your Highness, are you okay?

509
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,300
Didn't you see it?

510
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,340
I shouldn't have cared about that beast.

511
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,260
I should've let Han Shuo die.

512
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,300
I just shouldn't have cared about him.

513
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,180
Why don't you give in to Young Master Han?

514
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,540
What did you say?

515
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,620
When Young Master Han was exiled,

516
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,460
you thought about him all the time.

517
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,660
Now he's back

518
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,700
and stands in front of you,

519
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,420
don't you also want to be with him?

520
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,380
And he'll stop besieging the city.

521
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,500
Won't all be well, then?

522
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,180
Is the current Han Shuo

523
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,900
still the old one?

524
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,580
Now he's an-eye-for-an-eye Shuo.

525
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,500
He's an an-eye-for-an-eye demon.

526
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,420
An... An-eye-for-an-eye Shuo.

527
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,460
But if you'd rather die than give in

528
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,180
and infuriate Han Shuo,

529
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,740
the Second Princess will be the City Owner

530
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,180
and no one will protect us.

531
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,940
I think our... our lives are more important.

532
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,140
Chuchu is going to be the City Owner?

533
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,220
Yesterday Zi Zhu announced an order
from the City Owner

534
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,660
and said Her majesty was sick

535
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,620
and let the Second Princess
act in her stead.

536
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,820
I don't know if it's true

537
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,940
but everyone is saying

538
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,820
the Second Princess will succeed
the City Owner soon.

539
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,140
Chuchu succeeds the City Owner.

540
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,660
The sun and the moon shine at the same time.
The heavenly gate opens.

541
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,720
It's getting back to the plot.

542
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,140
What are you talking about, Your Highness?

543
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,420
That's the sign of a good ruler coming down.

544
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,300
The Second Princess is not worthy.

545
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,980
In that case,

546
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,300
I'll be able to wake up and go home.

547
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,300
But Han Shuo dies shortly after Chuchu

548
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,860
succeeds the City Owner.

549
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,300
Now Xuanhu has besieged

550
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,500
Huayuan City.

551
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,580
What if Han Shuo actually dies

552
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,740
according to the plot?

553
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,220
No.

554
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,900
I can't let Chuchu be the City Owner.

555
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,460
Quickly. Go in. Go in.

556
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,020
Look. Men from Xuanhu are ferocious.

557
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,380
(Many talents compete in splendor)

558
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,140
Your Highness, choose one.

559
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:54,860
Well,

560
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,180
well,

561
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,660
there were ten yesterday.

562
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,380
How come there are only five today?

563
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,220
Isn't it more likely that I'll choose

564
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,340
the poisonous one?

565
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,380
Young Master said this was funnier.

566
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,500
Funnier?

567
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,420
He thinks it's funnier.

568
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,020
Has he considered

569
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,260
the feelings of the player?

570
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:16,780
Won't...

571
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,380
won't there be only two tomorrow?

572
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,380
It all depends on Young Master's mood.

573
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,940
Han Shuo,

574
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,620
you are the obstacle on my way home.

575
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,820
I can't let him torture me like this.

576
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,860
I need to counter-attack.

577
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,380
Exciting.

578
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,540
Your Highness.

579
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,500
Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear.

580
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,460
Oh dear. Oh dear.

581
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,660
Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear.

582
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,620
Young Master. Young Master. Oh dear.

583
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,340
What's she up to again?

584
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,940
Her Highness had a stomachache

585
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,300
after she drank it.

586
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,420
Soy sauce, vinegar, honey water,
scallion juice and liquor.

587
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,860
Which one can make her stomach ache?

588
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,900
But she drank all of them.

589
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,460
You...

590
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,300
why didn't you stop her?

591
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,620
I tried to

592
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,180
but I failed.

593
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,940
She did that

594
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,060
in order to see the Princess Royal, right?

595
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,380
I think...

596
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,180
It's aching.

597
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,380
Help, Yuanyuan.

598
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,540
It's killing me.

599
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,780
So painful.

600
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,020
So painful.

601
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,380
It's killing me. It's killing me.

602
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,180
Quick. It's killing me.

603
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,180
Quick.

604
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,900
Quickly.

605
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,860
So painful.

606
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,740
So... so painful.

607
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,940
God, it aches so much.

608
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,500
Just now I drank the same things as you.

609
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,140
How come I'm alright

610
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,260
and your stomach aches so much?

611
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,380
That's because you're strong.

612
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,860
I'm too weak.

613
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,500
Quick, send for Yuanyuan. Quickly.

614
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,180
Don't worry.

615
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,220
To be on the safe side,

616
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,700
I have sent for a doctor.

617
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,940
Doc...

618
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,540
Will be here soon.

619
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,820
That's not okay.

620
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,980
Yuanyuan is the best doctor

621
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,260
in the whole Huayuan City.

622
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,940
Send for her. Quick.

623
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,500
You're so seriously ill.

624
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,420
Don't you also want to see your mother?

625
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,340
Shall I ask the City Owner to come as well?

626
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,020
If you do that,

627
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,340
it'll be the best.

628
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,460
Chen Qianqian,

629
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,100
don't try to fool me.

630
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,900
I won't let you see

631
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,940
any one of them.

632
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,860
Now that you don't want to see the doctor,

633
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,620
keep aching, then.

634
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,380
Han Shuo!

635
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,220
I'm like this
and you're still not helping me?

636
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,020
Aren't you well?

637
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,340
Stay here.

638
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,220
Don't think about escaping.

639
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,980
When you were away,

640
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,300
I missed you every day and every moment.

641
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,180
Should you treat me like this?

642
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,380
Young Master, a group of musicians

643
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,940
came singing and playing.

644
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,940
They said the Crown Princess invited

645
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,140
them over almost every day before

646
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,380
and now she doesn't do that anymore.

647
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,660
They miss the Crown Princess.

648
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,460
Almost every day.

649
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,340
When you missed me,

650
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,860
you needed musicians to play music to you.

651
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,500
No, Han Shuo.
There must be some misunderstanding.

652
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,900
They... they slandered me.

653
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,380
Ask... ask them to go back.

654
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,340
Let them in.

655
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,220
Otherwise, Your Highness
will miss them so much

656
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,980
and get away to see them.

657
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,980
You got it wrong.

658
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,460
Han Shuo, you've really got it wrong. You...

659
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,140
Why on earth did you come here?

660
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,340
Han Shuo was in a fit of anger.

661
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,060
Didn't you add fuel to the fire?

662
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,620
We came to play music to you.

663
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,780
I'm so distressed now.
I don't wanna listen to it.

664
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:56,860
Pei...

665
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,660
You need music more when you're distressed.

666
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,180
Who told me

667
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,860
music could relieve my distress?

668
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,300
What are you doing here?

669
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,020
I came to get you out of here.

670
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,260
Get...

671
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,780
How are you going to do that?

672
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,220
You're so furtive.

673
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,860
Bai Ji.

674
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,260
Look at me.

675
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,500
Listen carefully.

676
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,940
The Crown Princess wants to eat

677
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,780
roast duck and goose,

678
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,740
pig bladder with pine nuts,
aired meat and sausage,

679
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,620
crystal and amber pig elbows,

680
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,340
blanched and fried three kinds of meat.

681
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,140
If you don't want me to name more things,

682
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,340
go and get them ready now.

683
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,420
Say them again.

684
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,820
Roast duck and goose,

685
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,980
pig bladder with pine nuts,
aired meat and sausage.

686
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,580
Okay, okay.

687
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,220
I'll go right now.

688
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,380
I've got to be grateful that Bai Ji is

689
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,660
someone who can never do things well

690
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,980
and you can speak.

691
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,740
Luckily Han Shuo is out.

692
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,900
I speak so fluently.

693
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,300
How's my mother now?

694
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,460
Her Majesty is under house arrest.

695
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,660
Yuanyuan and Su Mu

696
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,820
are also locked in.

697
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,220
They're alright for the moment.

698
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,940
I'm really sorry.

699
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,940
You had to disguise yourself as a musician.

700
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,820
I once thought it was shameful
to please women

701
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,380
but now I think

702
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,020
it's also great to help the woman I love

703
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,900
and make her laugh.

704
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,660
Pei Heng.

705
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,700
I know.

706
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,420
I shouldn't talk about that now.

707
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,300
Did Han Shuo make things
difficult for you again?

708
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,020
No. He's quite nice to me.

709
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,340
After what he has done,

710
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,900
you still defended him.

711
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,780
It's a long story.

712
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,420
I'm to blame.

713
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,980
I forced him to be like that.

714
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,440
Your Highness.

715
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:15,680
