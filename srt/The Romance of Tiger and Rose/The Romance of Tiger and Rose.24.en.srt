=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 24)

24
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,060
Have you lost your mind?

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,580
I'm a descendant of the Pei family!
My last name is Pei!

26
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,660
But what you are doing

27
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,780
is against Her Majesty's decree

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,700
and disturbing the livelihood of our people,

29
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,900
as well as in defiance
of late Minister Pei's will!

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,020
I treated you whole-heartedly,

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,140
yet you switched sides right in front of me!

32
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,260
Which side are you on exactly?

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,660
Surround this place!

34
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,620
The City Guards are certainly
on the side of the Pei family!

35
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,020
Mr. Pei.

36
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,740
You are also a descendant of the Pei family,

37
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,340
and you are just as upright

38
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,100
and talented as late Minister Pei!

39
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,860
Though you are a man, so what?

40
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,740
Your Highness.

41
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,860
That day, you personally
smashed the flower token

42
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,140
and asked us

43
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,460
to follow the person instead of the token.

44
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,580
And now,

45
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,260
we'll just follow another person.

46
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,460
Fellow brothers and sisters,

47
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,340
bring out the guts of our City Guards!

48
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,460
I'm willing to follow Mr. Pei!

49
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,140
Han Shuo!

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,500
Qianqian, watch out!

51
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,140
Xiaoqian!

52
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,940
Go get the doctor!

53
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,620
No! Go get the Princess Royal!

54
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,220
Yes!

55
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,540
Han Shuo!

56
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,140
Han Shuo!

57
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,580
Han Shuo!

58
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,300
Han Shuo!

59
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,380
Han Shuo! Wake up!

60
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,140
Han Shuo!

61
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,140
Han Shuo!

62
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,540
Three out of five.

63
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,300
You've tossed eight times!

64
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,980
Is the fight over?

65
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,420
Something happened to Han Shuo!

66
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,100
(Risheng Mansion)

67
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,180
I've dressed the wound.

68
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,220
The sword didn't

69
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,900
stab right to the heart.

70
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,340
That's good!

71
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,260
I knew

72
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,020
that after so many things happened,

73
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,420
the story wouldn't develop
as it was written before.

74
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:10,940
Right?

75
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,180
What's wrong?

76
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,020
But his lungs are badly injured.

77
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,820
He doesn't have much time left.

78
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,220
No! No way!

79
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,980
Yuanyuan, please check again!

80
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,220
Please! Please check again!

81
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,900
Xiaoqian.

82
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,700
Let's leave, darling.

83
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,260
I shouldn't have made you die in the story.

84
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,220
It's my fault!

85
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,460
It's different, Xiaoqian.

86
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,940
I originally

87
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,180
died for someone

88
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,260
I didn't love at all.

89
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,340
It wasn't a worthy death.

90
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,860
But now,

91
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,300
I'll die for you,

92
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,020
for Huayuan and Xuanhu.

93
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,940
It'll be a worthy sacrifice.

94
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,900
You didn't make the story end this way.

95
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,780
It's my own

96
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,580
decision.

97
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,220
You told me

98
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,100
that people in your world

99
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,540
didn't understand why you wrote this story,

100
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,220
why the hero would fall in love
with the heroine.

101
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,100
I have an answer now.

102
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,860
Because you are kind,

103
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,220
optimistic,

104
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,180
and strong.

105
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,260
You bravely overcame

106
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,420
the setbacks over and over again.

107
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,180
Being so bright and full of life,

108
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,380
you will be fine

109
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,380
even without me, right?

110
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,260
Hope I'm the love of your life.

111
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,220
And hope you won't regret meeting me.

112
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,780
I don't!

113
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,100
I will never regret it in my life!

114
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,380
Although

115
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,100
I once hated you,

116
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,460
rejected you,

117
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,820
feared you,

118
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,100
I felt so lucky

119
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,100
that when I fell in love with you,

120
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,900
you were there!

121
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,460
You were always there!

122
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,500
This is the best ending.

123
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,740
Just end the story.

124
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,180
Let me see you become the City Owner.

125
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,140
I don't want you to go!

126
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,940
I don't!

127
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,700
I won't.

128
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,940
Just pretend that you had a dream.

129
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,580
When you wake up,

130
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,660
just go over the script,

131
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,740
and you'll see

132
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,220
I've never left.

133
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,220
Sorry.

134
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,260
I know it's my fault!

135
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,620
Shuo was right.

136
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,860
As a man, he fulfilled his responsibility.

137
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,740
It was his own choice.

138
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,060
Darling,

139
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,980
let's go inside.

140
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,860
Nothing lasts forever.
Live every moment to the fullest.

141
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,180
Cherish the time

142
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,060
when Young Master Han is still with you.

143
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,180
This is something from before.

144
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,740
You can

145
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,380
keep it well.

146
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,900
I've been reappointed
as the Minister of Education.

147
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,820
As you asked,

148
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,420
I opened a school.

149
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,460
From now on,

150
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,900
boys in Huayuan will have the equal chance

151
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,100
to go to school as girls do.

152
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,860
People are all

153
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,820
thankful for your benevolence.

154
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,860
I didn't do it alone.

155
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,940
It's because people are willing to do it

156
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,180
and accept a better

157
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,420
life style.

158
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,780
So,

159
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,820
how are you going to punish Chuchu?

160
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,820
How is he doing?

161
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,460
He's resting.

162
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,620
When I stabbed you,

163
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,100
I aimed for a spot that was

164
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,060
three inches away from your heart.

165
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,900
But I didn't expect

166
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,180
that Han Shuo would use his body
as a shield to protect you.

167
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,620
You should be very happy now.

168
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,780
Mother favors you,

169
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,220
sisters are close to you,

170
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,540
Han Shuo loves you,

171
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,660
and the citizens adore you.

172
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,300
Everything is yours.

173
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,140
And I

174
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,700
have become the butt of a joke.

175
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,420
Chuchu,

176
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,580
I'm partially responsible

177
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,500
for what you've become.

178
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,180
If I died from the very beginning,

179
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,980
Han Shuo would marry you,

180
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,900
and you'd be happy together.

181
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,060
You'd be mom's only loving daughter

182
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,860
and get all her attention.

183
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
Su Ziying and Meng Guo
would be enlisted by you.

184
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,500
The citizens of entire Huayuan

185
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,900
would support you to be the Crown Princess.

186
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,220
Everything would be yours.

187
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,020
But I didn't die.

188
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,780
I survived.

189
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,460
It's also not my fault.

190
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,140
Since I survived,

191
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,700
I became your rival.

192
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,780
You thought the things you didn't get

193
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,100
should have belonged to you,

194
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,500
but they were all taken away by me.

195
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,900
But have you ever thought about

196
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,780
why Han Shuo fell in love
with someone else but you,

197
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,780
why Su Ziying switched his sides
at the last minute,

198
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,100
why the citizens of Huayuan ended up

199
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,300
supporting a nobody like me?

200
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,020
I don't know how to argue with you.

201
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,980
When a storyteller writes a story,

202
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,340
he usually arranges all kinds

203
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,860
of coincidences for the roles.

204
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,100
The hero is destined
to fall in love with the heroine.

205
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,500
Supporting roles are meant to be
the stepping stone for the main characters,

206
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,900
as well as the focus of people's attention.

207
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,620
You were

208
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,580
supposed to be a heroine.

209
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,580
You could have had a promising life.

210
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,500
But when you came across
a stumbling block like me,

211
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,900
you didn't know how to deal with it.

212
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,540
So frankly speaking,

213
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,100
you don't possess the qualities
of a City Owner.

214
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,740
It's the so called "The winner takes it all.
The loser has to fall."

215
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,020
If you don't trust me,

216
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,060
I'll prove it to you!

217
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,740
Do you remember the tale

218
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,980
we heard when we were little?

219
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,540
At the Founding Ceremony

220
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,220
of Huayuan City,

221
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,540
when the first City Owner

222
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,660
walked onto the flower path,

223
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,580
a vision appeared showing the sun and the moon
shining together in the sky

224
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,220
and the door of heaven opening.

225
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,260
The citizens instantly supported her,

226
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,820
thinking that she'd be a wise ruler.

227
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,580
After that,

228
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,740
people began to believe

229
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,020
that the vision would appear
if a wise and benevolent person

230
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,620
were to succeed to the throne.

231
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,380
It's also your wish, right?

232
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,140
You also wanna see

233
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,940
if you can make

234
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,220
that vision appear.

235
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,500
-I don't!
-You do!

236
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,060
You worked hard every day

237
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,380
studying literature and practicing Kung Fu.

238
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,980
You were so sure
that you would be the chosen one

239
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,300
who can usher in that auspicious vision.

240
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,180
I'll give you a chance.

241
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,500
I'll go talk to Mother

242
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,540
and ask her to hold a succession ceremony.

243
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,900
You can also walk

244
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,300
onto the flower path

245
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,100
and see if the same vision

246
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,420
will appear.

247
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,140
I don't think so.

248
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,540
Then what if it does appear?

249
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,100
Would Mother

250
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,700
allow me to walk through the path?

251
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,700
You,

252
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,820
Yuanyuan and Qianqian.

253
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,460
The three of you

254
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,740
can all give it a try.

255
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,980
Whoever can make that vision appear

256
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,020
while walking down the path,

257
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,300
I will pass my throne to her.

258
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,580
It's fair, isn't it?

259
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,580
Young Master, you are too weak to get up!

260
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,620
What are you doing?

261
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,860
You'll go to the succession ceremony.

262
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,140
It's only a setup for Chuchu,

263
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,660
so that she can realize
that she made a mistake.

264
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,500
I'll just stay aside and watch.

265
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,020
But there's an access to your world
at the succession ceremony.

266
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,460
I made it up!

267
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,140
The vision is not something
that can appear easily.

268
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,460
That's special effect,
which costs a lot of money.

269
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,620
Listen to me.

270
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,300
No matter who walks onto the path,
it'll be the same.

271
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,020
There won't be colorful clouds

272
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,140
or door of heaven.

273
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,620
How did you know?

274
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,780
It won't appear

275
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,820
even if you walks on it?

276
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,820
Do you want

277
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,140
my dream to be over?

278
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,780
I have told you

279
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,780
that I wouldn't go anywhere.
I'll be here with you!

280
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,380
I just want to see you at the ceremony

281
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,740
and remember the way you look

282
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,580
in your ceremonial costume.

283
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,260
I fear that...

284
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,100
Okay, I'll wear the costume.

285
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,780
I'll wear it for you.

286
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,180
But I won't

287
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,100
walk the flower path.

288
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,100
I'll wait for you.

289
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
Go ahead.

290
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,180
Easy.

291
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,630
Bai Ji, take good care of him.

292
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,920
Yes.

293
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,780
Wait for me.

294
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,940
(City Owner's Mansion)

295
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,100
(Auspiciousness lights up
the virtuous household)

296
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,020
(Auspiciousness lights up
the virtuous household)

297
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,300
The succession ceremony begins now!

298
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,420
Kneel!

299
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,260
Wish Huayuan City

300
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,780
a prosperous and peaceful future!

301
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,500
Offer incense to heaven!

302
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,580
Watch out!

303
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,140
How did this happen?

304
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,420
I don't believe it!

305
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,180
It's only a tale!

306
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,940
It's not true!

307
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,220
It'll be the same

308
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,700
no matter who does it!

309
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,660
Your Highness, be careful!

310
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:21,980
I'll try.

311
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,900
Let me accompany you.

312
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,460
Young Master!

313
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,180
Young Master!

314
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,260
I'm fine!

315
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,540
Whose turn is it now?

316
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,020
The Princess Royal.

317
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,220
Xiaoqian still refuses to do it?

318
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,460
Her Highness said

319
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,900
she'd come to see you in the costume

320
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,460
as soon as she finished.

321
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,660
And she asked you to rest in bed.

322
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,580
I know she doesn't want to leave me.

323
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,420
But I can't let her stay because of me.

324
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,940
Young Master, you vomited blood!

325
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,380
I don't want Xiaoqian to be alone

326
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,140
after I'm gone.

327
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,140
Help me to get up.

328
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,740
Your Highness!

329
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,940
I'm fine.

330
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,180
I also want to walk this path.

331
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,180
Offer incense to heaven!

332
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,940
What's the big deal?

333
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,540
What tale?

334
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,100
Your Highness!

335
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,180
It's only a lie!

336
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,740
There's no wise ruler or vision at all!

337
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,380
I did it!

338
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,820
People always said

339
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,300
that I couldn't.

340
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,420
But look,

341
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,340
I walked through the path!

342
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,380
Maybe, it's because I had you by my side.

343
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,020
Your Highness,

344
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,660
it's your turn.

345
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,100
Succession ceremony begins now!

346
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,340
Wish Huayuan City

347
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,900
a prosperous and peaceful future!

348
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,460
The ceremony is held

349
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,460
over and over again.

350
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,940
First it was the Second Princess,
then the Princess Royal.

351
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,460
And now, it'll be

352
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,860
the Third Princess...

353
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,300
I think I'll pass.

354
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,340
Qianqian, don't be willful.

355
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,940
I really don't want to do it.

356
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,860
What if

357
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,820
the door of heaven really opens?

358
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,660
Don't you want to be the next City Owner?

359
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,100
Whether I can be the City Owner or not

360
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,540
has nothing to do with
walking the flower path

361
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,500
or the vision.

362
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,140
A wise and benevolent City Owner

363
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,340
doesn't need these things to prove herself.

364
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,820
All she needs is

365
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,180
a kind and caring heart for people

366
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,580
to get their respect and support.

367
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,100
Come up here!

368
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,380
Qianqian, come here!

369
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,700
Han Shuo!

370
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,100
You ran over here!

371
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,500
I told you to wait for me in your room.

372
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,740
Why did you come here?

373
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:56,460
♪I'd be your rock.♪

374
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,500
♪I'd reach for the stars for you♪

375
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,460

Qianqian!

00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,180

Han Shuo!

404
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,620
After suffering from all the hardships,

405
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,980
Chen Chuchu, the Second Princess of Huayuan
finally became the City Owner.

406
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,180
During her succession ceremony,

407
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,860
an auspicious vision appeared –
the sun and the moon shone together in the sky,

408
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,500
the door of heaven opened,
surrounded by colorful clouds!

409
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,740
The end.

410
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,380
Was that really just a dream?

411
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,580
I woke up.

412
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,820
Xiaoqian, when can you
finish altering the script?

413
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,620
Xiaoqian, I'm not pushing you.

414
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,620
But can't you try to deliver the script
a couple of days earlier?

415
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,740
The super star, Mr. Han, is still waiting!

416
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,740
Listen, you've got to reflect

417
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,340
his advice in your alteration.

418
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,460
So,

419
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,060
it really was a dream.

420
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,540
Then Han Shuo

421
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,180
didn't exist?

422
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,260
(Check in Zone)

423
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,020
(Check in Zone)

424
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,060
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

425
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,260
I'm sorry,

426
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,980
but I may have to extend my deadline.

427
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,300
Extend your deadline, why?

428
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,220
Because I lost my love.

429
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,620
You've never even been in love!

430
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,980
How could you lose it?

431
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,780
I mean,

432
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,740
I do feel that there are some problems

433
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,980
with my story.

434
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,740
I understand now why Mr. Han

435
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,140
asked me that question.

436
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,340
I had no idea what love was before.

437
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,180
But now,

438
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,340
I think I do.

439
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,540
Xiaoqian, don't worry.

440
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,220
We actually have more time now,

441
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,620
and we won't film until three months later.

442
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,500
Three months later?

443
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,020
Why?

444
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,380
Don't know what happened exactly,

445
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,220
but Mr. Han had a car accident

446
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,820
the night before last night.

447
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,580
He was admitted to the hospital.

448
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,380
How is he doing now?

449
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,620
Don't worry.

450
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,940
He is quite lucky.

451
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,260
The doctor said he only injured his lungs.

452
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,140
He'll be able to get back to work

453
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,420
after resting for three months.

454
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,380
Mr. Zhang, what hospital is it?

455
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,420
I wanna go check on him.

456
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,540
Excuse me, could you tell me
where the inpatient department is?

457
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,780
Thank you!

458
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,100
I... I heard that you had a car accident.

459
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,180
I'm fine now.

460
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,580
I have to say

461
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,980
that the modern medical technology
is quite impressive.

462
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,340
Should it happen in the ancient times,

463
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,420
I'd be dead.

464
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,340
Do you still remember

465
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,260
how the accident happened?

466
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,660
It happened too fast.

467
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,940
I only remember a strong beam of white light

468
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,740
and then nothing.

469
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,780
Then do you still remember

470
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,260
playing fireworks in town
on the Double Seventh Festival?

471
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,740
It's not allowed to play fireworks
within the fifth ring road.

472
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,460
No, I didn't mean the present day.

473
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,300
Then do you still remember

474
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,100
that I stole the Dragon Bone for you
and cured your heart disease?

475
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,580
First of all, I was hit by a car.

476
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,980
I didn't have

477
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,780
the heart disease you talked about.

478
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,420
Second of all,

479
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,940
Miss Scriptwriter, if you stole something,

480
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,940
I suggest you turn yourself in
as soon as possible.

481
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,940
You are not Han Shuo.

482
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,580
Han Shuo?

483
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,580
Chuchu?

484
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,740
Chen Qianqian?

485
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,820
Miss orange.

486
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,620
I'm in the hospital.

487
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,980
Do we need to go over the script now?

488
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,100
Don't you think you immerse
too much in the story?

489
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,460
Sorry

490
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,420
to disturb you.

491
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,340
Chuchu? Chen Qianqian?

492
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,060
Miss orange. I'm in the hospital.

493
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,460
Do we need to go over the script now?

494
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,540
Don't you think you immerse
too much in the story?

495
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,060
Orange?

496
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,620
There wasn't orange
in the version I delivered...

497
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,980
He is Han Shuo!

498
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,660
Banana!

499
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,700
Why did you come back?

500
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,380
Stay away from me!

501
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,140
I'm warning you! Don't come over!

502
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,140
You don't know how scary it was!

503
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,420
Something strange hit me all of a sudden

504
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,020
and I had a long dream.

505
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,140
And now, my head is filled

506
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,060
with images like apple, banana, orange,

507
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,140
which weren't even part of my memory!

508
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,380
And all I can think about is you!

509
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,620
Do you understand me?

510
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,180
I don't know it was a dream or reality!

511
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,540
So you'd better stay away from me

512
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,460
and stop making trouble!

513
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,140
So silly!

514
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,340
Is it silly?

515
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:20,780
Yes.

516
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,060
Orange?

517
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,780
Mr. Han

518
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,140
is such a workaholic!

519
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,820
The moment he woke up, he called
the scriptwriter over to discuss the play.

520
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,580
So you really should feel

521
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,540
excited about our new series.

522
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,780
When you report it,

523
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,460
please write positive things about it.

524
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,540
Don't forget how professional

525
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,380
and dedicated Mr. Han is!

526
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,380
Now, here.

527
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:09,780
This way, please!

528
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,940
Don't push.

529
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,220
Both of them are very dedicated!

530
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,100
They are discussing passionately
about the play!

531
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,340
Okay! Don't take pictures!

532
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,540
Stop taking pictures!

533
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,420
So,

534
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,740
today's interview is over!

535
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,860
(With Chen Qianqian's help,
Chen Chuchu finally succeeded the City Owner.)

536
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,380
(Han Shuo cleared the air with Chen Qianqian.
They ended up being a loving couple.)

537
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:17,700
