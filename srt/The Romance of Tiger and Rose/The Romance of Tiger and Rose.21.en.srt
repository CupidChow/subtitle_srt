=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 21)

24
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,100
Mother,

25
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,420
I've drafted the abdication decree.

26
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,340
Now I only need the City Owner Seal.

27
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,060
This is the most thoughtful thing

28
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,380
you've ever done so far.

29
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,900
Thank you for your compliment!

30
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,940
Since you've forged the decree,

31
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,300
why didn't you forge a City Owner Seal
at the same time?

32
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,180
It should be very easy to you.

33
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,260
You know that these are all forgeable,

34
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,420
so this fake decree is obviously

35
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,780
not convincing enough.

36
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,100
Why don't you

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,500
just help me this one last time?

38
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,380
Walk out of here

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,740
and announce in the meeting hall

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,260
that you'll pass your throne to me,

41
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,380
and demote Chen Qianqian to a commoner.

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,100
You told me

43
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,060
that you've been raising me
as your successor.

44
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,100
"The City Owner of Huayuan

45
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,740
has ruled the city for 25 years.

46
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,220
Though the city was once in turmoil,

47
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,020
with the blessing of our great ancestors,

48
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,340
it was revitalized again.

49
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,660
After observing the astrological signs
and people's will,

50
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,980
though people's support is there,

51
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,500
The City Owner is in a bad shape

52
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,740
and no longer capable
to lead the future of Huayuan.

53
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,620
The Third Princess Chen Qianqian

54
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,180
was appointed as the Crown Princess,

55
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,220
yet she is ill-behaved
and has no sense of morality.

56
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,740
She's not a good fit for the position,

57
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,780
and she's not

58
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,620
as large-hearted and caring as
Chen Chuchu, the Second Princess.

59
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,100
You are large-hearted and caring?

60
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,240
And she is ill-behaved
and has no sense of morality?

61
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,800
Do you know

62
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,280
that when you were born,

63
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,440
Huayuan and Xuanhu were right at war.

64
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,560
To rescue Huayuan City,

65
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,640
Minister Pei sacrificed her life.

66
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,400
At that moment, I made up my mind

67
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,340
to raise you into
a righteous person like her.

68
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,080
Later on, you were really
more and more like her.

69
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,940
If

70
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,340
you can inherit Huayuan

71
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,200
and become the next City Owner,

72
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,220
I think you'd live up to your capabilities.

73
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,740
Why did you

74
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,040
talk about late Minister Pei?

75
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,980
I...

76
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,560
I just remembered something from the past.

77
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,400
I feel sorry that my years of effort

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,000
has gone in vain!

79
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,540
Mother, we don't have so much time!

80
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,020
Do you remember how the corner of this seal

81
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,700
was damaged?

82
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,860
When you were little,

83
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,380
you thought it was a toy
and tossed it around.

84
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,380
Then you accidentally chipped the corner.

85
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,260
But I didn't blame you at all.

86
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,420
I didn't expect

87
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,460
that when you touched it again,

88
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,020
you'd use it

89
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,260
to do such an unfilial and disloyal thing!

90
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,060
If I had known it,

91
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,860
I should have punished you severely

92
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,980
and let you know the gravity of misbehavior!

93
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,460
At this point,

94
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,140
it's too late to change my mind!

95
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,780
Your Majesty!

96
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,980
You... you dare to threaten me?

97
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,460
Mother, just grant my request!

98
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,060
You!

99
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,140
Give it to me!

100
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,260
Chuchu!

101
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,700
Your Highness! Young Master Han betrayed us!

102
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,460
Our people

103
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,160
have been surrounded by Xuanhu army!

104
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,540
What?

105
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,380
Han Shuo tricked me!

106
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,460
You idiot! You opened the door to our enemy?

107
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,580
Han Shuo is a crafty person!

108
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,900
You are not his match at all!

109
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,580
Only Qianqian can contain him!

110
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,660
Han Shuo!

111
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,860
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

112
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,820
Han Shuo, you promised you'd work with me,

113
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,180
but you betrayed me
while I was negotiating with my mother!

114
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,340
It's only because you are too credulous,

115
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,220
just like how I was before.

116
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,060
Chen Qianqian was the one who lied to you!

117
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,060
My heart for you is real!

118
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,220
How can you treat me like this
because of her mistake?

119
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,740
You should blame
that you are all women of Huayuan.

120
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,180
So you only have Chen Qianqian

121
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,660
in your heart?

122
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,620
Your Highness!

123
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,220
Stop!

124
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,660
Pei Heng, you stole the flower token?

125
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,780
Arrest Han Shuo, now!

126
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,500
The City Guards' job is to protect
Her Majesty and Huayuan City.

127
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,740
We'll never disgrace the fame of Pei family!

128
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,780
Looks like between your mother and me,

129
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,980
you chose your mother.

130
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,100
Between Huayuan and me,

131
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,940
you chose Huayuan.

132
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,660
Han Shuo.

133
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,060
My love for you

134
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,860
and my intention of
protecting Huayuan citizens

135
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,740
are not against each other.

136
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,900
Do you understand?

137
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,820
Arrest them all!

138
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,140
Report!

139
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,940
Minister Pei!

140
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,460
A group of bandits helped us
take the city gate back!

141
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,820
Bandits?

142
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,660
Could it be Meng Guo?

143
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,420
Meng Guo!

144
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,180
How did we forget about him?!

145
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,220
Young Master, it'll be too late
if we don't go now.

146
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,740
There's still one thing I need.

147
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,460
When we conquer Huayuan,

148
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,300
the Crown Princess will belong
to you sooner or later!

149
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,180
Qianqian, come with me!

150
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,140
Stop!

151
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,060
Mother!

152
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,800
Arrest Han Shuo and Chen Chuchu!

153
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,900
Mother!

154
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,500
Chuchu,

155
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,780
from now on, I'm no longer

156
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,000
your mother!

157
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,140
Maybe I owed you

158
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,540
in the beginning,

159
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,020
but now, we are even!

160
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,400
Your Highness, did you receive my letter?

161
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,500
Han Shuo, Her Highness
asked me to follow you,

162
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,260
but you escaped!

163
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,980
I'll capture you again today

164
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,380
to fulfill my mission
that Her Highness assigned to me!

165
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,780
Han Shuo,

166
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,740
please stop!

167
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,500
You mean

168
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,380
Han Shuo was the principal criminal,

169
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,980
and Chuchu was his hostage?

170
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,940
Chuchu has been a prudent
and sensible person.

171
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,180
If she weren't threatened,

172
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,340
she wouldn't have rebelled.

173
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,620
She tried to stab Qianqian

174
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,420
because she wanted to prevent
Han Shuo from escaping.

175
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,500
You stole the flower token from Chuchu.

176
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,020
Why are you trying to save her now?

177
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,780
Even if I'm not,

178
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,100
I think you'll still forgive her

179
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,180
and spare her life.

180
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,780
Rebellion is a serious sin!

181
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,700
Why do you assume that I'd let her go?

182
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,500
Because she's the only daughter
of the late Minister Pei!

183
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,820
Because you promised my mother

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,600
that you'd take good care of Chuchu!

185
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,940
How did you know that?

186
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,780
My mother died in battle.

187
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,380
Chuchu was a baby and you pitied her,

188
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,980
so you adopted her.

189
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,940
Back then, I was already old enough
to remember things.

190
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,830
But now,

191
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,060
Chuchu made a big mistake.

192
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,680
Let Han Shuo die for her.

193
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,620
Once Han Shuo is dead,

194
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,510
no one else will know the truth.

195
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,340
Chuchu could be an accomplice,

196
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,590
could be a hostage,

197
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,720
could even be a heroine

198
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,430
who spied for days
and finally made her work worth.

199
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,270
No matter what, let Han Shuo

200
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,680
take all the blame!

201
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,120
Good!

202
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,950
Like mother, like son!

203
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,420
You do live up to your mother's reputation!

204
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,240
Though I planned everything,

205
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,640
I forgot about Meng Guo's troop.

206
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,870
I should have listened to Bai Ji

207
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,150
and enlisted Meng Guo into my army.

208
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,320
You finally got what you wanted.

209
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,020
I'm here to save you!

210
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,030
You think I can still be saved?

211
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,480
The daughter turned against her mother.

212
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,440
The sisters fought each other
over the throne.

213
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,770
In order to shut my mouth
and save her dignity,

214
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,320
the City Owner will certainly kill me!

215
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,620
You'll live

216
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
if I want you to.

217
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,040
You think I'll still trust you?

218
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,300
Han Shuo,

219
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,540
you still don't know

220
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,520
that my love for you is real, do you?

221
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,780
I regard myself as a smart person.

222
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,460
But you always make me feel

223
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,940
that I'm just fooling myself.

224
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,800
No matter what I want,

225
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,880
I'll end up doing things as you wish.

226
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,560

Mother!

241
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,100
Could you please spare Han Shuo's life?

242
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,300
If you must kill him today,

243
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,060
I'll die together with him!

244
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,180
We are a real couple now!

245
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,820
I'm not lying!

246
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,980
I really love him!

247
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,880
I can let Chuchu be the Crown Princess.

248
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,390
With your guide,

249
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,760
I'm sure she'll be a qualified City Owner!

250
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,780
And you can also be relieved.

251
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,660
Mother,

252
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,540
just consider that I died on the day

253
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,780
I married to Han Shuo.

254
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,480
I'm begging you!

255
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,300
Please spare his life!

256
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,660
I'm willing to give up everything

257
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,920
as long as you set him free.

258
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,580
Then what about me?

259
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,940
You won't even want your mother anymore

260
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,660
because of this man?

261
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,260
Mother, are you happy being a City Owner?

262
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,820
I never wanted

263
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,380
to be the Crown Princess.

264
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,940
I only want Han Shuo!

265
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,420
Then I really need to kill him!

266
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,360
Behead him!

267
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,220

00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,700
can put an end

273
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,420
to this mess.

274
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,540

Or you'll be sad.

300
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,500
It's my fault!

301
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,460
I didn't know she loved you this much!

302
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,700
To save your life,

303
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,300
she even killed herself!

304
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,100
If I had known that,

305
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,460
I wouldn't have stolen the flower token

306
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,820
and led the City Guards to siege you.

307
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,780
You had no choice.

308
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,140
We represented two different sides.

309
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,500
You only did that to rescue Qianqian.

310
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,220
And I wouldn't have convinced Her Majesty

311
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,820
to let you take

312
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,060
all the blame.

313
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,420
You asked the City Owner to kill me?

314
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,180
So that was for selfish reasons!

315
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,780
You thought you could

316
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,700
be with Qianqian after I died?

317
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,100
It's my fault

318
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,180
that Qianqian died!

319
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,900
That's right!

320
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
It is your fault!

321
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,060
Look!

322
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,900
She'd rather sacrifice her own life

323
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,020
than watch me die

324
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,820
and be with you!

325
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,020
Didn't you feel ashamed
to say something like that?

326
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,460
Qianqian killed herself,

327
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,660
yet you don't feel sad at all!

328
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,380
Apparently you were just

329
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,220
fooling and using her!

330
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,460
I really regret that I didn't get a chance

331
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,660
to show Qianqian who you really were

332
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,380
and let you pay for what you did!

333
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,540
It is what it is.

334
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,740
You and Qianqian weren't meant
to be together in this life.

335
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,980
From now on,

336
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
just forget about her.

337
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,460
I can't!

338
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,780
How can I forget her?

339
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,460
(Will always be remembered)

340
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,340
I let her wait for too long.

341
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,700
We were engaged

342
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,820
when we were little.

343
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,540
I should have married her later.

344
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,780
But I was too young

345
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,740
and always stalled our marriage.

346
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,500
That's why I missed her.

347
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,500
You mean

348
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,820
if you had married her earlier,

349
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,300
I wouldn't have had any chance?

350
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,060
Men of Xuanhu are all cold-hearted!

351
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,540
If I had known things
would turn out like this,

352
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,900
I wouldn't have let you have her, ever!

353
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,900
You let me have her?

354
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,540
I fought for her myself!

355
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,380
My love for Qianqian is real!

356
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,460
But to you, it's worth nothing!

357
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,260
Real?

358
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,860
Are you willing to die for her?

359
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,380
Die for her?

360
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,300
You don't dare!

361
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,700
But I do!

362
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,420
It's my fault that Qianqian died!

363
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,580
I won't let her

364
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,100
die alone!

365
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,180
Don't!

366
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,940
Hold on a sec!

367
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,300
Calm down!

368
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,340
I'll accompany her!

369
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,620
I asked you to wait!

370
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,620
Wait!

371
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,740
Pei Heng!

372
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,700
Qianqian! Qianqian!

373
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,860
You are still alive?!

374
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,420
It... it was just a prop.

375
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,020
I thought it could deceive everybody.

376
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,140
You faked your death?

377
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,100
We said that we'd keep this a secret.

378
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,380
How come you let it slip

379
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:50,980
in front of Pei Heng?

380
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,340
You've pushed him into a corner!

381
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,580
What were you up to?

382
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,380
Well, I just accidently

383
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,300
said something wrong!

384
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,940
Pei Heng, I'm sorry

385
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,980
that you had to go through that.

386
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,780
I really had

387
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,100
no other choice.

388
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,460
You did this for Han Shuo,

389
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,100
as well as to ease

390
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,580
Chuchu's mind.

391
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,780
Are you going

392
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,540
to leave Huayuan City?

393
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,220
Han Shuo,

394
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,340
would you please give us a moment?

395
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,740
I have something to say to Pei Heng.

396
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,340
I heard

397
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,580
what you said just now.

398
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,980
If I had the courage
to tell you that earlier,

399
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,100
things for us might

400
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,940
be different.

401
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,580
Pei Heng,

402
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,780
maybe we didn't belong to each other
from the very beginning.

403
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,620
The me you love

404
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,620
isn't the one you knew

405
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,940
or the one you thought I was.

406
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,620
Just pretend that I was poisoned to death

407
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,340
on my wedding night
when I drank the cross-cupped wine.

408
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,100
You hated me back then.

409
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,180
There's one less eyesore in this world,

410
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,940
and no one will force you anymore

411
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,580
to marry someone you don't like.

412
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,180
Maybe thinking of it this way

413
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,180
will make you feel a little better.

414
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,420
But you didn't die.

415
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,260
Falling in love with you

416
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,340
after your marriage

417
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,340
is the best thing that has ever happened

418
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,340
to me so far.

419
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,980
It felt like

420
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,020
my life became meaningful

421
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,020
from that moment on.

422
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,020
You were the one who told me

423
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,620
that I could also have my aspiration,

424
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,380
I could do whatever I wanted to do

425
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,420
just like a woman.

426
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,180
But later on, I realized

427
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,220
my aspiration,

428
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,980
the one I loved the most,

429
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,420
was you!

430
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,620
I didn't know what love was either,

431
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,780
until I met Han Shuo.

432
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,620
Pei Heng,

433
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,540
you will meet a nice girl in the future.

434
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,500
Don't be concerned about me.

435
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,020
I will be fine.

436
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,460
Alright.

437
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,020
Starting tomorrow,

438
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,100
I won't love you anymore.

439
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,140
And you don't need to worry about me either.

440
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,860
Okay.

441
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,700
It's a deal.

442
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,460
(Yueli Mansion)

443
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,100
May you rest in peace, Your Highness!

444
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,820
What are you doing here?

445
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,780
Qianqian was my sister after all.

446
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,260
I'm here to offer my condolences.

447
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,500
She's already

448
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,100
gone.

449
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,540
She won't fight with you for anything now.

450
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,220
You are on your own!

451
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,740
Say, since Chen Qianqian is dead,

452
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,940
why isn't Pei Heng crying?

453
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,500
Zi Zhu,

454
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,380
go find some stuff for me.

455
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,230
What were you talking about?

456
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,900
Nothing.

457
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,340
Why do you wanna know?

458
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
I'm afraid

459
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,200
that Pei Heng is still in love with you.

460
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,740
After you pass away,

461
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,140
I'll name you

462
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,460
"Xuanhu King of Jealousy"

463
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,180
as your posthumous name!

464
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:42,840
I think it'll work!

465
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,500
More people are coming!

466
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,140
Your Highness!

467
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,540
Her Majesty, the Princess Royal
and the Second Princess

468
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,700
have all arrived.

469
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,740
Get ready!

470
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,220
Come on, cover me up!

471
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:57,700
Listen,

472
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,620
Chuchu is very smart.

473
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,260
Don't let my mother find out the truth!

474
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,500
Come on! Hurry!

475
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,100
How come I think

476
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,260
you are still hiding something from me

477
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,460
aside from Pei Heng?

478
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,860
I need to know all of your secrets

479
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,420
so that I can feel relieved.

480
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,380
Young Master, hurry up!

481
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,300
They are here!

482
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,780
Okay! Come on, close it up!

483
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,340
We've opened our hearts to each other.

484
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,580
I'm not keeping anything from you!

485
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,540
Close it up, now!

486
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,300
When you lie,

487
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,300
you always look all over the place!

488
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,340
You haven't explained

489
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,220
about your Kung Fu.

490
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,220
I will tell you after we
get to Xuanhu City, alright?

491
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:27,980
Just cover me up, now!

492
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,240
Come on! We don't have time!

493
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,300
Okay, then it's a deal!

494
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,060
If you lie to me again,

495
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,860
I'll let you know
who wears the pants in our family!

496
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,060
Don't close it fully! I need to breathe!

497
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,700
(In memorial of my beloved wife Chen Qianqian)

498
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,200
Qianqian!

499
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,800
Qianqian!

500
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,540
Qianqian!

501
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,420
Mother,

502
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,580
shall we take one last look at Qianqian?

503
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,700
Your Majesty,

504
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,460
you'd better not.

505
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,060
It'll only make you sad.

506
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,820
Mother.

507
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,420
Mother. Qianqian is gone.

508
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,500
You need to take good care of yourself.

509
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,740
Forget it.

510
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:41,980
Let's not look at her.

511
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,720
Just let her rest in peace.

512
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,520
Mother,

513
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,120
I have a method
that can protect her body from decay

514
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,340
and make her face remain the way it is.

515
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,300
What method?

516
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,020
Refine mercury from cinnabar

517
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,540
and inject the mercury
into her blood vessels.

518
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,180
This way, the body will never decay.

519
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,460
She wants to poison me to death!

520
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,220
Qianqian was the Crown Princess of Huayuan!

521
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,140
How can you treat her body with disrespect?

522
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,940
No.

523
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,500
Just let her rest.

524
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
In that case,

525
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,020
I have a nice coffin in my mansion.

526
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,220
It's well sealed,

527
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,780
insect-repelling and moisture-proof.

528
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,540
It suits her noble status better.

529
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,220
Put Qianqian

530
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,820
in that coffin later.

531
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,460
That coffin is sealed tightly.

532
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,140
I'll suffocate to death

533
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,420
even before Han Shuo digs me up!

534
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,540
Qianqian disobeyed Her Majesty;

535
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,260
she was a sinner.

536
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,420
She doesn't deserve such a nice coffin.

537
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,860
You may as well just save that for yourself!

538
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,220
Since she was a sinner,

539
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,180
then she can't be buried
in the tomb of our ancestors.

540
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,580
But mother

541
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,500
certainly won't let Qianqian
wander in the wild

542
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,060
and become a homeless ghost.

543
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,900
Why don't we cremate her body
instead of burying her?

544
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,100
That way, we can make her relics into sarira,

545
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,980
which will be enshrined
in the ancestral temple

546
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,460
to comfort her spirit in heaven.

547
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,380
She wants to burn me into ashes!

548
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,340
She won't even give me a break after I died!

549
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,300
How come

550
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,700
you hate Qianqian this much?

551
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,740
Han Shuo, you are getting so upset.

552
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,220
Are you afraid of anything?

553
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,460
Maybe

554
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,180
you did something to Qianqian?

555
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,380
Chen Chuchu!

556
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,300
She was your sister!

557
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,940
Chen Chuchu!

558
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,900
Stop it!

559
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,460
Air! I need air!

560
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,300
Qianqian!

561
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,420
Qianqian!

562
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,020
My daughter!

563
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,460
Qianqian!

564
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,300
I'll say goodbye to you now!

565
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,660
If your spirit can hear me,

566
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,420
please come visit me in my dreams!

567
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,220
I will offer sacrifices to you

568
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,260
on new moon and full moon days.

569
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,900
Your two sisters

570
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,660
will remember you, too!

571
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,220
Your Majesty! Sorry for your loss!

572
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,620
Your Majesty, sorry for your loss!

573
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,500
Mother!

574
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,460
Mother!

575
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,540
Yuanyuan!

576
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,940
Yuanyuan!

577
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,260
Chuchu!

578
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,260
You two

579
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,660
are all I have now.

580
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,420
Just let me

581
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,340
take care of Qianqian's funeral.

582
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,660
You may take your leave now.

583
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,740
Your Majesty.

584
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,380
Life and death are all destined.

585
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,380
Please

586
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,980
take care!

587
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,180
Han Shuo,

588
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,380
Qianqian is making

589
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,700
such a big sacrifice for you.

590
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,620
You've got to treat her well!

591
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,540
Mother

592
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,100
just... just left like that?

593
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,120
She wouldn't even say
anything more to my body?

594
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,540
Is she still angry with me?

595
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,980
She wouldn't forgive me even I'm dead.

596
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,380
She may already know your plan.

597
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,860
What a childish play!

598
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,340
Your Majesty, you mean

599
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,780
the Third Princess faked her death?

600
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,060
If I hadn't played along,

601
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,220
her trick would've been exposed!

602
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,820
The Third Princess

603
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,540
is surely stubborn.

604
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,260
She hurt you so badly

605
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,220
in order to save Han Shuo's life.

606
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,580
Not only to save Han Shuo,

607
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,580
but also to save Huayuan City.

608
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,940
From now on, Chuchu

609
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,060
will be my only successor.

610
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,180
There'll be no more fights.

611
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,700
Though the citizens
of Huayuan support Qianqian,

612
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,420
Chuchu can't stand her.

613
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,420
If she didn't die,

614
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,580
Chuchu and I

615
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,660
would never get along.

616
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,100
So the Crown Princess

617
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,940
actually gave up on the City Owner's position?

618
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
Today,

619
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,180
I admitted her death,

620
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,500
which means we are
no longer mother and daughter.

621
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,740
She betrayed me that day

622
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,660
for Han Shuo on the execution ground.

623
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,940
And today,

624
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,780
I betrayed her

625
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,740
for Huayuan in the mourning hall.

626
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,300
I don't know if Qianqian will blame me.

627
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,820
I think she will understand
your thoughtfulness.

628
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,620
But

629
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,780
it'll be difficult for her
to return to Huayuan in the future.

630
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,900
Don't know when

631
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,620
you can see each other again.

632
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,780
Escort her to the cemetery tonight

633
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,380
and offer her a chance to leave.

634
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,620
Yes!

635
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,940
Her Majesty has ordered

636
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,620
to bury the Third Princess
in the cemetery tonight.

637
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,340
I'll let her fake death become true

638
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,540
and bury her there forever!

639
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,700
Yes! I will finish this mission.

640
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,380
Then come back soon.

641
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,620
I still need to find a way
to take back the flower token.

642
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,580
In fact, if you are promoted
to be the Crown Princess,

643
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,100
it should be appropriate
to appoint Mr. Pei

644
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,460
as the Minister of Defense.

645
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,740
What are you talking about?

646
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,380
How can a man be qualified to lead the army

647
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,580
and command the City Guards?

648
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,260
However, when I become the Crown Princess,

649
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,380
it'll be different.

650
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,380
I will appoint you as the lieutenant!

651
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,740
I will do my best to serve you,
Your Highness!

652
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,100
Go ahead.

653
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,140
Can you go faster?

654
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,540
I... I'm afraid!

655
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,300
It's a little scary in here!

656
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,420
If you are afraid,

657
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,420
I can get in and hold you in my arms.

658
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,060
Don't!

659
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,980
It'd feel like you bury
yourself alive for me.

660
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,820
Plus, the oxygen inside is
not enough for two people.

661
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,020
What's oxygen?

662
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,940
It's a type of gas

663
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,380
on which humans live.

664
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,420
Without it, people can't survive.

665
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,460
Then you are my oxygen!

666
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,460
Let her go!

667
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,220
Su Ziying?

668
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,620
Chen Qianqian, you are really alive!

669
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,180
Yingying, please calm down!

670
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,340
Put... put the sword down.

671
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,340
I know what you want.

672
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,140
Just put the sword down.

673
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,540
Let's talk, okay?

674
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,020
I want you to die!

675
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,620
Lin Qi!

676
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,940
Lin Qi! You are alive!

677
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,980
I haven't got my revenge yet.

678
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,900
Of course, I couldn't die!

679
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,020
Did Chen Chuchu send you?

680
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,580
It doesn't matter who sent me.

681
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,780
What matters is

682
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,140
that all of you should be dead!

683
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,540
Just kill me

684
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,260
if you dare!

685
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,380
Look, if you had surrendered to me earlier,

686
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,460
there wouldn't be so much trouble!

687
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,700
What do you wanna do to him?

688
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,260
Your Highness,

689
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,860
you can also capture and release him
seven times respectively.

690
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,500
He will definitely change his ways after that

691
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,660
and submit to you completely.

692
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,300
Meng,

693
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,740
Su Ziying is different from you!

694
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,460
I can never catch him again if I release him.

695
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,500
Then I'll be after him wherever he goes!

696
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,140
What do you want to do to him exactly?

697
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,740
Su Ziying tried to kill you several times!

698
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,820
He deserves to die!

699
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,580
Wait!

700
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,460
Don't... don't kill him!

701
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,260
Just tie him up.

702
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,220
In case he makes trouble again.

703
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,860
Now, please take your buddy away!

704
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,420
Thank you, Your Highness!

705
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,260
Let's go! Come on!

706
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,740
What brought you here?

707
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,500
I heard you were dead
and about to be buried here.

708
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,140
So I came to burn incense for you.

709
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,940
Who would expect something
like this would happen?

710
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,300
If I had known that, I would have come later.

711
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,420
Maybe I could have really
offered you some incense.

712
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,980
Can't believe I actually saved you!

713
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,620
Your bark is always worse than your bite.

714
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,980
I know you wouldn't let me die.

715
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,980
You know me so well!

716
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,540
My fake death plan failed now.

717
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,740
It's even harder for me
to dodge Chuchu's attack in the future.

718
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,140
Go to Xuanhu City with me.

719
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,540
I'll take you to my home.

720
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,980
From now on, you need not

721
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,260
worry about what will happen in Huayuan.

722
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,700
Let's go to Xuanhu City together!

723
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:40,700
No way!

724
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,380
Who's that?

725
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,980
He's a traveling merchant from Xuanhu City.

726
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,100
He saved my life when I was badly injured.

727
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,460
We... We...

728
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,500
You are married?!

729
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,660
That's great! Let him come with us!

730
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,380
We can be each other's company on the way!

731
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:04,980
Call him over! Come on!

732
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,060
Who said I'd go with you?

733
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,900
I have a husband now!

734
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,620
So do I!
