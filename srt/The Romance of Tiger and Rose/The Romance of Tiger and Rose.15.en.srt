23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 15)

24
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,460
Why did Her Majesty suddenly give orders

25
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,660
for you and the Crown Princess
to get a divorce?

26
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,460
The envoys' visit

27
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,900
must have made her raise doubts.

28
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,820
Shall we take the opportunity

29
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,140
to make a clear break
with the Crown Princess?

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,220
You're Crown Prince of Xuanhu City

31
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,620
and she's the Crown Princess of Huayuan City.

32
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,420
Both of you are the future City Owners.

33
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,420
You'll have to go back
to Xuanhu City sooner or later.

34
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,220
The two of you are like the general
and the marshal on the Chinese chess board,

35
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,460
who can't cross the River of the Chu
or the Border of the Han,

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,340
let alone meet each other.

37
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,660
What if I remove the boundary?

38
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,780
Do you mean

39
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,020
we'll conquer Huayuan City?

40
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,660
If the whole Chinese chess board is yours,

41
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,780
then the Crown Princess

42
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,580
will definitely belong to you.

43
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,580
Young Master,

44
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,340
we're from Xuanhu City, anyway.

45
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,860
Her Majesty has ordered

46
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,380
we should strengthen public security
now that Xuanhu City's envoys are here.

47
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,700
Stay alert.

48
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,700
Lord Han,

49
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,580
we're doing this without
letting Young Master know.

50
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,740
Will he punish us

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,180
if he knows about it?

52
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,140
We're doing it under
the orders of the City Owner.

53
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,460
Young Master also needs
to listen to his father.

54
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,300
Got it.

55
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,340
Be careful.

56
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,740
It's all explosives inside.

57
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,420
(The Annual Crowd Hunt of Huayuan City)

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,340
Qianqian,

59
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,180
why does Han Shuo still stay in your mansion?

60
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,940
I've told you to divorce him.

61
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,940
Mother,

62
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,940
please give me more time.

63
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,580
I don't know why you're into him.

64
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,460
In terms of appearance,
moral quality or talent,

65
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,740
Pei Heng is all superior.

66
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,100
Well. It's not a beauty pageant.

67
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,060
I really don't love Pei Heng.

68
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,900
I can understand why Han Shuo
misunderstood me. You...

69
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,220
Your Majesty, let me pay my respects.

70
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,140
You'd better not make trouble.

71
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,700
Han Shuo,

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,420
please take a seat.

73
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

74
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,940
Qianqian.

75
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,540
I'm going to give my regards to your mother.

76
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,740
Go ahead.

77
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,540
Qianqian.

78
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,940
This year,

79
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,060
you'll still get the most prey, right?

80
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,660
Why?

81
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,060
In previous years,

82
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,140
the Second Princess sent most of her prey

83
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,620
to your mansion.

84
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,140
Yeah. Chuchu loves me most.

85
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,340
Qianqian has been unruly
and self-willed since childhood

86
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,060
and Pei Heng is gentle and cultivated.

87
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,340
He'll be the most tolerant one towards her.

88
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,780
If the two of them get married,

89
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,540
they'll be a happy couple

90
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,140
everyone admires.

91
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,060
Pitifully...

92
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,100
Pitifully, Qianqian has married me.

93
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,740
Han Shuo,

94
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,540
men in Xuanhu are different
from those in Huayuan.

95
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,940
In Xuanhu City, a woman is required to

96
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,460
obey her father before marriage, her husband
when married, and her sons in widowhood.

97
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,860
In short, men are in authority over women.

98
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,900
It's just the opposite in Huayuan.

99
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,140
Here, men are appendages to women.

100
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,380
Are you sure

101
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,700
you're willing to
become Qianqian's appendage?

102
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,940
Qianqian, don't feel awkward.

103
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,380
I hope

104
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,300
we can get along as before.

105
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,260
As

106
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,660
friends?

107
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,740
Can you try to persuade my mother?

108
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,340
Just tell her you regret it

109
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,700
and you don't want to marry me.

110
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,500
She wouldn't listen to me.

111
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,660
Only if you insist on refusing to marry me

112
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,580
can she give up that idea.

113
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,940
What if I say

114
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,860
I don't want to reject it?

115
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,620
You just said

116
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,340
we could get along as friends.

117
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,300
I also said I'd wait.

118
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,940
Alright.

119
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,260
I mean

120
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,020
I'll wait for the right time

121
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,300
to talk about it with your mother.

122
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,140
Really?

123
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,740
You haven't come out hunting for a long time.

124
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,020
Have a good time today.

125
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,300
I...

126
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,820
I won't let this thing worry you.

127
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,820
Thank you, Pei Heng.

128
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,820
Qianqian and I love each other.

129
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,580
I'm not an appendage to her and vice versa.

130
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,020
You said you loved each other.

131
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,500
How will you prove

132
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,060
your love for Qianqian?

133
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,900
You must have got an idea.

134
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,020
According to rituals of Huayuan City,

135
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,620
a princess's husband must wear

136
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,020
a copper bracelet with
the badge of the family

137
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,420
to prove that he belongs to her.

138
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,140
He can't take it off as long as he lives.

139
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,660
You want me to put on
the copper bracelet of Huayuan City?

140
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,060
Exactly.

141
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,260
But in Xuanhu City,

142
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,860
only servants and handymen will be labelled.

143
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,260
Besides, as far as I'm concerned,

144
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,220
there hasn't been such
a ritual in Huayuan City.

145
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,820
There is now.

146
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,660
Starting from you.

147
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,700
I believe

148
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,780
if it's Pei Heng,

149
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,500
he'll say yes without hesitation.

150
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,260
I'm wondering if you'll wear

151
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,340
a copper bracelet for Qianqian.

152
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,300
What if I say no?

153
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,500
Now that you refuse

154
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,660
to admit your relationship with Qianqian,

155
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,060
why bother staying married?

156
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,380
How about

157
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,420
ending your marriage?

158
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,460
You're pushing me

159
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,060
to let it go first.

160
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,140
Han Shuo,

161
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,860
think about it.

162
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,220
Your Highness,

163
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,940
I wonder what the Crown Princess said

164
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,900
to Mr. Su.

165
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,980
He hasn't been here for several days.

166
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,580
They say

167
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,340
male entertainers are heartless.

168
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,620
It's really the case.

169
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,500
Su Mu is not that kind of person.

170
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,500
Mother.

171
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,740
Yuanyuan.

172
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,540
Chuchu.

173
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,980
Qianqian, you're here.

174
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,420
Let's have a discussion.

175
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,540
The Double Seventh Festival is approaching.

176
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,580
I plan to pick a gentle and kind man

177
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,700
to be Yuanyuan's husband.

178
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,620
Mother, don't worry about me.

179
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,020
These days,

180
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,900
I always felt exhausted.

181
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,060
I'm feeling my age.

182
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,740
I can't always stay by your side.

183
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,500
So, I want to see all of you get married

184
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,180
in my remaining years.

185
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,180
Chuchu,

186
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,260
when Yuanyuan is married,

187
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,300
it'll be your turn.

188
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,500
Me? But I...

189
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,420
But Chuchu has fallen in love with Han Shuo.

190
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,860
Mother,

191
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,980
you'd better pick a guy for Chuchu first.

192
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,580
I'm not interested.

193
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,420
Forget about it.

194
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,060
I'd better get Yuanyuan
and Su Mu's issue done first.

195
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,740
Yuanyuan,

196
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,100
you're afraid you can't
pick the right guy, right?

197
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,180
I've got an idea.

198
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,580
Let's throw an embroidered ball.

199
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,980
Throw an embroidered ball?

200
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,660
Yuanyuan, trust me.

201
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,940
I have 1,000 ways

202
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,500
to make sure Su Mu gets the ball.

203
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,900
He won't show up.

204
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,820
Don't you want to give it a try?

205
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,220
If he shows up,

206
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,180
it means he likes you too.

207
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Trust me.

208
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,500
At this Double Seventh Festival,

209
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,860
there is no smoke of gunpowder

210
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,620
but ebullition of joy.

211
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,020
The rabbit is so cute.

212
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,540
It'll be tasty if we use it to
make Spicy Diced Rabbit.

213
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,060
Go pick it up.

214
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,740
Where are you?

215
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,780
Mr. Rabbit.

216
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,180
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,260
Chuchu is such a good archer.

218
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,580
Do you want to be braised or steamed,

219
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,140
or become Spicy Diced Rabbit?

220
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,540
Let's go.

221
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,460
Chuchu, one rabbit is enough.

222
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,220
I'm leaving if there is nothing else to do.

223
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,540
Han Shuo, you're a good archer.

224
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,260
Second Princess, you're a better one.

225
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,980
Pitifully, I missed it.

226
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,540
I'm wondering what you want.

227
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,460
We're hunting. Of course, I want my prey.

228
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,700
But Chen Qianqian is your younger sister.

229
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,420
She has long stopped
treating me as her sister.

230
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,860
Why do I need to consider her as mine?

231
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,940
It seems you were not drunk

232
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,740
that evening.

233
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,540
Han Shuo,

234
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,460
now that my mother has
ordered Qianqian to divorce you,

235
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,900
I can beg her

236
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,900
to let you marry me.

237
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,940
I'll only stay with Chen Qianqian this life.

238
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,220
But it's obvious

239
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,980
Chen Qianqian doesn't like you at all.

240
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,740
She's always changeable and self-willed.

241
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,620
I've seen too much about
that since my childhood.

242
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,460
She's going to abandon you

243
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,740
and marry Pei Heng.

244
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,900
Why do you still have illusions
about her feelings for you?

245
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,540
It seems you don't know Qianqian well.

246
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,940
And you know even less about me.

247
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,860
Are you so dead set on following her?

248
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,060
If you aim at Qianqian again,

249
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,860
I'll shoot

250
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,260
my second arrow.

251
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,380
Sooner or later,

252
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,900
you'll know she doesn't deserve it.

253
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,980
I shot this rabbit for you.

254
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,420
How will you cook it?

255
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,180
Miss Lin Qi, I don't eat rabbit.

256
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,580
Take it back.

257
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,060
Chen Qianqian.

258
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,060
Why are you here?

259
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,060
Qianqian,

260
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,580
are you here to take a rabbit to me?

261
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,460
There is something you don't know.

262
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,380
Minister Pei doesn't eat rabbit.

263
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,540
I do.

264
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,660
You just told me you didn't.

265
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,660
Su Mu, put the rabbit away.

266
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,540
Did you decide to eat it

267
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,900
just because it's from her?

268
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,140
Chen Qianqian,

269
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,220
you've made him

270
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,340
a topic of conversation for the whole city.

271
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,820
How dare you come here and...

272
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,620
You!

273
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,940
I have something to say to you.

274
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,620
Chen Qianqian!

275
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,740
Su Mu,

276
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,020
why did you not help Yuanyuan

277
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,540
with her rehabilitation recently?

278
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,820
You promised me

279
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,300
you'd take care of her.

280
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,620
Zi Nian always stays by her side.

281
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,980
I'm not irreplaceable.

282
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,740
It's not all about rehabilitation.

283
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,380
The two of you care about each other.

284
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,820
Why don't you take the opportunity

285
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
to spend more time with her?

286
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,060
Your Highness, please don't say that.

287
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,300
I'm a man of low origin. How dare I do that?

288
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,060
If others know about it,

289
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,780
the Princess Royal will be discredited.

290
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,180
Your Highness,

291
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,900
please don't mention this issue again.

292
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,100
If you don't tell her how you feel about her,

293
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,260
how can she be determined
to throw an embroidered ball?

294
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,580
Mealtime.

295
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,500
Anybody? Guards! Someone broke out of prison!

296
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,180
(Xingzi Mansion)

297
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,700
Come out!

298
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,420
Your Highness.

299
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,460
Su Ziying?

300
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,500
I'm here to assist you.

301
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,780
Assist me?

302
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,140
Haven't you been imprisoned?

303
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,100
How did you escape?

304
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,260
Chen Qianqian is infamous.

305
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,860
She doesn't deserve to
be the future City Owner.

306
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,180
Your Highness, don't you want to replace her

307
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,380
and enjoy the highest position

308
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,980
and supreme power?

309
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,380
She's been elected as the Crown Princess.

310
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,860
It has nothing to do with me.

311
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,220
It all depends on
human effort, Your Highness.

312
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,660
I'm confident that

313
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,860
I can help you

314
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,580
become the Crown Princess.

315
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,740
While you worked for Chen Qianqian,

316
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,180
you reported she illegally
possessed the defense map

317
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,220
and tried to rebel.

318
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,260
And in the end,

319
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,820
instead of getting her into trouble,

320
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,700
you were thrown into prison.

321
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,140
What can you do

322
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,940
to be my aide?

323
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,660
I've got some secret information.

324
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,420
The envoys of Xuanhu City

325
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,940
have taken lots of explosives here.

326
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,500
They'll launch an attack

327
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,420
in the evening of
the Double Seventh Festival.

328
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,700
Do you have evidence?

329
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,140
I got this tip-off by accident

330
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,500
in Chen Qianqian's mansion

331
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,580
when I worked for her.

332
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,900
If you believe me,

333
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,660
you can take the opportunity
to arrest Han Shuo

334
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,420
and use it as an excuse
to accuse Chen Qianqian

335
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,300
so that she will be dethroned.

336
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,060
If you don't believe me,

337
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,100
you can throw me into prison again.

338
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,380
Why do you want to help me?

339
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,940
Your Highness, do you really forget me?

340
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,980
How dare you try to be hired as a lieutenant

341
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,500
by pretending to be a girl.

342
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,420
I'll beat you to death.

343
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,060
I'll beat you to death.

344
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,660
Qianqian, stop it.

345
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,740
Your Highness.

346
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,740
Are you okay?

347
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,060
I'll take you to the doctor.

348
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,900
You were the one who stopped Chen Qianqian

349
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,140
and saved my life.

350
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,220
You also let me heal
my wounds at the Pei's Mansion.

351
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,940
At that time,

352
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,580
I made a promise that I'd pay you back.

353
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,180
Thinking back carefully,

354
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,060
I did do this thing.

355
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,580
I admire you from the bottom of my heart.

356
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,820
I'll remain loyal to you.

357
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,700
You just said

358
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,340
Han Shuo and the envoys

359
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,180
had arranged troops
in ambush and laid explosives.

360
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,300
Yes, Your Highness.

361
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,740
As long as you prove

362
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,420
Han Shuo intends to conquer Huayuan City,

363
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,020
you'll be able to turn the tables.

364
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,900
In this case,

365
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,220
Han Shuo will definitely lose his life.

366
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,580
But you'll become
the Crown Princess with ease.

367
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,020
I serve as the Minister of Defense,

368
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,220
but I couldn't move City Guards
without letting my mother know.

369
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,500
How can I cope with Han Shuo

370
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,020
while hiding it from her?

371
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,660
There is one family in the city

372
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,140
whose security guards
are brave and battle-wise.

373
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,100
Do you mean the Pei family?

374
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,540
Pei Heng will help me?

375
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,780
(Pei's Mansion)

376
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,420
I've already messed up once.

377
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,140
If I fail again this time,

378
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,780
I'll never win my mother's trust back.

379
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,980
Minister Pei,

380
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,220
this is a secret action,

381
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,100
so I have to ask you for a favor.

382
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,340
Borrow soldiers?

383
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,100
Your Highness, as the Minister of Defense,

384
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,980
you can move troops anytime.

385
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,220
Why do you want to borrow my security guards?

386
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,020
You said

387
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,820
Han Shuo intended to conquer Huayuan City.

388
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,580
Do you have evidence?

389
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,500
I've investigated Xuanhu's envoys in secret

390
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,100
and confirmed the information is correct.

391
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,220
I've marked the locations

392
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,740
where explosives have been laid.

393
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,900
To avoid alerting the enemy,

394
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
I'm afraid I can't provide more evidence.

395
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,980
Minister Pei,

396
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,260
as for this matter,

397
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,940
it's better to err on the side of caution.

398
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,620
You also want to prove to Qianqian that

399
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,100
Han Shuo has an ulterior motive, right?

400
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,100
As long as we join hands,

401
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,380
Han Shuo's plan will be destroyed

402
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,380
and Qianqian will awaken to the truth.

403
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,940
Why not do it?

404
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,140
It's about the defense of the city.

405
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,460
I have to report it to the City Owner.

406
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,300
Don't you hope that

407
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,580
Qianqian can't find any excuse to refuse you?

408
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,500
If I lend soldiers to you,

409
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,860
do you have confidence
that you can catch Han Shuo?

410
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,020
Young Master Han, if you're ready,

411
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,180
I'll ask the blacksmith to get started.

412
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,700
I have to make things clear beforehand.

413
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,260
The bracelet is like shackles.

414
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,660
Once it's welded,

415
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,020
it's impossible to take it off
without leaving serious injuries.

416
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,380
Will the City Owner recall the order

417
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,340
and never mention Qianqian's
engagement to Pei Heng

418
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,980
as long as I accept the humiliation?

419
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,740
Please mind your language.

420
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,820
How can you consider
the badge of Huayuan City

421
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,620
as a humiliation?

422
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,500
If you're unwilling to do that,

423
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,460
just tell the City Owner

424
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,900
you agree to divorce the Crown Princess.

425
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,020
Do you want to scald him to death?

426
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,340
Stop there.

427
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,420
What a coincidence.

428
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,620
Tomorrow is the Double Seventh Festival.

429
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,780
You want to ask me to go out?

430
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,580
I'm busy tomorrow.

431
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,740
I need to arrange my mother's
inspection on a festooned vehicle

432
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,420
and help Yuanyuan with the ceremony
of throwing an embroidered ball.

433
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,460
I really have no time left.

434
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,260
Enjoy yourself tomorrow.

435
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,180
I have something to say to you.

436
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,180
No matter what you want to say,

437
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,580
wait till the day after tomorrow.

438
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,620
I'm going back.

439
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,180
Can't you let me finish my words?

440
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,420
Why do you keep avoiding me?

441
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,580
Why do you always brush me off?

442
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,740
Why do you pay no attention to how I feel?

443
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,300
You made me

444
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,220
feel so worthless.

445
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,100
Your mother asked you to divorce me.

446
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,980
You haven't given me an explanation.

447
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,460
Everyone wants us to get a divorce,

448
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,140
but I insist on staying with you like a fool.

449
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,020
If you treat me like that,

450
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,340
how could I persuade myself to keep going?

451
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,660
Then give up.

Repeat it.

455

All you know is scaring me

456
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,380
and threatening me.

457
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,380
I threaten you?

458
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,100

Young Master.

465
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,420
Young Master, you asked us to come here

466
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,900
because you've changed your mind, right?

467
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,540
Now that you've laid explosives

468
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,940
all over the city behind my back,

469
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,900
I have no choice but to do this.

470
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,740
Okay. Great.

471
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,500
These are all the locations with explosives?

472
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,980
Young Master, don't worry.

473
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,700
Nothing will go wrong.

474
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,340
Only when you are one-up

475
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,260
can you get everything you want,

476
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,580
including Chen Qianqian.

477
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,580
Slow down.

478
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,380
Awesome!

479
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,660
(Music and Dance Academy)

480
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,820
These musicians the Music and Dance Academy
just bought

481
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,100
are not bad.

482
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,260
Exactly.

483
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,020
Let's go.

484
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,300
Isn't that Lu Peng?

485
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,500
Has he been back?

486
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,540
Now that Su Mu has left the Academy,

487
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,940
Lu Peng will be the best musician here.

488
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,220
Of course, he chose to come back.

489
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,540
Stop looking.

490
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,020
The best is yet to come.

491
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,540
Really?

492
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,020
The Princess Royal will
throw an embroidered ball.

493
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:42,980
Whoever catches it

494
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,460
will marry her.

495
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,460
That's exciting.

496
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:45,980
Let's go.

497
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,940
Okay.

498
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,580
Is Su Mu there?

499
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,740
Throw it.

500
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,380
Crown Princess.

501
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,580
Throw it. Crown Princess.

502
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,460
Crown Princess.

503
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,340
Crown Princess, Su Mu hasn't shown up.

504
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,060
Will this really work?

505
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,060
It just started. No hurry.

506
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,620
I've sent for him.

507
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,420
Even if he comes,

508
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,580
how do you guarantee he can catch the ball?

509
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,340
Trust me. Yuanyuan,
I've got everything arranged.

510
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,620
Zi Rui.

511
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,020
Here.

512
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,780
In a while,

513
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,660
I'll approach Su Mu

514
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,260
with this embroidered ball.

515
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,860
You need to pose like you're
going to throw the ball,

516
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,820
but don't really do it.

517
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,780
Cover it with your sleeve like this

518
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,100
and people will think you've thrown it.

519
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,580
Then I'll pass this ball

520
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,740
to Su Mu in secret.

521
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,820
Nobody will find it out.

522
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,100
Does it really work?

523
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,660
Yes. Definitely. It's...

524
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,220
It's called editing thinking.

525
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,860
Let me show you.

526
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,020
I got it!

527
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,300
Got it?

528
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,500
Just show them

529
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,140
how you pose to throw an embroidered ball

530
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,100
and how Su Mu poses to catch it.

531
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,900
Then everyone will think you've thrown a ball

532
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,660
and Su Mu has caught it.

533
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,780
That's it.

534
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,020
Okay!

535
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,140
There he is. Mr. Su is there.

536
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,300
Mr. Su is there.

537
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,300
Hurry.

538
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,900
The Princess Royal shows up.

539
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,380
He's really there.

540
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,860
Princess Royal.

541
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,740
Yuanyuan, I'm going down to see Su Mu.

542
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,460
Look carefully.

543
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,020
Throw the embroidered ball

544
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,940
after I'm by Su Mu's side.

545
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,620
Don't do it

546
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,660
before that.

547
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,660
Got it?

548
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,500
Got it.

549
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,580
We've been waiting so long.

550
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,820
Princess Royal.

551
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,460
Isn't that Su Mu?

552
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,220
Is he also there to catch
the embroidered ball?

553
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,540
He's just a musician.

554
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,940
The Princess Royal is out of his league.

555
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,780
Maybe he's just here as a looker-on.

556
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,020
The Princess Royal is a cripple.

557
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,180
Why is she out of his league?

558
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,580
Su Mu is the best musician, anyway.

559
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,780
Maybe the Princess Royal
just deserves a musician

560
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,820
now that she's a cripple.

561
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,660
Unbelievable.

562
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,700
Yeah.

563
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,540
Nothing is impossible.

564
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,900
Even Young Master Han
wears a copper bracelet.

565
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,140
Usually, only the underclass and servants

566
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,500
wear that thing.

567
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,980
Young Master of Xuanhu is just so so.

568
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,940
What bracelet were you talking about?

569
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,140
Crown Princess, it has spread the whole city

570
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,900
that Han Shuo was ordered by the City Owner

571
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,060
to wear a copper bracelet

572
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,220
to prove he belongs to you.

573
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,580
It means women of Huayuan City

574
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,780
can enslave men of Xuanhu City.

575
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,780
Wearing a bracelet?

576
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,740
I didn't write it.

577
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,940
Everyone wants us to get a divorce,

578
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,580
but I insist on staying with you like a fool.

579
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,980
If you treat me like that,

580
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,620
how could I persuade myself to keep going?

581
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,860
Han Shuo.

582
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,700
Han Shuo.

583
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,700
Crown Princess. Have a rest.

584
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,940
Where is Han Shuo?

585
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,700
Han Shuo?

586
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,740
I haven't seen him the whole day.

587
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,860
Where has he gone?

588
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,220
Don't worry.

589
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,220
We'll find him.

590
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,540
I shouldn't have refused him yesterday.

591
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,660
He's so proud and arrogant.

592
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,140
He must be heartbroken.

593
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,260
It's all my fault.

594
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,980
If it hadn't been for me,

595
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,500
he couldn't have put on that damned bracelet.

596
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,060
I let him down time and again.

597
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,180
Bracelet?

598
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,860
Young Master Han put on a bracelet?

599
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,660
Uh. Don't be sad.

600
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,580
I don't think

601
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,740
Young Master Han will take it to heart.

602
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,060
Well, this morning,

603
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,900
I saw Bai Ji and Young Master Han

604
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,220
ordering guys from Xuanhu City

605
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,820
to move a lot of boxes.

606
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,740
Bai Ji told me

607
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,420
Young Master Han would give you

608
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,820
a big surprise tonight.

609
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,060
He said, after tonight,

610
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,820
you would regret

611
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,220
you treated Young Master Han like that.

612
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,740
They asked me not to tell you

613
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,020
because they're afraid
you won't feel surprised.

614
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,580
They've prepared special
local products of Xuanhu City.

615
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,860
Zi Rui,

616
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,220
do you know what Xuanhu City abounds in?

617
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,260
Fruit?

618
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,620
Ironware?

619
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,300
What is it?

620
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,140
Explosives.

621
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,340
The boxes are filled with explosives.

622
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,100
After being pushed by
my mother and refused by me,

623
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,380
he wants to bomb Huayuan.

624
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,900
Xuanhu will destroy Huayuan.

625
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,820
Crown Princess, don't run.

626
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,100
Crown Princess, where are you going?

627
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,180
The embroidered ball.

628
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,540
Right. The embroidered ball.

629
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,340
Zi Rui, keep the embroidered ball.

630
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,740
Don't give it to anyone except Su Mu.

631
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,900
I have to find Han Shuo.

632
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,300
You lead a team respectively and split up.

633
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,900
Got it.

634
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,220
Your Highness,

635
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,740
our guys are

636
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,500
lying in ambush at places

637
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,500
where explosives have been laid.

638
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,380
It seems you don't know Qianqian well.

639
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,180
And you know even less about me.

640
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,300
If you aim at Qianqian again,

641
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,500
I'll shoot

642
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,620
my second arrow.

643
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,700
Once Han Shuo takes action,

644
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,180
arrest him at once.

645
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Try your best to capture him alive.

646
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,420
Yes, Your Highness.

647
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,620
When Han Shuo is convicted,

648
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,900
he'll be at your disposal.

649
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,220
Chuchu.

650
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,740
Chuchu.

651
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,860
Crown Princess, you can't go in.

652
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,340
Chuchu.

653
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,140
Go away!

654
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,220
Chuchu, there is an urgency.

655
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,660
Only you can help me.

656
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,780
What can I do for you?

657
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,260
As the Crown Princess, you're awe-inspiring.

658
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,700
You even broke into my house

659
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,780
without permission.

660
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,020
Han Shuo wants to conquer Huayuan City.

661
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,500
Send City Guards to find him.

662
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,340
We must stop him.

663
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,140
How did you know that?

664
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,940
There is no time to lose.

665
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,580
Han Shuo had explosives
laid in the whole city.

666
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,420
Mother's inspection tour is about to start.

667
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,580
Once the explosives are ignited...

668
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,740
He won't have his way.

669
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,180
I've sent guys to lie in ambush

670
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,780
at every place with explosives.

671
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,700
You've already known that?

672
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,060
You've not only known that,

673
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,340
but also sent guys to catch him.

674
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,660
Han Shuo harbors evil designs.

675
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,900
As the Minister of Defense,

676
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,380
I have to arrest him.

677
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,700
To convict someone,
you must catch him red-handed.

678
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,740
I'll give him a deadly blow tonight.

679
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,980
Catch him red-handed?

680
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,900
You knew what he was going to do today.

681
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,140
Why did you not stop him?

682
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,100
Instead, you want to see
him make big trouble.

683
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,900
Chen Chuchu,

684
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,780
to become the Crown Princess,

685
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,140
you even decided to give up Han Shuo?

686
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,140
You don't have the right to yell at me.

687
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,220
Why does Han Shuo want to conquer Huayuan?

688
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,940
Isn't it because you keep changing your mind

689
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,500
and have so many love affairs?

690
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,860
Chuchu, stop it.

691
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,340
Don't make things difficult for Qianqian.

692
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,700
Pei Heng,

693
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,700
you can help me, right?

694
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,460
Go find him and stop him.

695
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,860
As the son of the former Minister of Defense,

696
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,380
you can help me out.

697
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,780
Why does he have to do that?

698
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,660
Today is the Double Seventh Festival.

699
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,300
City Guards need to patrol the whole city

700
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,620
and protect our mother.

701
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,140
Why don't you have a guess?

702
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,620
Who lent me soldiers

703
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,580
to encircle and suppress Han Shuo?

704
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,420
Fine.

705
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,940
Neither of you is obliged to help me,

706
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,420
but I can't do nothing

707
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,220
while watching you give up on Han Shuo.

708
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,340
Now that you don't go,

709
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,180
I'll go alone.

710
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,340
I can stop Han Shuo by myself.

711
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,300
Guards!

712
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,420
Now that you're here, you'd better stay.

713
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,740
I'll keep our mother company.

714
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,220
Just stay here.

715
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,620
I'll deal with you later.

716
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,660
Chen Chuchu,

717
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,460
didn't you say you wanted Han Shuo?

718
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,060
Pei Heng.

719
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,300
Don't look at me like that.

720
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,380
I know you're not that type of person.

721
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,300
You couldn't hurt others.

722
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,180
When will she throw it?

723
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,780
Come on.

724
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,660
When will she do it?

725
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,260
Is she going to do it or not?

726
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,700
It's an important event in her life.

727
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,300
It's understandable she's cautious.

728
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,940
I've been waiting for two hours.

729
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,820
If it goes on like this, it'll be dawn.

730
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,780
Is she going to throw it or not?

731
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,980
Mr. Su is back.

732
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,820
It's not Mr. Su.

733
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,660
Hurry up.

734
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,500
He won't show up again.

735
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,580
Excuse me.

736
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,060
Excuse me.

737
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,940
Help me with it.

738
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,900
Guo,

739
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,380
did you see Mr. Su?

740
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,260
No.

741
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,620
What does he look like?

742
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,500
Your Highness, how about
you don't throw it today?

743
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,660
Let's go back.

744
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,140
They all want to make a decision for me.

745
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,500
I'm a cripple,

746
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,020
so I even don't have the right

747
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,140
to decide who I can marry?

748
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,020
No. I'll throw it.

749
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,420
Why do I have to give up
just because he doesn't show up?

750
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,420
Pass the ball to me.

751
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,820
Your Highness.

752
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,620
Pass it to me.

753
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,900
Your Highness.

754
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,580
Her Majesty has left her mansion

755
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,220
on the festooned vehicle.

756
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,380
We've missed the auspicious time.

757
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,540
How about we don't do it today?

758
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,500
Let's go back.

759
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,420
Guo, the Crown Princess

760
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,740
asked the Princess Royal not
to throw the embroidered ball

761
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,260
unless Mr. Su shows up.

762
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,140
Wait here.

763
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,180
I'll go stop her.

764
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,060
Your Highness, throw it!

765
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,100
Here. Your Highness.

766
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,140
Look. She threw it.

767
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,820
She threw it.

768
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,820
It's here.

769
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,740
Here. It's mine.

770
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,620
The ball.

771
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,860
Meng Guo, get the ball!

772
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:39,940
It's mine.

773
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,700
Mine.

774
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,620
It'll be mine.

775
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,220
Stop pushing.

776
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,420
I got it!

777
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,740
Where is it?

778
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,140
Don't grab.

779
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,900
Who dares to grab?

780
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,700
You? You?

781
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,020
He got the embroidered ball.

782
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,420
He'll be the Princess Royal's husband.

783
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,700
It's him.

784
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,620
I can't believe he got it.

785
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,460
A musician.

786
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,340
He's a musician.

787
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,300
A musician.

788
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,260
I can't believe it.

789
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,980
Your Highness,

790
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,380
he's the one who got the embroidered ball.

791
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,220
Your Highness, let me pay my respects.

792
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,860
Tell everyone

793
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,020
he'll be my husband now that
he got the embroidered ball.

794
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,140
I'm determined to marry a musician.

795
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,420
Got it.

796
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,860
Your Majesty!

797
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,380
I'll look for Han Shuo with you,

798
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,540
but you have to promise me

799
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,220
this is your last time
being bewitched by him.

800
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,500
You can't believe him again

801
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,740
no matter what he says.

802
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,820
I'll stop him.

803
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,180
I won't let him do that.

804
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,620
No way. We couldn't find him
if it goes on like this.

805
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,060
We'd better get off
the horse and act separately.

806
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,100
Here.

807
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,940
I heard you were looking everywhere for me.

808
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,060
Where did you go?

809
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,180
I've been looking for you so long.

810
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,500
I did something great.

811
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,380
Your timing is perfect.
I was planning to look for you.

812
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,900
Even if you didn't want to see me,

813
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,260
I'd tie you up and take you there.

814
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
The City Owner is here!

815
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,980
Mother.

816
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,780
Mother.

817
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,140
Qianqian.

818
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,940
Mother.

819
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,340
I'll show you something interesting.

820
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,420
Wait. Han Shuo.

821
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,580
It's my fault.

822
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,220
I shouldn't have ignored you.

823
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,820
I shouldn't have brushed you off.

824
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,380
I shouldn't have pushed you away.

825
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,420
I promise I won't do that again.

826
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,220
Han Shuo, I like you.

827
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,900
I really like you.

828
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,500
I want to stay with you.

829
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,340
I'll stay with you

830
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,900
no matter who wants to stop me.

831
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,260
Why are you saying these silly words?

832
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,300
I know I let you down.

833
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,220
You even suffered this for me.

834
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,500
It couldn't be taken off, right?

835
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,460
It can't as long as you live, right?

836
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,780
I don't think it's a badge of Huayuan City.

837
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,420
I think...

838
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,100
... it's you.

839
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,060
You're a rose with thorns.

840
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,340
Wearing a rose doesn't make me suffer.

841
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,140
You hurt me

842
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,620
with your thorns,

843
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,980
but I

844
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,220
love it.

845
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,020
I'll stay here

846
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,780
for you.

847
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,220
I'll stay by your side all my life.

848
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,900
For my sake,

849
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,980
can you stop...

850
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,260
Your Majesty!

851
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,900
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

852
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,220
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

853
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,900
