(Episode 9)

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,780
The Crown Princess Election will
be held seven days later.

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,220
You're pressed for time.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,140
It's too late to practice
from the basic things now.

27
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,780
I'll teach you a move

28
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,460
and you'll win with the single one of it.

29
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,500
What is it?

30
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,940
Take a horse stance first.

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,460
Lift your left foot.

32
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,860
And then throw your right fist forward.

33
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,020
This move can't work
without a good grounding.

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,620
The Third Princess has lost her ability to fight.

35
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,780
Why does Young Master teach her this move?

36
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,900
I'll go and remind him.

37
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,740
What are you doing?

38
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,740
If you don't want

39
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,380
your Young Master to send
you back to Xuanhu City,

40
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,820
stay here.

41
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,820
Look.

42
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,220
Again.

43
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,220
Now lift your right foot.

44
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,900
and throw your left fist forward.

45
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,780
Go on.

46
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,940
You did it on purpose.

47
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,220
You want to make me look dumb, don't you?

48
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,740
You leaned towards me

49
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,300
again and again yourself.

50
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,140
I'm done.

51
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,700
Alright, I won't do it again.

52
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,740
I'm serious now.

53
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,700
I'll teach you how to defeat Lin Qi.

54
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,100
How?

55
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,340
Let me say it in your ear.

56
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,180
I'll teach you a move

57
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,620
and you'll score one point
higher than Lin Qi.

58
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,540
Even if you two tumble
off the ring at the same time

59
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,820
and draw,

60
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,180
you'll still win

61
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,940
in the Kung Fu test.

62
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,980
My goodness.

63
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,140
That's amazing.

64
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,460
How shall I do it?

65
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,740
Come closer.

66
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:53,980
Okay.

67
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,180
I'll teach you.

68
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,140
Gentlemen,

69
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,820
today I ask you to come

70
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,540
because I want to discuss

71
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,380
the Crown Princess Election with you.

72
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,740
I...

73
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,660
What's the matter?

74
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,860
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

75
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,820
Don't always kneel down.

76
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,580
Quickly. Stand up.

77
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,740
Stand up.

78
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,340
Your Highness,

79
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,740
there's a limit to our capabilities.

80
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,620
We can give you advice,

81
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,380
but as for major events
like the Crown Princess Election,

82
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,180
even if we want you to win,

83
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,220
we're powerless to help.

84
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,540
Your Highness, forgive us, please.

85
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,420
No.

86
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,020
I don't want to win. I want to lose.

87
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,260
Lose?

88
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,020
Stand up. Have a seat.

89
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,100
Quickly.

90
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,660
Your Highness,

91
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,300
do you really want to lose
the Crown Princess Election?

92
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,780
Yes.

93
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,100
For you,

94
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,340
it's hard to win

95
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,540
but isn't it easy to lose?

96
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,780
I'm just afraid I'm too good.

97
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,660
What if I win?

98
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,180
If I win in the Kung Fu test,

99
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,740
how can I make sure that I'll lose

100
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,060
in the literacy test
and discourse on politics?

101
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,580
When you compete in things

102
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,940
you're bad at and others are good at,

103
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,380
you'll certainly lose.

104
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,340
As long as you be yourself,

105
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,460
you're sure to lose.

106
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,740
I want to help Chen Qianqian
be the City Owner.

107
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,700
Would you please

108
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,740
tell me your purposes?

109
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,900
Chen Qianqian is simple-minded, ignorant,

110
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,980
unreasonable, dissipated

111
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,300
and lawless.

112
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,500
I live in Yueli Mansion.

113
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,540
If Chen Qianqian is the Crown Princess,

114
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,820
I'll be conveniently able

115
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,020
to take control of the lifeblood of Huayuan.

116
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,900
Compared with the Second Princess, Chen Chuchu,

117
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,300
Chen Qianqian is easier to control

118
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,380
as the Crown Princess of Huayuan City.

119
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,380
Anyway,

120
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,620
the Crown Princess must be Chen Qianqian.

121
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,380
Now that she doesn't want to try hard,

122
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,900
let's give her a hand.

123
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,780
Yes.

124
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,860
The test starts now.

125
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,540
(The First Test:
Literacy Test)

126
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,220
Can I hand in my paper in advance?

127
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,860
No.

128
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,780
(Qian)

129
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,580

130
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,260
(Qian)

131
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,340
Is there anything else I need to do?

132
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,620
No. Off you go.

133
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,540
Yes.

134
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,260
Your Highness,

135
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,180
was it hard? How did you do in it?

136
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,780
It was so easy.

137
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,220
I drew beautifully.

138
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,660
You drew beautifully?

139
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,860
(The Second Test:
The Kung Fu test)

140
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,900
The Kung Fu test of the Crown Princess Election.

141
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,340
There are fifteen contestants in total.

142
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,900
The winner of a game gets one point.

143
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,460
The two people who score
the highest reach the final.

144
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,900
The winner will be the best
in the Kung Fu test.

145
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,460
Chen Qianqian, Li Yilan,

146
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,940
come here, please.

147
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,580
Don't be afraid, Your Highness.

148
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,980
You're a brave and skillful fighter
who never lose.

149
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,660
You are winning already.

150
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,100
Can we just shake hands? I admit defeat.

151
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,740
Swords are merciless
and lives are unpredictable.

152
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,020
Everything on the ring is predestined.

153
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,500
Sign the disclaimer, please.

154
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,060
Sign the disclaimer?

155
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,380
Do you have to be so serious?

156
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,260
(Disclaimer
Chen Qianqian; Li Yilan)

157
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,420
The one who chickens out, lost.

158
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,420
The one who causes disorder, lost.

159
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,300
The one who falls off the ring, lost.

160
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,100
The one who hits the truce gong, lost.

161
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,580
The competition will start now.

162
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,060
I've arranged with her.

163
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,700
She's on our side.

164
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,580
Lin Qi has also bought some people off.

165
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,740
The Third Princess is a shoo-in.

166
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,060
Dodge, Your Highness.

167
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,540
I want to but I can't move my legs.

168
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,460
Bravo. Bravo.

169
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,700
Fantastic.

170
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,260
Chen Qianqian, one point.

171
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,180
(One)

172
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,100
Your Highness, you're so agile.

173
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,980
I... I didn't expect it.

174
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,380
Your Majesty, I hear

175
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,900
Miss Lin Qi

176
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,620
has bribed the Third Princess's opponents.

177
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,900
I could never expect

178
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,940
Lin Qi to be so reliable.

179
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,580
Lin Qi has always been

180
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,380
a competitive child.

181
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,700
She'll seize every chance

182
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,420
to embarrass Qianqian.

183
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,660
I worry

184
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,380
if the Third Princess makes it to the final

185
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,420
and has to fight Lin Qi,

186
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,540
then...

187
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,420
Don't be afraid.

188
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,060
Han Shuo will help her.

189
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,980
He's not a man to be trifled with

190
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,620
and he adores Qianqian.

191
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,460
He won't watch her being hurt.

192
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,380
(Two)
Qianqian may get something for nothing.

193
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,860
The Third Princess has been given

194
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,380
a lot of support recently.

195
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,220
If she performs well in this election,

196
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,740
will she be the Crown Princess?

197
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,860
Let's just wait and see.

198
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,020
Dedicated actresses like this

199
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,340
should be paid at least
300 yuan a day in Hengdian.

200
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,580
Young Master, I've never seen that person.

201
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,100
It seems we haven't bought her off.

202
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,820
Is she on Lin Qi's side?

203
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,060
No, she's not.

204
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,660
Is she a dark horse?

205
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,660
Zi Rui, tell Her Highness

206
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,740
to default on this game.

207
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,180
Your Highness, come down here.

208
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,260
Don't play this game.

209
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,300
Don't distract me.

210
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,100
Just watch how I defeat her.

211
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,540
Sorry about that, Your Highness.

212
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,940
Are we fighting actually now?

213
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,500
As long as I run fast enough,

214
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
you won't be able to catch me.

215
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,060
Quick. Quick. Quick.

216
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,460
When can I... when...

217
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,340
The one who fights negatively will also lose.

218
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,980
Okay. Okay.

219
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,300
Okay. Okay.

220
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,860
Why do you have so much strength?

221
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,580
Your vital capacity is over 800, isn't it?

222
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,860
It must be.

223
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,180
Just go.

224
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,940
Bravo. Bravo.

225
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,860
Chen Qianqian has won

226
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,500
and reached the final.

227
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,820
You can't sleep either?

228
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,260
You'll compete with Lin Qi tomorrow.

229
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,740
It's sure to be tough.

230
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,620
I just wish it wouldn't be too painful.

231
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,900
Pain is unavoidable.

232
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,340
Will I die?

233
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,380
You're the Third Princess.

234
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,020
Lin Qi won't dare to go too far

235
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,180
even if she wants to make you suffer.

236
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,260
As long as you bear
what I've taught you in mind,

237
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,700
it's still possible that you'll win.

238
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,260
But

239
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,220
you fear pain so much.

240
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,460
You can withdraw from the final.

241
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,380
Tell me when you can't hold on anymore.

242
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,860
I'll hit the truce gong for you.

243
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,180
How can we do that?

244
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,100
I've said those things.

245
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,700
If I give up now,

246
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,860
Yuanyuan will be more
reluctant to listen to me.

247
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,940
Her disability is

248
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,780
more or less related to me.

249
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,860
I can't give up.

250
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,180
She can't give up either.

251
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,660
There's a custom in Xuanhu City.

252
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,940
If you tell the full moon your wish,

253
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,980
it'll come true.

254
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,860
So many people tell the moon their wishes.

255
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,980
Can it hear mine?

256
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,580
Let's be closer to the moon

257
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,740

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,140

I hear yesterday the Third Princess

300
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,780
beat one opponent after another

301
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,660
with great courage

302
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,140
and earned her qualification for the final.

303
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,260
She's competing with Miss Lin Qi today.

304
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,180
Even though

305
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,620
she has lost her ability to fight,

306
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,780
she can still win in the Kung Fu test.

307
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,260
Don't you want to go and watch her battle?

308
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,260
She must have done some wicked things.

309
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,820
Many people will be there, too.

310
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,060
The sunlight has been strong recently.

311
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,700
It'll easily cause a rash.

I'm weak. I can't bear that.

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,140
I don't want to go out.

314
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,100
But Your Highness,

315
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,740
you've got cleaned up and dressed.

316
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,260
You've even taken your cloak out.

317
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,060
Aren't you going to watch it?

318
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,140
Nonsense.

319
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,660
I'm not.

What brings you here?

325
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,180
The Third Princess is afraid
you won't watch her fight

326
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,620
and she really wants you to be there.

327
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,940
So she's specially asked me to persuade you.

328
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,700

329
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,020
push me to the study.

330
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,380

(Seven)

338
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,420
The Third Princess and Lin Qi have always fought

339
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,140
and Lin Qi has never won.

340
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,020
Now

341
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,980
the Third Princess loses all her Kung Fu.

342
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,020
Lin Qi will definitely take her revenge now.

343
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,100
Everyone in Huayuan City
knows how her whip kills.

344
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,180
The Third Princess is losing.

345
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,340

346
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,340

347
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,980

360
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,420

What now?

369
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,580
Lin Qi,

370
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,580
it's boring if we just fight.

371
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,860
Let's change for another way of fighting.

372
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,740
Okay.

373
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,020
What is it?

374
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,460
Have you heard of a way of fighting

375
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,340
whose name is increase in FPS?

376
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,380
What's that?

377
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,820
It means slow motion.

378
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,580
Let's make one move at a time.

379
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,340
Slow motion?

380
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,460
Increase in FPS, done.

381
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,260
You fooled me!

382
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,900
One, two, three.

383
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,340
Stop.

384
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,340
Come here.

385
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:14,820
Four.

386
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,580
Chen Qianqian.

387
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,500
Holy cow!

388
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,940
Eight, nine.

389
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,460
Help!

390
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,060
Don't run, you coward.

391
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,420
Don't chase me, you chicken.

392
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,180
Ten.

393
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,620
Lin Qi is good at attacking from a distance.

394
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,780
You can provoke her,

395
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,340
and get into a hand-to-hand fight with her.

396
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,140
You just need to hit her down the ring.

397
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,740
Chen Qianqian,

398
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,620
this is a competition!

399
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,620
Are you shameless?

400
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,380
Everyone is shameless
at such a critical moment.

401
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,860
Stop!

402
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,500
This is undignified.

403
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,900
Let go, both of you.

404
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,100
Lin Qi, I'll say one, two, three.

405
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,500
Let's let go together.

406
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,780
Okay.

407
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,140
One, two, three.

408
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,980
You're a liar.

409
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,540
So are you.

410
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,940
What are you doing?

411
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,380
Lin Qi, what are you doing?

412
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,100
Chen Qianqian,

413
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,820
it's useless playing tricks on me.

414
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,380
If you don't want to suffer pain,

415
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,900
admit defeat now.

416
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,980
Admit that you're a loser.

417
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,220
Twelve.

418
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,580
Why is Yuanyuan still not here?

419
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,740
Do you know it now?

420
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,540
There's no possibility that you'll win.

421
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,020
What's the Third Princess doing?

422
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,540
Why did she take her protector off?

423
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,540
Only then will she be likely to win.

424
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,940
Twenty-one.

425
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,740
Listen,

426
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,420
I was testing you just now.

427
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,100
The real combat

428
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,300
starts now.

429
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,860
See?

430
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,140
The Third Princess is unconquerable.

431
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,380
Lin Qi is really daring.

432
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,020
That's the Third Princess.

433
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,820
Because she's rolling in it.

434
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,420
Good, that's my girl.

435
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,420
The Third Princess

436
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,540
resembles you so much.

437
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,660
This is great.

438
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,140
If Qianqian earns

439
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,740
her spurs in this election,

440
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,700
I'll have one more option

441
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,660
and I won't have to let someone

442
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
have control of her life.

443
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,060
Qianqian. Stop. Qianqian!

444
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,060
What are you doing?

445
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,060
It's such a dangerous thing.

446
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,500
Aren't you afraid Lin Qi will hurt her?

447
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,300
Let go of me!

448
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,380
It's her wish.

449
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,340
I just give her what she wants.

450
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,100
She doesn't know any Kung Fu now.

451
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,340
What's the point of taking this test?

452
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,020
To you she's worthless.

453
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,300
But to my mind...

454
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,420
Chen Qianqian.

455
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,780
She's not.

456
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,900
Get up.

457
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,860
Zi Rui, hit the truce gong.

458
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
No.

459
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,700
Have faith in her.

460
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,940
How do you know she won't win?

461
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,220
In my opinion,

462
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,580
as long as she wants to,

463
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,140
she can do anything in the world.

464
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,260
Can you bear this?

465
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,340
I can't.

466
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,260
But so what?

467
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,420
She'll be unhappier if I hit the gong.

468
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,980
If you admit defeat now,

469
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,140
I'll let you live.

470
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,020
You're so noisy.

471
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,820
What matters most is that she lives.

472
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,260
Minister Pei.

473
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,820
I'm the only child of
the deceased Minister of Defense

474
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,940
and the Minister of Education.

475
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,900
Don't you dare to stop me.

476
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,780
Calm down, Minister Pei.

477
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,780
According to rules of the contest,

478
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,860
only the competitors' husbands or parents...

479
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,620
The Third Princess and I have been
engaged for fifteen years.

480
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,980
Except Her Majesty,

481
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,420
no one's more eligible than me.

482
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,140
Go away.

483
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,420
Qianqian, admit defeat.

484
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,980
The truce gong has been hit.

485
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,500
Chen Qianqian has admitted defeat.

486
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,220
She hasn't.

487
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,340
When have I admitted defeat?

488
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,060
Your Highness,

489
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,460
Minister Pei has hit the truce gong for you.

490
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,420
The Third Princess has admitted defeat.

491
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,460
Lin Qi has won.

492
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,940
Pei Heng.

493
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,820
Qianqian, give up.

494
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,060
I don't accept

495
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,140
this hit of the truce gong.

496
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,140
Pei Heng is not my parent, brother

497
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,940
or even my husband.

498
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,860
His hit of the truce gong

499
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,660
means nothing.

500
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,620
I don't accept it either.

501
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,260
Chen Qianqian has married Han Shuo.

502
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,140
She's not engaged to Minister Pei any more.

503
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,140
Qianqian,

504
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,620
you and Han Shuo didn't
offer sacrifices, parade down streets

505
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,580
or even hold a wedding.

506
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,140
You're not a couple.

507
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,580
He hasn't even lived at your house
more than three months.

508
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,940
You and I grew up together

509
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,420
and we've been engaged for fifteen years.

510
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,340
I'm more eligible than him to hit the gong.

511
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,100
Take my advice. Come down.

512
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,700
Your Highness,

513
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,340
you can only choose either Minister Pei

514
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,140
or Young Master Han to act on your behalf.

515
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,140
Pei Heng,

516
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,140
I know you did it for my own good

517
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,340
but I must keep fighting.

518
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,620
I choose Han Shuo.

519
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,420
Han Shuo hasn't hit the truce gong.

520
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,020
I haven't admitted defeat.

521
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
Continue.

522
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,260
The hitting of the truce gong is invalid.

523
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,140
The competitors will go on with the game.

524
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,420
Heavens,

525
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,180
the most good-looking man in Huayuan City,

526
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,380
Minister Pei, was turned down in public.

527
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,100
It's really embarrassing.

528
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,020
After this,

529
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,740
can he still marry a good lady?

530
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,020
But what's up with the Third Princess?

531
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,020
She always fooled around before.

532
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,980
Why's she trying so hard today?

533
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,220
Women are so charming when being like that.

534
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,780
You think you stopped her from being hurt

535
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,980
for her own good.

536
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,660
You don't know her at all.

537
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,300
It seems

538
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,420
Minister Pei

539
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,100
doesn't know the Third Princess
as well as Young Master Han.

540
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,380
Han Shuo watched Qianqian

541
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,140
being humiliated so much

542
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,780
but he didn't move a bit

543
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,580
or hit the truce gong.

544
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,900
Is it because he understands her

545
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,140
or he doesn't love her enough?

546
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,620
Besides, women don't need to be understood

547
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,260
but to be

548
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,700
loved truly.

549
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,020
That's to say,

550
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,700
Minister Pei is the good match for her.

551
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,260
Chen Qianqian,

552
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,540
how dare you humiliate Pei Heng in public?

553
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,940
Don't you disapprove

554
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,420
of my engagement to Pei Heng?

555
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,260
Do you want me to admit it?

556
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,380
Of course you can't.

557
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,140
But

558
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,020
you can't deny it in public either.

559
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,140
What a strange way of thinking.

560
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,660
Twenty-five.

561
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,500
I was often beaten

562
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,260
by Miss Lin Qi in
the Music and Dance Academy.

563
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,700
Her whipping is top-ranking

564
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,780
in the whole city.

565
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,300
Now that it was an awful time,

566
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,180
just don't think about it.

567
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,660
When Miss Lin Qi whips people,

568
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,420
sometimes their flesh is torn

569
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,860
and sometimes they suffer internal injuries.

570
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,220
I have no idea

571
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,700
how she's whipping the Third Princess today.

572
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,180
She'll just get some superficial wounds.

573
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,060
She's Her Majesty's daughter.

574
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,820
Lin Qi won't get herself into trouble.

575
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,220
Stop trying to persuade me.

576
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,660
I'm not going.

577
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,540
It's no business of mine
whether she loses or wins,

578
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,060
dies or lives.

579
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,340
I don't care

580
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,540
and I don't want to know.

581
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,420
Your Highness,

582
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,260
the person you sent to the ring said...

583
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,460
Nonsense.

584
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,300
Who sent someone there?

585
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,860
How's Qianqian?

586
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,940
Her Highness has been badly battered

587
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,340
but she's still not admitting defeat.

588
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,060
She's forcing me.

589
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,820
Your Highness, do you want to go or not?

590
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,780
What's the use of going there?

591
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,500
I'll just be laughed at.

592
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,700
Sorry about this, Your Highness.

593
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,140
What are you doing?

594
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,060
Zi Nian, catch up.

595
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,700
Yes.

596
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,420
Twenty-seven.

597
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,260
The game's over. You lost.

598
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,340
Yuanyuan.

599
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,700
Qianqian.

600
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Qianqian, admit defeat.

601
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,340
Rehabilitation.

602
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,260
I promise you.

603
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,540
I'll accept rehabilitation.

604
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,820
Admit defeat.

605
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,540
You'll die if you keep fighting.

606
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,140
Qianqian, listen to me.

607
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,660
Admit defeat now.

608
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,340
It's a competition.

609
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,780
Don't act so pitiful.

610
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,900
Who are you trying to impress?

611
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
As a worthless person,

612
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,780
I will only be ridiculed
by the whole world no matter what.

613
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,660
You want to make me stand up again.

614
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,500
It's just like you want to win the Kung Fu test
though you are unable to practice Kung Fu.

615
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,500
Do you think

616
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,740
it is possible?

617
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,300
And you'll score one point
higher than Lin Qi.

618
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,620
Even if you two tumble
off the ring at the same time

619
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,740
and draw,

620
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,980
you'll still win

621
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,460
in the Kung Fu test.

622
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,260
-Qianqian! -Qianqian!

623
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,700
Qianqian.

624
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,140
Qianqian.

625
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,620
Are you okay?

626
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,700
Get up. Slowly.

627
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,580
Qianqian.

628
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,900
Chen Qianqian, you crafty woman.

629
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,780
You underestimated me yourself.

630
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,140
Your Highness,

631
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,620
you've won in the Kung Fu test.

632
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,100
If your discourse on politics
gets the first grade,

633
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,140
that will be perfect.

634
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,380
Don't turn over. Don't raise your head.

635
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,740
Don't move. Be a good girl.

636
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,140
Don't move.

637
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,980
Lin Qi whipped Qianqian twenty-seven times.

638
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,060
Go and kill her.

639
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,780
Cut her twenty-seven times before she dies.

640
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,700
If you do it one time less,

641
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,580
you'll suffer it for her.

642
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,380
Yes, Young Master.

643
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,180
I'll only cut her more.

644
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,060
Han Shuo.

645
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,180
Bai Ji, come in.

646
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,100
Are...

647
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,860
are you going to take revenge on Lin Qi?

648
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,940
I...

649
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,660
Listen,

650
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,580
she deserves more than death.

651
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,300
I know a better way to punish her.

652
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,380
Zi Rui,

653
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,820
my back itches.

654
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,140
What did the doctor say?

655
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,820
Yuanyuan has dressed my wounds.

656
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,060
And it doesn't hurt so much.

657
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,420
Don't worry.

658
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,820
That's good.

659
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,060
-On the competing ground...
-On the competing ground...

660
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,820
On the competing ground,

661
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,980
you couldn't bear to see me being hurt

662
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,460
so you mentioned our engagement, right?

663
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,340
I knew it.

664
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,380
I must win this competition

665
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:50,980
so...

666
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,020
Wait a minute, Minister Pei.

667
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,340
I hear over the past few years,

668
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,460
you were indifferent to this engagement,

669
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,820
but today you mentioned it

670
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,580
before a crowd of people.

671
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,460
Did you feel forced to do it

672
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,220
or do you have some ulterior motive?

673
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,980
So what if I felt forced to do it?

674
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,060
So what if I have some ulterior motive?

675
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,420
If you felt forced to do it,

676
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,340
I'll take that as your concern for your student.

677
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,220
And I'll be grateful to you

678
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,420
as Qianqian's husband.

679
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,860
If you have some ulterior motive...

680
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,420
I once suffered from heart disease

681
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,060
and I couldn't often stay with Qianqian.

682
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,540
Now I've recovered.

683
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,460
Qianqian and I will

684
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,420
grow old together

685
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,380
and be with each other forever.

686
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,020
I'd advise you to forget your engagement

687
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,740
to Qianqian as soon as possible.

688
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,260
Grow old together.

689
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,220
Be with each other forever.

690
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,820
The die is cast.

691
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,700
Now that some things didn't happen,

692
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,980
they're never gonna happen.

693
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,940
Don't waste your time

694
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,500
for someone you can't be with.

695
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,380
I think Lin Qi is a good choice.

696
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,820
At least she's devoted to you.

697
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,780
Let me ask you a question, too.

698
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,700
After you moved into Yueli Mansion,

699
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,740
Qianqian snatched Dragon Bone
and became a commoner for you.

700
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,260
But when she was whipped by Lin Qi,

701
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,300
you weren't pained a bit.

702
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,100
Are you serious about Qianqian

703
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,660
or do you have an ulterior motive?

704
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,100
You're an outsider.

705
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,260
Why should you suspect

706
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,740
my feelings for Qianqian?

707
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,060
Qianqian and I have been
engaged for fifteen years.

708
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,540
How come I'm an outsider?

709
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,540
An engagement you were indifferent to

710
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,140
and wanted to break off

711
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,780
is nothing at all.

712
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,460
Her Majesty may not think like that.

713
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,460
Did you just admit that you liked Qianqian?

714
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,460
It's nothing to be denied.

715
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,580
You didn't care a damn about Qianqian

716
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,940
but only after I came here

717
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,900
and took her away from you

718
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,860
did you pay attention to her.

719
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,660
I can't see that you truly love her.

720
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,580
I may not truly love her before.

721
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,300
But now I definitely do.

722
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,740
Don't resent me for not being nice to you.

723
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,740
Same to you.

724
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,740
Pei Heng admitted that he liked Qianqian

725
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,220
right in front of me.

726
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,620
Does he really think I don't dare to kill?

727
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,980
Young Master,

728
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,820
Minister Pei dared to infuriate you

729
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,500
just because

730
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,180
he's the only child of
the deceased Minister of Defense.

731
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,060
But don't forget

732
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,340
that behind you

733
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,220
is Xuanhu City.

734
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,860
As long as we light the beacon
and march our army here,

735
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,020
not only the Third Princess

736
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,540
but also Pei Heng will be yours.

737
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,460
What do I need him for?

738
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,980
Sorry. Sorry.

739
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,860
It hurts.
