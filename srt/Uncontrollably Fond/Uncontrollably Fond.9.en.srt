00:00:01,326 --> 00:00:05,715
=Episode 9=

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,270
This is the girl I like, mom. I've
told you about her before, right?

3
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,490
For about 9 years, I've kept thinking about her
and not understanding why I cared for her so much

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,882
until I realized with certainty
that I love her a lot.

5
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,673
The cameras must be capturing everything.
Is that okay with you? With everyone watching...

6
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,378
I don't care at all.

7
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:15,459
Can't you see? Do you know what
I did because of you?

8
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,131
Am I nothing to you?

9
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,433
What should I do?

10
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,704
That idiot who is facing her back at me..

11
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,008
won't even spare me a look.

12
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,781
She only looks for the jerk who left her behind.
What shall I do?

13
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,330
Don't listen to all those jerks
and please...

14
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,000
just listen to my words only.

15
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,674
I love you, Eul. I love you.

16
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,944
I love you...

17
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,829
Hello? Is this Sin Jun
Young's residence?

18
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:02,999
No Eul?

19
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,339
I decided to trust you just this once.

20
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,150
Hello? Sin Jun Young?
Are you listening?

21
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,530
I didn't hear you.
What did you just say?

22
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,485
-That I would try once...
-That's fine. Don't say any more.

23
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,820
Don't say anything.

24
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,425
I'm coming to you to
confirm that face to face.

25
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,471
Let's just stay like this for a while.

26
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,056
I don't like intestines.
They smell awful.

27
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,795
Miss, we roast ours once.
So they're very savory!

28
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,398
Have some. Oh, oppa!

29
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,741
Eul was waiting for you,
and she left a while ago.

30
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,811
I didn't come for Eul.
I came to see you.

31
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:08,084
Me? You should've told me! I
haven't even washed my hair today.

32
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,623
What's this now?

33
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,995
$1, $10, $100, $1000...

34
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,890
You don't have to bring me this kind of money. I
would like you even if you were a poor homeless man.

35
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,772
Please keep this money and use
it as payment for Eul's meals.

36
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,009
-What? What are you...
-I won't be coming here again.

37
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,880
I won't be seeing Eul again either.

38
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,282
I think a minute's long passed.

39
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:54,591
One more minute.

40
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,129
When did you arrive?

41
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,765
Just now.

42
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:42,605
Do you know what time it is? What is it?
Did something happen?

43
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,939
Are you going to stay
like this all night?

44
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,277
-Then I'd be ecstatic.
-Oh, man...

45
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,785
Tell me again what you
said over the phone.

46
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,357
Well...

47
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:46,903
When I said I'd trust you this once,
it doesn't really mean that I trust in you.

48
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,344
So... you're the person who
puts food on my table.

49
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:58,748
It'll be my loss if I don't believe
the person who puts food on my table.

50
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:04,354
-Why do you keep on smiling?
-Because you're pretty.

51
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,360
You're even prettier.

52
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,430
You're so pretty I could die.

53
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,069
-If I kiss you, you'll hit me right?
-I'll kill you.

54
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,208
You pervert...

55
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,512
See you tomorrow, No Eul.

56
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,083
Let's see the day after,
too, and the following day!

57
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,120
And the day after tomorrow too.

58
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,790
Let's see each other anytime and
anywhere like we are crazy!

59
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,542
Cut! Why is it so loud?

60
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,345
Direct Jo! Are you not
restricting the site?

61
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:42,719
Because of Jun Young and Kim Yoo Na, there are too
many reporters around making noise. I'm sorry.

62
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:44,821
Hold on, excuse me.

63
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,025
Reporter Kim!

64
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,280
Oh, Manager Jang. Let's
make an interview!

65
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,340
Reporter Kim... Once
the filming is done,

66
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,837
I'll get Sin Jun Young and Kim
Yoo Na to make an interview.

67
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,700
So please wait just a little more.

68
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,608
-It's so cold...
-I'm sorry.

69
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,545
And since we're filming,
could you please stay quiet?

70
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,215
Everyone be quiet! We're shooting!

71
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,250
What the heck?

72
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,832
Hey. Hey, hey! What's with the drone?
The drone?

73
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,290
You have come.

74
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,990
-Should we start?
-Go ahead.

75
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,452
Okay, let's start.

76
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:29,926
This is the first official meeting after news came
of you dating. Would you please say a word for us?

77
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,070
I am sorry that you came down
all this way because of us.

78
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,308
We'll continue to cultivate our love.
Thank you.

79
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,813
Sin Jun Young, could you
please say something as well?

80
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:05,061
Although we are
celebrities and public figures,

81
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:14,570
I think we have the rights for basic humanity
and personal rights to be protected as human.

82
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,279
My love being subject
to people's gossip,

83
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,684
and the person I like...

84
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,993
is being hated and rip to shreds by people
when she hasn't done anything wrong.

85
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,298
Whether I should stay
at a place like this,

86
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,570
I am seriously confused about it.

87
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,960
Hey, what does he mean
by saying all that?

88
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,330
Let's continue listening.

89
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,349
The interview about my
dating will end here.

90
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,853
From now on, I won't be doing
any type of interviews anymore.

91
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,456
If you still do want to see me around
as the celebrity Sin Jun Young,

92
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,527
then I ask you all to refrain
yourselves from too much curiosity.

93
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,065
What was that?

94
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,167
Jun Young! Jun Young!

95
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,675
No Eul PD!

96
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,615
Would you please say a word about you becoming
national gold digger because of Sin Jun Young?

97
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,383
Please say something.

98
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,189
I have nothing to say.

99
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,759
Isn't Kim Yoo Na really being
used as a kind of shield?

100
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:53,800
Jun Young, agrees with his agency's strategy,
he deceived the public once again to protect you.

101
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,620
Reporter, aren't you being
too harsh with your words?

102
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,308
Did I guess wrong?

103
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:08,400
Yes, you're wrong. I like someone else
who is much better than Sin Jun Young.

104
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,019
Do you expect for me to believe that?

105
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:14,670
Sin Jun Young might be the top
star, but he's not my type.

106
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,794
Just for your information, I
am a big fan of Seo Yeon Woo.

107
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,503
What the heck?

108
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,685
Why did I mention Seo Yeon Woo?

109
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,521
You stab because you
were perplexed, idiot?

110
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,429
So you're a fan of Seo Yeon Woo?

111
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,433
He's such a crazy casanova.

112
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,400
Get out, hurry! What if people see us?

113
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,350
If I'm not your type,
then what is your type?

114
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,640
I told you to get out!

115
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,910
I asked what's your type? I'll try to
adjust myself to match your type, so tell me.

116
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,090
You being like this will
make us get caught really!

117
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,883
Get caught about what? The
fact that I am your type?

118
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,886
-Hey!
-The fact that you like me too?

119
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,064
It's me, No Eul. Sin
Jun Young is in my...

120
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,832
Hey!

121
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:32,701
Hello?

122
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,772
What's wrong with this... Hello?

123
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,911
From now on, whatever happens
to me is because of you.

124
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,145
What?

125
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,123
Are you an elementary school student...

126
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,417
-Should I help you?
-I don't know what ring I should by for a woman.

127
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,520
If you tell me the occasion, and
I'll make some recommendation.

128
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,757
Present for my mother, who is getting discharged.
Would you please make some recommendation?

129
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:35,898
Yeah?

130
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,699
They say you should trust no one, but
who knew that punk would swindle me?

131
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,040
That punk and I have been
friends for 50-years now.

132
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:18,007
I understand it hasn't been a month since
we last send you money, Brother-in-law.

133
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,380
You'll hurt my feeling
if you say it like that.

134
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,690
Today, I'm not here
because of money at all.

135
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,610
I was just curious about how Hyeon Joon, you,
my nephew and niece are doing in their lives.

136
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,792
I was going to sever our brothers relationship
seeing what Hyeon Joon did before.

137
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,220
His own nephew got drunk and
beat up a person by accident,

138
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,801
he could just make a call to the police
commissioner to end it but he ignored it instead!

139
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:51,040
-My Seop had to serve whopping one month...
-Times have changed, Brother-in-law.

140
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,800
What if the information got leaked that an
assemblyman pressured the police commissioner?

141
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,714
Aigoo, is that right?

142
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,790
There's nothing you don't know!

143
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,989
I couldn't think that far ahead
because I am an ignorant punk.

144
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,598
This is why people should
converse with their own kind.

145
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,810
Jun Young's mother matched
my ignorant level, though.

146
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,510
-Why bring that person into the discussion again?
-Because I'm feeling sorry.

147
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,650
To a person who was carrying Hyeon Joon's child...
To a person who was that pretty and nice...

148
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,970
Because it's bothering me how I got money
from you and kicked her out myself.

149
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,586
I think you've had too much to
drink, Brother-in-law.

150
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:38,687
I'm fine.

151
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,791
I only had half a bottle of soju.

152
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,263
I'm sorry. I forgot I
had an appointment.

153
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,065
Take your time finishing
your meal and go back.

154
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,207
Does she think I'm a beggar?

155
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,620
Oh, my poor Hyeon Joon.

156
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:07,690
His son is a famous star and he doesn't even
know it, even when he's right in front of him.

157
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,570
And to the child who isn't his own...

158
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,589
-Aigoo my child. My son...
-Brother-in-law!

159
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,190
Why are you screaming?

160
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,273
Secretary Kim, transfer $300,000 to my
brother-in-law's account by tomorrow morning.

161
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,642
You must not let the
Assemblyman know about this...

162
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,532
Don't do that, Secretary Kim.

163
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,768
-Ji Tae.
-If you send as much as a cent to my uncle.

164
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,072
I won't let it slide.

165
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,081
How much do you know?

166
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,885
Everything.

167
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,822
As much as you know... everything.

168
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,058
Even about...

169
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,027
Sin Jun Young's true identity.

170
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,737
Tell Dad everything.

171
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,175
Tell him all about how my uncle

172
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,712
has blackmailed and frightened you.

173
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,983
-Tell him everything.
-No.

174
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,280
Your dad will leave me if I do.

175
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,056
-Mother...
-I was the first to like him.

176
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,659
Your dad...

177
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,663
I liked him before Sin Young Ok did.

178
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,134
I made your father into what he is now.
I did everything.

179
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,238
If your father kept meeting
that woman, Sin Young Ok,

180
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,010
he probably would still
be in that mud pile.

181
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,712
Yes, probably.

182
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,018
That's why he will understand,
whatever you'd be telling him.

183
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,488
-So just say it...
-Then he'll go to Sin Young Ok.

184
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,826
He still misses her so much he
even sees her in his dreams.

185
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,929
If he finds out he has a son with her...

186
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,031
he'll definitely go to themp.

187
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,232
I, too,

188
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,803
am Dad's son, mother.

189
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,344
Even if it's not his blood
that runs through my veins,

190
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,447
I am Choi Hyeon Joon's son, too!

191
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,310
-Good afternoon!
-Have you had lunch yet?

192
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,265
Sure, how could I have not eaten by now?

193
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,668
Why are you calling me at this hour?
Aren't you busy?

194
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,238
I love you, Father.

195
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,976
I love you.

196
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,015
Even if you're being like this, I still can't
give you Greg Norman's autographed ball.

197
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,423
I found a nice bar. Would you like to have a
drink with me there? Mom doesn't need to know.

198
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,627
Sure! I was feeling like
having a drink anyway.

199
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,396
My son's the best indeed.

200
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,733
-Call me when you finish work.
-I love you, son.

201
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,232
I am going to tell Dad everything.
We are family anyway.

202
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,534
How much longer do you want to
deceive him and be blackmailed?

203
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,407
Father will not leave you.

204
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,776
Even your real dad left me.

205
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,348
He left me and his son without looking
back to go to some other woman he liked.

206
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,585
Your father will leave me too.

207
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,789
As he despises me and hates me...

208
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,491
It won't be like that.

209
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,227
Just 3 months.

210
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,620
I'll figure something out, so
give me just 3 months, Ji Tae.

211
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,066
Why do you need 3 months?

212
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,735
Please don't hide another day more.

213
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,900
-Come clean as soon as possible and...
-After 3 months,

214
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,308
Sin Jun Young, that punk will
no longer be in this world...

215
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,346
What...

216
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,916
What do you mean?

217
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,452
Mother!

218
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,091
Sin Jun Young is sick.

219
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,033
Have you thought about your bucket list?

220
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,202
Yes.

221
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,240
Then can you tell me at least
one thing that's on it?

222
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,143
From the person who asks
me that question now,

223
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,246
hearing her confession
saying "You are my type."

224
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,583
I will edit out what you just said.

225
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,852
I'm asking you again.

226
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,790
-One thing from Sin Jun Young's bucket list...
-From the woman I see in front of me,

227
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,559
hearing her confession
saying "I love you."

228
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,198
I told you to stop fooling around.

229
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,701
I'm not kidding.

230
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,973
You didn't wash your
hair today, did you?

231
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,942
How can you come see the guy you like
without even washing your hair?

232
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:42,177
-I did wash my hair!

233
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,914
Oh. So you like me, then.

234
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,216
You even washed your
hair to look good to me.

235
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,852
This guy, really...

236
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,326
I actually didn't wash it. It's really
greasy and it also smells awful.

237
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,196
Do you want to smell it? It's no joke.

238
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,569
Oh, I didn't shower for the past week, either.
That must be why I'm feeling so itchy.

239
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,373
I can even fart in front of you.

240
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,246
Jun Young! You need to be on
standby for the photoshoot.

241
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,049
-Come with us, PD No.
-I need to go back to Seoul.

242
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,688
Mr. Sin keeps saying weird things and not in a good
condition, so I don't have much to shoot anyway.

243
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:36,665
Why is Jun Young acting like that?
Is he upset?

244
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,730
Wow, how elementary...

245
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,504
What do you mean elementary
to a Korean big star?

246
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,741
It's more like middle schooler...
I am off first.

247
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,325
Yes, that's good. A bit more warmly now.

248
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,064
Wow, you really suit each other.

249
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,333
It's nice.

250
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,836
Seems like we really do suit each other.

251
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,240
Should we just date?

252
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,746
What's your relationship to PD No Eul?

253
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:32,053
I know you have some peculiar tastes,
but isn't she a bit too much?

254
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,210
Doesn't it hurt your top star pride?

255
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,327
Now, lean on each other as
if you're whispering love.

256
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,399
Shut up and let's just
take the pictures.

257
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,102
What does she have that I don't?

258
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:52,174
Why do you make me feel like crap?

259
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,342
Didn't you start it first?

260
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:55,360
Ah, that's good.

261
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,680
You even did an interview
for CEO Namgoong's scheme.

262
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,349
Yes, that's good.

263
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,386
You just take what you want.

264
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,723
I am just grateful that
you let me protect Eul.

265
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:14,896
Wait a minute! Let's take a short break.

266
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,331
Yes, let's do that.

267
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,880
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait a minute! PD,
roll the windows down. Quickly! Quickly!

268
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,090
What is it, all of a sudden?

269
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,324
Aigoo, what do I do? Jun Young
got hurt just a while ago.

270
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:18,827
Why?

271
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:24,199
Aigoo! He fell down while filming. Ah, if
our Jun Young is hurt, it's a big problem!

272
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,603
-Where is Sin Joo Young right now?
-At the hospital.

273
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,180
Just over there, a manager
is waiting in the van.

274
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:38,480
I have things to sort out here,
so please go to Jun Young first.

275
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,982
-Yes.
-Go, quickly.

276
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:50,492
Take her safely, okay?
Don't speed to much!

277
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,794
Go!

278
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,418
Is Sin Jun Young really badly hurt?

279
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,019
Ah, yes.

280
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,370
How badly?

281
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,863
I'm not certain, but I heard
it's a life and death situation.

282
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,299
Ridiculous.

283
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,860
Why are you stopping?

284
00:32:52,921 --> 00:32:55,880
There's a coffee shop that way,
so I'm going to buy some coffee.

285
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:00,395
You! Are you in your right mind or not?

286
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:06,134
Jun Young is in a life or death situation
right now, and you're stopping to buy coffee?

287
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,610
It'll only take 5 minutes.

288
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:15,443
5-minutes my butt. Get going right now! I have
to get to Jun Young and say something to him.

289
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:18,113
Get moving quickly, I said!

290
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,750
I said it will only take 5 minutes.
I'll be right back.

291
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,784
What the heck kind of a jerk are you?

292
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,950
You get off right now! I'll drive!

293
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,633
Just give me the hospital
address and get off!

294
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,804
I said get out you jerk! Get out!

295
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,989
Why do you have to cry? Were
you that worried about me?

296
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:11,533
What is it that you wanted to say? Did you want to
share your feeling because you heard I was dying?

297
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,840
-You punk.
-Hey!

298
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,817
That wasn't a 100% lie. I
got a knot on my head.

299
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,886
I'm serious.

300
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,824
So do you pretend like
you don't like me?

301
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,562
Why do you act otherwise when you are
really concerned about me and like me?

302
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,201
You fell over again.

303
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,003
How can you fall so often?

304
00:34:57,645 --> 00:34:58,680
Did you hurt your leg?

305
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,616
Hey.

306
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,454
-You...
-What?

307
00:35:09,424 --> 00:35:10,592
What is this?

308
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,600
That stings. Ah I cut my
face and even got a bruise.

309
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,605
Inside my mouth is cut, too.

310
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,712
I feel like I can't move my
shoulder properly either.

311
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:37,385
I wanted to go on a date with you before
going to the hospital. It's all ruined.

312
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,521
That place really has awesome coffee.

313
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:05,013
That's right. You're my type.
Are you satisfied?

314
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:13,421
That's right. I like you! I
asked if you are satisfied?

315
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,425
Crazy jerk.

316
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:23,498
You're hurt like this and
you want to go on a date?

317
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,237
Date my butt. Coffee my butt!

318
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,888
Dad, you're going to the
K-Festival today, right?

319
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,992
Can't I go there with you?

320
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,531
Ah, Dad! Me too, me too.

321
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:36,371
Ahjussi, let me get out for a bit.

322
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,610
You... you were a high schooler?

323
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,630
-Yeah.
-Wow!

324
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,080
This jerk, still with soft spot on your head,
was deceiving me then? I should just...

325
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,452
I didn't deceive you. Did you ask
me if I was a high schooler?

326
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,730
By the way... do you have money?

327
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:04,399
Why? Are you trying to rip me off now,
too? And by the way, I'm older than you.

328
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:09,137
How dare you young punk... You
better address me properly!

329
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,073
Eat slowly or you'll get indigestion.

330
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,842
Was he starving for days?

331
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:19,370
I don't know. He's not my cat.
Somebody must have abandoned him.

332
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,051
Really? How pitiful.

333
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:28,890
What, what, what?

334
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:33,161
Take care of him for me. I have to go to school right
now, so just until I finish school, can you...

335
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,310
I mean can Noona, look after him?

336
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,801
I don't want to! Why would you leave
a cat that was abandoned, to me?

337
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,440
Because people with pretty
faces are also kind.

338
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,910
Shut up! Stop singing that nonsense.

339
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,631
Yes.

340
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,037
Ahjumma, there's a big
problem, Jun Young,

341
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:19,330
Jun Young... Just, just
come with me for now.

342
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,610
Hey! Hurry up and get Ahjumma...
her jacket.

343
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,900
-What? What is it?
-Just come for now.

344
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,580
-Put that down.
-What are you like this?

345
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,990
Why have we come here? You said Jun Young
is injured so we should go to a hospital.

346
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,691
I... I actually called
the doctor to come here.

347
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,929
Ahjumma, quickly. It's urgent.

348
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,812
I knew you'd be like this.
I knew it! You conman.

349
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,618
This isn't my idea.
It's Jun Young's idea.

350
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,255
It seems that your son
enjoyed fooling PD No Eul.

351
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:09,223
Move. Aren't you moving?

352
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,590
What are you doing? Let go!

353
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,931
Hold on to mom.

354
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,767
These kids, seriously...

355
00:40:22,203 --> 00:40:24,972
The Minister of culture, sports and tourism
is giving you an award today, I hear.

356
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:30,678
It's a prize I'm giving to the amazing
mother who raised a Hallyu star.

357
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,214
What? What?

358
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,117
Why aren't you clapping Manager?

359
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,752
Congratulations.

360
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,789
What do we do? Your
beauty is so superior,

361
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,492
that there isn't a piece of clothing
that doesn't match you. I can't pick.

362
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,970
Just wrap all of this please.

363
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,161
Yes, I understand.

364
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,932
No, I'm not going to buy
it, so don't wrap it.

365
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,301
No, please just wrap it.

366
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,005
Because I let it pass several times,

367
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,310
I think you're mistaking that
we've gotten closer or something.

368
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,344
They said that politicians and
their families are attending too.

369
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,714
The minister couples and
Assemblymen couples will be there.

370
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,950
I think they said Choi Hyeon Joon
was attending too, right hyung?

371
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,521
Yes, you're correct.

372
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:19,340
They say in Africa they sing my songs and people
in Brazil shed tears while watching my dramas.

373
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,428
I think this is enough

374
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,030
for you to be proud of
your son, am I wrong?

375
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,130
How is it?

376
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,309
Wow, they said clothes are like wings.

377
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:39,410
Are you really my twin
brother Jeong Sik?

378
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,449
I think you'll be fine if you
just suck in your stomach, Dad.

379
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,220
-Is it good now?
-It's good.

380
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,321
But is our manager going
to be on television too?

381
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:48,780
I don't know about that.

382
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,030
Seeing how Jun Young took his
mother and also sent you a tuxedo,

383
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,865
don't you think he probably
thinks of you as her father?

384
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,470
What kind of nonsense is that?

385
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,472
That kid is doing that because just
his mom alone would be awkward.

386
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,075
So he invited me to make
things look better.

387
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,630
My visuals are pretty good.

388
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,649
Dad, I'll pretend to be a reporter
and ask questions, so answer them.

389
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,800
Ah, I heard that you have known

390
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,156
Sin Jun Young and his
mother for a long time.

391
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,760
Could you say something about
Sin Jun Young's mother?

392
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,660
If I were to tell you about
our Jun Young's mother,

393
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,730
I can say that she is
like Mencius's mother.

394
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:40,508
In order to make Jun
Young a national star,

395
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:43,210
so...

396
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,249
-What do you think she did?
-She did nothing.

397
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,920
Let's be real. She just said he wasn't her
son and cursed at him and nagged him.

398
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:54,120
Excuse me? Could you give
more radish kimchi please?

399
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:54,922
Yes!

400
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,594
But why is she still not here?

401
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,715
What is he saying? Why can't I hear?

402
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,204
I don't think it's an audio problem.

403
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,740
What's the problem then?

404
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,444
Why are you still in the editing room?

405
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,380
I'm an editor so I'm in the editing
room. Where else would I be?

406
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,900
Are you not going to the K-Festival?

407
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,184
I was told not to go there.
Jeong Sik called me yesterday.

408
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,770
What are you saying? Jun Young's mother is
getting an award from a minister, wouldn't you go?

409
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,391
Get there quickly. I am sure you
can get a lot of shots there.

410
00:44:37,725 --> 00:44:41,495
Even so, he said not
to come several times.

411
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:46,890
Are we promotional video filmers
who have to do everything they say?

412
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,935
Hurry and go!

413
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:59,080
At least brush your teeth
before you go, as a human.

414
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:37,972
Yeah, Jik?

415
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:39,473
When are you coming, noona?

416
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,610
I suddenly had an urgent filming,
so I think I'll be late.

417
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,420
Is something up?

418
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:47,481
No, just... Are you going
to be really late?

419
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,953
All right. Make sure to eat
your meals while you work.

420
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:54,922
Hello?

421
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,524
Did you forgot what today was?

422
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,159
What day is it?

423
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,665
It's not our Jik's birthday
or your birthday, Na Ri.

424
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:07,401
It's your father's death
anniversary, you stupid!

425
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,642
What nation-saving job you doing that you forget
your father's death anniversary, you witch!

426
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,579
Give it to me, noona.

427
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:24,490
Dad knows you're busy too,
so he'll understand it all.

428
00:48:24,585 --> 00:48:26,353
Don't worry and work.

429
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,927
Yeah, if you want to make a living and eat,
would your father's anniversary be important?

430
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:36,610
We'll take care of things here,
so don't worry too much.

431
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,566
Just make some time to
quickly visit, okay?

432
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,336
Hello?

433
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:44,972
Hello? Eul, can you hear me?

434
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,007
What the...

435
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,076
Did it end?

436
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,954
Oh well...

437
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,622
You have to do it alone at least.

438
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:05,120
It's fine. I can do it alone.

439
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,094
Aigoo my proud child...

440
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:12,199
How are you so different from your sister
when you both came from the same stomach?

441
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,176
Are you waiting for a call or something?

442
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:23,940
Why do you keep staring at
your phone since before?

443
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,145
Hyun Woo hyung...

444
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:27,281
That's right...

445
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:30,117
Why isn't Hyun Woo oppa calling us?

446
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:34,350
He always brought alcohol on your father's
memorial day every year. Give him a call.

447
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:36,023
It says the number does not exist.

448
00:49:36,824 --> 00:49:39,026
I kept calling Hyun Woo hyung,

449
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,295
but it keeps saying the
number does not exist.

450
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,133
You don't think something happened
to Hyun Woo hyung, right?

451
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,247
Why did you bring Ha Roo too?

452
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:38,218
Dad said I was studying
way too hard, and

453
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:44,024
that I should get some fresh air. And eat
lots of good food to replenish my body,

454
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:47,194
and relieve some stress
while watching celebrities.

455
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,996
Isn't it, dad?

456
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,898
Ha Roo's right.

457
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:54,435
Spend some time with Ha Roo today,
Mrs. Ha Roo's mom.

458
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,737
-Celebrities will be there too?
-Yes.

459
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:58,572
Did I forget to tell you?

460
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,508
Like who?

461
00:51:01,508 --> 00:51:04,378
Mom, how can you expect to
know them if you don't even watch TV?

462
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:10,184
They're mostly people I don't know..It's
because I don't watch TV very often.

463
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,457
Is Sin Jun Young coming today?

464
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,630
You know Sin Jun Young?

465
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,496
Come on, dad! If she didn't
know him she'd be a spy...

466
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,832
or so they say.

467
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,336
-That's why some people call me a spy these days...
-Sin Jun Young's coming?

468
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,705
No...

469
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,741
He's at a concert overseas, so no.

470
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:38,145
I have a friend who's
obsessed with him, so...

471
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,913
That's what I heard from her.

472
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,620
Why? Are you his fan too?

473
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:49,790
No, it's just that I thought it might
be nice to see him in person. Too bad.

474
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,730
Drive Ha Roo back home and
you're done for today.

475
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,482
Mom!

476
00:52:15,482 --> 00:52:18,018
Why? We've come all the way
here. Let's go inside together.

477
00:52:18,418 --> 00:52:22,189
Didn't you say that many important people
like Vice-minister Jang are coming tonight?

478
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:26,530
What will they say if they saw someone like her,
who is supposed to be busy with exams?

479
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,329
-Why should we care about that?
-That's what I thought!

480
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,500
Choi Ha Roo. Follow the man.

481
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:35,802
I don't want to. I can't go
without seeing Jun Young's face.

482
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,606
Oh, oh no Na Bi! Na
Bi, stop right there!

483
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,210
Let's go.

484
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,846
Ha Roo! Leave the cat
alone and come here!

485
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,849
So Sin Jun Young is here?

486
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,451
Yeah, seems like it.

487
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,587
So why did you lie to me that he wasn't?

488
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,791
Well... I was afraid you'd send
Ha Roo back home if you knew.

489
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,398
You know that she's Jun Young's
diehard fan, don't you?

490
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:11,371
As Ha Roo said, she'll be too busy staring at him
to cause trouble, so let's be thankful he's here.

491
00:53:14,474 --> 00:53:16,410
Come on. Let's go.

492
00:53:35,395 --> 00:53:37,831
Dad, I'm sorry.

493
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,511
Go away now.

494
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,682
Go away while I'm being nice.

495
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,788
Hey! Those were so valuable.

496
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,491
How dare you steal someone else's food?

497
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,499
Huh? It's the gold digger.

498
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,003
Is that your cat?

499
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:18,505
What's this?

500
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:22,209
-How on Earth did you train your cat that...
-I'll pay for this.

501
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,079
I just have to pay for this, right? This
stupid thing doesn't cost much anyway.

502
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,015
"This stupid thing?"

503
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,685
Here you go. It's enough, right?

504
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,590
Seriously now!

505
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,259
-Why did you hit me?
-How old are you?

506
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,528
Where did you learn to
be this disrespectful?

507
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,998
Didn't your parents teach you to
apologize when you do something wrong?

508
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:46,867
Ha Roo!

509
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:49,403
Dad!

510
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,344
That woman hit me.

511
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,482
Did my daughter wrong you in any way?

512
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,989
Did I wrong you in any way?

513
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,338
What is it?

514
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,873
What did you do to her?

515
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,842
I didn't do nothing.

516
00:55:29,543 --> 00:55:32,045
I was just passing by and
she suddenly hit me.

517
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,051
Did you hit my daughter?

518
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,590
Don't... you remember me?

519
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,693
Do you know me?

520
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,463
That girl's a total gold digger.

521
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:54,020
I don't know what she
did to my Jun Young.

522
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,203
She got rejected before even
having the chance to try anything.

523
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,415
Did my daughter do this?

524
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:12,285
It wasn't me, it was the cat.

525
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,922
What does the cat know? It
didn't do this on purpose.

526
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,926
It's my father's memorial day today.

527
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,595
Oh...

528
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,047
It's not like the cat did this on purpose,
so don't be mad. And buy it again with this.

529
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,870
Gosh, why are you giving her
50 thousand won?

530
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,685
-This barely costs 3000 won!
-Ha Roo!

531
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,430
Please receive it.

532
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:58,398
Apologize first.

533
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:29,396
Forget this money and apologize first.

534
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,260
You want me to kiss you, don't you?

535
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:21,882
Okay!

536
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:24,710
We need to settle this now.

537
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,188
-Jun Young!
-You're not missing some show program here.

538
00:58:28,188 --> 00:58:30,810
-Move.
-Did you forget how you climbed up to this place?

539
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,210
Get a grip, Jun Young!

540
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,896
-Open!
-Why did you do this.

541
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,932
You did this 3 years ago
too, do you remember mother?

542
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,571
Everything changed after Chief
Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Joon got involved.

543
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,006
Eul...

544
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,160
What happened to that man? The
one I hit with my car back then.

545
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,381
I'm so sorry, Eul.

546
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:57,284
I'm so sorry...

547
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:00,287
Is anyone here? Can anyone come here?!

548
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,055
Please!
