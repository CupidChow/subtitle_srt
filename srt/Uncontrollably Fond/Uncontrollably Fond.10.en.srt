00:00:02,034 --> 00:00:06,072
=Episode 10=

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,367
Still, try to convince her
one last time please.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,436
What did he say?

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,274
He said she won't come whether it's a Minister
prize or even the Minister's grand prize.

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,560
Did you explain what
kind of event this is?

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,046
Of course, I did!

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:34,520
It's an event that ministers and members
of the Assembly attend not to be taken lightly.

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,187
I explained that if Jun
Young's mother does not come,

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,191
you, Sir, might hang yourself and die.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,529
Will you just use this
chance and get a new mother?

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,666
I will introduce you to a mother who would do
anything for her son to be Sin Jun Young.

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,440
Go and buy me a calming pill.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,477
And call my home, and tell someone
to bring me my blood pressure pills.

14
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,447
Didn't you say that PD No
Eul is not coming tonight?

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,270
Yeah. Jun Young told me not
to let her come tonight.

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,086
She came though. Way over
there, with her camera.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,023
Where is No Eul?

18
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,274
Do you... not remember me?

19
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,580
Do you know me?

20
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,416
That girl is a gold digger.
A gold digger.

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,520
She tried to do something
with my Jun Young Oppa,

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,022
-and she got rejected before even trying anything.
-Ha Roo.

23
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,933
Did my child cause this?

24
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,737
No. It's not me, but this kitty.

25
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,441
What does a cat know?
It's a cat for a reason.

26
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,278
Today is my father's memorial day.

27
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,281
Oh, no.

28
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,087
Here.

29
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,195
It isn't like the cat meant to cause any trouble,
so don't get mad. And buy this again with this.

30
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,620
Why are you giving her
$50, this barely costs $3!

31
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,399
Ha Roo!

32
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:36,773
Here.

33
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,842
Accept this, hurry.

34
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,911
Why don't you apologize, first.

35
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,475
Not with this kind of trashy money.
First, apologize.

36
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,589
Before that, I think I should get
an apology from Sin Jun Young.

37
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,661
I don't know who you
are to this girl, but

38
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,033
where did you learn to rudely
interrupt other people's business?

39
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,104
Did your parents teach you so?

40
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,674
All I have done is tell you

41
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,245
to acknowledge what you have done
wrong, and apologize for what you did.

42
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,783
Because of what a little
street cat has caused,

43
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,921
-what are you telling me to do?
-Your actions...

44
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,926
-Acknowledge your fault and apologize for...
-I misjudged you.

45
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,132
I didn't know you were this kind of trashy
human being, and I was waiting for you.

46
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,607
Weirdly, I kept thinking that someday you
would come visit me at the law office.

47
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,677
And because of that, I wasn't
able to get rid of that office.

48
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,414
I didn't know you got this
ruined in the meantime.

49
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,855
Although the hierarchy and morals
have collapsed in society,

50
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,192
I am old enough to be your father!

51
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,530
I don't know how high the place of a top
celebrity stands in this nation, but

52
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,968
before being a star, first
mind your manners, and

53
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,705
then next time you can ask for an
apology or whatever it is you want.

54
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,408
Let's go, Ha Roo.

55
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,076
Dad...

56
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,584
I told you not to come here.
Why won't you listen to me?

57
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,759
What are you doing?

58
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,595
Why are you picking that up?

59
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,864
-Then should I throw away money?
-Trash it!

60
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,637
Gosh, I should have told him to give me
more. I should have asked for $1000 more.

61
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,247
Hey! Why rip money?

62
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,320
Don't pick it up. I told you not
to pick it up! Are you a beggar?

63
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,390
Yeah, that's right. I'm a beggar.
Didn't you know?

64
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,710
Don't bother with other
people's business.

65
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,515
Other people?

66
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,793
Jun Young, what are you doing here?
The director is looking for you.

67
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,606
Let's go together!

68
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,721
The director will receive the
award instead of Ahjumma.

69
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,123
No, it's that...

70
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,827
It's that these guys kept on saying
that your mother gave birth to you, but

71
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,630
that it is the director who raised you.

72
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,599
-I've never said such a thing.
-Neither have I.

73
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,337
Right, you didn't say that.
Gosh, who was that?

74
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,907
Right, the makeup team said so.

75
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,480
Manager Jung! Do my makeup, won't you?

76
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,977
Hyung can I have my phone?

77
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,113
Just use my phone.

78
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,659
I told you that I wasn't coming.
Don't you have better things to do?

79
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,261
Hey, hurry up. Hurry.

80
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,101
Hang up. Just try calling again.

81
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,304
What have I done so terribly wrong?

82
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,708
I said, what have I done wrong?

83
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,315
Is it so terrible that I didn't become the
prosecutor that you wanted me to be?

84
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,018
For over five years, you've hated me,

85
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,756
and you told me that I wasn't your son.
Did I really deserve that?

86
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,930
Mom, the prosecutors that I know

87
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,634
tell the truth at any moment, and

88
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:07,237
punish the bad people,

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,907
and save the innocent ones. But!

90
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,978
I'm not that kind of person.

91
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,115
I told you hundreds of times, that
I'm not qualified to be like that!

92
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,551
That I was screwed from the very start.

93
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:26,990
If a jerk like me becomes
a prosecutor, Mom,

94
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:32,295
people like you who have
no power or backers

95
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,765
cannot live in this country.

96
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:45,170
Why aren't you qualified for that?

97
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,260
Why were you screwed from the beginning?

98
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,482
Long ago, you helped weak girls bothered
by boys, and you even got suspended.

99
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,522
Why?

100
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,397
Is this because I worked
at a bar long ago?

101
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:12,835
Because I stole a piece
of pork, back then?

102
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,511
Just tell them that I worked at a bar because
I didn't have any other means of living.

103
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,648
Tell them that I gave that
piece of pork back, too!

104
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,486
Right. Just don't come, Mom.

105
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,558
I'll tell them that you
won't accept your award.

106
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,896
Why reject such a prize?

107
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,004
Why are you getting undressed,
we have to get going soon.

108
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,874
-Oppa!
-Jun Young!

109
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,247
Jun Young! Jun Young! Where
are you going, you brat?

110
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,548
Move.

111
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,290
Are you out of your mind? The
program starts in 10 minutes.

112
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,587
I told you I wouldn't do it.

113
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,010
This time, it's not like not showing up for
a TV program. It's not like that at all.

114
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,620
You do know for sure who
are coming here today.

115
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,629
There are ministers and there are
deputies and congressmen.

116
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,465
Aren't you moving?

117
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,970
Oppa, Oppa! We got a big problem.
The CEO has fainted.

118
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,872
What?

119
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,275
Take the CEO to the
hospital for a check-up.

120
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,211
You brat!

121
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,644
Are you tired?

122
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,183
I'm sorry. I was fine earlier...
What's happening?

123
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,754
I shouldn't have uselessly brought you
here, you are still feeling too weak.

124
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,389
Are you okay?

125
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,530
We're going home so go get the car.

126
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,593
Yes, Sir.

127
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,978
Eul!

128
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,386
You were scared in the car, right?

129
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,950
Please drive the Madam back safely.

130
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,588
Yes.

131
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,058
You're not coming?

132
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,662
If we all left now, it would look strange.
It's an official event after all.

133
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,532
I'll follow up soon, so you go first.

134
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,602
Okay then.

135
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,839
Ha Roo, take care of your mom.

136
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,211
That child is seriously... Choi Ha Roo!

137
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,013
I'll be going.

138
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,916
Don't think about anything
too much and rest a lot.

139
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,869
I think the position might be too much for me to
handle, but thanks to you, Assemblyman Kim...

140
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,238
It's just that you do
praise me too highly.

141
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,310
Of course, I will buy you
some drinks for sure.

142
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,631
The 59th place.

143
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,005
So you're saying that you made 59th
place out of the entire school?

144
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:02,011
Let me see. In the last exam you
took, you came in 138th place.

145
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,014
Just how steps have you jumped over?

146
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,080
It's nothing. I just haven't
put my effort into studying.

147
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,157
But once I made up my mind, the
study was the easiest thing to do.

148
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,696
-Dad, Dad, Dad! I want to eat Tangsuyuk.
-That's right. That's right.

149
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,502
Today, your dad will buy you anything
you like. Just say it, say it.

150
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,880
Manager, please get us a portion of
Tangsuyuk here. Just a small portion.

151
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,441
Don't order Tangsuyuk, Dad!

152
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,612
Do you really want to eat sweet and
sour pork bad enough to deceive Father?

153
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,546
Hey.

154
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,683
What is he saying?

155
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,780
She's lying to you. She's not at 59th place.
She actually came in at 159th place in school.

156
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,723
She scratched off 1 with a knife...

157
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,120
What nonsense are you babbling?

158
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,000
It's true!

159
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,362
-Hey, No Jik!
-Hey, No Eul!

160
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,403
-Come here.
-Geez...

161
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,010
Come here! How dare you hide
your rank and trick your father?

162
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,920
You, you, you. Just what are
planning to be when you grow up?

163
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,160
Dad! I was wrong! I won't do it again!!

164
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,256
Dad! I love you. Dad!

165
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,049
Stop right there!

166
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,340
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...

167
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:56,280
It's not him. It wasn't this ahjussi. It was a
woman who caused my father's hit and run accident.

168
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,070
A red sports car with the
license Seoul 3-Ga-3216!

169
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,664
I'm sorry, I did something terrible!

170
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,868
When Prosecutor Choi Hyeon Joon intervened
that night, everything changed.

171
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,637
The criminal changed, the car changed.

172
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,942
The witness testimony changed and the
prosecutor in charge was also changed.

173
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,048
Choi Hyeon Joon... Who is that person?

174
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,102
It's like hitting a boulder with eggs.
This isn't a fight we can win.

175
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,390
No Eul.

176
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,669
Just shut your mouth and settle the case
quietly and live your life like you are dead.

177
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,601
Are you alright?

178
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,914
Is there a doctor? Is there no doctor? Doctor!

179
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,416
I said is there no doctor? A doctor!

180
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,840
Is there no doctor?

181
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,890
Lower the volume, Ha Roo.

182
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,864
Driver Park!

183
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,602
-Your mom isn't feeling well now.
-I don't feel well either.

184
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,570
I'm feeling worse than my mom.

185
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,507
Do you know what Dad
said to Oppa Jun Young?

186
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,376
How can I ever look at Oppa
Jun Young's face again?

187
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,350
Hello?

188
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,559
Ha Roo, Mom's on the phone.

189
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,630
Yes, talk. What?

190
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,702
Are you not going to stop the music?

191
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,307
Turn off the music.

192
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,850
Say it again. What happened then what?

193
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,253
Sin Jun Young saved the assemblyman

194
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,489
when he was almost hit by a car.

195
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,185
Why do you think she did that?

196
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,855
-What?
-That young woman...

197
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,226
Why did she try to hit me with a car?

198
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,931
Was that something to make
such a big deal over?

199
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,768
The police will investigate it soon.

200
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,705
No, there's no need to make
that big of a deal over it.

201
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,675
She seemed younger than our Ji Tae.

202
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,379
Let's just cover it up.

203
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,949
-Assemblyman.
-Tell that to the police too.

204
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,052
To take care of it as a
simple car accident.

205
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,592
I understand. Also, I sent a thank
you message to Sin Jun Young.

206
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,497
If it weren't for that friend,
it would have been worse.

207
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,910
Thankfully it's not a broken, but I think
your shoulder has a hairline fracture.

208
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,815
As it swells naturally, you
need to keep it immobile.

209
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,047
I am General Planning Director
Choi Ji Tae of KJ Group.

210
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,751
Thank you for saving my father.

211
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,558
Assemblyman Choi Hyeon
Joon is my father.

212
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,197
Which is why I gave up Eul, too.

213
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,969
Because my dad is Choi Hyeon Joon.

214
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,077
So what do you want me to do?

215
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,450
Sorry, I left you alone.

216
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:44,920
I was wrong.

217
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,526
I was wrong.

218
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,539
I love you, customer!

219
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,576
Noona's still in the editing room.

220
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,413
Who edits for a week
without even sleeping?

221
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,214
Without even being able to come home.

222
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,719
I'll find a job, so
can't you rest a bit?

223
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,658
All right. Send me a photo of
what you've been eating at least.

224
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,829
It's because I'm worried you're just
eating a piece of bread, that's why.

225
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,103
Make sure to send it. Or else I'm going
to go find you in the editing room.

226
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,875
It seriously upsets me.

227
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,846
Give the cat to me.

228
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,790
Did you just speak formally to me?

229
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,453
You said you're older than me.

230
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,689
Where is the cat?

231
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,626
I said where's the cat?

232
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,128
I don't have it.

233
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,604
Did you lose it?

234
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,342
Did you throw it out by chance?

235
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,090
No... That is...

236
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,716
I definitely had it until I went to school,
but during the time I went to buy coffee...

237
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:57,819
-So you threw it out.
-I said I didn't!

238
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,322
I lost it. That's the truth.

239
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,426
But you...

240
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:08,597
Do you know you're really handsome?

241
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,702
Hey!

242
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,642
Let's go on a vacation, Eul.

243
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,932
Let's go to a place where no one
can find us for just a month.

244
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:30,712
I'll prepare for everything, so
you just need to follow my lead.

245
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,422
I'll only look at you and
you only look at me.

246
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,462
Close your ears and eyes to the world.

247
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:04,379
I am sorry, but may I
borrow your makeup?

248
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,382
Thank you.

249
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,469
Don't think about anything.
Don't listen to anyone.

250
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,410
Let's spend a month together like we are
the only two people left in the world.

251
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,200
It fits you perfectly.

252
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:02,637
Our Eul is so pretty.

253
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,476
Let's...

254
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:16,551
not come back after a
month, but after a year.

255
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:21,656
Let's come back after ten years.

256
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,462
I'll be totally ecstatic. Okay!

257
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,032
If I ask for a kiss,
you'll hit me, right?

258
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,234
I'll kill you.

259
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,938
In this situation...

260
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,207
We...

261
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,644
can't end with a kiss.

262
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,379
Stay here. I'll bring the car.

263
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,893
That's better.

264
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:33,755
Miss No Eul?

265
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,625
You are No Eul, right?

266
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,895
I am, but who are you?

267
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,230
Police.

268
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,301
We are arresting you on an attempted
murder charge on Choi Hyeon Joon.

269
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,710
You have the right to remain
silent, obtain an attorney,

270
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,800
and anything you say may be used
against you in the court of law.

271
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,721
Let's go.

272
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,959
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

273
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,194
Jun Young!

274
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,236
Jun Young! Sin Jun Young!

275
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,992
Jun Young.

276
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,919
Eul was taken in by
the police, Attorney.

277
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,359
Please find out where
they have taken her.

278
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,052
It's locked from the outside.

279
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,021
Open it.

280
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:33,500
The CEO made a strict order that you
are not to be out from this point on.

281
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,365
He said it'll be the end of your
career if you cause any more trouble.

282
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:41,780
I am holding your phone, too.

283
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,705
Open it.

284
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,574
Open it before I kill you!!

285
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,340
Hey! I can't open it
even if you kill me.

286
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:56,517
I happen to think the
CEO is right this time!

287
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,920
Just think how you climbed
up to this place!

288
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,540
Are you going to mess it
all up over a woman?

289
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,610
Open it while I'm speaking nicely.

290
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,426
Please get a hold of
yourself, Jun Young!

291
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,395
Hyung Jang Gook!

292
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,399
Open it!

293
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,805
Please open it.

294
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,609
Please open it, Hyung!

295
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,381
Open...

296
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,684
Open it!

297
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,323
Open it!

298
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,465
I have to go.

299
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,056
You haven't even touched it.

300
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,829
Why did you try to kill
Assemblyman Choi Hyeon Joon?

301
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,965
I said why did you try to kill him.

302
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:22,103
Are you really going to
keep your mouth shut?

303
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,891
How is it, Dad?

304
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,901
I'll have to rethink sending
you off to be married.

305
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,410
Why? Is it that unappetizing?

306
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,908
My daughter, you are this pretty,
intelligent, and a great cook.

307
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:05,313
It's suddenly such a waste that I have to send you
off to Choi Gi Tae without anything in return.

308
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,120
I'll come visit often
even when I'm married.

309
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:21,262
In the morning, I will have breakfast with
you. And I'll also have lunch with you.

310
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,900
And... I will have dinner with you.

311
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:29,570
Even if you aren't a politician,
that sweet talk is excessive.

312
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,445
Dad.

313
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:41,883
-What?
-What exactly happened to that ahjussi?

314
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,651
Who?

315
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,455
The ahjussi I hit with my
own car a long time ago.

316
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,592
Why are you asking about
that all of a sudden?

317
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:57,298
Just... Last night, that ahjussi
suddenly came into my dream.

318
00:41:57,899 --> 00:41:59,901
Today, I felt so terrible all day.

319
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,905
He died.

320
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:09,810
That's good.

321
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,583
You said he was in a vegetative
state after the accident.

322
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,356
He seemed poor. If he was still in that state,
he would've been extra baggage to his family.

323
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,426
He would have.

324
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,666
In that case, it would have
been best to leave like that.

325
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,512
But, Dad...

326
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,419
Where is this wine from?
Can't you buy me one?

327
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,824
So I can give it to my father-in-law
and get some brownie points!

328
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,939
What do you mean?

329
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,576
My wife did what?

330
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,390
Oh my. Haven't you killed it yet?

331
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,100
I can't do it. It's looking at me with
its own eyes so how can I kill it?

332
00:43:31,492 --> 00:43:35,000
Oh my, how can you make sushi
when you're acting like that?

333
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,531
Let me do it. Please step aside.

334
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:41,569
Ah! I can't see that. Please take it
with you and do it outside, Ahjumma.

335
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,790
Gi Tae! You're off work already?
You haven't eaten yet, right?

336
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:51,420
Wait just a moment, Madam is going
to make some delicious sushi.

337
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:54,610
Ahjumma! I told you to take it
with you and do it outside.

338
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,617
Mother, did you file a
complaint against PD No Eul?

339
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:06,460
Ahjumma. Go into the wine chamber and bring
some wine from the third shelf of the cabinet.

340
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:07,161
Yes.

341
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:12,400
Why did you do it?

342
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,971
Because PD No Eul almost hit Dad,

343
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,775
did that make you angry?

344
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,346
So did you childishly release
your anger in that manner?

345
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,084
I have no idea at all what
you are talking about.

346
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,254
Dad is going to come soon,
so wash up and come down.

347
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,003
You trampled on them three
years ago, as well.

348
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,040
Although the report of our company's
illegal slush fund was completely true,

349
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,114
PD No, who covered the story, sued for defamation
for disseminating false information.

350
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,750
She lost in the trial to
your power and connections.

351
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:07,054
That child is even still trying to pay that
debt while being hounded by loan sharks.

352
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,960
I told you to wash up
upstairs and come down.

353
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,060
Do you seriously not even
feel an ounce of guilt?

354
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,097
-Ji Tae!
-A human being...

355
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,499
Mother if you are a human being,

356
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,236
don't you feel the least
bit remorse and guilt

357
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:25,973
for you and Father for ruining
PD No Eul's life?

358
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:04,645
No Eul.

359
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:08,149
No Eul.

360
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,788
I'm No Jang Soo's daughter, No Eul.

361
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,657
I'm telling you to remember me.

362
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,860
Don't forget me. You must remember me!

363
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,656
Jun Young.

364
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,759
Jun Young, it's me.

365
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,262
Sin Jun Young!

366
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,700
Sin Jun Young!

367
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,670
Jun Young!

368
00:47:50,985 --> 00:47:52,052
Hyung.

369
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,322
Please help my noona.

370
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:03,764
The more I think about this, you are the
only person left who can help my noona.

371
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,500
Among the people we know,

372
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,436
you are the only person
with power and connections.

373
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:14,942
Except for you, there is no
one who can help my noona.

374
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,549
Hyung, please.

375
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,621
Hyung!

376
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,768
Hyung, please help us.

377
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:22,436
This is your lawyer. You didn't answer your
phone so I called you at home instead.

378
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:28,375
Do you... perhaps know where Eul is?

379
00:50:28,742 --> 00:50:32,010
I think she is being held at
Seocho Police Station right now.

380
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:35,749
Get her out immediately.

381
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:41,488
Attorney, I...

382
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,058
Mr. Sin Jun Young, are you all right?

383
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,595
I'm sorry, but I can't
help you with that.

384
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,730
Why?

385
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:54,001
CEO Nam Goong called
me a little while ago.

386
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:58,105
He said not to interfere in any
matters related to No Eul.

387
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:06,747
Sin Jun Young, I'm really sorry.

388
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:45,352
Your neck needs to be warm when
you are coughing. Just wear it.

389
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:54,540
Wow, this looks yummy! Oh, so sudden!

390
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:56,263
Have a good meal, Customer.

391
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,580
Our yukgaejang has been made
with the best shredded beef and broth.

392
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:04,538
Sorry, have a good meal. If you run out
of spicy beef soup, please tell us.

393
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,573
-You!
-Hey.

394
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,710
-Aren't you going to take this off?
-No, I'm not going to take it off.

395
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,890
For three days, you've been wearing this while
cooking spicy beef soup, steam pork, and bbq beef.

396
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,219
-Are you protesting against me?
-Yeah, did you figure that out just now?

397
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:22,456
-Yeong Deuk, go inside and get my sewing kit for me.
-Why the sewing kit?

398
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,292
I'm going to sew this man's
body into this tuxedo.

399
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:29,810
Sure, go ahead. This is the most
expensive outfit I have ever worn.

400
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,498
So as for me, thank you very much!

401
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:36,770
Boss!

402
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:39,310
Okay! Pour water on me!

403
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,409
Even if you pour feces on me, I'm
never going to take this off.

404
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,340
-It's Jun Young..
-Don't pick up.

405
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,580
-Don't pick it up.
-Let it go.

406
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:54,420
Oh, Jun Young! I really was going to go. I
was going to wear the tuxedo you sent me, and

407
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:58,125
prepare for your interview, too,
but your Mom suddenly disappeared...

408
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:03,096
Jun Young? He... Hello?

409
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,066
Jun Young, are you sick?

410
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:12,472
Oh my child, why is
your voice wearing out?

411
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,277
Did someone... come and beat you up?

412
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,816
Should I put your mom on the phone?

413
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,290
Mom.

414
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:35,495
Mom, please help me.

415
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,820
I knew that CEO Nam Goong
was a total freak!

416
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:44,710
How dare he when he looks like
some idiot wreck of a person?

417
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,740
He's so crazed about money, I knew he wasn't to
be trusted when he caused all sorts of scandals!

418
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:52,913
How much is enough for that crappy jerk?
How far does he have to go? Ouch.

419
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,882
-Be quiet and just drive.
-Okay.

420
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:30,917
You're doing great. God and
Jesus would be proud of you.

421
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,759
-Dad.
-Are you a 911 worker?

422
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,794
Are you Superman? Batman?

423
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:45,365
You're also cold, so why are you giving
someone else your clothes, you brat?

424
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,269
Dad.

425
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:53,473
You, you. Stop crying!

426
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:58,178
This brat. How are you going
to live in this harsh world?

427
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:00,614
If you're like this, how am I...

428
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,518
going to close my eyes, you brat?

429
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:10,424
So... I accepted the money, Dad.

430
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:15,796
I received the money
Choi Hyeon Joon gave me.

431
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,604
I accepted that money, and
tried to forget about you.

432
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,940
That's why I got the money, Dad.

433
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:30,410
If not, I felt like I was going to die.

434
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,979
So I accepted his money, Dad.

435
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,517
If I die, what is our Jik going to do?

436
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:43,657
Even if I want to die, I
couldn't leave our Jik alone,

437
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,993
so I accepted the money, Dad.

438
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:52,999
You did well.

439
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,703
You did well, my daughter.

440
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,538
Dad.

441
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,142
I'm sorry, Eul.

442
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,714
I'm so sorry. What should I do?

443
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:09,750
What should I do?

444
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,054
Everything is so hard.

445
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:19,626
Can't you take me to where you are?

446
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,569
Mom.

447
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:18,151
These jerks. A child is in such poor health and
they're confining him? What are they even doing?

448
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,156
Hey. Get up, let's go to
the hospital quickly.

449
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,926
Here. Let's go.

450
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,861
Let's go.

451
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,866
I need to go to Eul, Mom.

452
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,202
Help me.

453
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:45,078
I need to go right now. Help me, Mom.

454
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:39,310
Why would Eul want to
kill the assemblyman?

455
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,869
I hope that in this life, this
will be the last time we meet.

456
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,239
This is all Mom's fault. Mom's fault.

457
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,920
They were right when they said you weren't in
your right mind because of that golddigger brat.

458
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:52,490
Please get PD No Eul out.

459
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,047
Do you like that woman?

460
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,500
You can't let that brat go! She's
going to try to kill you again.

461
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:59,553
Crazy jerk! You don't
even know anything!

462
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,455
And how dare you address him by Choi
Hyeon Joon? That man is your father!

463
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:04,925
-Jun Young.
-I said we would go on vacation.

464
