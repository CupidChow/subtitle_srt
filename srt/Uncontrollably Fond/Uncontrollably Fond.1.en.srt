1
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,647
The woman standing here next to me

2
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,283
starting from this moment...

3
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,721
is to be my wife.

4
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:48,766
=Episode 1=

5
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,834
Through happiness,

6
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,670
sadness,

7
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,040
difficulties, through age or sickness,

8
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,040
despite whatever unbearable
obstacles that might come my way,

9
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,550
I will never let go

10
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,196
of the hand I am holding right now.

11
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,997
Hey!

12
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,999
Traitor!

13
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,936
Hey! How could you think of

14
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,505
taking the boss's woman?

15
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,320
She was originally my woman.

16
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,040
What?

17
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,100
What the heck is he saying? What
kind of nonsense is he spouting?

18
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,678
Hey! Let's go home quickly.

19
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,381
Kill him! Let's go.

20
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,351
Let's go!

21
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,685
Darling!

22
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,492
Let go of me!

23
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,883
Let me go!

24
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,192
Hey!

25
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,517
Hey!

26
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,889
No!

27
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,010
I don't want to die.

28
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,515
This is not even Hollywood. Does it make sense
for someone to die nowadays from a gunshot?

29
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,156
Why aren't you dying?

30
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,058
Director!

31
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,162
-It's cold.
-Put some clothes on her.

32
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,930
Director!

33
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,835
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

34
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,939
The fact that you were going to die in the ending
was decided when you first received the script.

35
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,042
-I changed my mind.
-What?

36
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,045
I can't die like this.

37
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,816
Change the script.

38
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,210
Oh my, these girls. How can they come to the
countryside when they should be at school?

39
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,060
It's a real worry.

40
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,666
You'll get hurt, move. Move! What
are they doing on a cold day?

41
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,067
Darn it!

42
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,206
Geez. I seriously serve the
king of kings, don't I?

43
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,050
How did it go?

44
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,110
The writer said that the script
won't be changed no matter what,

45
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,788
so just go ahead and ruin the broadcast!

46
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:16,010
They're saying that he has gone nuts and that
they're going to bury him from this business!

47
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,260
So what are we going to do?

48
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,995
What the hell are we going to do?

49
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,167
But, honestly, who would dare
take a top star like Jun Young

50
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,702
and bury him?

51
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,420
At this rate, if something goes
wrong, the writer would be buried.

52
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,090
There are many articles up already. "Sin Jun
Young rumored to be against writer's script."

53
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,011
"Super Demanding Top Star
makes broadcast go under."

54
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,190
"Sin Jun Young, you are bossy!", "Sin Jun Young,
you are a jerk!", "Sin Jun Young never dies!"

55
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,550
You look like you are having fun!

56
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,330
Me? No....

57
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,792
I'm going to meet the Director first,
so go stop the reporters from making it worse.

58
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,820
Hey! When the script came out last week, Jun Young
didn't say anything about not wanting to die.

59
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,964
That time, he said that
he was going to die.

60
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,180
When he read the script, he even said,
"Daebak!" That's why he is a crazy jerk!

61
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,640
"Sin Jun Young, your personality is horrible!
You really need to die to get your act together!"

62
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,278
Those were the malicious
comments that were posted.

63
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,340
There are some in there that are even
worse. Should I read those for you, too?

64
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,615
Hey, where is Sin Jun Young?

65
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,651
Room 2011 Patient Yoo Jong Soon

66
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,886
is exhibiting atypical
symptoms of Parkinson's.

67
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,190
Do another blood test, as
well as another PET scan.

68
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,294
Mr. Sin Jun Young?

69
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,705
I didn't get any sleep last night

70
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,477
and thought about it so hard that I
thought my head was going to explode,

71
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,648
but it just doesn't make any sense.

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,983
What doesn't?

73
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,585
That I...

74
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,623
contracted a disease that is hard
to cure using modern medicine

75
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,427
and that I don't even
have a year left to live.

76
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,566
You don't know how healthy I am, right?

77
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:07,203
I can even run 100 meters in 11 seconds,

78
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,672
and to climb up Cheonggye Mountain summit,
it doesn't even take me 30 minutes.

79
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,111
I sleep well and eat well. Aside from
occasional headache, I feel fine.

80
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,381
Yes.

81
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,459
By any chance...

82
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,533
you aren't confusing me with the characters I
play in dramas because I end up dying, right?

83
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,369
No. I am not.

84
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,084
Or maybe it's a misdiagnosis.

85
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,623
I heard that a lot of quacks
misdiagnose these days.

86
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,863
If you don't believe me, would you
like me to find you another doctor?

87
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,746
What if I say that...

88
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,652
I'm not going to die?

89
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,059
Is being a doctor be the end of it all?

90
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,363
How do you know when I am going to die?

91
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,034
If I say that I refuse to die,

92
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,606
then what happens?

93
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,943
Can't you quietly just die
this once, Jun Young?

94
00:09:56,646 --> 00:10:00,817
They already filmed the scene where
the female lead scatters your ashes.

95
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,460
If you really refuse to die,
things will get out of hand.

96
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,096
The episode is supposed
to air tonight, too.

97
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,999
Do you really want to
see this show ruined?

98
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:21,304
I will make sure to only give you
scripts with happy endings from now on,

99
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:23,172
so it is just this time, okay?

100
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,113
Please stop resisting and die
nicely just this one time, okay?

101
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:46,295
This is the location where DL
Industries discards their waste.

102
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:47,997
Location 17-1.

103
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:58,741
What? Did someone tease you
and call you fatty again?

104
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,010
Write their names down.

105
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,447
-I will totally kill all of them.
-Sin Jun Young died, No Eul!

106
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:13,322
The last episode

107
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:18,227
of "Eternal Love" just ended!

108
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:22,632
-And he got shot!
-How old are you, exactly?

109
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,500
Are you at the age where you should be
crying over some drama character dying?

110
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,671
-Jun Young!
-Ah really...

111
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,406
You...

112
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:34,143
Hey, I am hanging up. If you
call me again, I will kill you.

113
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,779
Where did the third one go? There
were definitely three of the...

114
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:37,073
Open this darn door! I am
about to pee my pants!

115
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:41,177
Open the door already!

116
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,681
Who the hell do you think
you are to lock me up?

117
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:51,154
You people who illegally dump waste, you are
just human trash! You disgusting pests!

118
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:58,094
If you don't open the door right
now, I am going to pee right here!

119
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,108
There is a bathroom in here, you know?

120
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,415
You were illegally dumping waste and took
my camera and other belongings by force.

121
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:22,218
You are just trying to intimidate
and confine an innocent citizen.

122
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,021
-Are you planning to commit murder too?
-Of course not.

123
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,923
Secretary Kim!

124
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,980
I am Director Yang Joon
Ho of DL Industry.

125
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,380
You seem like you are only
a freshman in college,

126
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,480
but you are quite notorious
in your field of work,

127
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,530
PD No Eul of SNU Productions.

128
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:55,184
Wow, you went and erased all the footage
that I struggled so much to get.

129
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,287
Oh, you recorded something?

130
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,122
It's okay.

131
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,092
I had more than enough
material to make a show

132
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,494
but I came today just to film one more
time in case I needed more footage.

133
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,766
You illegally dumped your waste on the
3rd, 10th, and 18th of last month

134
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,203
and on the 5th, 13th, 19th of this
month. So six times in total.

135
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,173
And you only did it on days like
today, when it was raining.

136
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,076
But I have so much footage that I
have more than enough for a show.

137
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,620
If you are not going to kill me,
can you just show me the way out?

138
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,685
If I get back late, my staff may
report to the police that I'm missing.

139
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,621
What is it that you want?

140
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,389
Go ahead and tell me.

141
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,526
A world where there's
at least some justice,

142
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,662
common sense, and principle.

143
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,600
A world where people like you can't even show
their faces because of utter humiliation.

144
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,940
If you forgive us this once, we will
make sure this never happens again.

145
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,277
And of course, let me know
if this is not enough.

146
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,013
Oh my god... really...

147
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,780
You must think I am a fool!

148
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,010
-Ms. P.D...
-Do you think life is that simple?

149
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,754
That money can solve everything?

150
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,324
Do you really think you can cover
up the truth with this money?

151
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,345
Please wait for a moment.

152
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,060
I just sent 4.95 million
won to your account.

153
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,654
So I only owe you 32.25
million won now, mister.

154
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,556
Keep track of my payments.

155
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,927
What the hell does it matter to you
where I got such a large sum this late?

156
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,263
What's it to you if I stole the
money or sold off my country?

157
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,365
You loan sharks only need
the money, don't you?

158
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,230
Yes, Lawyer Pyo?

159
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,066
Were you in the middle of a workout?
It is quite late already.

160
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,402
Yes. I want to live a
healthy, long life.

161
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,637
That's good.

162
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,974
Now about that woman whose name
and age you texted me before...

163
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:32,742
Yes.

164
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,740
How much do you
want me to look into her?

165
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,400
Where she is living right now and
what she is doing for a living.

166
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,051
Whether she owns the place she is
living in or if she is paying rent.

167
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,155
How much money she has. Whether
or not she attended college.

168
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,358
Whether or not she's married.

169
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,595
And if she is married,

170
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,032
what her husband does.

171
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,990
-Is there anything else?
-No, that's all.

172
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,350
I understand. If I do find her,
should I talk about you, Jun Young?

173
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,544
No. Don't say anything. Don't even
tell her that I was looking for her.

174
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,114
Weren't you planning on meeting her?

175
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,650
-No, not at all.
-I understand.

176
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,840
I will give you a call as soon as possible.
Please don't exercise too much. Good night.

177
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,022
You too.

178
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,694
Why are you already up?

179
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,563
What time is it right now?

180
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,804
It is already this late?

181
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,193
You know you eat a lot for a dog, right?

182
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,299
And only the expensive ones, at that.
You shouldn't be like that, dude. Okay?

183
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:46,168
When I'm gone, Gook Young
will probably take you.

184
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,971
Do you think a cheapskate like him
will buy you expensive dog food?

185
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,474
He probably will only
give you his leftovers.

186
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,013
It's not like I can leave a will either. Even
if I did, it's not like he will carry it out.

187
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,382
You will just have to
adjust to his standards.

188
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,920
From now on,

189
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,191
try some human food and
change your eating habits.

190
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,793
Ok?

191
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,830
This kid's temperament...

192
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,600
Do you know how delicious ramen is?

193
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,736
Oh it looks so tasty!

194
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,922
I'm sick because I never eat food

195
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,225
but pieces of ramen every day.

196
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,690
Collapse, collapse, and be destroyed!

197
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,190
You bad Candrilla!

198
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:21,240
-We cannot lose the Earth to the likes of you!
-Collapse, collapse, and be destroyed!

199
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,564
No!

200
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,068
Stop, children!

201
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,740
If you have something to say,
you should use your words.

202
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,060
It's bad to use knives
and violence like this.

203
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,740
You sure talk a lot, you bad villain!

204
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,145
Be quiet, you bad villain!

205
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,615
Hey! These kids...

206
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,884
You guys stop watching comics.

207
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,830
Why do you tiny kids keep getting
more and more violent as time passes?

208
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,560
This time, should I investigate the
amount of violence in cartoons?

209
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,362
Why did you make the kids cry?

210
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,490
-Aunt, she hit us!
-Aunt, she hit us!

211
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,850
Did you hit my kids?

212
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,838
I didn't. The kids tried to kill me.

213
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,490
-Should I show you?
-Never mind that!

214
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,830
Even if you cleaning and washing dishes,
I am still going to raise your rent.

215
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,347
So don't use petty tricks. Let's go.

216
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,250
Just 100 dollars! No, 50!

217
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,460
Can't you just give me
a 30 dollar discount?

218
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,189
If you think I am playing dirty,
then leave! I won't stop you.

219
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,958
You have been playing
dirty for a long time.

220
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,893
No matter how dirty it is,

221
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,864
I can only leave if I
have a place to go.

222
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,726
Oh my, this black blood.

223
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,196
Because you are always eating so
fast, you are getting indigestion!

224
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,200
I'll make porridge quickly so eat it instead
of this yukgaejang.

225
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,869
It's okay, Aunt.

226
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,904
Listen to your aunt!

227
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,380
100 bowls of yukgaejang, please.

228
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,090
Why? Do you think I won't be
able to finish 100 bowls?

229
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,793
Give them to me and see
if I can or can't.

230
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,495
We don't sell yukgaejang, customer.

231
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,498
Does it make sense that a yukgaejang
restaurant doesn't sell yukgaejang?

232
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:41,904
It's up to owner whether to sell spicy chicken soup
or soy sauce crabs in a yukgaejang restaurant.

233
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,207
-I'll bring some porridge.
-Yes.

234
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,744
If you want to eat it, please go to
a different yukgaejang restaurant.

235
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,713
I'm too lazy to go somewhere else.
Give me the yukgaejang.

236
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,952
We don't sell it. This
customer really...

237
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,922
What are people eating
at other tables then?

238
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,562
We're only selling to those customers,
and we're not selling it to you.

239
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,820
Then give me at least
plain rice and kimchi.

240
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,620
If you keep on being childish like this, I'm going
to call the police for business interference.

241
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,307
Then, I will call my lawyer

242
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,350
for unfair discrimination!

243
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,810
Are you trying to start with me?

244
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,614
So give it to me too! Yukgaejang!

245
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:27,290
-Ah, really...
-Daebak!

246
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,385
Daebak!

247
00:24:31,753 --> 00:24:34,670
Customers, don't take pictures.

248
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,092
Sorry, don't take pictures.

249
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,090
Hey! Hurry up and leave, Jun Young.
There is no use being stubborn.

250
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:42,770
Leave quickly! People are watching.

251
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:43,999
Please don't take pictures!

252
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,830
Hey, what are you doing, Yong Deuk?
Hurry up and stop them!

253
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:49,030
I told you to stop taking pictures!

254
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,575
Oppa! After this customer leaves, spray a
bowlful of salt in front of the restaurant.

255
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,382
Hey, customers please don't take
pictures. No pictures please.

256
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,655
Pay for 100 bowls of
yukgaejang with this.

257
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,591
I paid for it already!

258
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,230
If you really don't give me any, then
I am going to really report you!

259
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,933
Fine, I will process your payment. So
come until she finally gives it to you.

260
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,710
Come today, and the day after that.
And 10 years and 20 years from now.

261
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:24,740
Like an annoying bill collector,
don't give up and come, okay?

262
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:26,241
Yes!

263
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,523
Sorry, but can I eat a
spoonful of yukgaejang?

264
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,877
God, can you please rain money my way?

265
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:10,010
My bank account has
exactly 240 dollars left.

266
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:15,057
I need to make my younger sibling
study and send him off to college.

267
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,229
I need to buy and feed
him some meat too.

268
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,970
My Jik's sneakers are all worn out.

269
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,406
His underwear is worn out, too.

270
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,418
You don't need to come
to work starting today.

271
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:46,722
Our company doesn't need trash like you!

272
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,596
Oh my,! You are really too much!

273
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,566
Jun Young is still your son, you know!

274
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,369
-Did he leave?
-He did.

275
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:06,842
He pleaded to a customer and ate a
spoonful of yukgaejang then left.

276
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,380
Is he a beggar?

277
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,780
Who do you think made her son a
beggar in the first place? Oh my!

278
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,483
You are really out of
touch with the times!

279
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,753
Do you think that entertainers are still
looked down upon like the old times?

280
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,689
Rather than a judge that you
tried to force him to become,

281
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,740
Jun Young makes a lot more
money and is a lot more famous!

282
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,395
Your spit will fall in.
Close your mouth!

283
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,167
Ok, Jun Young right now isn't in
the position to be ignored by you.

284
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,170
What if Jun Young says, "Who are you?"

285
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,540
and ignores you later on?
What are you going to do?

286
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,843
You eat all of this porridge!

287
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,746
It's dirty because of your spit, so
I can't serve it to the customers!

288
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,621
Today was a failure again!

289
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,624
Should I just confess
everything to my mom?

290
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,328
I'm going to die soon so before you
regret it, give me some yukgaejang.

291
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,620
Don't even ask me for a bite.
There isn't enough for me to eat.

292
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,510
What are you saying? Why are you suddenly
saying you can't film the documentary?

293
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,971
Just because I don't want to film it.

294
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:11,807
"Just because I don't want to film it?"

295
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,600
Don't say useless things.

296
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,913
Do you know how much money and people's
livelihoods are depending on this project?

297
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,870
Other celebrities are raising
their hands to do this project!

298
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,952
It turned out well then. If they want
to film it, then tell them to film it.

299
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,188
Are you a junior high school student?

300
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:29,124
A couple of days ago, you said that you weren't even
going to shoot the last scene of the drama

301
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,560
and made such a fuss over it.

302
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,429
But despite that, I died
in the end, didn't I?

303
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,467
From now on, I'm not doing things, I don't want,
even if there's knife to my throat,

304
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,901
don't tell me what to do.

305
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,779
Sin Jun Young!

306
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,415
After thinking about it for a week,
this is all you could come up with?

307
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,784
Don't you have more hot stories?

308
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,924
Sorry!

309
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,293
I'm sorry I'm late.

310
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,001
Our CEO, a chocolate flavored milk tea
with an addition of tapioca pearls!

311
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,639
And a sweet taro-flavored
milk tea for Sunbaenim!

312
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,143
This is my feelings for you!

313
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,783
And for Yang Sunbae, a
fragrant jasmine green tea!

314
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,987
And for Kim Sunbae, a green tea
that's grapefruit flavored!

315
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,970
And for Choi Sunbae, a mango smoothie!

316
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,400
-No Eul...
-Yes, CEO!

317
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,297
What are you doing? Didn't you receive
the notice that you're fired?

318
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,790
A text definitely should have been sent.

319
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,307
I found an amazing item.

320
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,945
Kang In Pharmaceuticals
released a new diet pill.

321
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,515
However, during their clinical trials,
there was a huge mishap that occurred.

322
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,630
But they wanted to cover
that incident up...

323
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,088
So what? How much are you
trying to get this time?

324
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,830
The people from Kang In
Pharmaceuticals are really evil!

325
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,710
They were trying to cover up what
happened to the victims that...

326
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,298
That's not enough?

327
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:22,237
Covering up their illegal dumping and getting
money from DL Industrial wasn't enough for you?

328
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:26,608
That's not it. I'm not
saying it's not enough.

329
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,546
But I didn't receive as
much as you are imagining.

330
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,250
DL Industrial was a first-time offender.

331
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:39,054
Also, they have contributed a
lot to society all this time.

332
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,690
And just because I turn a
blind eye, doesn't mean...

333
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,924
Hey, No Eul!

334
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,960
You're really pushing it!

335
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,661
You call yourself a PD
after doing all this?

336
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,032
As a person who works in the media, do
you have no sense of integrity and duty?

337
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,204
Ah, whatever! Do you even have
an ounce of conscience in you?

338
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,173
I do have it. I have a conscience.

339
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,080
I can't show it to
you, but I do have it.

340
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,112
What the heck is she?

341
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,615
Hey, get out of here this instant.
Get out!

342
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:12,360
And, before I report you to the cops, return
all the money you got from DL Industrial

343
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:16,358
and get out of my sight! Don't dirty our
company's name any further, and leave!

344
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:40,649
But didn't you also cover up the incident with
Assemblyman Han In Shik during the nominations?

345
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,853
Didn't you get $100 or $200 grand?

346
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,322
Hey! Are you crazy?

347
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,460
And you too, Sunbae-nim. Didn't you cover up that
corruption scandal of Yoo Il Auto's supplier?

348
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,620
I know you received a
car and lots of stocks.

349
00:31:56,698 --> 00:31:59,760
Hey you! Are you done talking?

350
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,503
Just let me off the hook this one time.

351
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,542
I'll really work hard not to get caught
in the future, just like you two.

352
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:10,245
Please let me off the
hook this one time, okay?

353
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,585
Those bad people.

354
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,091
They're so bad.

355
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,526
Who is?

356
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,700
-Mister!
-Who's bad?

357
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,569
Everyone.

358
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,330
Everybody in this world.

359
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,242
Why are they all bad?

360
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:47,215
Investigative PDs like you who go crazy over
money and cover up corruption are the bad ones!

361
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,518
Why are you shoving the blame to
innocent people in the world?

362
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,900
My CEO and Sunbae Han did
it 10 times more than me!

363
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:57,500
They took 100 times more
but only I got fired!

364
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,910
Then it's great that you
of all people are fired.

365
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,840
Mister.

366
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,890
People say that small-scale thieves
become large-scale thieves!

367
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,131
If you didn't get fired this time,

368
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:06,267
you would have continue to accept huge bribes too,
just like your CEO and your Sunbae,

369
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,169
and become a large-scaled brazen thief!

370
00:33:08,503 --> 00:33:11,006
It's good that you're fired.
It turned out well!

371
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,276
Oppa, why are you being like that?
Have a seat.

372
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:19,481
No, I'm leaving right away. I
don't want to drink with her.

373
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,551
-Mister!
-Okay, don't play with Eul today.

374
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,490
She needs to be punished today.

375
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,588
Unni!

376
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:29,290
What good did you
do that you're yelling?

377
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,528
You are healthy and still have four
limbs, so why live like that? Why?

378
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:39,167
If your dead parents are looking at you now
from the other side, they'd be proud of you.

379
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,940
Why are you being like this to only me?

380
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:48,643
You can't even say anything to people
who are a thousand times worse than me!

381
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,945
Why is it only me?

382
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:56,551
I'll leave, so put your nose in a plate full
of water and reflect for the rest of the day.

383
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,160
Unni, please give me a plate.

384
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,227
Why do you need a plate?

385
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:08,220
I'm going to put my nose in the plate of water,

386
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,332
and I'm going to reflect on my
actions, then I'm going to die.

387
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,837
Please bring me a plate!

388
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,380
Please bring me a plate!

389
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,790
Please bring me a plate!

390
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,070
Oh my, that crazy...

391
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,187
Stop drinking alcohol and go home!

392
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,224
Unni, I'm going to kill myself.

393
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,227
Unni, after I die.

394
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,763
Die a little later.

395
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:48,169
I need to put my face into this
soft tofu stew and die first.

396
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:54,175
So you put your nose in the plate
of water and die a bit later.

397
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,030
Stop that!

398
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,983
No, no! Hyungnim. From now on...

399
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,160
as an act of protest
against this super abusive employer,

400
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:13,061
die after shoving my face
into this tofu stew.

401
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,064
Don't let my death be in vain.

402
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:23,130
Be sure to tell that son of a... Sin
Jun Young that I'm dead because of him.

403
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,541
PD, don't you think your
words are a bit harsh?

404
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,177
Why is our Jun Young a son of a...?

405
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,690
Did you see a dog giving
birth to Jun Young?

406
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,249
Why are you making this worse?

407
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,840
Can't you see he's not
in his right mind?

408
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:40,788
-Are you in your right mind, punk?
-I... I...

409
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,091
I'm in the right mind, punk!

410
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,963
Ah, Sin Jun Young, that jerk.
Is being a top star everything?

411
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,099
Is being a Hallyu star everything?

412
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,503
If you are a top star, you can actually
change contracts as you please.

413
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,907
He always goes against his promises.

414
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,409
I'll pay the contract fees!

415
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,490
I said that I'll pay it!

416
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,114
How much is the contract fee worth?

417
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,716
You didn't write the contract properly about the

418
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:11,386
compensation because you
strong-armed us, right?

419
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:18,960
Do you even know how much effort we put in
to film the documentary with Sin Jun Young?

420
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:25,680
Do you know how much we got for investments?
He agreed to do it even yesterday...

421
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:31,900
If he says he can't do it today suddenly, then
what can powerless minnows like us to do?

422
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:40,081
-Get up, get up!
-Hurry and get up.

423
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,685
Should I try to convince him?

424
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,557
-The plate of water?
-I know about that documentary.

425
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,261
It's with Writer Kim Soo Hyeon, Chef
Choi Hyeon Seok, and Park Ji Seong.

426
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,031
Isn't that right? You guys picked Sin
Jun Young out of all the celebrities.

427
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,500
-Isn't that right?
-Who are you?

428
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,572
I'm a person who works in the broadcast
field. You probably already heard about it.

429
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:08,910
I got fired 5 hours ago because
I got caught taking a bribe.

430
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:09,944
So?

431
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,283
I'll try to convince Sin Jun Young.

432
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,953
I'll convince him and let you
shoot a documentary of him.

433
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,555
Do you know Sin Jun Young?

434
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:22,557
Are you close to Sin Jun Young?

435
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,760
Is there someone in the Republic of
Korea who doesn't know Sin Jun Young?

436
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:31,266
We're not in a situation to deal with
your drunken habits, so go away!

437
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:32,367
Go away!

438
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,703
What will you do if I can
convince Sin Jun Young?

439
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,805
For real.

440
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:42,644
If I can convince him,
please hire me as the producer

441
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,849
This time I really won't accept any
bribes at all. I'll only do honest work.

442
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,618
Really!

443
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,654
Should we write a contract right now?

444
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,391
-She must be drunk. Just go.
-Hyungnim!

445
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,005
You crazy!

446
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,151
Did you see my Oppa going to the club?

447
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:28,022
Hey, seriously! I'm
completely at a loss.

448
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:34,128
Ahjumma. This is obviously Seo Yeon Ho's
crazy fan, so how do I teach her a lesson?

449
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,531
Why? What is it?

450
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,068
This guy is our Jun Young?

451
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,938
Our Jun Young isn't the
type of kid to go to clubs.

452
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,342
How could you know that so well?

453
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,090
Hey. The story seems...

454
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,381
The Jun Young that you guys
were just talking about...

455
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,352
Was it Sin Jun Young?
He's a celebrity, right?

456
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:00,154
Our Ha Roo is working hard as a Bbasoon.

457
00:39:01,155 --> 00:39:04,726
Could you call it an passionate
fan, instead of a Bbasoon?

458
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:09,560
I'm also Sin Jun Young's Bbajumma.
Ha Roo made me join his fanclub.

459
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,560
You should also join.

460
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,302
There's even a 10% discount
to Sin Jun Young's concert!

461
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,607
-Let's see.
-Dad!

462
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,112
This is a combined photo.

463
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,080
That's what I'm saying!

464
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,918
As expected, I knew my dad would get
this since you used to be a prosecutor.

465
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,921
How do I teach them a lesson?

466
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,793
Jun Young Oppa has been chewed to
pieces from last night because of this.

467
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,761
Ha Roo...

468
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:42,764
Do you really like Sin
Jun Young that much?

469
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,802
I love him to death.

470
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,104
Let me marry Oppa Jun Young.

471
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,940
No, Ha Roo!

472
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,174
Are you really going to
be like this, Ahjumma?

473
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:57,011
A man like Sin Jun Young
is so-so for a son-in-law.

474
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,580
I don't really like his job, either.

475
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,283
His looks are... well...

476
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,280
I feel a sense of refusal to
good-looking guys like him.

477
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,230
Do you think he's handsome
because he wanted to be?

478
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,640
His father created him to be handsome.
What can you do?

479
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,061
Good morning.

480
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,880
Oh, did you sleep well?

481
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,199
Did you have a good sleep, Madam?

482
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,280
Mom, hi....

483
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,436
Hi, Ha Roo.

484
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,505
I'm so dizzy.

485
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,874
I think I need to go to my
room and get some rest.

486
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,111
I'll have my breakfast later.

487
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:40,630
What do we with her? She can't sleep
or eat because she's studying.

488
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,490
I feel so bad for her.

489
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:47,161
If I could do some
things for her, I would.

490
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,164
Please stop worrying about the child.

491
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,970
Just take care of your own health.

492
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,504
Oh right. About your physical
exam that was done last week,

493
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:00,374
Dr. Kim said you need to be careful
because your liver index is up.

494
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,145
How can it be alright when you are
working all the time, day and night?

495
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:09,450
Are you the only assemblyman in the country? It's
not like they'd notice you working day and night.

496
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,351
Madam!

497
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:11,219
Yes.

498
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,121
Will you please get the
newspaper that's outside?

499
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:15,223
Yes.

500
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,461
Why? Is it because you don't
want to hear me nagging?

501
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:23,064
Then why do you do things
that deserve nagg...

502
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:40,448
I am still so amazed, happy, and
thankful that you are my wife.

503
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,451
Thank you, Honey.

504
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:39,507
Oh my. My goodness!

505
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,978
What is this?

506
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,884
Oh my... Ah that... It wasn't that...

507
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:54,021
I wasn't going to give
this to Jun Young, but...

508
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:58,426
Our fellow Gook Yeong really
wanted to eat this, so...

509
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:03,164
Ah, this too! I'm definitely not
giving this to Jun Young! This...

510
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:07,401
I could give this to him!

511
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,874
Our Jun Young is a picky eater, so he
doesn't even touch food made by others.

512
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,590
He only wants to eat
only his mother's food.

513
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,716
Besides, I hear that young punk is
only eating ramen and kimbap everyday.

514
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:30,725
My heart aches when I think about him, so how
can you be so cold as his so called mother...

515
00:43:31,492 --> 00:43:33,661
Oppa, you should be Jun
Young's mom instead.

516
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,736
This is Sin Jun Young's
residence, right?

517
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,940
This kid... What's up with her?

518
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,813
Oh my god! That girl really came.

519
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:59,954
Sin Jun Young is in there, right?
I'm not a solicitor.

520
00:44:00,254 --> 00:44:04,458
And I'm not a stalker fan of yours.
I'm not a weird person either.

521
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:16,404
I am just...

522
00:44:16,704 --> 00:44:21,776
a pretty, kind, and
honest Korean citizen.

523
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,811
While I was drinking, I met that girl.

524
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:29,150
She loudly said that she could convince you to do
that documentary you rejected.

525
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:32,753
She said she was a PD, but she
got fired for accepting a bribe.

526
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:37,350
She feels a bit of a
con-artist and a bit maniac...

527
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,026
I'm not a maniac!

528
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,996
From listening to your voice,
you must be the Manager Oppa.

529
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,965
But shouldn't you be helping
me instead of interfering?

530
00:44:45,533 --> 00:44:48,803
You also have a lot of dissatisfaction
towards Sin Jun Young!

531
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,072
Was what I said wrong?

532
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:57,520
You said that punk Jun Young won't
film a movie, film a drama, nor sing.

533
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,160
You said you were about
to lose your job,

534
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:02,817
and that if you could have it your
way, you'd want to beat him up.

535
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,460
You whined behind the
restaurant while peeing!

536
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:09,540
Wow, this maniac. No, Jun
Young, I never did that.

537
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,126
Can you please meet me,
Mr. Sin Jun Young?

538
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,361
Let us talk face to face.

539
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,050
You can kick me out immediately
if I am a maniac, so...

540
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,320
I will kick you out right now.
Careful going back.

541
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:21,135
Mr. Sin Jun Young...

542
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,405
Hold on a moment!
Mr. Sin Jun Young!

543
00:45:28,209 --> 00:45:29,543
Hey! Sin Jun Young!

544
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:34,570
That's not it, Jun Young. If you are not going
to continue in the entertainment business,

545
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,917
it's true that I'd be
naturally unemployed.

546
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,820
Even so, would I have openly
badmouthed about you?

547
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:45,726
If I did curse, I would do it inside me, but I would
never curse you on the outside. You know my style!

548
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:49,063
Pororo! Let's take a bath!

549
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,898
Should I do it with you guys?

550
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,790
I AM FULLY AWARE OF YOU
BEING DUMFOUNDED.

551
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,200
TAKE YOUR TIME WITH THE THINGS YOU WERE DOING.

552
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,400
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, CALL ME.

553
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,890
UNTIL YOU OPEN YOUR DOOR.

554
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,300
I WILL BE WAITING PATIENTLY.

555
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,048
Oh my, refreshing....

556
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,684
Stay still.

557
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,405
Oh my, refreshing...

558
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,390
At times like these in the year, it's important
that you take good care of your own health.

559
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,426
Because people's immune systems get weaker,
it's good to take some of this red ginseng.

560
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,580
You viewers know about this, right?

561
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:06,667
Today we would like to introduce
to you a very popular item!

562
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,908
I told you to send a proof shot of you
eating dinner, so why didn't you?

563
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,578
You... You're eating
some bread again, right?

564
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,349
Why don't you listen to
your noona, you punk?

565
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:25,019
Even you are ignoring me?

566
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,630
I WILL BE BACK.

567
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:08,355
Good morning!

568
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,457
What are you doing?

569
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,663
You are leaving really early?

570
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,533
If I was even a little bit
late, it would have been bad.

571
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:24,038
Oh! It looks like you're
going ice climbing.

572
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:29,140
I looked into your fanclub and
did a bit of investigation.

573
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:32,679
About what you like, hate, your
hobbies, specialties, and habits.

574
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:36,060
When you are having rough times or feeling lonely,
you'd go ice climbing or race off-road...

575
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,484
Do I have to drag you out?

576
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:43,080
I know you are annoyed and dumbfounded
thinking I am a leech-like person.

577
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,930
But I am desperate. I
have to make a living.

578
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,770
I'll count to three to give you a
chance to get out while you can. One.

579
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,933
Stop ignoring me and let's shoot
the documentary, Sin Jun Young.

580
00:50:53,434 --> 00:50:53,901
Two...

581
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:57,004
I'll even do an amazing job of photoshopping.
I'll make it so that none of your pores will be seen.

582
00:50:57,004 --> 00:50:57,604
Three.

583
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,680
Lower your speed! At this rate,
we'll get into anp...

584
00:51:18,859 --> 00:51:20,027
He must be insane!

585
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,516
Do you want to get out now?

586
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:31,265
Use this as the medical fee, and
let's not see each other ever again.

587
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,767
Just as the snow has started to fall more heavily,
we have received a report about an accident.

588
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:45,272
Let's hear from Reporter
Kim Eun Na on Highway 6.

589
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:47,207
Yes, this is Kim Eun Na.

590
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:52,090
We discovered that a truck heading towards
Yangpyeong on Highway 6 slid due to the snowfall,

591
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:56,350
and that a woman in her twenties who was
passing by was struck by the truck.

592
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,786
Although her identity hasn't been
disclosed yet, this 20-year-old woman

593
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:07,527
is on her way to the hospital. We have been
told that she is in critical condition.

594
00:54:07,794 --> 00:54:14,001
According to the weather report, an additional
10-15 centimeters of snow will fall.

595
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:18,071
To all the drivers out there,
please drive carefully.

596
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,480
I have urgent matters to attend to
right now so can we talk later...

597
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,740
I found the woman you were
talking about last time.

598
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:03,317
Me too.

599
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:07,921
I think I found her.

600
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,363
Did you change your mind?

601
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,101
That's why you came back, right?

602
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:34,808
I'm not only doing this for me.

603
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,779
I'm not doing this just so
I can get a job, you know.

604
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:47,120
This documentary... It really helps that
you're putting out this image of an asshole.

605
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,900
To be honest, earning
more money is good...

606
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:51,892
You don't know me?

607
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,501
I do know you.

608
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:07,020
Even the kids at my landlord's
place all know you.

609
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:07,941
No Eul.

610
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,148
You don't know me?

611
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,857
I know.

612
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,760
You son of a...

613
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,753
Sin Jun Young, I've liked
you for a while now.

614
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:27,880
I love you, No Eul.

615
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,720
I think you'll get a
brother-in-law soon.

616
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:32,140
How can love change?

617
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,940
You're going to bully
and make fun of Eul?

618
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:40,066
If I knew that you'd become this glamorous,
I wouldn't have let you go no matter what.

619
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,801
Let's date.
