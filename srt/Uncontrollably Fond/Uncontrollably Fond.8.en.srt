1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,923
I love you, No Eul.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,195
Stop it now, Sin Jun Young.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,504
The whole of Korea knows that you're
a great actor, so stop it now.

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,407
Think about what you've done to Eul.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,544
How can you look her in the
eyes and tell her you love her?

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,315
I love you... No Eul.

7
00:00:34,582 --> 00:00:38,881
=Episode 8=

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,925
My Jik tried so much to
warn me to be careful.

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,931
He said that we're from
different worlds now

10
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,804
and I might be swayed or become hurt

11
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,375
because of any of your words or actions.

12
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,878
He warned me so much about you...

13
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,721
Yes, I'm a crazy wench!
I'm a crazy wench!

14
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,227
I should've just listened to Jik.

15
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,149
Not even once...

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,021
have I used you or
toyed around with you.

17
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,729
Look at me and listen to me only.

18
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,234
I love you, No Eul.

19
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,215
Don't go.

20
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,055
Don't go, No Eul...

21
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,226
We were just close as co-workers.

22
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,890
But somehow... We're too busy these days,
so we can't see each other too often.

23
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,430
Oh my, why do you say that?
All stars say the same thing.

24
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:59,008
Now, during your birthday party, we heard that
he sent you a thousand roses and sang you a song.

25
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,778
The rumors have spread to
all your acquaintances.

26
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,880
About that, I thought he wouldn't be
able to show up since he's so busy,

27
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,450
but he suddenly showed up
so I was so surprised.

28
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,090
But, during his concert,
the documentary PD,

29
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,710
that is, he grabbed another
woman's hand and disappeared.

30
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,097
He proposed to her as well. The
shock must have been great.

31
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,490
No, not at all.

32
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,290
Of course, since he was just acting to divert
the attention of the reporters away from you.

33
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,574
Wow, you knew all about it beforehand.

34
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,809
Well.

35
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,730
Wow, that wench, she's like the
best-friend of a court lady.

36
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,515
I'm shocked at your acting.

37
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,017
Then...

38
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,770
Hey, No Eul. Did you know
about this beforehand too?

39
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,891
That he was using you to divert
attention away from Kim Yoo Na?

40
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,796
First, he is a warm and
thoughtful person.

41
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,998
Of course, I knew about it.

42
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,390
He told me at the concert venue.

43
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,320
That he's going do to such and
such and for me to react well.

44
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,541
-So that is, you were acting too?
-Yeah.

45
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,844
How was it? It was pretty
good acting, wasn't it?

46
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,947
Maybe I should become an actress too.

47
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,851
I am speechless.

48
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,480
How can you only now tell me, you wench!

49
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,330
We had no idea, so we were
so worried about you!

50
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,970
-Sorry.
-Sorry, my ass.

51
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,530
Because of you, Jik
couldn't even go to school

52
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,580
and couldn't sleep or eat.

53
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,303
And Oppa Hyeon Woo, because of you...

54
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,007
Never mind that. You're my enemy. Why
don't you die today so I can live?

55
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,510
Today, you should die so I can live!

56
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,512
I'm tired.

57
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,715
Stop it now, Go Na Ri.

58
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,225
Lastly, a word to the viewers, please.

59
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,860
Hello everyone. For not being able to tell you
the truth and confusing you in the process,

60
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,799
I sincerely apologize.

61
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,303
And since Sin Jun Young did
all this to protect me,

62
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,920
I ask you to please not be angry.

63
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,812
To all the fans, I apologize again.

64
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,850
Wow, our Yoo Na,

65
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,850
after starring in the mini-series,
she's become quite the actress.

66
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,650
From now on, I will not just stand by and
watch if anyone calls her a bad actress.

67
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,860
CEO. You're committing fraud
against all the citizens.

68
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,300
-We're not some kind of a group of frauds.
-How are the comments looking?

69
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,780
"Korea's Brangelina is born. This is
what you call classy Hallyu stars."

70
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:42,480
"Look at how he's protecting his woman.
Sin Jun Young is a real man."

71
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,360
"Is there any other man around like Sin Jun
Young? I'm a woman just like Kim Yoo Na."

72
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,343
That's right.

73
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,581
You need someone at Yoo Na's level
to match Jun Young's status.

74
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,490
How did someone who we've
never even heard of...

75
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,386
Well, let's say that
you are just this way.

76
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,670
But what is Yoo Na lacking that she's decided
to take part in defrauding the whole country?

77
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,250
Even if she's your cousin's daughter...

78
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,029
After the story leaked out, she
got four offers for commercials.

79
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,164
Not long ago, people raise hell,

80
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:11,900
that she's starring in a movie when she's
no better than a supporting actress,

81
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,840
but because of the news with Jun
Young, no one says a thing about that.

82
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,340
Still, this isn't right.

83
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,150
Then what does that do to PD No Eul?

84
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,000
"Oh, poor PD No Eul. In the
end, she just got used."

85
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,410
"A shield for the citizens has been born. If you
want to hide your love life, use PD No Eul."

86
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,654
"1288, 1288, call now. Call now."

87
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,058
See that? It turned out
well for PD No Eul, too.

88
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,695
She was about to get killed by
Jun Young's fans if she go outside,

89
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,690
but now no one even calls her a gold-digger.

90
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,498
Still, this isn't right.

91
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,269
The one who Jun Young
really likes is No Eul...

92
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,070
But, why is Jun Young so quiet?

93
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,130
Right.

94
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,047
With his temper, he would have wreak havoc with
CEO by the throat. Several hundred times at that.

95
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,910
Why is he being so quiet?
It's making me anxious...

96
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
That's true.

97
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,420
You guys think something's
strange, too, right?

98
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,360
Not even a phone call...
This really isn't like him.

99
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,780
Perhaps, did he not see the article?

100
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,098
No way! Right now, the Korean TV, newspapers,
and internet are plastered with his love life.

101
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,050
I wonder... if Jun Young's
house has a blackout.

102
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,705
Even with a blackout, you
still get the Internet.

103
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:29,479
Ah! What the heck is this? I'm more
anxious now that you brought it up.

104
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,749
Why did you have to say such useless
things and make me anxious?

105
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,994
Oh, Grandpa, thanks for the food.

106
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,362
Bye, Mr. Guts!

107
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,170
It's how it is.

108
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,673
Oh! Grandpa!

109
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,209
Why didn't you tell me that
you have a rich hyung?

110
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,140
What are you talking about?
I don't have a hyung.

111
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,615
Thanks Grandpa!

112
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,980
-I love you!
-Your hyung is awesome.

113
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,950
Don't lie, punk. Your hyung
bought this for the whole school.

114
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,824
Including the teachers, even.

115
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:19,870
What are you talking about? You
misunderstood something, right?

116
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:22,198
Hey Grandpa! You are wanted
at the teacher's office.

117
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,233
Go ahead.

118
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,678
Thank you. Thank you.
Please autograph here.

119
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,116
-To the Head Teacher.
-Ah, the Head Teacher.

120
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,588
Take one with me, too.

121
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,292
My Jik who I cherish is here.

122
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,494
Ah, this punk with zipped up lips.

123
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,331
Why didn't you say anything about you being
best buddies with a big star like him?

124
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,501
Hello. Study hard.

125
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,734
Long time no see, Jik.

126
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,273
The entire student body, teachers, and even the
administration people, the total of 930 people.

127
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,710
That hamburger set is $6.10, right?

128
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,570
Hey! When did you get this big? If I met
you on the street, I wouldn't recognize...

129
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,455
Then... it'll be $5,673.00 in total.

130
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,992
Tell me your account number.

131
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,340
I heard you're a good student. Your goal is to get
into medical school in Seoul University. Right?

132
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,064
I can't pay you back the
$5,673.00 immediately.

133
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,037
But I'll pay you back in installments,
so input your account number.

134
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,378
I asked for your account number.

135
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:18,548
Jik.

136
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,559
I... like your noona.

137
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,430
I am about to go crazy
because I like Eul so much.

138
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:42,071
I can't eat. I can't sleep,
and I can't even breathe.

139
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,875
I just can't live.

140
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,848
So please help me.

141
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,520
Tell her not to run away.

142
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,992
Tell her to look at Jun Young.

143
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,431
Tell her to trust me.

144
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,973
I heard your noona only listens to you.

145
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,424
I'll send the $5,673.00 to your
company as soon as I get some money.

146
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,299
Jik.

147
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,923
Not even once...

148
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,962
have I used you or toyed with you.

149
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,269
Look at me and listen to my words only.

150
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,506
I love you, Eul.

151
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,840
I love you, Eul.

152
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:33,230
No, no, no, no, no, no.

153
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,634
Director!

154
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,240
I brought the car that was parked
in front of Sin Jun Young's house.

155
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,976
Thanks.

156
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,519
Just for one minute...

157
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,590
May I ignore rank and have a
chat with you as your friend?

158
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,493
Please do.

159
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,897
Stop it here, Choi Ji Tae.
You've gone too far already.

160
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,670
Go to Jeong Eun and apologize
and end it here with PD No Eul.

161
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,741
Do that! If No Eul finds
out who you are...

162
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,011
If Jeong Eun finds out who No Eul is...

163
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,570
-If your parents find out who No Eul is, then...
-One minute is over.

164
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,683
Ji Tae.

165
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,788
One minute is over, Secretary Kang.

166
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,757
Director!

167
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,458
Yes, Director.

168
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,328
Secretary Kim! Did you buy
the thing I asked for?

169
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,069
Who is it?

170
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,454
Na Ri said you can't eat anything.

171
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,391
It's already cooled off a lot. Eat up.

172
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,740
Eat it.

173
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,076
Eul has hands, too.

174
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,650
Eul is not a critical patient so why feed the
porridge to her, which is embarrassing for a man?

175
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,823
If you don't like abalone porridge, I have the
mung bean porridge you like. Do you want that?

176
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,000
I fine. I am okay Ahjussi, so...

177
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,264
If you are okay, then eat some. Do
you know how you look right now?

178
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,500
It wouldn't be strange if you died within
a minute with the way you look now.

179
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,810
How can abalone porridge
taste this awful?

180
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,449
Don't eat it. Don't eat it.
You'll only ruin your taste buds.

181
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,520
This isn't my house but
my friend's house.

182
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,457
I'll take care of my own meals,
so please, both of you leave.

183
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:36,525
Eul!

184
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,629
Right. Don't eat this porridge
and go buy some rice and eat.

185
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,098
People need to eat rice to get strength!

186
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,013
You are a really strange, Ahjussi.

187
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,550
I heard you rejected Eul, Ahjussi.

188
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,254
Then why do you keep
lingering around Eul?

189
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:09,525
Because you don't want someone else to
have her even though you don't want her?

190
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,663
Does Kim Yoo Na know that
you are here right now?

191
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,969
How would she know that? I don't
even know Yoo Na's phone number.

192
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,040
Ah, it tastes really bad.

193
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,012
Also,

194
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,815
that...

195
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,087
If I were to say something about you
saying I'm not qualified to love Eul,

196
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,391
do you have to get licensed to love someone? If
I like someone, then I just have to like her.

197
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,828
Do people save up their free will so
they can use it to cook soup with later?

198
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,198
Why are you laughing?

199
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:53,369
It is like that, right?

200
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,875
A man doesn't love a woman because
he is qualified to do so.

201
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,680
If you like her,

202
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,117
you just have to like her.

203
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,854
I was very confused, but
thanks to you, I get it now.

204
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,123
Thank you, sincerely.

205
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,192
Who are you?

206
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,099
Hiding this expensive brand name
watch underneath your cheap jacket.

207
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:28,370
I'm asking what your identity is that you linger
around Eul with this weird concept.

208
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,077
I've heard that watch is so exquisitely
made that there are no knockoffs of it yet.

209
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,913
Who are you?

210
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,250
You're not a robber or a thief, right?

211
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,019
Why is it so important who I am?

212
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,891
Both you and I, who have no qualifications,
like the same girl out of all girls,

213
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,194
so therefore, it's a
misery and a tragedy.

214
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,377
Why didn't you answer the phone, Oppa!

215
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,990
Mom fainted!

216
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,152
Mother!

217
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,225
-Ji Tae.
-Why are you here?

218
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,262
Your mom asked to go to the
sauna together, so I took her.

219
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,990
But she suddenly said her
heart hurt and fainted.

220
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,100
What did you do?

221
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,437
-What?
-What exactly did you do that my mom fainted?

222
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,740
What is that supposed to mean?

223
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,509
What would Unni Jeong Eun do and how?

224
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,780
Unni saved our mom's life by
rushing her to the hospital. Why?

225
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,683
What did you do while mom fainted?

226
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,319
I called you over ten times,
and you didn't even pick up.

227
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,489
I'm sorry, Ji Tae.

228
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,126
I should have been more careful
while taking care of her.

229
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,795
I'm really sorry.

230
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,632
Why are you sorry, Unni? Dad
went on a business trip,

231
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,201
and I couldn't even contact my brother.

232
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,939
If I hadn't at least had you, I
would have been scared to death.

233
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,712
It's okay, Ha Roo. Everything
is going to be all right.

234
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,831
According to the doctor, it could be due to
the side effects from her kidney transplant.

235
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,034
They said that we have to see the examination
results in order to find out more details.

236
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,638
It's probably nothing big.
Don't worry too much.

237
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,341
Unni Jeong Eun is talking.
Why aren't you replying?

238
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,220
You didn't even say a word of
thanks to our mom's lifesaver.

239
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,682
-Ha Roo...
-How were you trained at home?

240
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,752
When Dad comes, I'm going
to tattletale everything.

241
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,658
Ha Roo, why are you being like that to your brother?
He couldn't pick up because he was working.

242
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,962
How does someone pick up
the phone while working?

243
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,051
Where did she go?

244
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,160
Don't eat. Come out, No Eul.

245
00:25:27,195 --> 00:25:31,613
Ahjumma. Can I have one more bowl of rice?

246
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,749
Isn't that Sin Jun Young?

247
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,286
Why would Sin Jun Young come here? It's not him.

248
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:37,170
You have indigestion. Your fingertips are
cold and it's completely blocked here.

249
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,782
I know a place that professionally
cures indigestion. Do you want to go?

250
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,820
Ahjumma, check please!

251
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,360
Ah, let go!

252
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,450
-Am I that much of a joke to you?
-No.

253
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,030
-Am I that easy to you?
-No!

254
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,750
Then why are you like this to me?

255
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,539
What did I do? I'm just upset
that you seem to be sick.

256
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,277
I'm even more upset because I think it's my fault.
Therefore, I wanted to help you feel better soon.

257
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,846
That's all I'm thinking.

258
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,990
Thanks to Yoo Na, you got rid of  your
gold-digger title. If we're seen together again,

259
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,089
then things will get really weird. I
won't kill you, so let's go quietly.

260
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,580
That's why I want you
to let go of my hand.

261
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,570
Don't mind me whether I
have indigestion or not.

262
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,650
-Try telling a dog to stop pooping instead.
-What?

263
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,634
I don't plan on letting go of your hand
today. Do you want to do this all night?

264
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,405
-Seriously, you crazy jerk...
-If you know that, then just come along quietly.

265
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,215
Do you not want to see me that much?

266
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,451
Yes.

267
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,991
My fans' life wish is to see my
face for longer than a minute.

268
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,428
If they heard you say this,
they'd probably want to kill you.

269
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,130
Can you just drop me off in front
of the hospital and get lost?

270
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,132
All right.

271
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:12,007
I'm good at getting lost. I'll get
lost quickly and cleanly without

272
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,476
even leaving a trace of dust behind.

273
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,945
However, not right now.

274
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,715
-What?
-Minimum, three months.

275
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,384
Maximum, after four months.

276
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:31,193
I'm going to continue to hang on to the
ahjussi again until he accepts me.

277
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,830
I'm going to continue to go to see
him, call him, and cry and insist.

278
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,970
-Do what you want.
-The person I like is Ahjussi, not you.

279
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,570
-Do whatever you want.
-Hey!

280
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,536
It doesn't matter who you like.

281
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,006
I don't even have time to waste by

282
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,376
upholding my pride or being jealous.

283
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,284
What kind of hospital is this far?

284
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,454
Is the hospital even in Seoul?

285
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,838
Where's the hospital?

286
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,051
If my mom tries to kick you
out, say you're my anti-fan.

287
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,687
Your mom?

288
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,990
Yes, my mom.

289
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,228
She is an expert at taking blood out
of your finger with a needle.

290
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,480
It's fine, I'll pay.

291
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,280
-Give it to me.
-It's fine.

292
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,812
Can I have the bill please?

293
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,740
Ah, yes, customer. Did
you enjoy your meal?

294
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,217
Yes, I enjoyed it.

295
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,619
Welcome customer...

296
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,067
Get home safely. Bye. Yes.

297
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,881
Let go, I'm not going to run away

298
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,116
in front of the elders.

299
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,690
I'm sorry for greeting you so late.
My name is No Eul.

300
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:42,924
By any chance, aren't you

301
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:45,560
that gold-digger?

302
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,197
I'm not a gold-digger, I'm just

303
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,468
the person who was unfairly used
in Sin Jun Young's scandal.

304
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,639
She got indigestion because of me.
Treat her, Mom.

305
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,476
No, not at all! I'm fine. I
can just take some medicine.

306
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,579
Sorry for the trouble. Goodbye.

307
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,453
You really don't have to worry.

308
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,957
I'm really not a gold-digger of
any sort. And I'm not in any way

309
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,728
-involved with your son.
-That's not true.

310
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,499
From what I can see you are somehow
involved. Asking to treat you and whatnot,

311
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,104
you're the first woman our
Jun Young has bought home.

312
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,541
She's the girl I like, Mom. The one I
talked to you about on the phone before.

313
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,878
Ah, the Manager Oppa said

314
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,040
that Sin Jun Young hasn't
been very well lately.

315
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:43,870
Whilst shooting, he's been hit over the head a
lot with a piece of lumber, so his brain...

316
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,891
Anyway, that's what happened,

317
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,895
-so he can't judge situations very well.
-Who is she that I am so bothered by her?

318
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,165
It's been nine years since
I've become confused.

319
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:01,202
Ah, I really do love her a lot.

320
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,172
It's been about 15 days
since I realized that.

321
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,608
Look here, Mr. Sin Jun Young.

322
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,645
Oh my goodness. The TV was blabbing

323
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:15,310
about you dating some
other girl all day long.

324
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:21,300
The person you really like is this gold-digger,
no lizard, no this startled bunny-looking girl?

325
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,390
No, not at all.

326
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,859
That's what Sin Jun
Young thinks, not me.

327
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,128
-No Eul.
-What are you saying right now?

328
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,799
This girl doesn't love you, but
you have a crush on her. Okay!

329
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,569
Wow, I think something is really
wrong with this kid's head!

330
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,541
Yeong Dook! Take that piece of paper down
and tell the customers outside to come in.

331
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,713
Because of these ridiculous people, we can't even
operate our business properly. What is this?

332
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,782
I...

333
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,186
am pretty good at knowing
my place, Ahjumma.

334
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,061
No matter what your son says, I'll try
my hardest to avoid him and run away.

335
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,300
Nothing will happen for you to get concerned
about, so you don't have to worry.

336
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,101
Hey!

337
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,770
If you can't believe me,

338
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,480
-shall I write up a contract?
-Why would you write up a contract?

339
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,042
Are you going to keep
making me go crazy?

340
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,380
-If that doesn't work, I'll just get totally lost.
-No Eul!

341
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,281
To some place Sin Jun
Young can't find me,

342
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,918
without anyone finding out...

343
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,437
Ah, wait a minute.
Just because you hate me,

344
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,273
please don't pierce it
too painfully, please.

345
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,049
Aren't you going to pierce it?

346
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,087
I didn't do it yet.

347
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,730
-Don't dislike me too much.
-I don't dislike you.

348
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:09,964
Why?

349
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,202
If I were you, I'd want to kill me.

350
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,807
I don't dislike you because
you know your place well.

351
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,396
What's seven multiplied
by eight?

352
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,966
Don't you even know the times table?
What's seven multiplied by eight?

353
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,768
-Fifty six.
-You're normal.

354
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,370
You didn't hurt your head then.

355
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,311
When my Gook Yeong got bitten by
a gold-digger and went crazy.

356
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,680
He said three times three is eight.

357
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,970
-What about eight multiplied by seven?
-Fifty six.

358
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,619
Ah, that's fine. You're fine then, kid.

359
00:35:06,454 --> 00:35:12,590
How did such a normal guy like you end up liking
that cheap sneakers of a girl, of all people?

360
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,265
You probably had plenty of luxurious heel
type of girls around you.

361
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:18,399
I know, right?

362
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,500
Leaving all the luxurious heels behind, out of all
women, why did I have to like that cheap sneakers?

363
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:30,111
That's why you can't deceive blood.

364
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:39,254
Your father also rejected all those smart
and amazing university students girls

365
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,700
and fell deeply for your mother who
thought Gandhi was a monk in our country.

366
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,905
When you're a little older
and realize the reality,

367
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,374
you'll understand that luxurious heels
are better than cheap sneakers.

368
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,790
You'll think back and reminisce about what
luxurious heels you had in your life.

369
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,249
Then you'll cleanly and scarily forget about
the cheap sneakers like Choi Hyeon Joon did.

370
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:13,288
With the power of an assemblyman, he
could have easily found Sin Young Ok.

371
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,257
In those long years, he never
once came to visit her.

372
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,105
Hello.

373
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,812
How about changing your clothes?

374
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:45,086
At this rate, it might be found out that
you have fallen for a ridiculous girl.

375
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,522
Do you like her that much?

376
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,259
Enough to take off and throw
away the luxury suit,

377
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,530
and to wear those cheap
clothes to match her level?

378
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,606
I want to be alone with
my family today, quietly.

379
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,442
I'll tell Secretary
Kang to take you home.

380
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,044
-Go back safely.
-What?

381
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,747
Ji Tae.

382
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:34,102
Fortunately it's not such
a critical situation.

383
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,260
All the numbers are normal, and you
can be discharged tomorrow morning.

384
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,976
No. I'm in a critical and very
dangerous situation right now.

385
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,381
-Pardon?
-Although I got a new kidney from my husband,

386
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,750
you can't say I am completely cured.

387
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:53,488
I heard that the transplanted
kidney lasts 10 to 15 years.

388
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,491
But that's just something
people put numbers next to.

389
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:02,096
Organs can always fail, so you
could say I'm terminally ill.

390
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,900
Excuse me, Director...

391
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:09,604
"I'm sure the medical team will do their
best, but more than that, the family,

392
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:15,410
"especially the husband whom she lives with. So
as to not allow the patient to get stressed,

393
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,912
"you'll need to show concern
and consideration."

394
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:23,017
"If she ends up in the operating room
again, no one can guarantee the outcome."

395
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,588
Can you say that to the assemblyman?

396
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,392
Darling!

397
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,897
Darling!

398
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,736
Have the results come out?
What's wrong with her?

399
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,239
I am sorry to tell you this,

400
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,310
but it doesn't seem to be a situation
which you can feel at ease about.

401
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,048
Is something wrong with
the transplanted kidney?

402
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:58,553
-It's not to that extent yet, but...
-Then...

403
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,657
What do we do?

404
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,093
What do I have to do?

405
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,071
In one months time, I will
become your family, Ji Tae.

406
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,977
Earlier at the sauna,
I said to your mother

407
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,813
that I want to become a daughter-in-law
who is like her own daughter, sooner.

408
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:33,321
I asked how would it be if we got married in
a month's time on their wedding anniversary.

409
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:38,893
Your mother liked that a lot.
How happy she was.

410
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,263
You, the filial son, should
have been there to see it.

411
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,836
Stop!

412
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,838
What? What? I mean...

413
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,508
How can you pour so much fish sauce in?

414
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:34,500
It's salty! Salty! Salty!

415
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,983
Oh my!

416
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,186
What?

417
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,320
What on earth are you doing right now?

418
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,595
You said it was salty.

419
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,865
Ah, really!

420
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,444
Eul is pretty isn't she?
Just like you were.

421
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,981
But I won't make Eul into you.

422
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,321
Unlike you, who are so backward and think
about educational background and status,

423
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,424
feel small by assuming things and calculating
everything, I'm not letting her end up that way.

424
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,465
Why does it taste like this?

425
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,810
Did they deceive me again?

426
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,203
I won't make Eul run away
alone, like you, Mom.

427
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,260
Uncle! What's wrong with the
way the cabbage tastes?

428
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,078
You said these are from the highland of
Gangwon Province. So why are they so dry?

429
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:41,249
I told you I'd change my vendor if you
deceived me one more time, didn't I?

430
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,140
How can they joke around with food?

431
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,456
Whatever you say, I won't let her go.

432
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,196
Even if I die, I won't let go of Eul.

433
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,799
From now on, I will
live however I want to.

434
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,502
Why is it so quiet?

435
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,741
No way... Young Ok killed
Jun Young, right?

436
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,282
You heard it all, right? You can
still hear it well from here.

437
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:18,586
Not everything, but most of it.

438
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,290
Jun Young is a top star
just on the outside.

439
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,428
Actually, he can't even get a bowl of warm rice
from his own mother when he comes to visit.

440
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:31,832
He only gets a belly full
of cussing from his mother.

441
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:37,950
But. Why isn't his relationship
with his mother that good?

442
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,040
Don't even ask.

443
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,590
Someone who was on his way
to becoming a prosecutor,

444
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,580
suddenly quit school and went down the path of
becoming a celebrity, so his mother flipped...

445
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,951
Anyway, hear the details
from Jun Young.

446
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,121
What does your father do?

447
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,403
My mother was a single mom.

448
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,276
She had me alone when she
was twenty-two years old.

449
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,847
My father...

450
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,486
wasn't there from the beginning.

451
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,458
During high school,

452
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,596
she even poured alcohol at a bar to
help pay for my academy tuition.

453
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,935
She used that money to bribe
my teacher and got caught,

454
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,306
so she made her son unable to walk
around the school with his head up.

455
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,811
As if peeling apples at a karaoke
bar is something to brag about...

456
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,317
On my junior high field trip,

457
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,689
she peeled apples into all kind of shapes
and put them into the teachers' lunch boxes

458
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,928
and left an unerasable scar
on her adolescent son.

459
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,771
In my second year of elementary
school, my mom even stole,

460
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,210
just because I wanted to
eat sweet and sour pork,

461
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,016
when my mother didn't even
have money to buy rice.

462
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:37,892
Even like this,

463
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:43,264
am I the person you can't even dream of?

464
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,439
Thank you for fixing my indigestion.

465
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,708
Bye.

466
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,031
I said to go back.

467
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,801
You haven't even unpacked from
your business trip yet, Father.

468
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,871
If you do this, it won't
be good for you either.

469
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,039
I will be here, so...

470
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,243
I will stay here, by your mom's side.

471
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,246
Ha Roo will be scared being home alone.

472
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:07,481
You should get back.

473
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:08,949
Father.

474
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:49,123
Ahjushi, would you like some noodles?

475
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:13,781
Yes, Father.

476
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,616
I'm sorry, Ji Tae.

477
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,251
For what?

478
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,119
Just, for everything.

479
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,756
I'll be better from now on.

480
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,259
I'll really become better.

481
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,194
You're fine as you
are now, Father.

482
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:33,400
Make sure you say thank you to Jeong Eun for me.

483
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,303
Tell her I owe her big this time.

484
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:41,275
Yes, I'll do that.

485
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,078
Right. Sleep well.

486
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:45,880
You should sleep too, Father.

487
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,274
I only ordered two noodles.

488
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,644
I know. I'm treating you today.

489
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,420
Why would you?

490
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,682
I heard you got upgraded to a national
shield woman from a national gold-digger.

491
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,186
Your parents probably didn't raise you
to be a national shield woman, though.

492
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,421
About that...

493
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:30,291
If it's someone like Sin
Jun Young, you would have wavered a lot.

494
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,861
You only got used for that
jerk and wench's love game.

495
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,697
Here, eat up.

496
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:41,335
When you get stabbed in the back by a man and
feel miserable and empty, eating is the best.

497
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,507
Well, since you've given it to me,

498
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,043
I will eat well.

499
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:55,215
So recently, did you only get rejected
by Oppa Hyeon Woo and Sin Jun Young?

500
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:59,386
You have other guy who rejected you, right? When
the water rushes in, all rushes in same time.

501
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:01,789
Yes.

502
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,726
Eul, you need to lower your standards.

503
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,910
Who did you meet today?

504
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,064
Ahjussi Hyeon Woo.

505
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:13,267
Who? The Oppa Hyeon Woo whom I know?

506
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,034
Yes.

507
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:20,207
Unni.

508
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,812
To some only junky cars show up
after foreign cars drive away,

509
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,116
but some lucky wenches get a sedan
even after foreign cars drive away.

510
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,454
You asked for two noodles, right?

511
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:34,421
Yes.

512
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,280
The call cannot be connected.
After the beep, leave a message.

513
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,282
Where did our Jun Young go, that
you're only coming back now?

514
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:39,353
I bought the grilled intestines
that you like so much.

515
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:45,125
Gook Yeong, kneel down.

516
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,660
-Only me?
-Do you expect me to kneel at my age?

517
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:54,101
Jun Young and Yoo Na, this defrauding the nation
on grand scale came out of your head, right?

518
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:55,903
-President.
-I'm sorry, Jun Young,

519
00:50:56,303 --> 00:51:01,760
I didn't discuss this with you beforehand. But I
really agonized over this decision for your sake.

520
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:06,814
If I have even this much ulterior motive,
then you can burn Gook Yeong's finger.

521
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:10,370
CEO. Why pick on my fingers...

522
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,318
You did well.

523
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,495
Did Jun Young just say that I did well?

524
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:23,864
-Yes.
-Why?

525
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,934
It may be that he's gone crazy.

526
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:12,513
Oh my! The noodles have become mush.
What a waste.

527
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:15,749
Why hasn't Oppa Hyeon Woo come yet?
Hasn't it been over an hour?

528
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:19,086
He said he would come.

529
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:24,091
-He's not coming.
-If he hasn't come until now, of course not...

530
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:27,661
Oh my, what can you do? It seems
you've been dumped again.

531
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:31,365
Just wait a little.

532
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,772
I was going to ask him a
favor to hold onto me.

533
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:43,300
I don't know. It's that
ahjushi's responsibility.

534
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:44,645
What are you saying?

535
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:56,990
That's right. It would be stranger if she was
in her right mind in this situation.

536
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:57,117
No Eul?

537
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,296
I didn't hear you. What did you say?

538
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,180
Ah forget it, don't say it, Eul.

539
00:54:45,332 --> 00:54:48,335
I'll come to you, so you can
say it to me in person.

540
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,582
You saw me wrong, God.

541
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,486
If you thought that for
something so insignificant,

542
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,690
I would give up and abandon,

543
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,828
or thought that I would yield,

544
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,637
you are mistaken.

545
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,575
Throw at me however much you want.

546
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,413
I will never despair, become sad

547
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,516
or surrender.

548
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,553
-You'll get caught like this.
-Get caught?

549
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,450
You like me too, don't you?

550
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,124
I won't come back here. I
won't see Eul again either.

551
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:01,520
What relationship do you have with
PD No Eul? Shall we just date?

552
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:05,490
Sin Jun Young may be a big
star, but he's not my type.

553
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,270
I have someone else that I like.
Someone a whole lot more handsome.

554
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,071
Why are you talking about that person again?

555
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,940
Because I feel sorry. She's the person
who had our Hyeon Joon's child.

556
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,142
Brother-in-law!

557
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,210
-Aren't you going to the K-Pop festival?
-Is Sin Jun Young not coming again today?

558
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,747
Are you Sin Jun Young's fan too?

559
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,430
Jun Young got hurt. If something
happens to him it's a big problem!

560
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,019
Where is Sin Jun Young?

561
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,970
From now on, whatever happens
to me is because of you.
