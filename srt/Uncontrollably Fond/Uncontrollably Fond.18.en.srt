1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,853
=Episode 18=

2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,066
Yes.

3
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,667
Are you going to keep meeting Jeong Eun?

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,539
Yes.

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,209
You seemed not to care much about
warnings, so I told Jung Eun everything.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,547
I told her that you are pursuing her
because you have an ulterior motive.

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,154
That you don't like her, but want to take revenge
on the one who abandoned you and your mother

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,222
so you're using her.

9
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,992
Aren't you thankful?

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,530
If I let you go just a bit further, you
would've really become human trash.

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,964
I know, right?

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,437
You're the only one who thinks of me, Choi Ji Tae.
Seems like I'm the one who has to buy drinks.

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,275
Are you eating well?

14
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,317
Don't skip any meals.

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,758
Take your medicine too.
Don't be in pain.

16
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,431
I'm planning to get Jung Eun to
admit her wrongdoings today.

17
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,035
The fact that Yoon Jung
Eun was the real culprit

18
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,141
in the covered up hit-and-run
Eul's dad lost his life in...

19
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,712
I want to make her say
it with her own mouth.

20
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,151
Even if you intervened, I still
think I have 90% chance of success,

21
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,856
but if my plan does fail, I'd
like you to keep your promise.

22
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,491
I will be the one to get revenge.

23
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,730
Whether it's your revenge or Eul's
revenge, I'll be the one to do it.

24
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,066
Don't worry and go.

25
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:36,973
I'll trust what you told me. I'll be cool,
regretful, and beautiful as I close my eyes.

26
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,346
So if I fail, please keep
your word, Choi Ji Tae.

27
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,149
Why are you telling me this?

28
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,189
What if I told Jung Eun everything about
this and your plan gets destroyed?

29
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,994
If Jung Eun confesses, my parents will be done
for too, and you know it. So why tell me this?

30
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,200
Because you're the only
one that came to mind.

31
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,739
I was really lonely and having a hard
time, so I felt like telling someone

32
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,643
but you were the only
one I could talk to.

33
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,814
No matter how hard I thought, you
were the only one I could think of.

34
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,384
If you want to wreak havoc, go ahead.
I won't resent you for it.

35
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,389
I'll just think that I've lived
in a very hopeless, cruel world,

36
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,993
that it's great that I'm
leaving this world so soon,

37
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,732
and I'll be able to close my eyes forever
in peace, even more so than now.

38
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,530
You need to deny it. Tell me
that Choi Ji Tae is lying.

39
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,080
We haven't met by chance.

40
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,853
I went to you with a purpose.

41
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,823
I have an ulterior motive. I want to screw
the life of the father who abandoned me.

42
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,736
Let's go together. Your goal and mine

43
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,972
seem to be pretty similar, after all.

44
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,740
Let's go together.

45
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,048
Hello. This is Sin Jun Young.

46
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,655
I'd appreciate it if you let PD No Eul
come for tonight's shoot instead of you.

47
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,803
I wanted to become a prosecutor
just like my father.

48
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,639
So, I wanted to go
find my father someday

49
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,576
and say to him, "I grew up just
fine without you, Father..."

50
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,312
I wanted to get his compliments.

51
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,917
But one day, I found
out about my father.

52
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,988
My father whom I respected the
most in this world is actually...

53
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,826
someone who'd do anything
to fulfill his ambition.

54
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,596
Contemptible and cruel...

55
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,199
A scary man.

56
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,837
As a prosecutor, he covered up a hit-and-run
accident as a favor to a higher-up.

57
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,141
He got rid of the CCTV,
bribed the witness,

58
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,111
changed the driver and made
him give false testimony.

59
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,017
He demoted his hoobae prosecutor to another
province for wanting to reveal the real culprit.

60
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,661
The victim, who died from
the hit and run accident.

61
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,765
Was my girlfriend's father.

62
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:36,840
And I... My girlfriend who wanted to reveal
the facts behind her father's death...

63
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,478
I stole the USB containing
incriminating evidence...

64
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,615
of my father's wrongdoings that she
wanted to give to the broadcasting station.

65
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,256
Thinking of such a man as my father...
to protect my own father,

66
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,565
I killed my girlfriend.

67
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:15,011
I killed that child.

68
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,550
Isn't that scary?

69
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,822
That's a beautiful story.

70
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,892
I wonder how much Congressman
Choi Hyeon Joon would like this story.

71
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:32,362
Knowing that he has such a devoted son...

72
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,638
I said I killed a person.

73
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,439
People die anyway.

74
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,143
Right now at this moment
people are even dying, right?

75
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,314
Because of accidents,
illness, or other causes.

76
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,288
Don't feel too guilty about
it and just let it go.

77
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,625
Even if you hadn't killed her,
everyone dies sooner or later.

78
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,369
Did you feel like this
too, Yoon Jung Eun?

79
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,972
When you killed someone.

80
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,420
What do you mean by saying that?

81
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,479
On December 5th, 2006 at 1:50 AM.

82
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,652
You ran over a man who had a
cart and then fled the scene.

83
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,700
Your car model was ZEF 320. The
color of your car was red.

84
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,228
Your plate number, Seoul, 3-Ga, 3126.

85
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,700
What are you talking about?

86
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,232
About something you know very well.

87
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,204
My dad must be looking for me so I think I
should go for today. Let's film another time.

88
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,275
You were the one who drove
the car in that hit-and-run.

89
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,650
What kind of novel do you think
you're writing just now?

90
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,018
Is it really a novel?

91
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,822
I cannot listen to such a childish and
unbelievable story for even a minute longer.

92
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:08,591
Leave, then.

93
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:11,561
I was going to try getting
a confession from you, but

94
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:14,530
the evidence I have is more than enough.

95
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:18,735
Goodbye and drive safely.

96
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:22,105
What kind of nonsense do
you keep on spouting?

97
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,143
"I ran away because I was scared. Back
then, I wasn't in my right state of mind."

98
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,912
I also had a hard time because of guilt.
So did I...

99
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,549
"I lived in hell as much as the victim."

100
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,687
If you were a person, I thought
you would make such a confession.

101
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:41,290
You're aware that the statute of
limitations is still left, aren't you?

102
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,094
Let's finish the leftover wine
after you pay for your crimes.

103
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,596
Right,

104
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,232
maybe I won't be around then.

105
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,702
You... got the wrong person.

106
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,338
I'm Yoon Sung Ho's
daughter, Yoon Jeong Eun.

107
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,043
I don't know what evidence you have to make
you act this way, but you can't catch me.

108
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,146
Do you think what was
possible back then isn't now?

109
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,360
My father has become much
more powerful since then and

110
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,385
there are plenty of
prosecutors like your father.

111
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,192
You just gave it a shot, didn't you?

112
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,429
In truth, you don't have
any evidence, right?

113
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:21,964
That's right.

114
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,267
I don't have evidence.

115
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,603
You all got rid of it ten years ago.

116
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,873
But just now, some evidence has emerged.

117
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,943
You just confessed a few moments ago.

118
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,246
Eul,

119
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,016
you're watching closely, right?

120
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,923
This is the truth that you
wanted to know so badly.

121
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,028
This woman standing here
killed your father.

122
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,330
Also,

123
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,100
that jerk who took your USB

124
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,737
and almost killed you

125
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,507
is me.

126
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,613
I wanted to make sure
you knew before I died.

127
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,218
This!

128
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,524
Is the first item on my bucket list and

129
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,597
the last.

130
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,916
Did the two of you plan this together
and toy around with me till now?

131
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,322
What kind of person are you?

132
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,625
Who do you think you are?

133
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,528
Then, do you have it?

134
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,899
Without getting this agitated
and shouting, "I'm a criminal",

135
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,570
you'll definitely be disadvantageous
in court. Director Yoon Jeong Eun.

136
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,888
-Hello?
-Jun Young, run away now!

137
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,630
Run away right this instant. Quickly!

138
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,327
Run away? Why should he run away?
Don't you trust our Jun Young?

139
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,963
I trust him, I trust him but...

140
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,134
Jun Young, then don't move and if the
detectives arrive later, just get arrested.

141
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,939
In any case, we're also coming soon, so until
a lawyer arrives, don't say a word. Got it?

142
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,941
What do you mean by that?

143
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,255
Sin Jun Young, you're under
arrest for abusing drugs.

144
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,070
Sin Jun Young, you have the right to an
attorney. You have the right to remain silent.

145
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:39,428
You have the right to deny
giving damaging testimony.

146
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,770
What did you just accuse me of?

147
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,602
In order to do a drug test, there will be a physical
search and confiscation. Please accompany us.

148
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,640
What?

149
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,478
Sin Jun Young's matter. It wasn't your
mother but your father who was behind it.

150
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,614
That...

151
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,417
is it possible?

152
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,453
If they examine him, it'll immediately
be known that it isn't true.

153
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,755
That's the power your father has.

154
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,193
The power to make something up as
long as he puts his mind to it.

155
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,631
Still, how could he?

156
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,400
Sin Jun Young

157
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,971
is my father's son.

158
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,709
By any chance, is there
soju in the house?

159
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,830
Were you behind Sin Jun Young's matter?

160
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,985
I wanted to have a glass of it
with you along with kimchi stew.

161
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,120
Honey.

162
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,271
Sin Jun Young

163
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,341
is a child I abandoned a long time ago.

164
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,380
My older brother met Young Ok and

165
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,252
told her, "You're not a good match for our Hyeon
Joon"  as he threatened her and chased her away.

166
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,770
Honey, that is something that I...

167
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,657
I asked him to do it.

168
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,060
To do that for me.

169
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,898
I sent that woman away.

170
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,235
Even though I knew she
was carrying my child.

171
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,739
To go to you.

172
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,510
Honey...

173
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,279
How do you think I got to this point?

174
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,816
I can't lose everything because
of a child by the likes of him.

175
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:23,225
There will be many things that will
surprise you. I hope you won't get hurt.

176
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,332
Help me, Ji Tae. What should I do?

177
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:09,004
I'm scared, Ji Tae. Sin Jun Young and
No Eul both planned it together and

178
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,774
please help me...

179
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,915
We have all these witnesses, are
you going to continue denying it?

180
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,623
Model Ha Soo Hee, movie
actor Park Shi Geung,

181
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,293
and singer Jo Yoon Hee have testified
that they all did drugs with you.

182
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,031
The distributor, Yoon Yool Joo also
stated that from last year till now,

183
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,935
he's had a total of eight transactions
with you through the Itaewon club.

184
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,643
Also in Yoon Yool Joo's ledger, all the dates
and prices of your transactions are all...

185
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,913
Sin Jun Young.

186
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,383
-Jun Young.
-What are you doing right now?

187
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,253
I'm laughing.

188
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,250
What's the matter, Jun Young?

189
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,625
What do you mean? I'm just
laughing because it's funny.

190
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,494
Isn't his facial expression funny? Am
I the only one who finds it funny?

191
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,197
What are you doing? Give that back!

192
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,910
What is this? It looks like a dictation.

193
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,869
How embarrassing...

194
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:19,520
How can you spell "commit crime"
with one "m"? There are two "m"s.

195
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,476
Please give it back.

196
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,614
This kind of behavior will
not be advantageous to you.

197
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,250
I'm really curious...

198
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,686
by any chance, is this some
kind of "hidden camera" joke?

199
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,789
What are you doing?

200
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,293
Why are we closing the store?

201
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,663
Then, should I take today's
earnings from your wages?

202
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,998
That's not what I meant...

203
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:48,737
After the guests inside leave, we'll
have to close the store for today.

204
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,470
I really can't bear to hear guests
talking badly of Sin Jun Young

205
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,810
and him doing his drugs.

206
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,746
That's all they're talking about.

207
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,940
That's exactly what I mean.
Put this sign back on.

208
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,130
If people talk without
knowing, you can say, "No."

209
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,191
"Our Oppa Jun Young isn't that kind
of person." You can tell them that.

210
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,328
What's your mouth for?

211
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,803
That's what I'm saying. Rip that up.

212
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,338
Ok!

213
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,847
Excuse me. Customers, can I
have your attention for a bit?

214
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,089
Well... by chance in here...
Sin Jun Young...

215
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,600
Did anyone read a gossip
article about him doing drugs?

216
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,527
-Ok!
-Ahjumma!

217
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,410
It's okay. Raise your hand.
If you tell me honestly,

218
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:52,568
I'll serve a plateful of
dumplings on the house.

219
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,446
So, you all read it.

220
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,860
Then, who believes that article?

221
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,854
Ok! What are you doing now?

222
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:14,290
It's okay. Raise your hand.

223
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,361
Then if you tell me the truth sincerely, I
will give you an extra service of bossam.

224
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:21,563
Young Deok.

225
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,046
Well... I'm sure you all know, but...

226
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,450
I am Sin Jun Young's mom.

227
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,540
And if that's really true, would I be...

228
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,224
selling yookgaejang and be so laid back?
I'm not that crazy, you know.

229
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,829
My Jun Young isn't like that.

230
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,830
That article is all wrong. So, if anyone talks bad
about my Jun Young, just say it's all wrong.

231
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,330
That it's all a lie... please?

232
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:05,808
Please say that, okay?

233
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,310
Do you understand?

234
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,181
-Thank you for the food.
-Yes, goodbye.

235
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,320
Our Eul, it's been a long while.

236
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,638
Hey, hey, hey! What are your doing right now?
You can't drink other customers' leftovers.

237
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,041
You're going to throw them away anyway.

238
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,712
Consider that I'm a rubbish can
so throw them right into here.

239
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,386
Seriously, this girl... why are you still so
messy and miserable? Even after all this time.

240
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,654
Go sit over there at a clean
table and start over.

241
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,994
Something's wrong again?

242
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,066
Alright. I'll leave you alone.

243
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,303
Hey! Have you heard about it?

244
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,741
Sin Jun Young... what's going
on, what's going on?

245
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:20,849
I beg you, Unni. Please don't mention "Sin"
as in Sin Jun Young in front of me tonight.

246
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,217
I got it.

247
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,091
Sin... your shoes are cute. Doesn't suit you.

248
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,896
Not Sin Jun Young. I was talking about
your shoes. You really won't order anything?

249
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,637
Ah, seriously. You stop looking at that.

250
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,110
My Jun Young oppa will never do that.

251
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,500
What do you mean never?

252
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,610
Sin Jun Young is finished now.

253
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,414
Hey, what do you know
about my Jun Young oppa?

254
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,510
Oppa? What's wrong with you calling
him Oppa? You're even older than him!

255
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:03,030
Excuse me. Can you please drink quietly?

256
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,020
-What's with her?
-She must be crazy.

257
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,398
Yes, I'm crazy. So, let's
shut up and drink up.

258
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,002
Hey, hey, hey. How do you drink
with your mouth shut, girl?

259
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,310
Dear customers, she must be not in her
right mind so please ignored her.

260
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,430
Please talk your heart out
and enjoy your conversation.

261
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,049
I mean, if you don't chat at a bar,
where else would you?

262
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,518
Hey, Sin Jun Young's gossip
article came up again.

263
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,087
What does it say about
my Jun Young oppa?

264
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,825
You can't complete a sentence
without saying Sin Jun Young?

265
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,362
Politics, economy and culture.

266
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,290
There are so many state of affairs concern. You
have nothing else to talk about than Jun Young?

267
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,604
That's right. All my customers are having
Sin Jun Young for their drinking food.

268
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:49,410
What do you want to do?

269
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:53,408
Sin Jun Young is the hottest topic now.
If you don't like it, then leave!

270
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,455
I texted him. He asked
me to contact him if you showed up.

271
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,593
Oppa, it must be that time
of the month for Eul.

272
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:15,197
You probably shouldn't approach
her within 500 meter radius.

273
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,602
Let's talk.

274
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,942
You're speechless and stunned, right?

275
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,413
Sin Jun Young, the man you love
so much, is Choi Hyeon Joon's son.

276
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,449
I'm sorry.

277
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,789
Being deceived by me... is
enough to drive you crazy.

278
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,927
I'm the only one who didn't know.
Everyone knew.

279
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,731
You guys must have had fun.

280
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:57,306
Deceiving me and playing me...
how much fun did you have?

281
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,609
It wasn't fun. At the least, Sin
Jun Young... as much as you did...

282
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,070
No, much more than you... he lived
through an agonizing and painful time.

283
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,085
Forget it. I don't want to hear excuses from you
hypocritical jerks for another second.

284
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,389
Sin Jun Young got arrested by
the police for using drugs.

285
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,934
The result will obviously come out positive.
My father worked it out that way.

286
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,740
Sin Jun Young stabbed his own father in
in order to catch the one who killed your father...

287
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,344
That's how he's punishing him.

288
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:42,985
Sin Jun Young's father.
Also my own father.

289
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,354
So what?

290
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,493
-Eul.
-What does that have to do with me?

291
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,729
What do you want me to do?

292
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:01,970
Just like me... you should've lived
with your eyes closed.

293
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,374
Like me... you should've just
lived ignoring everything.

294
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,809
Everyone in this world lives like that.

295
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,415
What woman? What conscience? What guilt?

296
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:21,223
Someone who will die soon... he put all that's left
of his life on the line and went into that hell!

297
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,997
A coward like me... how can
I live with such a shame?

298
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:38,807
You can hate me for the rest of your life.
But as for Sin Jun Young... go easy on him.

299
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,582
I ask you as a favor, Eul.

300
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,353
I don't want to.

301
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,109
Eul!

302
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,482
Jik is at home right now.

303
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,054
But, what's wrong with your face?
Are you ill?

304
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,757
No.

305
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,530
I told Jik everything.

306
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,240
The story behind your father's
hit-and-run accident.

307
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:54,282
I mean... there was a reason why I
couldn't hold back. I couldn't help it.

308
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,059
I'll come in a little later.

309
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,096
You two have at it and text
me when peace is back.

310
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,202
Why didn't you tell me about it?

311
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:19,470
Why didn't you tell me about Prosecutor Choi Hyeon
Joon covering up dad's culprit of the accident?

312
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,245
Why didn't you tell me that Choi Hyeon
Joon's wife threatened you about killing me?

313
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,848
Why didn't you tell me you wanted to
leave this country because of that?

314
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,584
Why did you hide it from me
and didn't tell me at all?

315
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,160
Because I thought you'd struggle.

316
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,470
But you still should've told me. Why do
you make me out to be an idiot and fool?

317
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,330
It's enough that I've
become an idiot and fool.

318
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,620
-Noona!
-How could I tell you?

319
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,068
Then if I had told you, from that point
that would have been the end of your life.

320
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:51,273
Every day is hell and
every day is painful.

321
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,443
Even if I'm smiling, I'm not really smiling.
Even if I'm breathing, I'm not really breathing.

322
00:29:56,244 --> 00:30:01,483
And if I forget about it for a moment and
be happy, I think, "My dad died so unjustly..."

323
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,410
"Can I be this happy? Can I smile?"

324
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,758
"Can I eat such delicious food?
Can I sleep so soundly?"

325
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,961
Do you know how much I punished
myself and lived struggling?

326
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,833
So how can you expect
me to have told you all this?

327
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,004
Okay. I understand, I'm sorry.

328
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,440
I was wrong.

329
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:30,245
So, don't tell me to let them off easy.

330
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,748
Don't tell me to forgive them.

331
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,468
What

332
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,037
did you just say?

333
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,907
I...

334
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,811
-I like men.
-Men?

335
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,330
Who's this "Men" girl anyway?
She has such a tacky name.

336
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,221
Come on, bring her to me. Let's see if
she's prettier, cuter or richer than I am.

337
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,224
I said men.

338
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,294
Not girls,

339
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,364
but males.

340
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,569
So are you telling me

341
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,774
that you like boys, not girls?

342
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,580
Hey, are you...

343
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,951
You're lying, right?

344
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,087
I'm not.

345
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,992
That's why I had a hard time
being physical with you

346
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,062
and why Na Ri was so mean.

347
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,497
Wow.

348
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:01,569
-Wow...
-I'm so sorry. I should've told you earlier.

349
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,385
Let's break up now, noona.

350
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,458
I'm extremely sorry.

351
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:33,301
Forget it.

352
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,704
Don't get up.

353
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,378
-I'm sorry.
-Stop apologizing.

354
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,349
-I was wrong.
-Don't say that either.

355
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,520
-Farewell.
-Don't say that either!

356
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,167
I'm deleting your number.

357
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:12,173
After all, who knows when I'll go crazy and
call you because of lingering feelings.

358
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,877
You delete my number too.

359
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,013
Okay.

360
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,728
I'm sorry.

361
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,699
Don't touch me.

362
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,445
Hey, Kwang Soo. It's Ha Roo.

363
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,581
Let's go on a date.

364
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,751
You choose where we go.

365
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,694
Let's have dinner, drink, see
a movie, do all of that.

366
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,065
Okay, got it.

367
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,280
I'll be there.

368
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,780
-My sister's still sleeping.
-Yeah.

369
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,485
How can she sleep for 15 hours?

370
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,688
She's not dead, is she?

371
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,858
I checked earlier. She's breathing.

372
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,999
Did you end things with Ha Roo?

373
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,601
Yes.

374
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,707
-A girl like her wouldn't let go too easily...
-You haven't eaten yet, right?

375
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,581
Let's let my sister sleep
and have a meal together.

376
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,716
-I'm hungry.
-Okay.

377
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,689
She'll be up by the time we finish
eating and come back, right?

378
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,326
Let's go.

379
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,456
Happy 100th day anniversary.
I love you, Eul.

380
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:55,463
You're so cute. I can't
study because of you.

381
00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:02,136
I'm Sin Jun Young's girlfriend. Baby,
you finished classes, didn't you?

382
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:27,295
Yeah, you are my type. Happy?

383
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,899
Yeah, I like you.

384
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,135
Happy now?

385
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,372
Just listen to me.

386
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,908
Don't listen to all those other jerks

387
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,913
and just listen to me.

388
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,918
I love you, Eul.

389
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,390
I love you, Eul.

390
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,929
Jik told me to be careful.

391
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,468
That's right, I'm crazy,
I'm the crazy one!

392
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,100
I should've just listened to Jik...

393
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:56,884
I can't stand this. I told you to put
kkalkarijeot, not baendangyijeot!

394
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,122
Oh. I got confused, sorry.

395
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,825
Oppa!

396
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,626
What is it?

397
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,763
I'm a crazy woman, aren't I?

398
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,436
My kid is locked up

399
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:20,341
and I'm here getting angry over
you mixing up the ingredients.

400
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,379
I can't be normal, right?

401
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,084
Be honest with me. You're not
in the clear state of mind.

402
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,189
Since yesterday until now, you're acting like
a crazy wench who's got several screws loose.

403
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,858
Oppa...

404
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,464
I'm going to see Jun Young.

405
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,068
Let's see.

406
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,972
Oh my. You've come to your senses.

407
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,376
Oh, my Ok. I'll take the
car out and wait for you.

408
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:19,167
Oh my! Are all those people with
cameras here because of Jun Young?

409
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,903
It looks like it.

410
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,178
Geez. Why would our Jun Young
be under investigation now?

411
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm just here for some
personal business.

412
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,517
Sin Jun Young is not in there.

413
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,086
Mr. A from that article was
indeed Sin Jun Young, right?

414
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,870
Has Sin Jun Young really done drugs?

415
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,191
What drugs are you talking about?

416
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,760
Our Jun Young has no relation to that!

417
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,263
Do you want to be sued for defamation?

418
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,569
Oh, I just got a call. Excuse me.

419
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,003
Sorry.

420
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,576
If anyone of you writes
some weird article

421
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,449
I'll be meeting you in there after I
press charges, so brace yourselves.

422
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,110
Why did you come to this
place filled with reporters?

423
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,455
I never thought they'd be here.

424
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,830
We came to see Jun Young.

425
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,290
Don't look at them, don't.

426
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,960
Act like you're here for
some other business.

427
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,763
If the reporters catch on that you're
Jun Young's mom, we're in big trouble.

428
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,566
Ok.

429
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,870
What is Jun Young going to do now?

430
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,605
Is he hurt in any way?

431
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,674
I saw him earlier and he's doing well.

432
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,513
He told me to tell you not to worry
because it's not a big deal.

433
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,147
It's nothing big, right?

434
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,884
Of course it's not.

435
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,151
And also...

436
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,721
The visits are over today.

437
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,456
-Really?
-Don't look at me!

438
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,076
You're having such a hard time.

439
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,016
It's all thanks to CEO Lee.

440
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,721
My wife has no relation to you.

441
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,624
I did it.

442
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,130
If you want to get out of
here, you'll have to retire

443
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,333
and go to another country
with your mother immediately.

444
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:39,473
I'll make sure you both live well

445
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,730
wherever country you might go to.

446
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,578
I have enough money myself.

447
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:46,380
That's a relief.

448
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,760
Anyway, you need to leave quick...

449
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,686
What if I don't leave?

450
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,089
Do I automatically become a junkie?

451
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,895
We shouldn't let things get to that.

452
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,765
With your wise decision...

453
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,139
You really have amazing power.

454
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,044
You've had it then, and you have it now.

455
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,013
I know.

456
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,817
You have no idea

457
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,121
what I had to do and go
through to get here.

458
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,794
You even abandoned my mom

459
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,400
for this amazing power.

460
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,473
My mom didn't leave you on her own?

461
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,181
I will take that as a yes.

462
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:08,029
If you, Sin Jun Young...

463
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,136
promise to leave quietly... I'll
drop the drug abuse charges...

464
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,604
Detective!

465
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,209
The visit's over.

466
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,378
Sin Jun Young!

467
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:30,418
Father...

468
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:42,430
I'll call you that today for
the first and last time.

469
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:46,534
And...

470
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,839
the fact that I am your son...

471
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,546
has been, is and will be shameful,

472
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,149
embarrassing...

473
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,688
and humiliating till the day I die.

474
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,996
This is the truth you wanted.
The woman in front of me

475
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,833
killed your dad.

476
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:58,272
And the jerk who stole your USB

477
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,176
and almost killed you

478
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,980
was none other than me.

479
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,685
I wanted you to know before I died.

480
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,390
This!

481
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,663
This is the first thing
on my bucket list

482
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,936
and the last one as well.

483
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,185
This is Yoon Jung Eun.

484
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:10,811
Welcome.

485
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,280
Traffic was awful, wasn't it?

486
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,747
There's no one here.

487
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,450
No guests or employees.

488
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:20,788
I wanted to have a private
talk with you, PD.

489
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,156
I bet.

490
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,558
Do you like coffee?

491
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,936
I feel so wronged.

492
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:41,408
Sin Jun Young kept pressuring
me and saying nonsense.

493
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,479
You didn't really believe that, right?

494
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:50,330
I didn't kill your father
in that hit and run, PD No.

495
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,418
I remember.

496
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,656
The face of the one who killed my dad.

497
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,076
Dad!

498
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,683
Hey!!

499
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,286
Stop!!

500
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,454
I saw it clearly.

501
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,559
Why didn't I realize it sooner?
How stupid of me.

502
00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:40,034
Have you been fine and happy ever since?

503
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,448
I'm telling you just in case
you might misunderstand.

504
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,885
I'm not admitting to anything.

505
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:04,291
Think of this as some form of consolation
for all that heartache, PD No.

506
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,472
I'm sending that to the broadcasting
station. No edits, no cuts.

507
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:24,345
And I'll take this money to the police
as yet another piece of evidence.

508
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,849
Do you really think
that will be possible?

509
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,780
A mere freelancer PD like you...

510
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,187
I'll make it possible.

511
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,123
Though I might be a mere producer,

512
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,460
the strong don't always win.

513
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:43,930
But the Shin Jun Young you
love so much will suffer too.

514
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:48,500
If one does wrong, they should be punished
accordingly. Whoever they might be.

515
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:50,104
Listen up, No Eul.

516
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:56,420
You made this expensive coffee, but
what to do? I haven't even touched it.

517
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:00,047
And all this...

518
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,020
you can stuff it down your throat.

519
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,590
Hey!

520
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,928
Stop right there. I said
to stop right there!

521
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,898
Stop there, No Eul!

522
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,577
Honey.

523
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,515
What are you thinking about?

524
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,240
No. It's nothing.

525
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,386
Please take your herbal medicine.

526
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:41,522
Ji Tae.

527
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,729
Please tell me of a solution.

528
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,930
Exactly what are you talking about?

529
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,499
It seems with my ability,

530
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:56,070
there is no way to block you and father.

531
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:01,408
You and father have already become
monsters that I cannot handle.

532
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,743
Ji Tae.

533
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,147
Please think of a way to
block the both of you.

534
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,950
Is there none?

535
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,620
Father is tired. Stop talking
nonsense and go upstairs.

536
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:14,530
Father.

537
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,355
Yes.

538
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:19,593
There doesn't seem to
be any unfortunately.

539
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,504
Ki Chul.

540
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,275
Gather the reporters right now.

541
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,780
I'm about to reveal news
about my father and mother

542
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:43,717
that will shock and surprise everyone.

543
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,619
Ji Tae!

544
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:50,290
What do you think about this solution?
With something of this caliber,

545
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,861
-don't you think I'll be able to block you?
-Are you in your right mind right now?

546
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,130
Please cheer me on, Father.

547
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,233
So that I can win for sure.

548
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:07,908
It has been revealed that Hallyu star Sin Jun
Young has been fighting a terminal illness.

549
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,443
Exclusive from Reporter Sin Hye Jin.

550
00:52:09,443 --> 00:52:13,113
Top star Sin Jun Young visited the
hospital over severe headache.

551
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:17,750
He was diagnosed with brainstem gliomas.
To his close friends and family...

552
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,380
-Did you enjoy your meal?
-Yes.

553
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:22,823
He's been fighting his illness
alone drawing regrets from others.

554
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,093
That'll be $81.50.

555
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,262
I think the bill is incorrect.

556
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,120
Sin Jun Young who has been
leading the Hallyu wave...

557
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:36,937
After the yukaejang stew, you had boiled pork, two
orders of dumplings, and three bottles of soju.

558
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:39,506
You forgot that you placed another
order of dumplings, right?

559
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:41,308
Yes.

560
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,183
One moment, yes?

561
00:52:49,783 --> 00:52:53,520
No, I heard of that article but I'm
in the middle of confirming it.

562
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,722
Reporter Kim, I'll call
you back in 30 minutes.

563
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,328
What are you two doing? Why are
you not answering the phones?

564
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:11,605
Yes.

565
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:15,142
We don't have any plans for
a press conference yet.

566
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:19,313
I haven't met Jun Young either.
Excuse me, but...

567
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,516
Is our Jun Young...

568
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:25,886
really dying?

569
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:54,715
Hey, hey, hey! This is awesome. Sin
Jun Young is really going to die?

570
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:57,918
Whoa! Hey, by any chance,

571
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,760
-is he dying because he did drugs?
-It's not the drugs...

572
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:04,858
-Well, from brainstem or something like that.
-Brainstem?

573
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,210
Wow! Sin Jun Young. How could a guy
with everything die when it's so unfair?

574
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,064
Gosh, I know, right?

575
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:13,700
What do you mean by that?

576
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,394
I'll be there in ten minutes.

577
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,462
Are all the reporters there?

578
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,732
I got it. I will be right there.

579
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:52,833
Good job, Cheetah.

580
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:01,208
Hey, did you see that wench's expression
earlier? I think we succeeded perfectly.

581
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,177
I think she was totally fooled into
believing that you're my girlfriend.

582
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:09,549
How about being an actress this time?

583
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,553
I got it, I got it.
I'll let it go twice.

584
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:21,528
I couldn't sleep because I was studying for
exams. Just let me lie here for ten minutes.

585
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:29,403
I think I'm going to get straight A's again this
time. If I get a scholarship, I'll treat you.

586
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:33,173
-Jun Young.
-I'm really going to sleep.

587
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,108
Don't wake me up.

588
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,979
I'm the crazy wench, why?

589
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,660
What am I doing getting involved
with a psycho like you?

590
00:56:42,783 --> 00:56:45,285
Why would I commit crime?
I'm a law student.

591
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:51,550
That much is enough for today.
I'm going to go home!

592
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,628
I couldn't sleep because I studied for
exams. Let me lie down for 10 minutes.

593
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,398
No thanks. Of the remaining nine
times, I'll count this as two.

594
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:05,272
While you're at it, one more.
Decrease it by three then.

595
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:06,306
Deal.

596
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,746
Since I did well today, one more.

597
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,149
-Decrease it by four.
-Do you want to die?

598
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:27,627
It's called delirium. He can have
hallucination from his memory.

599
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,798
It's a state where the past and the
present are temporarily confused.

600
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:35,235
Don't be surprised. Please embrace him.

601
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:51,284
After that long, difficult,
and painful time,

602
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,187
Jun Young came back again.

603
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:09,302
To the time in his life that he longed
for and wanted to return to the most.

604
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,369
No Eul.

605
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:45,505
I don't want to! I also
want to go on a trip.

606
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:48,608
Where is this place?

607
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,679
-It's the house I built to live with you.
-Let's live together. For 500 years.

608
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:57,083
Create the world that you believe in.

609
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,719
If you don't lose, then win.

610
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:05,158
Does this make any sense? Our
Jun Young is only 28 years old!

611
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,627
What am I going to do when I
feel so sorry for my child?

612
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:12,032
Whatever it is, I'll do everything
you ask me to do. Our Jun Young...

613
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:13,900
Please save him.

614
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,102
Do you want to go back to that pit?

615
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:17,871
This is a video of Yoon
Jeong Eun's confession.

616
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,041
What's the real reason
