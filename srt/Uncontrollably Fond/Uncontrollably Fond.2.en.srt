=Episode 2=

2
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,250
YEAR 2006.

3
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,305
Who are you?

4
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,408
I am Eul of the hoddeok shop.

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,510
Thank you.

6
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,890
Grandma, you're going to freeze
to death trying to be stylish!

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,550
It's OK!

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,087
What are you going to do
if you give these to me?

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,989
I'm hot, hot.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,300
What should I do? I feel badly.

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,127
I'll take the rest of theses boxes, so you go on
a date with the grandpa from the dry cleaner's.

12
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,298
You look too pretty to go straight home.

13
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,140
$2.10 for hoddeok and
$1.00 for ddeokbokki.

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,948
Your total is $3.10.

15
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,117
Ddol Ddol! Forget paying him!

16
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,485
Eul noona!

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,600
-Now give me the money.
-Oh!

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,256
Our flower boy, how embarrassing!
You have a runny nose.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,398
Why are you paying? I told you, if there's anything
you want, think of it as yours and take it for free.

20
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,635
Go quickly! You dad and
sibling must be waiting.

21
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:27,571
Thank you!

22
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,311
Aren't you just a saint?

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,510
Are we wealthy? Do you think I'm working for no
reason? Do you know how much debt we're in?

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,200
His dad fell at a construction site, he can't go to
work! Do you want to take money from that kid?

25
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,490
I do. So much.

26
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:50,961
Your dad doesn't have the money
to buy a pair of clothes.

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,797
He can't even eat what he
wants and is getting skinny.

28
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,410
If we just collect the money
that you gave to others,

29
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,420
I wouldn't need to sell
out in the cold streets!

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,290
I could just sit around in

31
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,177
a building with a good heater and...

32
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:08,030
No Eul!

33
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,313
What's up with her?

34
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,260
Eul, I heard that the Il Jin kids called
out Moon to the gym to teach him a lesson.

35
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,860
What? Who do they think they are to be teaching
her a lesson? These jerks I will just...

36
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,257
Don't you dare go.

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,560
Did I tell you to meddle
or not in others' affairs?

38
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,998
She's not a stranger. She's my friend.

39
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:29,199
Let's go.

40
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,903
Hey Eul! Eul! Eul!

41
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,473
Hey! Are you 911? Are you the police?

42
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,144
Are you Wonder Woman? Treat your
father the way you do others, girl!

43
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,581
I can't believe she's my daughter.

44
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,118
I hope she slips on an icy road.

45
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:00,463
What is this?

46
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,600
Did something happen?

47
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,220
Suspension? What do you mean my
Jun Young is getting suspended?

48
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,205
Mother!

49
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:11,374
Principal!

50
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,311
She's the mother of Sin Jun Young, the
student who is receiving punishment, Mother.

51
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,247
What did my Jun Young do wrong?

52
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,917
Because those gangsters kept on bothering
a young and weak girl like her,

53
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,090
he told them not to do it and
hit them a little for it.

54
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,056
And he got hit too.

55
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,780
An award wouldn't be enough.
What do you mean suspension?

56
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,895
Mother...

57
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,699
Since you're a witness, tell
everything in front of the teachers.

58
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,070
Tell them how my Jun Young is being wrongfully
punished because he tried to save you!

59
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:41,838
Tell them everything!

60
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,320
Why aren't you saying anything?

61
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,481
Ma'am... According to this girl,
those boys never bothered her.

62
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,984
They were just talking but...

63
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,288
Sin Jun Young provoked
them and hit them first.

64
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,392
Oh my god. That doesn't make sense.

65
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,269
Did you really say that to them?

66
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,838
Why are you lying?

67
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,643
Did your parents make you?

68
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,715
"Even if he saved your life, instead of a poor son
of a widow who doesn't even have a cent to his name,

69
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:27,851
it's better to take the side of a rich
family son with connections,

70
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:29,919
at least you can get something out of it."

71
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:32,450
Did your parents tell you to do that?

72
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,623
Mother!

73
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,480
Bad wench. You don't even
know how to be grateful!

74
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,130
You horrible wench!

75
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,466
-Mommy!
-What are you doing to a student?

76
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,712
Principal, please cancel the suspension.

77
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:02,185
My Jun Young is going to become a prosecutor.
If you draw a red line like this,

78
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,921
that's the same thing
as telling us to die.

79
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,524
I'll take responsibility and
make sure he's careful so...

80
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,061
I won't let him even write
the "f" in "fist" so...

81
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,200
please, please cancel the
suspension, Principal.

82
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,471
Please, please take it back.

83
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:27,260
Hey! I heard Sin Jun
Young got suspended.

84
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,247
I know, right? Why doesn't he know
his place and stay out of things?

85
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,256
Can I ask you something?

86
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,458
What is this jerk saying?

87
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:42,992
Can't you figure it out already?

88
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:49,099
How noble we are that someone like you from
a lowly family should never lay a finger on?

89
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:58,220
I know. When someone as lowly
as me dared to interrupt

90
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,610
what such noble and great
young masters were doing,

91
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,448
don't you think it's a bit lame
to end things with a suspension?

92
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:12,789
So... I'm thinking of
smashing one of you guys and

93
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,126
just getting expelled.

94
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,696
If you want to volunteer,
raise your hand.

95
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:26,403
Sit straight. This kid still
hasn't come to his senses.

96
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:28,772
If I come to my sense, what will change?

97
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:30,673
-What, rascal?
-If I come to my senses,

98
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:33,643
will you take proper legal action against them
while ignoring all their family connections?

99
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,320
This kid. Hey! Hey!

100
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,284
I took pity on you because
you had a tough childhood!

101
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:44,621
Why do I look pitiful to you? Who
are you to look at me pitifully?

102
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,600
Aren't you going to let go?
What kind of jerk...

103
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,096
Stop right there! If you want to
continue to feed yourself with that hand.

104
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,399
Is our Jun Young a
neighborhood drum or something?

105
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,390
Even a neighborhood drum will tear,
if you keep hitting it like that.

106
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,375
Really, if you keep looking down
on him and mistreating him,

107
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,243
I'm going to bring his father too!

108
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,980
When he comes, you won't be able
to keep sitting in that chair.

109
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:14,751
You'll be flat on the floor,

110
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,030
begging for forgiveness to overlook it.

111
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,987
Uncle...

112
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,089
Oh really?

113
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,694
Then please bring this
student's father over here!

114
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:27,330
I was getting curious
what kind of person he is

115
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,910
when his kid is sitting here like this.

116
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,939
Let's do that then! He is incredibly
busy working for this country.

117
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:41,840
But still, if he knows that his son is like this, he
will stop everything he's doing and run over here.

118
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,812
Stop it, Uncle.

119
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:45,782
Just wait. When his father gets here,

120
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:51,754
those darn kids' fathers and even the
director of criminal division or whatever,

121
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,891
-they will all die!
-I told you to stop!

122
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,335
How can a dead person come here?
Say something that makes sense.

123
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,304
As the result of DNA test from victim's blood...

124
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:10,540
found on the metal pipe which
was collected at the victim's factory,

125
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,877
aside from the seven
victims already murdered,

126
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,081
we found the DNA from an
additional two female victims.

127
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,690
Currently these DNA samples are being...

128
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,921
Hurry and eat this, so you won't
ever go back to place like that.

129
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,557
Don't ever say those crazy words again.

130
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,261
It may not be false...

131
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,630
This was not a simple fire.

132
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:37,133
This was arson by the culprit to
destroy the scene of the crime.

133
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,270
What's the reason you
come to that conclusion?

134
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,342
What will you do if that
man is your father?

135
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:52,849
I said what are you going to do if that
amazing prosecutor is your father?

136
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,987
I will kill him. He
abandoned my mom and me.

137
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,060
He's eating and dressing well by
himself and coming out on television.

138
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,564
Did he do it on purpose? He probably
doesn't even know that you were born.

139
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,935
Your mom hid her pregnancy and ran away.
So how would he know about you?

140
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,777
What are you saying?

141
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:35,858
I mean... What I'm saying
is that it's possible...

142
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:47,870
I was out of my mind because of you
and start babbling to myself...

143
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,640
Where are you going?
You didn't even eat.

144
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,030
I'm going to ask mom myself
about what you just said.

145
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,390
If your mom finds out that I
talked to you about that man,

146
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,951
with her temperament, she'll kill
three generations of my family.

147
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,900
She'll even kill my Gook
Young and Man Young.

148
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,489
Sit.

149
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,368
Your father hid the fact that
he was attending law school

150
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,905
and worked as a waiter
at a noraebang bar.

151
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:27,276
While your mom was cutting
fruit in the bar's kitchen,

152
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:31,948
their eyes met.

153
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:38,588
Your mother wasn't very good in school,

154
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:41,958
but she had a pretty face.

155
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:50,980
Jun Young. Your mom would kill me
if she knew I told you about this.

156
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,336
You can't let her know.
Do you understand?

157
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,856
But one day, someone showed up saying
he was Choi Hyeon Joon's older brother

158
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,996
and told your mother that Hyeon Joon is a
student at the nation's best law school

159
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,465
and that he's someone who's
going to become prosecutor.

160
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:27,136
So, a woman cutting fruit in a darn bar

161
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:30,606
definitely wasn't good enough for him.

162
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:31,941
Mother.

163
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:39,348
Your mom may be rough
on the outside, but

164
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,218
do you know how kind and
gentle she is on the inside?

165
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,755
She realized all too well her position.

166
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,760
If it was for your father, she
would've died if someone told her to.

167
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,400
Why are you sitting out here instead
of going inside? Did you wait for me?

168
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,038
Why did they release a gangster
who goes around hitting others?

169
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,242
They should've just locked you up
in jail. Why did they release you?

170
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,045
They said there's no space because
there are too many bad guys.

171
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,981
They told me to cause another
accident and come back.

172
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,249
What?

173
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,087
You didn't eat yet, right?
I'm hungry too.

174
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:25,094
There's no food for you! If you're hungry, go
back to the police and ask for rice with beans!

175
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:36,539
They give rice with beans in jail, not at the police
station. What is my uneducated mother going to do?

176
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,822
Aren't you going to ask your son to eat?
So petty.

177
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:07,236
That's the reason she is determined to make you a
prosecutor even though you're last in your class.

178
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,007
That was all because of your father.

179
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:17,113
Before she dies, she wanted to make you a
prosecutor to go face your dad just once

180
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:26,255
and show him that she
raised you well by herself.

181
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,925
She wanted to flaunt it.

182
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:45,808
I'm not going to get tutored.
Fire the tutor tomorrow.

183
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,222
Do you think a $1500 tutor makes sense
when we're living in a $300 half-basement?

184
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:09,098
Why did you save that witch?
Since when were you such a hero?

185
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:13,236
You're the type of person who doesn't even
care if a person dies in front of them!

186
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,839
Right? I think I went crazy for a bit.

187
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,509
After I found out that you're working
at a bar to make money for my tuition.

188
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,970
Wake up mom. I am stupid
because I take after you.

189
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,001
Did you honestly think I could become a
prosecutor just because you got me a tutor?

190
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,804
That's right! From now on, whether your life
becomes rice or porridge, I won't interfere so

191
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:53,676
whether you make money off beating
people up or eat rice with beans in jail,

192
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:56,812
live as you want! You brat.

193
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,616
Hello I'm Susan...

194
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,553
Thank you.

195
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,395
It's Sin Jun Young! Sin Jun Young!
Daebak! Daebak!

196
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,168
Hey! Hey! Move! Move!

197
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,707
What's up with that man?

198
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:10,579
You get a lot of calls from the
entertainment industry, right?

199
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:18,454
You'll find out once you sign our contract,
but we're a different level from other companies.

200
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,790
If you make some time...

201
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:44,373
Excuse me.

202
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:51,680
Why are you ignoring me?

203
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:55,551
I sent you seven messages
to meet me for a second.

204
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:01,724
You're not my style.

205
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,260
You're not my style either.

206
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,435
Ever since you dumped Na Ri, she has been
laying in bed sick refusing to eat or drink.

207
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:14,803
What are you going to do?

208
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,338
How could there be anything I should do?

209
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:19,710
Because of you my friend
can't eat or sleep.

210
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,510
What does that have to do with me?

211
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,480
Because of you, my friend said
that she's going to die.

212
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,481
Tell her to die then.

213
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,983
If she dies, you're going
to die in my hands too!

214
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:40,296
She's in a serious state! She won't eat,
sleep, or come to school! All she does is cry.

215
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,298
Can't you go easy on her?

216
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:46,101
Can't you just save her and
break up with her later?

217
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,504
Just wait until she is a bit more ready...

218
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:49,805
Is this your new part-time job?

219
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,408
How much are you being paid to do this?

220
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,143
Hey!

221
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:09,458
What are you doing?

222
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,797
I don't think you're in your right mind.
Go to the hospital.

223
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,367
Want me to call your parents for you?

224
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,382
Stop crying.

225
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,819
Let's eat something, friend, OK?

226
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,757
I brought my dad's sweet pancakes
and blood sausages that you like.

227
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:44,827
I'm not eating it.

228
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,266
Because I'm just going to
live like this and then die.

229
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:53,402
Why would you die for a
worthless guy like him?

230
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,304
Is he the only guy in this world?

231
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:59,375
You're Sooyoori's Son Ye Jin.

232
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:02,040
Should we line up all
the guys who like you?

233
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,380
If it's not Jun Young,
I don't need them all.

234
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:09,918
No Eul, it must be good for you

235
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,488
because Jun Young isn't your type.

236
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:16,191
Because you don't like
guys like Jun Young.

237
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,196
What brings you here to
get your hair done here?

238
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,066
I'm going to confess.

239
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:01,003
To who? The guy than you said
you had a one-sided-crush on?

240
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:06,475
So please give me a hairstyle
that will blow him away.

241
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:07,343
OK.

242
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:15,117
Pretty Na Ri.

243
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:19,154
You know that pink dress
that you wore last time?

244
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,524
Could you let me borrow
it for exactly 3 hours?

245
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:29,531
It's because I have to do
something important today.

246
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:33,569
I think you'll get a
brother-in-law soon, Girl!

247
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,340
I'll tell you who it is if
you lend me your dress.

248
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,945
OK. I'll see you later to
pick it up from your house.

249
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,889
Sin Jun Young.

250
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,925
I'm No Eul,

251
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,063
and I've liked you
since a long time ago.

252
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,835
I know you're super
popular with everyone,

253
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,372
but even so, you're fated to be with me.

254
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,477
You can't escape from me...

255
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,616
You won't perhaps confess
like this, right, No Eul?

256
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,240
Mr. Jang Soo!

257
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,076
Did you sell a lot of sweet pancakes?

258
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,580
This wench. You drank alcohol, right?

259
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,651
Why would a high school student drink alcohol?
Can a daughter not act cute to her father?

260
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,019
Why?

261
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,322
Do you need money again?

262
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,160
From your friends, you got another who doesn't
have enough money to go to school anymore, right?

263
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,899
Do you think we're rich? Do you think I sell dirt
or something? Do you know how much debt we're in?

264
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,102
Dad.

265
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,938
Please buy me a glass of alcohol.

266
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,675
You crazy girl. Just
come home and sleep!

267
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,917
As expected, a bloodline is a bloodline.

268
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,721
Seeing that he knows I'm a crazy girl.

269
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,199
I woke you up, right, Jik?

270
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,669
I came to see Dad as a surprise.

271
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,891
I'm going to go on a date with
Dad, so wash up and sleep.

272
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,262
Dad!

273
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:26,902
Hey!

274
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,404
Hey!

275
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,040
Stay right there!

276
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,012
Hey!

277
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,915
Stay right there!

278
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,911
Yes, this is Choi Hyeon Joon.

279
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,014
This is Yoon Seong Ho, Mr. Choi.

280
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,887
Yes, Assemblyman Yoon.

281
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,825
Just a moment.

282
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,905
What is it at this time of day?

283
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,309
My daughter has caused an accident.
I need you to help her out.

284
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,187
Student, the time is up.

285
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,030
Current affairs Journal  An
executor of Law and Justice.

286
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,052
The person who hit your father
has just came in and confessed.

287
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,260
This man is the hit-and-run criminal?

288
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,506
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

289
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,942
No, it's not this man.

290
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,412
The hit-and-run criminal is a woman.

291
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,230
A red sport car with the
license Seoul 3-Ga-3216!

292
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,590
I'm sorry, I did something terrible!

293
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,256
Ahjusshi, what did you do that
you're apologizing? It wasn't you.

294
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,859
You didn't do that to my father!
Why are you lying?

295
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,000
Yeah, I'm coming out of the
subway terminal right now.

296
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,603
Because I thought there would
be traffic, I used the subway.

297
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,441
I left my car at the parking lot
of the prosecutor's office.

298
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,410
I'll be there in 10 minutes,

299
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,680
so tell the Chief Prosecutor that.

300
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,118
Oh, this...

301
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,086
What is this?

302
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,656
Darn it.

303
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,503
You're going to the
Prosecutor's Office, right?

304
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,090
Yes, how do you know that?

305
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,508
Well, you are a famous Prosecutor.

306
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,376
You come out on television too.

307
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,550
My dream is to become a Prosecutor.

308
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,857
I'm also planning to go to the
college that you went to.

309
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,827
You must be good at studying.

310
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,363
Well...

311
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,267
Your parents must be proud of you.

312
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,705
You're certain of your dream

313
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,975
and you look to be even more certain in
your willpower to fulfill that dream.

314
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:05,347
I raise a child as well. But the kids
these days are really not to be desired.

315
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,783
They don't have dreams nor convictions.

316
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:10,785
Even more, they don't have willpower.

317
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,490
I envy your parents.

318
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,170
The rain has stopped.

319
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,409
It must have been just a shower.

320
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,012
Please go in well.

321
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,080
Because of you, I came here well.

322
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,157
Later, let's see each other
again with you as my junior.

323
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,960
Yes.

324
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:02,904
Student.

325
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,976
I'm the type of person who can't leave debts
unpaid so just stay here for 10 minutes.

326
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,311
Do you have the time?

327
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,949
Yes, I have time.

328
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,251
Your car was hit by this student...

329
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,324
Has my car done something wrong to you?

330
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,665
I kept visiting for over 20 times, but
you, saying you were busy or not here,

331
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,500
kept avoiding me.

332
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,838
So I figured if I didn't do something like
this, you wouldn't have met someone like me.

333
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,875
Send everyone out.

334
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,809
OK.

335
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:27,322
OK, so what was the reason you had to meet
me that you had to go through such lengths?

336
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,795
My father's hit-and-run case

337
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,964
can't end like this.

338
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,466
The criminal has not been caught yet.

339
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,236
The man who turned himself
in is not the criminal.

340
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,207
To put it bluntly, if you
say it like that, I...

341
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,910
Let's see here.

342
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:55,050
In the organization, we each
have our domain, duty and rank.

343
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,819
I don't know why you came to see me,

344
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,755
but I can't get involved
with everything.

345
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,524
The cop told me this.

346
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,227
That right when you intervened,
everything changed.

347
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,550
The criminal changed, the car changed,
the witness testimony changed,

348
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,434
and the prosecutor in
charge was also changed.

349
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,706
Will you go and tell the cop this?

350
00:34:19,874 --> 00:34:23,745
That if he has the time to make up stupid lies,
then he should do an investigation better.

351
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:26,114
He said that he thinks there is
someone with great power behind it.

352
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,982
He said it's like hitting
a boulder with eggs.

353
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,540
He told me that this isn't
a fight I could win,

354
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,690
and that I should keep my mouth shut
and accept the settlement money.

355
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:37,459
I don't have the time to continue
to listen to your 3rd rate story.

356
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,530
I'm sorry to make you go
back when you came this far.

357
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:48,369
I never told you where I
live and where I came from.

358
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,777
You already knew who I was, right?
That's why you kept avoiding me, right?

359
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,447
Prosecutor, you hid the real culprit
and covered it up, right...

360
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,250
Since I've never seen this
school uniform around here,

361
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,954
I thought you lived far away.

362
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,457
Go back home quietly.

363
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:15,690
Because you're same age with my daughter, I was
being considerate but my patience ends here.

364
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,160
I'm jealous of your parents.

365
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,373
You like it that much?

366
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:05,610
Because of you, there's someone who hasn't
even eaten yet. Are you that happy over that?

367
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,984
Have you not gone to the hospital? Dangerous
person like you shouldn't be walking around.

368
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,320
I don't know what that
girl likes in you.

369
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:16,658
If she was my daughter, I'd have broken
her leg to stop her from seeing you.

370
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:26,801
Jerk like you becoming a prosecutor
is what makes this world a problem.

371
00:36:27,202 --> 00:36:30,138
I heard that's why you dumped Na Ri-because
she was getting in the way of your studies.

372
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,342
But does someone who couldn't even get into the top
200 have the studies to be get in the way of?

373
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,140
From now on, don't meet a girl or date

374
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:51,893
or marry. Just study for the rest
of your life, get old, and die!

375
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:57,131
If you study until your 80, wouldn't you think that
you'd pass the Prosecutor test and get accepted?

376
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,515
I'm sorry I kept you
waiting for a long time.

377
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,152
Here. A present for letting
me share your umbrella.

378
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,622
Oh! Wait a moment.

379
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,826
What's your name? Since you're a
junior that I will meet later on.

380
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,995
I'll need to sign it and give it to you.

381
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,363
Next time.

382
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:35,103
I'll study hard and come back with my passing
test results, so give it to me then.

383
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,939
I'll give my name to you then too.

384
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,241
OK, then.

385
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,445
Until then, I'll keep this safe.

386
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,583
Yes, thank you.

387
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,248
I'm sorry, but do you think you could move to
the seat in the back? She's my friend, you see.

388
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,451
He is not my friend.

389
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,604
Then you try to seduce me.

390
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,743
What kind of a crazy jerk would give up on
his lover, who he could die for, for studying?

391
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,380
Only if he doesn't love her to the
point that he could die for her.

392
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,583
So that's why you should
try and seduce me.

393
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,453
Make me so crazy about
you that I can't study.

394
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,957
That I can't dream of
becoming a Prosecutor.

395
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,635
If you can't seduce me, I'll seduce you.

396
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,050
Thank you. Please read
it once, thank you.

397
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,218
Thank you.

398
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,763
Eul! Are you sleeping?

399
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,633
I'm not sleeping.

400
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,506
Did you find a part time employee
for chicken restaurant?

401
00:41:32,273 --> 00:41:32,707
Why?

402
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:34,809
If you didn't, I was
going to ask if I can do it.

403
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,211
You don't have money these days, right?

404
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:40,214
Your dad's hospital
bills must be no joke.

405
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,283
I can just earn money.

406
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,218
Can't you just settle?

407
00:41:44,986 --> 00:41:46,500
He's not a victim so
how could we settle?

408
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,940
Sin Jun Young! It's Sin
Jun Young, right?

409
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,557
Yeah, it's Sin Jun Young.

410
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:53,628
Is he going to give it to someone?

411
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:02,303
It's really Sin Jun Young!
Is he here to meet with Na Ri?

412
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,250
Because he regrets dumping her?
Or maybe to date her again?

413
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,944
Hey! Don't interfere in others' affairs.

414
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,181
Look who's talking.

415
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:47,315
I cut class since it's our 100th day anniversary,
but you just go without even glancing at me?

416
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,651
What? 100 day anniversary? Who?

417
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:59,560
Happy 100 days. I love you, Eul.

418
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:21,382
You're so cute. I can't
study because of you.

419
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,120
Oh! Na Ri! Na Ri!

420
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,623
Na Ri... Na Ri...

421
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:30,324
Na Ri...

422
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:34,729
Let's not hide something
that's happened.

423
00:43:36,263 --> 00:43:38,032
I'm the bad guy, what
wrong have you done?

424
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,790
You crazy jerk, what are you saying?

425
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,070
Just stay still. I told
you I would do it myself.

426
00:43:43,437 --> 00:43:46,907
It just happened like this, Na Ri.
I'm sorry!

427
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,744
Find a better guy than me, OK?

428
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:16,971
What happened? You're a guy who may or
may not smile once in his lifetime.

429
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:20,841
Did you see rolling
horse dung on your way?

430
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,447
Not a horse's dung, but
I just did a warning.

431
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:29,216
This girl, you saw me wrong...

432
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,453
What are you murmuring?

433
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,993
-Uncle...
-Yeah, why?

434
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:42,897
Why am I, a human, so evil? Who do
I take after that I'm like this?

435
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,638
Are you going crazy from studying
for the first time in your life?

436
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,576
Oh my, it really must be that.

437
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:59,680
Stop studying to become a Prosecutor.

438
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,116
It seems that not anyone can study.

439
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,554
This brat. What are we going
to do with him? Stop laughing!

440
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,889
Ugh! Jerk.

441
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,057
Who?

442
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,862
Sin Jun Young. How do I kill this guy?

443
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,530
Jun Young hyung?

444
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,568
That guy is not a hyung.
He's not a hyung or a human.

445
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,236
He's a son of a...

446
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,005
Dad, sister is cursing!

447
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:29,443
It's not a curse but a fact, dad.

448
00:45:30,044 --> 00:45:34,849
Because of that guy, I stole a friend's
boyfriend and now all the girls hate me.

449
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:40,950
Dad, wake up quickly and take
revenge for your daughter.

450
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,557
Are you telling dad to
wake up for your revenge?

451
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,659
How old are you?

452
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,361
This punk, to your sister right now...!

453
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:50,464
Dad, wake up quickly and buy me pizza.

454
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:52,900
Cheese crust, sweet potato, and bacon.

455
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,737
Then what about you? Are you asking
dad to wake up quickly for pizza?

456
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,939
That's why you're a kid.

457
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,142
Go watch cartoons, child No Jik.

458
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,060
Dad, please wake up quickly,

459
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:09,750
and slap Sin Jun Young with
your sweet pancake spatula...

460
00:46:14,388 --> 00:46:15,289
Dad!

461
00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:17,491
What kind of talk is that
coming out of a girl's mouth?

462
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,520
Dad! Wake up quickly and punish sister!

463
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:21,796
Dad!

464
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:24,732
Nurse!

465
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:41,081
Time of death: 23:40.

466
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,591
No! Dad, don't die!

467
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,862
Doctor, save our dad!

468
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:58,040
Sister! Tell him to save our dad!

469
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,340
Dad...

470
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:02,100
Tell him to save our dad, sister!

471
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,871
I'm sorry.

472
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,803
The hotcake stand man passed away.

473
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,739
Whoa. I heard he had a hit-and-run
accident a few days ago.

474
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,242
He passed away in the end.

475
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,377
Eul's household is so pitiful.

476
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:48,582
My mom said she didn't even hold a
funeral and left with her brother.

477
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,551
Why? Where did she go?

478
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,721
I don't know where she went.

479
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,424
But after Eul's dad passed away,
it seems that the debt is no joke.

480
00:47:57,725 --> 00:47:59,994
Eul's mom passed away
after being really sick.

481
00:48:00,227 --> 00:48:01,762
So why did they run away in
the middle of the night?

482
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:04,260
Wouldn't it be because the loan
sharks kept bothering them?

483
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:07,434
They even went to find them at the funeral
homes, and to those pitiful kids...

484
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,370
It was no joke.

485
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:13,574
Jun Young, I heard you were dating Eul.
But you didn't know anything?

486
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,155
Where is this that you
dare to come here?

487
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,092
This mortuary is made from
us gathering our money!

488
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:35,580
You guys made it so that a funeral couldn't
be held, so we're making one instead!

489
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:37,798
You are less than salted fish jerks!

490
00:48:37,898 --> 00:48:41,640
Harassing our Eul and Jik so much that
they ran away isn't enough for you guys?

491
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:44,240
Did you come here to get
some more money from them?

492
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,650
What kick out? Who kicked them out? Those insolent
punks ran off into the night with our money!

493
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:53,150
They took your money? What kind of money do
they have that you threaten them like that!

494
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,416
Do you have no children?

495
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:56,600
I'm going to go crazy.

496
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,319
So why did they borrow someone else's money?

497
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,020
If you borrow money, you should
repay it even by selling your body!

498
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,489
Why you...

499
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:31,552
Mr. No Jang Soo, who was a victim
of a hit-and-run, died last night.

500
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:41,295
As for the criminal who turned himself in, I made it
so that he was sentenced to two years of probation.

501
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:47,067
You really suffered a lot.

502
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,205
I will not forget this grace
for the rest of my life.

503
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,742
How is Yoon Jeong Eun doing?

504
00:49:54,942 --> 00:49:57,378
The same night, I sent her
to the United States.

505
00:49:57,811 --> 00:49:59,847
That young kid must have
been shaken up a lot.

506
00:50:00,848 --> 00:50:05,252
I think she needs to travel
around and calm herself down.

507
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,890
Because of this small mistake,

508
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,960
you won't break our promise
to become in-laws, right?

509
00:50:18,332 --> 00:50:19,533
Of course.

510
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,970
The call cannot be answered and
will be connected to voice mail.

511
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,242
Jung Tae Ho.

512
00:51:02,743 --> 00:51:03,477
Yes.

513
00:51:04,678 --> 00:51:08,382
You did well. Try a bit harder to
beat your sunbae Ho Cheol next time.

514
00:51:08,382 --> 00:51:09,683
Yes, I understand.

515
00:51:12,019 --> 00:51:13,287
Sin Jun Young!

516
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:14,755
Jun Young!

517
00:51:16,757 --> 00:51:17,791
Jun Young!

518
00:51:18,225 --> 00:51:22,529
Jun Young improved the
most on this test.

519
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:27,167
His placement in school went
vertical over 100 places.

520
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,320
This is a waste to see it alone.

521
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:42,182
He nods off regardless of time and
place every chance he gets.

522
00:51:42,382 --> 00:51:45,810
You are not like a sick chick, and you
are at the age who can digest metal.

523
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,957
How will you support your
wife and kids like this?

524
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,826
Why would I support
my wife and the kids?

525
00:51:52,926 --> 00:51:54,528
They can support me.

526
00:51:58,765 --> 00:52:03,070
This is really waste to watch it alone.
Give it to me.

527
00:52:04,471 --> 00:52:07,307
Pick up the pace! The
teachers must be hungry.

528
00:52:07,307 --> 00:52:08,642
OK.

529
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,879
-Go to work!
-It hurts, Dad!

530
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:15,415
Do you think I hit you because you were itching? Of
course I hit you to hurt you, you twerp.

531
00:52:15,415 --> 00:52:16,850
Don't cuss at me.

532
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:21,330
What kind of talk is that telling your kid to be
struck by lightning? I'll go to my mother.

533
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,958
OK go! Get lost!

534
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:27,828
Just how pathetic must you have been,

535
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:30,831
for your mother to give up on you
after raising you for 20 years?

536
00:52:31,165 --> 00:52:33,900
And send you to me to raise you?

537
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:38,005
That's because that Ahjussi only
likes his own son and hates me.

538
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:42,910
-That's why she did it because it upsets her.
-Oppa! I told you to pick up the pace!

539
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:49,483
Take some ddeok here, too.

540
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,385
Hope it's to your liking.

541
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:52,890
-Take this.
-Enjoy it.

542
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,390
Oh my! Don't stand there
and come and eat!

543
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,158
Come in.

544
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,197
Is it to your liking?

545
00:53:04,064 --> 00:53:06,867
Oh my! Mr. Principal!

546
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:10,370
Welcome Mr. Principal!

547
00:53:10,704 --> 00:53:14,374
-What's all this?
-Thanks to your teachers fine teaching,

548
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:18,612
Jun Young's score went up the
most in the school, I heard.

549
00:53:19,046 --> 00:53:22,480
How can I just not do
anything as his mother?

550
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,518
I really baekgul...

551
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,040
-Baekgul...
-Nanmang, nanmang.

552
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:29,923
-Thank you Teacher.
-I told her not to use big words.

553
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:33,120
I'm really grateful. Please sit down.

554
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:01,221
Hello?

555
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:03,991
Hello?

556
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:06,126
Hello?!

557
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:07,894
No Eul?

558
00:54:08,629 --> 00:54:11,398
It's that call again? I am not No Eul!

559
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:14,501
Just how many times have you called?
It's annoying.

560
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,535
Why would I? Why would I
be so concerned about her?

561
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:51,305
Ah, forget it.

562
00:55:02,115 --> 00:55:03,083
Yes?

563
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:07,030
-Hello?
-Yes.

564
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,023
By any chance, is this Sin
Jun Young's phone number?

565
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:16,330
I am Eul. No Eul.

566
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:27,200
I heard it from Eun Young's grandmother that you
held my father's picture to his grave site.

567
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,978
Thank you, Sin Jun Young.

568
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:50,897
Did you change your mind?

569
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,202
That's why you came back, right?

570
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,942
I'm not only doing this for me.

571
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,946
I'm not doing this just so
I can get a job, you know.

572
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:14,254
This documentary... It really helps that
you're putting out this image of a jerk.

573
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:17,930
To be honest, earning
more money is good...

574
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,959
You don't know me?

575
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,897
I do know you.

576
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:29,780
Even the kids at my landlord's
place all know you.

577
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:30,637
No Eul.

578
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,075
You don't know me?

579
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,145
I know.

580
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,682
You son of a...

581
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:51,324
If I know you...

582
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,529
If I said I know you, will
you film the documentary?

583
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,232
You know you won't.

584
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:05,005
If I say I know you, you'll be more of a jerk
and meaner to me like you did to me before.

585
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:13,440
Thank you for this. I'll spend it well.

586
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:54,287
She can't be Eul... She must not be Eul.

587
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:13,340
She is definitely... not... my Eul.

588
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,674
Have you eaten? I haven't eaten yet.

589
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,478
My darling! Are your classes over?

590
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,550
Oppa, are you getting married
to Unni Yoon Jeong Eun?

591
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,990
Where are you going
to run as a criminal?

592
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,750
Are you looking at me now?
