1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,310
I apologize.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,857
Sorry? What are you sorry about?

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,326
What about and how sorry are you really?

4
00:00:09,408 --> 00:00:11,740
=Episode 15=

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,033
How dare you, how does someone
as insignificant as you dare...

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,804
You are of a level that isn't even worthy
of my jealousy and still you dare...

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,542
I am sorry. I am honestly sorry.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,010
I never intended to hurt you, Director.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,214
I am really sorry...

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,285
If you're that sorry, go die.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,890
If you're so sorry, then get out
right now and go kill yourself.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,728
Go die so Choi Ji Tae will
never get near you again!

13
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:04,381
Jun Young... I had a dream last night.

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,987
And in that dream.

15
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,962
I met you.

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,808
Out of all moments when I was
the most pathetic, embarrassed,

17
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,810
and at the moment I wanted to die.

18
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,884
The doors are closing.

19
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,491
Did your coat eat up the food
you were supposed to eat?

20
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,262
Such a bad coat...

21
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,935
You must be hungry.

22
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,741
Even though I knew it was a dream which would
disappear once I woke up, my heart fluttered,

23
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,010
my heart pounded,

24
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,914
and your hand felt unbelievably warm.

25
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,663
You were hungry, weren't you?

26
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:39,102
Here, have this. I know it looks
gross but it tastes amazing.

27
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,239
It really does!

28
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,684
Oh my God, don't eat that...

29
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,356
I told you not to eat!

30
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,094
You could die if you ate that!

31
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:13,069
It's the first thing you cook
for me, how could I not eat it?

32
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,809
Even if it was just a
dream and it tasted awful.

33
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,414
Have you got any kimchi?

34
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,483
Of course I do.

35
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,985
Do you know how sad,
lonely and torturous

36
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,390
is dreaming something so beautiful
while knowing it's just a dream?

37
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,313
I think I have a cold.

38
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,448
Come on.

39
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,983
I really have a cold, back off.

40
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,858
Come here.

41
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,335
Hey! Hey, Eul!

42
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,582
Are you okay?

43
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,000
Morning, don't come.

44
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,469
-Please don't come near.
-Look at that.

45
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,613
Do you like it?

46
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,205
Don't dare wake me up from this dream.

47
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,242
Whoever does will have to face my
revenge, for their entire life.

48
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,570
You just made someone who came to apologize
to you feel like crap. Congrats.

49
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,330
I'm going to kill that wench.

50
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,643
-Jung Eun!
-I'll make it so she dies by my hands.

51
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,581
You think I can't do that? If she ever comes looking
for you again, there's nothing I couldn't do.

52
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,552
Wasn't what you did once enough?

53
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:24,888
What?

54
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:27,891
Playing around with one's life
because of your immaturity and selfishness?

55
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,528
Wasn't once enough?

56
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,790
What are you trying to say?

57
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,538
You should never say those kinds
of words, not even as a joke.

58
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,008
You can't go.

59
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,810
-Yoon Jung Eun.
-You can't go to that wench?

60
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,213
-Let go.
-It's my birthday today, Ji Tae!

61
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,517
-Stay with me.
-Let go right now!

62
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,318
I can't.

63
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,586
Just let him go.

64
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,102
Let this jerk go and let's
spend some time together.

65
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,673
Tell him go

66
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,075
and let's celebrate your birthday.

67
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,597
Eul!

68
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,177
These are to replace your shoes
the manhole near my house ate up.

69
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,280
This means "Happy birthday to you".

70
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,385
Thanks for saving me
from that situation.

71
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,486
I know right?

72
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,722
I'm not even a guardian
angel or anything, but...

73
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,693
Are you not going to
receive my birthday gift?

74
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,261
Why are you being like this to me?

75
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,732
Why are you playing with my feelings
when you clearly don't want to see me?

76
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,735
How did you know it was
my birthday, anyway?

77
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,077
So if I play with your feelings,
will you let yourself be toyed with?

78
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,251
Instead of planning some
childish eye-for-eye revenge,

79
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,080
instead of trying to make someone regret
losing someone as charming as you

80
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,891
and acting so catty and whiny,

81
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,959
why don't you just sincerely

82
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,164
let yourself be played...

83
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,236
no, why don't you try and
play with my feelings?

84
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,990
But you like No Eul.

85
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,275
So try and sway me with your charms.

86
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,413
Try and make me forget all about Eul.

87
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,152
Make it so only you
will fill my thoughts.

88
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,757
Could you do that?

89
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,132
Yes.

90
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,602
What are you scheming? What made
you come to Jung Eun like that?

91
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,370
I'm trying to help you.

92
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,342
I want to make it easier for you
to pursue the woman you want.

93
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,910
Aren't you thankful?

94
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,912
I bet you're very much so.

95
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,782
Life's all about helping each other.

96
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,620
Don't you think I should do some good
deeds if I want to go to heaven?

97
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,952
Listen up, Mr. Sin Jun Young!

98
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:52,922
If you're so very thankful, buy me
some expensive drinks sometime.

99
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,781
Hey, what should we do?
Someone took all of these!

100
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,684
This girl, really...

101
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,325
All the clothes, shoes, bags that
you left behind were taken away!

102
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
They only left this thing behind!

103
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,431
We can get a refund or sell them or
something if there's anything left!

104
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,632
What are you going to do?

105
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,535
Should I buy them again?

106
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,790
Have you still not got a grip?

107
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,674
Do you know what you've done?

108
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,860
In just one day, you blew
off not $1, not $10,

109
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,812
but $10,000!

110
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,960
So I'm going to buy all of that again.
I have loads of money, remember?

111
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,851
Seriously...

112
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,286
I'm telling Jik.

113
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,360
I'm telling Jik that his sister got some
dirty money and can send him to college

114
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,293
and abroad to study. I'll
tell him everything!

115
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,050
Do you want to cut off our relationship?

116
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,260
So just take it back
before Jik finds out!

117
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,860
Even if you'll still have
debt, bite the bullet

118
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,871
and take it back!

119
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,308
Who is it?

120
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,984
Hyun Woo... I mean, Choi Ji Tae!

121
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,753
Tell him to go, I have
nothing to talk to him.

122
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:38,361
She told you to piss off. She told me to tell
you not to show up in front of her again.

123
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,360
Huh? What's this?

124
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,735
Hey, you didn't have to!

125
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,871
Put it on.

126
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,439
I will.

127
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,116
Am I pretty?

128
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,190
Very.

129
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,186
Freeze!

130
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,830
What are you doing in front of the shop?

131
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,525
Stop right there!

132
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,659
Hey!

133
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:52,140
-I heard this place is owned by Jun Young.
-Jun Young, that jerk, he's a total womanizer.

134
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,636
Yeah, I heard it too.

135
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,706
I heard that jerk can't
take a nap without a woman.

136
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,343
I think he changes girlfriends
every 10, no, 3 hours.

137
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,379
What do those girls see in him anyway?

138
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,817
You don't care about this, Jang Gook Young.
You aren't Sin Jun Young's manager anymore.

139
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,560
This isn't something to get angry over.
Stop listening.

140
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,524
Hey, that punk Sin Jun Young must've
got so many plastic surgeries.

141
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,560
My brother saw him at the hospital.

142
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,462
Oh, really?

143
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,450
Oh, even I didn't know that.

144
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,971
So Sin Jun Young fixed his entire face
and altered his height with surgery?

145
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,570
Ok then, I'll give you the money, so go
have some of those surgeries as well.

146
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,310
That way,

147
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,548
you could turn that gross face of yours
into a pretty one like Jun Young's

148
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:45,680
and transform from a midget into a
tall, handsome guy like Jun Young.

149
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,100
You stupid punks.

150
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,458
How can you treat your
customers like this?

151
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,260
Hey, take a picture!

152
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,030
It's Sin Jun Young!

153
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,098
Wow, it's him!

154
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,140
Go sue this lady or file at complaint
to the Customer's Protection Service.

155
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,742
How can she swear at the
ones paying for her food!

156
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,548
And about that surgery clinic,
can you show me where it is?

157
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,153
Can they really turn you
into Sin Jun Young?

158
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,580
If you're lying, I'll
sue you for conning me.

159
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,990
What did we... we said nothing!

160
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,450
Really?

161
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,180
Didn't you say he's a total womanizer that
can't even take a nap without a woman,

162
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,150
or that he changes
girlfriends every 3 hours?

163
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,000
Did they say that too?

164
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,543
Wow, oh wow, did you hear
that and leave them alone?

165
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,546
And you say you were my manager.

166
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,548
Of course not.

167
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:48,480
I was just about to tell them off

168
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,750
but boss came and started...

169
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,121
Okay, you can stop now.

170
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,492
And how dare you insult my customers!

171
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,828
Making me look bad.

172
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,097
Apologise to these jerks.

173
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,600
Turns out I got no one
but my mom in the end.

174
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,004
You, please don't show
up in front of me again.

175
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,107
Let's just live our separate lives.

176
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,442
Hey, Jun Young, I...

177
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,553
Thanks for giving me a ride.

178
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,057
Can you do some hand
acupuncture to me, mom?

179
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:38,134
I've been feeling stuffed for past few days.
It won't go down even if I take indigestion pill.

180
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,013
Did you lose weight?

181
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,521
I actually think I gained some.
What a diet.

182
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,825
You crazy punk. Why
would you need a diet?

183
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:06,295
You're all skin and bones
and you want to diet?

184
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,490
You're so full of good fortune that
you're shitting in the toilet.

185
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,634
If you love me, just say it.

186
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,739
-What?
-Stop making fun of me with every occasion

187
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:24,013
and look into my eyes and
ask "How have you been?"

188
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,984
"What were you so busy with that you
had no time to see me? I missed you."

189
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,222
Confess like this. That would be hot.

190
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,192
Crazy jerk...

191
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,643
If you like her, then like her
and live well like that.

192
00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:00,149
I heard from Gook Young. All about
what you did to that No Eul girl.

193
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,784
Are you a kid?

194
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,987
Playing pranks on the girl you like?

195
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,859
You'll get sick that way. Your indigestion and
feeling stuffed up... it's all because of that.

196
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,467
That person, Choi Hyeon Joon...

197
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,938
We don't know that man.

198
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,443
We'll never have to meet him again.

199
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,522
And because of him you can't
stop doing what you want.

200
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,596
Drive carefully on your way back.

201
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,212
Thank you, mom.

202
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,249
Choi Hyeon Joon...

203
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,853
He has nothing to do with us.

204
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,690
Thanks for saying that.

205
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,488
It's so warm.

206
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,324
I thought I'd never be
in this house again.

207
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,007
Thanks.

208
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,553
-Is your documentary going well?
-Yeah.

209
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,457
Yoon sunbae's skills are awesome.

210
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,926
Not better than me though.

211
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,066
For the last time, I came to
say goodbye to you tonight.

212
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,847
Still, we've known each
other for a long time.

213
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,950
I think we deserve a proper goodbye
greeting at least, my friend.

214
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:12,768
And you know this is one last thing
I want to ask you before I leave.

215
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,906
Why are we breaking up?

216
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,715
Aren't you going to say
even a single word?

217
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,690
I got it.

218
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:41,096
Then you should listen to me. I'll
just say what I want and leave.

219
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,668
No matter how hard I think about it,

220
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,906
I don't think there is
anything I did wrong.

221
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:56,411
It's not like I cheated
on you or gambled...

222
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:03,485
I think the reason of
breaking up is on you.

223
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:11,760
Your feelings for me have died down
or maybe there's another woman...

224
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,778
Please give me compensation.

225
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,150
All the pain you caused me, humiliation,
and misery I felt all this time...

226
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:40,055
Waste of my emotion, time, physical
strength... compensate all that.

227
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,857
You have a lot of money.

228
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,597
Choi Ji Tae gave me 1 billion
won for leaving him.

229
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,536
I just want 10,000 dollars from you.
Please just give me 10,000 dollars.

230
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,978
I thought of asking you to lend
it to me with no interest, but...

231
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:10,152
over whether I'll pay for that or not...
we'd have to meet again.

232
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,289
So that we won't see
each other as of today.

233
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,393
So that I won't come near
you out of embarrassment...

234
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,262
Just give it to me here.

235
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,198
Okay.

236
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,535
Just wait a bit.

237
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,826
You write the amount however you want.

238
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,963
Whether you write in 10 million
won, 100 million, 1 billion...

239
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,000
You write in whatever amount you desire.

240
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,238
What if I asked for everything you own?

241
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,775
I'll give you everything. You want it?

242
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,250
Forget it. Am I a burglar?

243
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,721
I'm really going to write
in 10 million won.

244
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,257
Later, don't report it to the
police as a stolen cheque.

245
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:35,130
If you're finished, will you leave?
I'm tired.

246
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,633
Okay.

247
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:44,774
Alright.

248
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,479
With this, the calculation
is over between us.

249
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,885
From now on, be at ease and sleep
well at night. Have a nice life.

250
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,688
You, bad jerk.

251
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,320
Punishment for giving you a hard time...

252
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:52,834
I won't forget it in hell...

253
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,705
I'll accept the punishment.

254
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:25,267
What was that? Are you a pervert?

255
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:51,359
An older girl that I like,
kissed me suddenly.

256
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:56,064
I was so shocked by what happened and
yelled out, "Are you a pervert?"

257
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,899
Am I abnormal?

258
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:03,004
P.S. It was my first kiss with a member
of opposite sex in my 18 years of life.

259
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:07,676
-Yes, you're abnormal.
-I think you're the pervert.

260
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,520
A crazy is here.

261
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,470
Wow, even an idiot like this
gets a kiss. Why not me?

262
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,320
A noona you like kissed you
and you called her a pervert?

263
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,683
This punk is a real pervert.

264
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,920
-Oh, wow...
-I smell a birch tree burning somewhere...

265
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,421
This is creepier if it's a
true story.

266
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:20,870
Don't pay any attention
to a guy like this...

267
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,624
There's some idiot here.

268
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,793
Why should that noona be punished?

269
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:50,051
He turned it off!

270
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,956
I'm speechless. Chewing me out
wasn't enough? He's hiding out now?

271
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,160
Making me into a pervert... Do
I look like a stalker to you?

272
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,767
No, it's not like that. That's right.
He must have been surprised.

273
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:10,739
From such a beauty... when did he ever
receive an unexpected kiss before?

274
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,244
But still! Am I some infectious disease
carrier? Why is he avoiding me?

275
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,000
Ha Roo, I left your
breakfast in your room.

276
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:41,536
-Why?
-The Chairwoman has a guest.

277
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,840
-A guest this early in the morning?
-She has something important to discuss with her.

278
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,808
She says not to come
around downstairs at all.

279
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:49,778
Mom's guest... I'm not interested.

280
00:34:02,424 --> 00:34:06,861
I stopped by your office, but they
told me you're home not feeling well.

281
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:10,432
-What's this?
-1 billion won you recently gave me.

282
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,769
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm not kidding you.

283
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,908
How could I kid with you, Chairwoman?

284
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,677
It's not like I'm trying to get killed.

285
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,615
Even if you don't give me 1 billion won,

286
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,018
I still won't meet Ji Tae.

287
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,255
I won't dream of refuting the
truth or taking my revenge.

288
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:40,595
If I can't live out my life and die early because
of heartache, I won't say a word until the I die.

289
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,110
Do you expect me to believe those words?

290
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:47,936
Whether you believe me or not...
that's up to you, Chairwoman.

291
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,075
But if there truly is God in this world,

292
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:59,080
wouldn't He side with people like me who is treated
unfairly, weak, and without connections...

293
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,983
Wouldn't he punish bad people...

294
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,319
That is what I think.

295
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,123
But again I don't think you
should worry about it either.

296
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:13,461
It looks as though God
died a long time ago.

297
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,946
Eul.

298
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,124
By the way, I was about to call you.

299
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,062
I came to return 1 billion won I
had received from the Chairwoman.

300
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,299
Good job. You really did well.

301
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,739
-Thank you.
-And also I won't ever meet you again, Ji Tae.

302
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,811
I'm not going to take revenge anyway.
You're of no use anymore, Choi Ji Tae.

303
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,532
What did you say? Tell me once again.

304
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,535
Mr. Ji Tae called an emergency
Directors Board Meeting.

305
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,138
An emergency Directors Board Meeting?

306
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,174
Yes, he called for emergency
Board of Directors meeting,

307
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:36,211
proposing your dismissal at
next shareholders meeting, Chairwoman.

308
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,584
Ji Tae is talking about my dismissal?
What kind of nonsense is this?

309
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,986
Are you sure you didn't
hear wrong, Secretary Kim?

310
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,588
Ahjummoni.

311
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,993
Ahjummoni!

312
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,329
Oh, Ji Tae.

313
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,020
Did you prepare the dress
shirt and suit I asked for?

314
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,268
Ah, of course. It is right on your bed.

315
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,536
Thank you.

316
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,094
You came in without knocking.
It's unlike you, Mother.

317
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:30,198
I believe you're the one who
came in without knocking.

318
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,507
Before you called for emergency Board of
Directors meeting. "Mother... can I come in?"

319
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,778
It would've been nice for you to knock
on my door. I'm disappointed, son.

320
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,380
Then, why are you disappointed?

321
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,182
Mom...

322
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,610
I mean, due to your reckless and
failing management, Chairwoman...

323
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,858
If you think of shareholders and
subsidiaries who lost money...

324
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,396
You can't say that you're
disappointed so easily.

325
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,434
Reckless and failing management?

326
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,938
-With what evidence...
-Construction, finances, entertainment...

327
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,808
Despite oppositions from the management,

328
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,745
the business projects you led from
planning to marketing yourself...

329
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,649
The results...

330
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,219
How were they?

331
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,720
It was terrible, right? Relevant departments
exploded and leaders in charge were fired...

332
00:38:32,858 --> 00:38:37,521
Relevant stock price has hit the bottom
and the investors suffered great loss.

333
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,969
The one who led all those things... Chairwoman
is the only one who escaped unscathed...

334
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,172
-For now.
-So?

335
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,976
You'll stand your own mother
at the judgment table?

336
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,413
-What will people think?
-A terrible son.

337
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,852
A jerk who's gone blind over ambition of taking
over his mom's position. That's what they'll say.

338
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,456
But once they know the details, they'll say
"KJ is running the company properly.

339
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,450
That company isn't that corrupt."

340
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,894
There will definitely be people
who applaud saying that.

341
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,333
I'll see you at the Board
of Directors meeting.

342
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,003
Why are you doing this to me?

343
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,575
You used to be a good son. Why are you
doing this to me all of a sudden?

344
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,270
Is that girl that much more
important to you than your mother?

345
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,912
No.

346
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,321
It's not because that girl is so great.

347
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,691
It's because you and Father are wrong.

348
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,251
I'd like to talk to my son.
Will you please leave us alone?

349
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,904
Do you finally have courage to
speak up in front of people?

350
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,544
No. To say that my parents are
such scary and ugly people...

351
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,548
I still don't have courage
to yell that out yet.

352
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,983
But...

353
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,520
I can't do anything about the past, but
relying on your money and power...

354
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,858
For one man to take advantage
of another and stomp on...

355
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,094
Before you become even bigger monster...

356
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,198
I'm trying to stop that now.

357
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,468
Fine.

358
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,871
That's a cool, wonderful thought.

359
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:09,283
How would you stop us and how far...
go for it then.

360
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,520
For you to win in this fight...

361
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,356
I'll cheer you on.

362
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,771
Do you have an aspirin?

363
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,607
We'll go get some right away.

364
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,713
I looked into Sin Jun Young's
family as you mentioned last time.

365
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,917
He doesn't have a father and his birth
records are listed under his single mother...

366
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,888
-He doesn't have a father?
-Yes.

367
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:54,629
So he took after his mother's last
name and is listed under his mother.

368
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,866
She clearly said she's
married and has a husband.

369
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:03,550
There's no record of her marriage
and according to the reporters...

370
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,608
The mother Sin Young Ok gave birth to Sin Jun
Young as an unmarried mother and raised him.

371
00:42:22,256 --> 00:42:23,850
What is it?

372
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,094
This is something I
developed recently...

373
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:31,400
If you eat it wrapped up in siraegi,
it tastes very flavorful...

374
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,602
Ouch! What are you doing right now?

375
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:39,040
Ah... I saw a gray hair. Oh!

376
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,880
-I got two.
-Of course, you got gray hair as you grow old.

377
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,670
Leave it!

378
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,350
Oh, my... 25 days ago...

379
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:55,620
I only saw black hair. Not one,
two, but three gray hair now...

380
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,260
Did you observe me growing
gray hair all this time?

381
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:03,831
More I think about it, this
is caused from stress.

382
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,702
-Because Jun Young caused trouble for you.
-Are you interested in me, Oppa?

383
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:08,769
What?

384
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,771
Do you like me?

385
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,709
You can't answer me?

386
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,648
Do you really like me?

387
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,385
-No.
-Hey.

388
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,754
I don't think you mean no.

389
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,356
When did you come?

390
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:31,959
Just now. The uncle likes you, Mother.

391
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,270
I knew it a long time ago.
Didn't you notice, Mother?

392
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,466
Wow, you're more dense than I thought.

393
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,250
-What?
-What is that dog crap saying?

394
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,108
What, what, what... who likes whom?

395
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:51,445
Even though there aren't any women around
me, would I like her? Are your eyes rotten?

396
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,970
But still, how can you say such a mean
thing, Oppa? Why not? What's wrong with me?

397
00:43:56,183 --> 00:44:01,600
When I go out, men lined up for me. You're the only
one who doesn't think of me as a woman! Only you, Oppa!

398
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,357
No, that's not it... well...

399
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,780
But CEO, what brings you here? Is
something wrong with Jun Young?

400
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,531
No, I'm not here because of Jun Young.
Oh my...

401
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:13,000
I'm here to get our Director Jang back.

402
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,671
Guk Young is inside.
Hurry up and take him.

403
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,807
You're the one with rotten eyes, Oppa!

404
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,579
Ok. Ok!

405
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:33,430
I thought Jun Young's mom was quite
sharp. But she's seriously dense.

406
00:44:33,654 --> 00:44:37,725
You must be so speechless, Uncle. You
showed your affection for her so openly.

407
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,030
How can she not notice like that? Right?

408
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,964
-Shut your mouth.
-Dad, do you really like her?

409
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,100
No. Am I crazy?

410
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:48,600
The way I see it, I think
you like the boss, Chef.

411
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:53,240
I said no! Why is everyone saying this?
Why mess with me?

412
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,370
Then... I have a friend who
owns a tofu factory...

413
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,980
It's okay for me to introduce Jun
Young's mom to that friend, right?

414
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:04,985
You'll be mad at me later? Yes or no?

415
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,258
Ok.

416
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,430
Oh, you have more gray hair.

417
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,260
Just pluck all of it. All of it!
Just make me bald. A shiny mound!

418
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:28,909
-Pluck them! Hurry! Pluck them all!
-Never mind.

419
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,686
No more, no more, no more...

420
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,571
I received a very expensive wine
as a gift. I wanted to share.

421
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:03,844
Great. But I have a business to take
care of. Can I be gone for 30 minutes?

422
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:07,515
Sure. I'll take a look around
your home in the meantime.

423
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:03,060
You should go inside if you're here.
Why are you standing here?

424
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,738
Why did you want to see me?

425
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,844
You filmed all these, right?
Please organize them.

426
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:14,780
I got fired from Sin Jun Young project.

427
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:19,050
That's your problem. You should
finish your job before you leave.

428
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,290
You stuck on all the wrong labels.
And the audios are a mess.

429
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,927
-Darn it?
-It's not like you're telling me to fuck off!

430
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:30,664
You can't do this to someone who's
suffering from being fired!

431
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,246
I'm a professional. This is work.

432
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:02,990
Oh, I can't do it.

433
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,026
Do you want to date me, No Eul PD?

434
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,165
Let's say I die after three months.

435
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,301
Just for three months.

436
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,304
Really deeply.

437
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,924
No directors will show up
even if you wait longer.

438
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:39,970
I think the Chairwoman did this.

439
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,967
Did you think she'd stand
back and take this?

440
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,935
No.

441
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,444
I just wanted to check.

442
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,247
How powerful Mother is.

443
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:38,610
Your call cannot be connected,
please leave a message...

444
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,700
Who is that man?

445
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,136
The one who picked up
your phone last night.

446
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,573
The person listed as "Husband."

447
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,309
Is he your boyfriend?

448
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:04,778
He is your boyfriend, right?

449
00:51:05,746 --> 00:51:07,748
How long have you been
dating your boyfriend?

450
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,151
His voice wasn't that great.
What about his looks?

451
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,954
Judging from the sound of his
voice, he seemed really ugly.

452
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,824
Your boyfriend, I mean.

453
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,026
I said he's not my boyfriend!

454
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,095
Good job.

455
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:28,001
-Have you thought about your bucket list?
-Yes.

456
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,005
Then can you tell me at least
one thing that's on it?

457
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,642
From the person who asks
me that question now,

458
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,846
hearing her confession
saying, "You are my type."

459
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,648
I will edit out what you just said.

460
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,383
I'm asking you again.

461
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:45,680
One thing from Sin Jun
Young's bucket list...

462
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:50,858
Hearing the confession of the woman in front
of me right now, saying, "I love you".

463
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,520
-Please edit this one first.
-What's this?

464
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:12,012
I don't know! There's no audio.
How did you check the audio?

465
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,598
What's he saying?

466
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,179
He's not saying anything on purpose.

467
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,681
Are you making fun of me?

468
00:52:50,717 --> 00:52:53,420
Sin Jun Young, you talked
crap about me, right?

469
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:35,295
You said to wait just 30 minutes.

470
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,966
Ah, I'm sorry. I had
something important to do.

471
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,401
I thought you'd left.

472
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:52,679
How dare someone like you make me wait? You
have no idea who you are! How dare you!

473
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:03,350
Hey, Hyung. There is a visitor I have
at home and she seems to be very drunk.

474
00:54:03,523 --> 00:54:05,630
I don't feel comfortable calling a
driving service. Will you take her...

475
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,820
Hey, Sin Jun Young!

476
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,529
Okay. Do come to my house.

477
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,071
My manager will be here in twenty
minutes. Please wait a bit.

478
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,542
Hey! Hey, son of a...!

479
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,672
Right now, I don't have much time left.

480
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,210
What does he mean by saying that?
Why wouldn't he have time left?

481
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:11,758
I don't have time left to
be right by your side.

482
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:22,869
I think I don't have time left
to be right by your side, Eul.

483
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:30,377
I think I don't have time left
to be right by your side, Eul.

484
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:50,163
Come out, Sin Jun Young!

485
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,999
Come out immediately!

486
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,103
Apologize!

487
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:59,272
Come out immediately and apologize!

488
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,978
I said to apologize to me, you jerk!

489
00:56:06,913 --> 00:56:12,052
I'm sorry. I didn't know who you are
and did you wrong. I deserve to die.

490
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,174
Jeong Eun, where are you?

491
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,811
Jeong Eun, hello?

492
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:41,114
Hello? Jeong Eun!

493
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:45,719
Jeong Eun!

494
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,159
Mother.

495
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,700
If you came to surrender, wait just a minute.
Let's call Jung Eun and have dinner together.

496
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,232
I didn't come here to surrender.

497
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:10,777
If you decided to come to me, you should've cleaned
up your act completely before you came here.

498
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:15,160
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
in my mouth like you, but...

499
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,819
I'm Sin Jun Young after all...

500
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,293
Go to your mother-in-law.

501
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:30,397
You two be sure to discuss
and hold on to Choi Ji Tae.

502
00:57:36,837 --> 00:57:41,141
Yes, Mother? I'm leaving now...

503
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:45,078
I will give up on Ji Tae.

504
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,923
Mother, please you should give up too.

505
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:02,295
No matter what I do, Ji Tae
won't come back to me...

506
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,988
Sin Jun Young, you better wait.

507
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:06,540
Crazy jerk! Insane jerk!

508
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,495
You got fired so how could you be here?

509
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,400
I told you to leave!

510
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:13,520
Why is that punk Sin Jun Young so mean?

511
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:16,269
About Father and Sin Jun Young's relationship.
How much do you know to come here?

512
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:18,605
You, how much do you know so far?

513
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:20,440
Didn't we decide to break up?

514
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,909
I'm being shaken up by Sin Jun Young.

515
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,513
If you can't wrap it up, should I do
it for you? Like that time long ago?

516
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:31,718
Please tell me where and how
much Jun Young is ill.

517
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:34,321
Let's just end our engagement.

518
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:37,257
Who is it? The new man you're seeing?

519
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,293
Just don't meet and forget about him.

520
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,264
If you keep not listening, I will
end up telling everyone everything!

521
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:46,199
I'll be the one to get revenge.

522
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:49,269
Whether it's your revenge
or Eul's revenge.

523
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:50,600
What is it, Eul?

524
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:53,660
I also like you. I love you, too!
