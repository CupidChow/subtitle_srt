00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,522
=Episode 5=
Let's say that in a year,

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,591
you'll die.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,430
You're going to die in a year...

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,566
You'd only have a year left,

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,790
is there something you'd
like to do or see?

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,170
A year is too long.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,143
Let's do just 3 months left.

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,440
Okay then. Let's say you
only have 3 months left.

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,519
I'll live recklessly, and take
care of people who backstabbed me.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,155
I'll kill the jerks I don't like.

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,590
This is not the goal
of this documentary.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,800
Through this bucket list, we want you to
see that life is precious and beautiful...

13
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,810
-I'll hook up with girls at the club...
-Excuse me...

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,650
And I'll have one night stands everyday.

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,040
Stop, stop, stop. We'll stop here!

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,708
Don't stop and let me continue.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,449
Do you think this broadcast
is a joke, Sin Jun Young?

18
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,920
It's not.

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,356
I'm being honest here.

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,695
What wouldn't I be able to
do if I were to die soon?

21
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,650
What about drugs? Will you drink and
drive, gamble, use public restrooms?

22
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,536
Do you want to date me, PD No Eul?

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,408
Let's say I'll die in three months.

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,711
For only three months.

25
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,681
Really deeply.

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,388
Only... 3 months.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,494
Really passionately,
with all of my strength.

28
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,338
Well, since it was just a test...

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,420
Those jokes don't really matter.

30
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,076
I'm not joking though.

31
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,583
I said I wasn't joking.

32
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,022
-Jin Young...
-Do you not want to, PD?

33
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,707
What do you mean? I'm so thankful!

34
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,660
Top star Sin Jun Young is
proposing that we date.

35
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,970
If I said I didn't like
it, I would be crazy!

36
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,930
PD No!

37
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,018
When do we start? Today?

38
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,355
Can we make it official?
I don't mind it.

39
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:57,460
Ah! Can I say on SNS that
I'm dating Sin Jun Young?

40
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,444
Welcome.

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,087
Noona, what's with the both of you?

42
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,757
I don't know, I think she caused a problem
again. She's been like this for thirty minutes.

43
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:29,659
Do you think you'll die like that?

44
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:36,766
Did you cause another problem?

45
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,890
I'll get fired from Sin
Jun Young's documentary.

46
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,939
Huh?

47
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,679
I think I'll get fired from
Sin Jun Young's documentary.

48
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,014
Why?

49
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,520
I took what Sin Jun Young meant to
be a variety show as a documentary.

50
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,393
I mean, I took what Sin Jun Young meant
to be a documentary as a variety show.

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:12,535
No, no. I took what Sin Jun Young meant
to be a documentary as a documentary.

52
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,606
-What are you saying?
-I think she went crazy.

53
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,244
I'm not crazy! Why are you always
only like that towards me, Unni?

54
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,810
Since you look down on me like that,

55
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,752
everyone else in the world doesn't take
me seriously and looks down on me.

56
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,988
You can't even make a
sound to Sin Jun Young.

57
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,228
You don't say anything about him being crazy, but
how come you only call me psycho? Am I that easy?

58
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,031
This little... Hey!

59
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,868
Was I unable to say
anything to Sin Jun Young?

60
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,171
The real question is, why are you being
like that to me? Am I that easy to you?

61
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,179
Then... I think I've really gone crazy.

62
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,758
It's good that things
turned out this way.

63
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,930
Don't do celebrity documentaries.

64
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,666
Just do what you like,
investigative programs.

65
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:19,436
I'll find a job for you.

66
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:26,376
You're unemployed too. Who's
looking for whose job?

67
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:30,313
I'm going to get a job too!

68
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,218
If you get a job,

69
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,922
should I sign myself up to you too?

70
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,759
I don't want to see this and that.

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,427
What?

72
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:54,137
You wouldn't starve me and Jik at least.

73
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,578
Ahjussi, can't you hire me as you wife?

74
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,155
What did you just say?

75
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:16,820
Starting tomorrow instead of plate-of-water
unni, another PD would come and film.

76
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,820
When you threw the ad-lib
today, asking her to date you?

77
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,880
Everyone knows that you did
that to chase her away.

78
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,230
Our chairman is so furious,

79
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,560
saying, 'The goby is jumping and the squid
is jumping too! What kind of PD is she?'

80
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,873
He said we can't trust our Sin Jun
Young to a psycho PD like that.

81
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,843
I gave them the notice. Are you fully
satisfied with this now, Jun Young?

82
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,750
And so in that situation what
would plate-of-water unni say?

83
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,660
'Hey you, cockroach of a guy! Are
you in your right mind or not!'

84
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,860
While saying that did she
have to just accept it then?

85
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,020
If so, a mere PD would approach a star

86
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,230
that would probably be a bigger mess.
Think about it.

87
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,590
People from the production
crew are really harsh too.

88
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,120
Even if she's a temporary worker, it shouldn't
be like, "We're about to take a chance to fire you."

89
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,430
Look at just what they are doing!
How come those people are so cruel?

90
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,551
No matter how weak or fragile, you
can't just treat a person recklessly.

91
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,289
I will be talking until here.
I'm sorry for blabbering.

92
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,259
Call the director.

93
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,430
If it's not PD No Eul, I won't shoot
a cut be it a documentary or what.

94
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,135
If they don't want the
representative actor of the agency

95
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,473
then they should put back PD
No Eul to her usual place.

96
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,621
Ahjussi, eat one.

97
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,026
Okay, I'll stop.

98
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,529
Proposal canceled.

99
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,140
You should just tell me that you
don't want me to be your wife.

100
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,104
Why are you drinking strong soju when
you can't even handle alcohol well.

101
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,775
Hey... 'it's not like that No Eul.'

102
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,012
'Why would I reject such
a lovely like No Eul?'

103
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,250
'I just like it so much that I
don't know what to do right now.'

104
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,389
You're not saying those.

105
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,030
You still won't say it.

106
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,241
I don't really like it as well!

107
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,175
He won't even come after me.

108
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:24,213
He is not that great at all.
Why is he stubborn?

109
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,516
Ah, this is so embarrassing!

110
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,020
Rejected from my job, and rejected
from my proposal, nothing went well.

111
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:36,192
That's because I am the third party!

112
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,877
That girl, Eul, doesn't know her place.

113
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,280
How could she linger around you?

114
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,482
Noona, from your perspective,

115
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,420
I think I'm better than Eul.

116
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,257
Of course! Even though you're still
unemployed, you can't give yourself to Eul.

117
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:13,630
Eul is in a lot of debt and doesn't even have a
great personality. She only mooches off of you.

118
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:21,337
So that's why I'm telling you this. Oppa, there is
a woman I know who cooks well, has enough money,

119
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,708
and doesn't fall too far
behind in terms of looks.

120
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,743
I...

121
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,981
am not good enough, Noona.

122
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,487
Because I am not good enough,

123
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,826
I cannot accept Eul.

124
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,168
Ah, Eul left her cellphone.

125
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,338
So clumsy...

126
00:10:58,174 --> 00:11:00,543
That oppa is not normal either.

127
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,114
Eul!

128
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,684
No Eul!

129
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,825
What is this?

130
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,164
Yes. This is No Eul's phone.

131
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,599
Hello?

132
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,803
Why are you picking up No Eul's phone?

133
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,774
We were together, and Eul
left her phone behind.

134
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:36,145
-Who is the person picking up then phone?
-What about you? Who are you?

135
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,616
-I asked first.
-When you ask for someone else's identity,

136
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,886
I believe you should reveal
your identity first.

137
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,192
Can you not read Korean? My name
probably appeared on the phone.

138
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,162
It only said 'dog' and 'bird'.

139
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,664
'Dog' and 'bird'?

140
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,499
Son of a...?

141
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:59,836
Anyways, Eul cannot take the
call right now, so call later.

142
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,008
If the person calling right now
happens to be Sin Jun Young,

143
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,411
I don't think there will be a
need for you to call back.

144
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:11,347
Not too long ago, she got fired from
your documentary project.

145
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:12,248
Who are you?

146
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,017
Who are you to tell me what to do?

147
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,523
Do you happen to be her husband?

148
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,568
Oh! My phone.

149
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:36,372
Are you Eul's husband?

150
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,845
Hello? Why aren't you replying?
Are you Eul's husband?

151
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,182
Why are you picking up my calls?

152
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,084
Hello?

153
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,855
Hello?

154
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,763
Hey crazy jerk! Do you want to die?

155
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,023
Am I your husband?

156
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:29,659
Yes.

157
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:36,465
Whenever I get in a fight with someone, you
always take their side.

158
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,102
So that's why you're not my side,
but others' side.

159
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:41,938
I'll be going now.

160
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:43,706
Eul.

161
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,848
You're going to meet a good person.

162
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,251
Someone who sincerely cares for you,

163
00:13:56,953 --> 00:13:58,187
and loves you.

164
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,490
You are definitely going to meet

165
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,126
someone who will make you happy.

166
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,897
Wow, seriously ahjussi.

167
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,067
I really did not see you like that.

168
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,036
You're seriously mean.

169
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,241
If you're going to reject me, just coldly
reject me instead of pretending to be nice.

170
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,041
No Eul...

171
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,843
From this moment on I'm not
going to see you any longer, Ahjussi.

172
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,012
Don't contact me again.

173
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,799
But why did this kid call?

174
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,670
If he was a typical freak, I
could at least make a guess.

175
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,947
You psycho, why did you even call?

176
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:00,850
You're asking to be cursed at.

177
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,521
If I answer your calls in the future and
meet you again, I'm not No Eul, but Dog Eul.

178
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,590
I apologize for not being able
to promptly pick up the phone.

179
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,631
Regarding my not knowing my place
and making an offensive joke,

180
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:18,834
I am deeply, deep in my bones,
reflecting and regretting it.

181
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,990
With your generous heart, please
speak well of me to the chairman,

182
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,140
and give me another chance...

183
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,784
Never mind, I'm not sending it. Do you
think I can't make a living without you?

184
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,990
I'll definitely get double salary and a permanent
position with the 4 kinds of insurance and more!

185
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,936
That Sin Jun Young...

186
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,041
Why are you so surprised? Are you
seeing a dog-bird for the first time?

187
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,812
How'd you find me here?

188
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:39,115
I asked the production
crew and they told me.

189
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,010
Why are they giving people's
personal information out like that?

190
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,956
What is your husband doing
while you mooch off of Na Ri?

191
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,840
-You see, the thing is...
-You're saying you married in that time?

192
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,690
Do you have kids too? Is your
husband unemployed? Did he

193
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,035
mess up while doing business and
ask you to bring home money?

194
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,840
What crazy person do you think
would marry a beggar like me?

195
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,648
If it were, would you do that? I don't have a
husband and most definitely do not have kids.

196
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,800
I don't have a house, money, or pride, so
I'm living with my friend Na Ri. So what?

197
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:19,620
Because of a certain psycho,
I got fired from my job,

198
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,659
and I will continue to not have
money, a house, or a husband.

199
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,963
Is it entertaining?

200
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:29,432
Is it funny?

201
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,370
Why do I even bother saying
these kinds of things to you?

202
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:36,806
Crazy wench...

203
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,524
-Hello?
-It's me, Yoon PD.

204
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,361
I think you will have to continue working
on Sin Jun Young's documentary.

205
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,431
I thought you were switching
me out for a different PD.

206
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,203
Sin Jun Young said that he would not film
a single scene if you weren't the PD.

207
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:21,520
He said to cut back on all staff except production
crew. I think you'll have to come to discuss it.

208
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,885
You can come now, right?

209
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,690
Hello? No PD!

210
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,827
No PD, are you listening? Hello?

211
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,432
Ah, I'm telling you, it's urgent!

212
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,400
What is this?

213
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,970
Noona's has work now so I won't be able to
take care of you as often. So eat a lot.

214
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,077
Your sister wasn't even able to sleep last
night because she was preparing all this.

215
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,785
So eat up and go to school already.

216
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:42,024
I'm so sad. What's with you face.

217
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:44,059
Your friends don't give
you food at their house?

218
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,594
Noona.

219
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,190
Ah for real.

220
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,430
If you're that worried why don't
you follow him with a bowl.

221
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,768
Should I really?

222
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,380
Should I just quit everything
and follow you around?

223
00:20:56,538 --> 00:21:01,277
Yeah. Quit everything and
even follow me to school.

224
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:05,581
Let's go to school.

225
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:07,850
Jik.

226
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,222
Noona wants to follow you around...

227
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,261
You know that Sin Jun
Young's fans isn't a joke.

228
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:26,060
Among the fans from singer celebrities, Sin
Jun Young's fans are the most extreme ones.

229
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,020
There are even psychos. They're
looking into you right now.

230
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:30,639
If something happens then...

231
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,313
This is Oh Jik's phone right?

232
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:41,180
You told me you'd give me more information about
PD No Eul but you didn't contact me back.

233
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:46,221
You're not answering my calls. If by any chance
everything is a big lie, you'll die for sure!

234
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,693
She said she's the president
of Sin Jun Young's fan club.

235
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,614
Not that, not that.

236
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:22,624
Do you remember that my father was
an extremely famous prosecutor?

237
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:26,061
By any chance, if you ever have
any personal interest in me...

238
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,450
What are you going to do if I tell you
about PD No Eul's personal information?

239
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:33,035
Do your parents know that you
are doing this with your life?

240
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,470
Heol!

241
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:38,360
Wah! She must be really mad.

242
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,775
What are you doing?

243
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,410
Noona!

244
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:46,048
Does she have nothing to do after
eating? Give me your cellphone.

245
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:47,249
No Jik.

246
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,056
It's her, right? Give me the phone now.

247
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:57,960
No Jik!

248
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,565
The person you are trying to call...

249
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,967
What's wrong?

250
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,000
I told you to give me
that girl's number.

251
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:17,079
No matter how you look at it, she's messing
with a student. Is Sin Jun Young that great?

252
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,313
Yeah he is.

253
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:21,316
This girl isn't that weird either.

254
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:26,221
She's normal but Jun Young is so awesome
that he's even able to change her.

255
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:28,157
I'm not saying that right now.

256
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,661
Don't fall for Jun Young.

257
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:33,862
What?

258
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:35,920
If you're always around
him filling the documentary

259
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,890
then you'll definitely fall for him.

260
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,300
This rascal... You don't know Jun Young.

261
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,307
Jun Young is now a person totally
different from your world.

262
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,545
Jun Young's saying
something without thought.

263
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:52,915
Don't be mistaken and don't
get any useless hope.

264
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,616
You'll get hurt.

265
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,355
Did you eat something
wrong this morning?

266
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,392
That's right. Those ribs must
have tasted weird, right?

267
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,361
So that's why I told you to stay away
from them and not to eat them, you punk!

268
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,398
Noona, I hope you and Hyung
will have nice courtship.

269
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:16,738
Even if he doesn't have anything he's a
really good person and you fit with him.

270
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:19,541
That's the way that you'll be happy.

271
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:23,245
Then this is the end of my nagging.

272
00:24:25,414 --> 00:24:26,582
No Euly!

273
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,418
Film the documentary well.

274
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,923
I call even that thing my brother.

275
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:41,897
But the Hyung Ahjussi already dumped me.
You punk, don't even know anything.

276
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:56,211
If you get a job, should I
sign myself up to you too?

277
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:00,249
I don't want to see this and that.

278
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:07,089
You wouldn't starve
me and Jik at least.

279
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:14,463
Can't you hire me as your wife?

280
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,001
Am I your husband?

281
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:22,804
Yes.

282
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:29,545
Whenever I get in a fight with
someone, you always take their side.

283
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,282
You never take my side so
that's why you're my husband.

284
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,536
Ji Tae!

285
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:18,360
Yes.

286
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,980
Ji Tae your father wants to see you.

287
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:23,298
Father?

288
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:47,723
Seeing that you think for a long time, your
excellent move might turn to a bad move.

289
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:54,463
If you wish for an excellent move like a
missteping my stone, it is never going to happen.

290
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,503
Let's see.

291
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,573
Just Tak Tak...

292
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:12,170
Yes!

293
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,910
Hey, let's do it one more time.

294
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:17,370
But where have you seen that to happen?
Please give me what you previously promised.

295
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,600
Why would you ask that between us?
Just forget about it.

296
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,990
Let's do it one more time.

297
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,029
Wow, Father. Are you going to be
like this? I'm going to tell mother.

298
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,199
My son wants to win me,
his father, that badly?

299
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,602
I can't believe it. Doesn't make sense.

300
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,310
Where did you learn
that kind of language?

301
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,140
Let's play another round.

302
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,620
Ah no...

303
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,160
Father.

304
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,746
Aigoo Choi Ha Roo.

305
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,117
Dad, today was a totally
awful day for me.

306
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,753
Where did you go this early?

307
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,257
Today's our Jun Young Oppa's concert.

308
00:27:57,793 --> 00:28:02,197
Dad, just wear this and come to our Oppa's
concert. It's held at 6 PM at the Olympic Hall.

309
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:05,233
How can I go there?

310
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,990
Haven't you heard about the Republic
of Korea's politician Ahjussi?

311
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:14,050
He posted a picture of him and his daughter at
a concert on social media and it became popular.

312
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:16,044
Didn't you know?
-No, I didn't.

313
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:20,582
Father's busy, and isn't
it time for you to study?

314
00:28:21,183 --> 00:28:23,320
After following Sin Jun Young, do you
want to take your exams a third time?

315
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,319
Okay, I understand.

316
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:26,988
Let's go together, Dad.

317
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,891
I heard they are filming Sin
Jun Young's documentary there.

318
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,670
If my dad was there at the
concert, how great would that be?

319
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:36,865
Choi Ha Roo! Stop it now.

320
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,202
Do my words seem a joke to you?

321
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,550
Oppa...

322
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:46,007
Other examinees are saying they don't have the
time to sleep because 1-2 seconds are a waste,

323
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,077
so how do you have the time to
go to a celebrity's concert?

324
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:54,680
Quit Sin Jun Young's fan
club while I tell you nicely.

325
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:58,286
I don't want to. To me, Jun Young Oppa
is far more important than college.

326
00:28:59,054 --> 00:29:02,724
My life has no meaning without Jun Young. Why
are you interfering with someone else's life?

327
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:08,530
What's with that tone, talking to your brother?
How could you say that he's "someone else?"

328
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:12,667
It's because he's is behaving strangely.
He got scary all of a sudden.

329
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,505
Oppa must have gone insane, Dad!

330
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:32,954
I'm sorry for all this
in front of you, Father.

331
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:43,298
Sin Jun Young, this friend,
I suddenly like him a bit.

332
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,503
Our Ji Tae, why are you never angry?

333
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:52,774
He might have around thousands
of reasons to be angry...

334
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,777
But why can't my son get angry?

335
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,381
"Is something wrong with him?"

336
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,286
I worried every day on whether I
should take you to the hospital.

337
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,156
It seems like I won't need to.

338
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,460
You know how to get mad and
throw a fit, our Ji Tae.

339
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,667
Thanks to this friend, I found
out that my son is alright.

340
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,269
Should I, at least, buy him a meal?

341
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,985
So petty. Did you change your password?

342
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,757
You said you would call right away.

343
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,134
I could not answer your call because I'm
in a meeting. I will call you right away.

344
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,370
You ignored my calls that's
why I just sent messages.

345
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,240
The meeting is still not done.
What are you going to do about it?

346
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,909
I will be having a concert today.

347
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,780
I got a really good seat for you
so come with Uncle Jeong Sik.

348
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,753
This is the last opportunity you would get to
be able to watch the sexiest side of your son.

349
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,440
It's your last chance, I said.

350
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,760
Even if you die, you won't
get to see this side.

351
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,913
Oh my. That's a news I'm glad to hear.

352
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,316
Thank you for telling something
good early in the morning.

353
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,085
Mom.

354
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,222
Let go! Why am I your 'Mom'?

355
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,125
When did you ever treat
me like your mother?

356
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,795
You quit the school that was
so hard to get you into.

357
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,899
You became a celebrity or whatnot
without even discussing with me!

358
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,903
What's wrong with a celebrity?

359
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,739
A celebrity would be a whole
lot better than a prosecutor.

360
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,242
Mom, you don't even know
how rich I am, right?

361
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,120
I have a building, a house,
3 expensive cars and...

362
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,715
Oh my! Good for you for being rich.

363
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:20,088
You said you would be a prosecutor to be with those
like us, who are poor and with no one to back up.

364
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,825
You were blabbering
about it and bragging.

365
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,895
Aren't you even embarrassed?

366
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,999
A person like me can't
be a prosecutor, Mom.

367
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,102
If a person like me
becomes a prosecutor,

368
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,050
those like you, who have no strength, no
backing and poor cannot live in this country.

369
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,076
They need to emigrate.

370
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,344
What?

371
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,147
I will leave your seat and Uncle's
vacant. Come if you change your mind.

372
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,652
I won't go. Wait until you die
and see if I would go there.

373
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,855
As expected of my Mom. She's strong.

374
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,524
I almost cried again today.

375
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,880
-I haven't.
-But I've been there many times.

376
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,350
Several times already? That's amazing.

377
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,560
-I've only been there once. Just once.
-I see.

378
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,300
Everyone, we arrived at the stadium
for Sin Jun Young's concert.

379
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,520
I will hand out tickets soon, so please
listen to my instruction carefully.

380
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:49,838
Stop crying. Did your parents pass away?

381
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,740
I got really hurt.

382
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,845
Ahjumma, how could my Oppa be like that?

383
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,181
How could he raise his voice at
his one and only younger sister?

384
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,923
He looked like he would kill me. I take
after mom so I have a really weak heart.

385
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,050
Madame has really weak
kidneys not a weak heart.

386
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,865
That's the same. That
Oppa must be crazy.

387
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,235
Oh my. Good job.

388
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,970
Dissing the Oppa that thinks of you.

389
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,472
-Dad!
-Assemblyman.

390
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,580
Oh my. A test repeated chasing
celebrities instead of studying

391
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,486
of course it would be normal for you to
be scolded. Stop chewing on your brother.

392
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,360
-How did you get here?
-I told him.

393
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,570
I told him that you were so hurt by your
brother that you were making a fuss,

394
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:50,131
that you're crying a river here. You must've
been worried about her that's why you came.

395
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:56,320
Now. Here. This is a secret
from your Mom and brother.

396
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,806
Dad!

397
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:02,860
I raised my child wrong, didn't I?

398
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:07,560
This is just between us, but Ha Roo honestly
doesn't have the brains for studying.

399
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,952
It's not like her grades are going to go up when
you stick your butt to the chair.

400
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:11,953
That's right.

401
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,580
And I don't do anything bad. I'm
just busy chasing after Jun Young.

402
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,920
Right. Well done, my daughter.

403
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:25,099
That... no, Ha Roo's dad.
You took a hard step today

404
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,336
let's take a commemorative
concert photo.

405
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:31,190
No. No. I'm good.

406
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,708
Here, I'm taking it.

407
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,110
One, two, three!

408
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,808
Be healthy, Sin Jun Young!

409
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,748
Be healthy, Sin Jun Young!
Be healthy, Sin Jun Young!

410
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,662
Don't fall for Jun Young Hyung.

411
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,570
If you keep on sticking around, you
might have your heart waver for sure.

412
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,107
Don't even dream of it.

413
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,913
Jun Young is now a person totally
different from your world.

414
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,520
You're going to the
Prosecutor's Office, right?

415
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,662
My dream is to become a prosecutor too.

416
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,799
Later, let's see each other again
with you as my junior.

417
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,834
Yes.

418
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,504
What's your name? Since you're a
junior that I will meet later on.

419
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,473
I'll need to sign it and give it to you.

420
00:40:58,739 --> 00:40:59,874
Next time.

421
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:06,581
I'll study hard and come back with my passing
test results, so give it to me then.

422
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,684
I'll give my name to you then too.

423
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,457
Sin Jun Young, I guess you won't
be coming back for your book.

424
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,568
The congressman went where?

425
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,407
To Sin Jun Young's concert?

426
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,445
Why would he be there?

427
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,982
Because of Ha Roo, he went
there to accompany her.

428
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:43,584
What?

429
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,066
I told you to peel the onions,
so what are you doing here?

430
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,035
I was watching Sin Jun Young's concert.

431
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,102
What?

432
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:38,906
But I couldn't find anything to diss.

433
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,108
Even as a man I like him.

434
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,779
Go inside and peel the onions.
Peel the garlic too.

435
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,086
Who are you saying "sshi" too? Are you
cursing at me right now? You jerk!

436
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,190
Why are you taking out
your anger on Young Deuk?

437
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,560
Oppa, where have you been all day long left your
restaurant empty and how come you show up now?

438
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,163
What is this?

439
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,540
What is this?

440
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:13,540
This is the debt money Gook Young
owed back then to Jun Young.

441
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,075
Oppa.

442
00:43:14,075 --> 00:43:17,230
Three years ago, I told him
clearly to give it all to Jun Young.

443
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:21,916
I'm returning you this now because this such
a bad egg intercepted it in the middle.

444
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,953
Where did you get all this money?

445
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:29,156
I went and got money from my friends

446
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,927
who borrowed money from me back then,
I took out the deposit from my house,

447
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,760
and you can take out the
interest from my paycheck.

448
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:36,964
Oppa!

449
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,437
It is like a heavy 5-year-old burden has
been lifted off my chest! I'm so relieved!

450
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,580
I owe you nothing now.

451
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:54,920
We are financially, psychologically,
and as a man-and-woman,

452
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:57,251
even now.

453
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,123
Also, let's make this one thing clear.

454
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:07,170
Jun Young didn't drop out of law school
because he was settling Gook Young's accident.

455
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:11,632
Number one, for some uncertain reason I don't
know much Sin Jun Young first dropped college.

456
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:16,504
Number two, Gook Young got into
an accident and number three!

457
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:23,280
He became a celebrity, received his contract
deposit, and settled Gook Young's accident.

458
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:26,313
Can you remember the proper order?
That's enough.

459
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:37,158
Here! Here he is!

460
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,140
I kept seeing you, and this
is the best you've ever done!

461
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,063
Here, take some water.

462
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,360
Okay, after the guest
finishes singing, it's the last song,

463
00:44:48,469 --> 00:44:51,772
so just put in some energy,
okay, Sin star? Let's do it!

464
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,475
Yeah, let's do it!

465
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,420
It's been awhile since
your last concert, right?

466
00:45:06,554 --> 00:45:07,088
Yes.

467
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,490
Can you share your
thoughts about it with us?

468
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,394
Who is that man?

469
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,663
Yes?

470
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:23,871
The one who picked up your phone last night.
He was listed as "Husband" in your phone.

471
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:29,543
Your boyfriend?

472
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:37,151
On my way in the concert hall, I saw some fans
who came from halfway the world to see you.

473
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:38,740
Can you say hello to them...

474
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:39,787
He's your boyfriend, right?

475
00:45:43,858 --> 00:45:47,880
What did you eat today? What do you
eat on days that you have concerts...

476
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:49,697
How long have you been dating him?

477
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:51,398
Jun Young.

478
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:00,870
What do you usually do when your concerts
are over? What are you doing today...

479
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,043
His voice wasn't that great.
What about his looks?

480
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:09,410
Judging from the sound of his voice, he
seemed really ugly. Your boyfriend, I mean.

481
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,985
He's not my boyfriend!

482
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,354
Good job!

483
00:47:15,637 --> 00:47:17,069
(So today I muster up my courage)

484
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:21,310
(So today I muster up my courage)

485
00:47:39,952 --> 00:47:41,756
(So today I muster up my courage
to confess my feelings)

486
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:49,350
(So today I muster up my courage
to confess my feelings)

487
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,052
What do I do if it's me?

488
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:30,751
Happy 100 days. I love you, Eul.

489
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,760
Ha Roo! Take a look at this!

490
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,058
Wow...

491
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,193
Wow...

492
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,401
Wow, what is this?

493
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,850
Jun Young to that plate-of-water...
no, PD No Eul...

494
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:28,208
As soon as the proposal articles were
written, this popped up as well.

495
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,330
Jun Young, that rascal,
where is he right now?

496
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,979
He's right there.

497
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:37,985
He's sulking like that after having his
proposal rejected in front of all of his fans.

498
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,853
He probably wants to die too.

499
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:44,324
What is this?

500
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,494
I asked what it is?

501
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,460
This is the picture No Eul's high school classmate
said she took a long time ago. It came up on myWorld.

502
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:55,002
Did someone ask you?

503
00:50:59,606 --> 00:51:02,140
What is this? Did you
use to date No PD?

504
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:04,778
"No Eul stole her friend's
boyfriend, Sin Jun Young."

505
00:51:06,747 --> 00:51:08,715
PD No Eul's personal circumstances
have been revealed.

506
00:51:09,883 --> 00:51:11,251
The comments are no joke.

507
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:16,590
"Everyone in Sooyoori knows the whole story.
No Eul's friend became a complete mess."

508
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,425
She even attempted suicide?

509
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,961
"Is Sin Jun Young crazy
to date a girl like that?"

510
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:24,230
"Unbelievable. Clearly a gold digger."

511
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,732
I'm going crazy.

512
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,470
Who is it? Who said that?

513
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,810
"Fans became fools." "Because he went crazy over
a girl, is that something to do to his fans?"

514
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,012
"How can I leave Sin
Jun Young's Fan Club?"

515
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,110
Keep reading.

516
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:43,217
"The girl who seduced him and the guy
who fell for it, they're all the same."

517
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,753
We said to film a documentary,
not 'We Got Married'.

518
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,624
"His standards for girls..."

519
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,896
Screenshot all the comments and report
them to the police to sue them.

520
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,935
For blubbering nonsense about all this, I'll meet
them in person and I'll kill them with my own hands.

521
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:08,876
But that's not the problem. If she's getting this
hated on, I think No Eul PD is more in danger.

522
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:39,506
That's No Eul, right?
Wow... She's scary.

523
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,608
What's wrong with her clothes?

524
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,914
What's she doing? Who does
this girl think she is?

525
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:51,485
She must have hit on our Oppa Sin Jun
Young first. Is she even listening to us?

526
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,358
You're despicable.

527
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,096
Are you saying that to me?

528
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,935
What a gold digger.

529
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,505
Hey, gold digger? Who's the gold digger?

530
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:25,652
Ah, everyone's very angry
over the proposal event.

531
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,091
But all of that was a lie. All planned.

532
00:53:34,661 --> 00:53:36,797
Did you really think that was real?

533
00:53:49,443 --> 00:53:51,120
What are you doing?
Please don't film me.

534
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:55,082
Congratulations! You even got such an
extravagant proposal from Sin Jun Young.

535
00:53:55,616 --> 00:53:56,520
It's not like that.

536
00:53:56,530 --> 00:54:00,220
I heard you and Sin Jun Young were a
couple since you were in high school.

537
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,522
Who? Who said that?

538
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,520
Please stop saying nonsense,
and move the camera.

539
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:11,999
Do you not know the internet is
going crazy over you two right now?

540
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,045
Please stop.

541
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,615
Without confirmation, it's rumors. You being
like this is a clear violation of human rights.

542
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,816
Ahjussi.

543
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,306
Are you her husband?

544
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,745
That kind of thing
doesn't matter anyways.

545
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,518
The cameras will all capture this.
Are you okay with that?

546
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,522
From now on, people will
think this is for real.

547
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,567
It doesn't matter.

548
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:01,375
Are you on the other hand, okay with it? I'm
already a celebrity whose face is everywhere.

549
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:06,113
If you're captured by that camera, it will only be
a matter of time before image is tossed around.

550
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,186
Oh! Sin Jun Young came out!

551
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,460
Sin Jun Young oppa!

552
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,570
Let's date, okay?

553
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,790
Jun Young's fans are
going to kill her soon.

554
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,350
Because of what you've
done, I can't go to Eul.

555
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,099
Let me just drown and die. I don't
really want to live anyways.

556
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,635
That's psycho, seriously.

557
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,850
Sin Jun Young! Where are you?

558
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,170
Did she fall in the ocean?

559
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:49,676
You're the nation's gold digger. You've been
revealed from your underwear to your makeup.

560
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,513
Eul, shall I just give up
on everything and show...
