1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,488
Pororo, where are you?

2
00:00:09,229 --> 00:00:13,362
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,718
I'm dreaming about you all week long.

4
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,155
Could you dream about me too, right?

5
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,505
Hyung, I'll call you back later.

6
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,666
I don't have much time left now.

7
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,906
Stop playing hard to get
and look at me, No Eul.

8
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,808
I just met with my doctor.

9
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,247
He said I got worse.

10
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,317
So...

11
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,861
I think I don't have time left
to be right by your side, Eul.

12
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,499
Before I tell you how much I love you,

13
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,437
I'm afraid I will die.

14
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,608
And that's exactly what
I worry about the most.

15
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,215
What's wrong?

16
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,760
Doesn't look like audio issue. But why is that part
where he's looking at the camera inaudible?

17
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,390
I heard everything.

18
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,027
Excuse me. You said you heard?

19
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,229
Yes.

20
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,166
What he's saying...

21
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,204
I can hear it so well.

22
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,279
Yes, Mother? I'm leaving now.

23
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,916
I will give up on Ji Tae.

24
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,092
Mother, please you should give up too.

25
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,696
No matter what I do, Ji Tae
won't come back to me...

26
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,276
Jeong Eun, hello?

27
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,545
Hello? Jeong Eun?

28
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,024
I didn't come here to surrender.
I'm here to declare war.

29
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,165
I don't know how far you'll go, Mother.
But I'll go as far as you go.

30
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,269
That's what I came to say.

31
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,280
I will give up on Ji Tae.

32
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,382
Mother, please you should give up too.

33
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,253
No matter what I do, Ji Tae
won't come back to me...

34
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,113
Have you sobered up?

35
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,619
Let go! Let go of me, you scumbag!

36
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,590
Let's have the next kiss without
you wearing that engagement ring.

37
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,329
I'm not understanding or shallow enough

38
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,501
to warmly welcome a woman who is
still wearing her engagement ring.

39
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,506
Look who is here.

40
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,610
Aren't you Director Yoon?

41
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,646
She's quite drunk. You
take her home, Hyung.

42
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:12,780
What's going on? You didn't do
anything with the Director, did you?

43
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,558
You didn't forget who she is, did you?

44
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,096
Go after her. If she gets into an accident
driving drunk, you'll be responsible.

45
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,935
Hey, you two didn't do anything, right?

46
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,380
You, jerk, if you did...
you're not human, punk!

47
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,910
You're an animal. You know that?
Seriously!

48
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,290
Please give me the car keys.

49
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,229
You drank. Why do you want to drive?

50
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,133
Punk, are you looking down at me, too?

51
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,404
I'm not looking down on you.
Once I drive you home,

52
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,775
I'll forget everything I saw
and heard today. Don't worry.

53
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,541
Do you not want to see me that much?

54
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,843
Yes.

55
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,947
My fans' life wish is to see my
face for longer than a minute.

56
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,983
If they heard you say this,
they'd probably want to kill you.

57
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,110
Can you just drop me off in front
of the hospital and get lost?

58
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,787
All right.

59
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,592
I'm good at getting lost.

60
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,964
I'll get lost quickly and cleanly without
even leaving a trace of dust behind.

61
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,800
However, not right now.

62
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,050
-What?
-Minimum, three months. Maximum, four months.

63
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,275
Please let my sad love
story come to fruition...

64
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,112
Please let my sad love story
come to fruition... Please...

65
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,517
How many days has it been?
You're 20 years old.

66
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,853
Do you want to copy what the
elementary kids posted online?

67
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,350
Geez... the mood in the
house is unsettling...

68
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,862
Ha Roo, can't you please
pretend to study at least?

69
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,500
Why are you eating that?! There are plenty
of things that you could eat in this house.

70
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:27,290
Spit it out. Spit it out immediately.
Spit it out, spit it out.

71
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,973
Are you a goat? I said to
spit it out immediately!

72
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:34,640
I have to eat that for my love to come
to fruition. Give it to me. Hurry!

73
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,413
Aigoo... if love resulted in fruition
with superstitions like this,

74
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:40,550
I'd be living my life among so many men.

75
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,886
Please let my sad love
story come to fruition...

76
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,421
Wake up!

77
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,699
Ahjumma... apologize to elementary kids.
My chanting...

78
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,069
worked!

79
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,607
It worked! It worked!

80
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:25,461
Noona, you must be very furious, right?
Because I ignored your calls and texts.

81
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,098
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm not angry.

82
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,620
While I couldn't get in touch with you,
I was hanging out with a bunch of guys.

83
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,572
Guys who are thousand times cooler and
ten thousand times sexier than you.

84
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,643
I guess you did.

85
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,279
I understand.

86
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,316
Then, I'll get going.

87
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,910
Jik, where are you going?

88
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,158
You said you met guys who are a thousand times
cooler and ten thousand times sexier than me.

89
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,393
-So you'll just leave?
-Yes.

90
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,995
I'm really going crazy!

91
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,940
Who would I meet? I only had eyes for
Jun Young oppa the last three years

92
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,905
and I switched to you. I may look like
a player, but I'm totally faithful...

93
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,880
-Why did you swallow?
-What?

94
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,815
Are... are you going to
do something to me again?

95
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,521
Oh, my! What do you mean do something? You
think I'm a pervert? I'm not like that.

96
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,491
Do you know how conservative
and reserved I am...

97
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,461
I won't eat you up, so don't worry...
you elementary schooler.

98
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,236
Well... Until I successfully graduate from high
school, I won't do any physical contact with you.

99
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,606
-What?
-Hugs are only allowed on special occasions...

100
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,974
What is this guy saying?

101
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,278
And also... Please Noona
introduce your parents to me.

102
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,148
I will introduce my Noona to you too.

103
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,184
I can't understand a
single word you're saying.

104
00:13:56,786 --> 00:14:00,623
Let's ask for permission from our families
so that we can date formally, Noona.

105
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,593
-Wow!
-You don't want to?

106
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,762
It's not that I don't want to...

107
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,567
It's not Joseon Dynasty. We're not getting
married, so there's no need for permission.

108
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,372
And why can't you kiss? These days,
even junior high schoolers kiss...

109
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:19,475
That's for those kids.

110
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,247
These are my values. When I
become a more responsible adult,

111
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,217
I want to be responsible for you with
more responsible behavior, Noona.

112
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,519
Seriously, what is he saying?

113
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,089
Ah! My head hurts.

114
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:39,762
Then, I can't even touch a hair on your
body until you graduate from high school?

115
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,366
We can hold hands.
Let's hold hands only.

116
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,235
Well, other people shake hands.

117
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,548
I don't think we can even hold hands.

118
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,251
Why?

119
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,590
Yes, Doctor Kang. How have you been?

120
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,463
This morning a woman called
No Eul came to find me.

121
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,936
Why did Eul do that?

122
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,886
She said she already knew you were ill.

123
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,826
So I had to tell her honestly everything
about you and I asked her to help you.

124
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,203
Please tell me where and how
much Jun Young is ill.

125
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,907
You're Jun Young's primary doctor.

126
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,711
I came here knowing everything.

127
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,747
Please don't leave out any details and
tell me everything without deceiving me.

128
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,356
Is Jun Young...

129
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,229
really...

130
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,635
going to die?

131
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,550
-How did you get in?
-What kind of Top Star uses "000" as his password?

132
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,984
Are you a bird brain?

133
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,527
-Didn't we decide to break up?
-We did decide to break up.

134
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,629
We did decide to break up, but...

135
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,735
When I thought about it, I felt like I was
losing out on the deal if we end it this way.

136
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,374
Then what should you do, so you don't
end up losing out on the deal?

137
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,413
Please let me continue working.

138
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,789
I'm not saying we should meet as a man and a woman.
I don't even care if you date another woman.

139
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,260
I don't care if you embrace another woman in
front of me. I just want to be by your side...

140
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,837
To be honest, producing Sin Jun Young's
documentary... it's a huge thing on a resume.

141
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,708
Come to think of it, it's not something
I can exchange with 10 million won.

142
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,777
Let me become a star PD
thanks to you, okay?

143
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,348
You'd let me, right?

144
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,352
Jun Young, please?

145
00:18:59,230 --> 00:18:59,955
I don't want to.

146
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,792
Don't be clingy and keep your promise.

147
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,563
Get out of my house in one minute.

148
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,020
You rotten scoundrel!

149
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,089
It's an obvious matter for the top manager
to take responsibility for poor management.

150
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,359
But Mother didn't put in any
effort to resolve the issue.

151
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,610
When an issue came up, she'd come up with
excuses until that issue got resolved...

152
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,690
-she'd avoid or not come out of the house.
-You, punk...

153
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,735
No matter how backwards basic
human ethics have become...

154
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,020
Although parent and child relationships
have been discarded in business,

155
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:54,560
how could a son bring up mother's dismissal...
Withdraw the dismissal immediately.

156
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,147
I'm sorry. I can't do that, Uncle.

157
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,984
Then keep being stubborn.
Let's see who gets hurt!

158
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,220
What a terrible son!

159
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,184
Stop it. Your mother isn't
someone you can win against.

160
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,119
You'll be the only one getting
hurt if you continue.

161
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,296
I'm being shaken up by Sin Jun Young.

162
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,765
You're surprised, right?

163
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,001
I'm also surprised.

164
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,039
The fact that Yoon Jeong Eun can be shaken
up by another man other than Choi Ji Tae.

165
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,442
I couldn't even imagine it.

166
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,212
I think...

167
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,649
Because of Sin Jun
Young, my heart pounds.

168
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,986
Will you really not hold onto me?

169
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,622
Ji Tae.

170
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,828
I believe I already gave you my answer.

171
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,684
The Chairwoman is here.

172
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,694
You should have called me
to say you would come here.

173
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,199
Do you have good news these days,
Jeong Eun? You look beautiful.

174
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,504
Mother, what I said to you yesterday...

175
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,774
I heard they sent over sawedged
perch from Jeju island today.

176
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,712
Let's have dinner at our house. It's
been a while. You have time, right?

177
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,360
Ji Tae said he'd eat dinner at home.

178
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,249
-Mother.
-Right. And also...

179
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,450
A bag for you.

180
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,690
It's a limited edition. I heard
only 2 of these came into Korea.

181
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,559
I don't know if you'll like it.

182
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,530
Mother, about the phone
call from yesterday...

183
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,730
What phone call?

184
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,700
Ah, the phone call about you saying
that you'll give up on Ji Tae?

185
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,940
I'm sorry. I'm speechless as his mother.

186
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,844
Be generous and be
forgiving with my Ji Tae.

187
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,679
I beg you, Jeong...

188
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,982
I'm seeing another man, Mother.

189
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,920
I was with that man yesterday night.

190
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,423
End it.

191
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,560
Mother.

192
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,996
If you can't wrap it up, should I do
it for you? Like that time long ago?

193
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:21,517
According to reporters. Sin Young Ok gave birth to
Sin Jun Young as a single mother and raised him.

194
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,320
Hyeon Joon.

195
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,958
Sin Young Ok, whatever that woman's name is...
it looks like she's pregnant with your child.

196
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,394
When is Sin Jun Young's birthday?

197
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,664
It's September 1st, 1989.

198
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,946
My dream is to become a prosecutor too.

199
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,784
I'm also planning to go to the
college that you went to.

200
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,555
You must be good at studying.

201
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,924
Well.

202
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,061
Your parents must be proud of you.

203
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,569
You're certain of your dream, you look to be more
certain in your willpower to fulfill that dream.

204
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,041
I raise children as well, but the kids
these days are really not to be desired.

205
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,813
They don't have dreams or convictions.
Even more, they don't have willpower.

206
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,951
Student, I envy your parents.

207
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,366
Why are you here?

208
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,801
Oh.

209
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,605
Our department is working
on a Hallyu event.

210
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,975
I wanted to ask Sin Jun
Young to sing a few songs.

211
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,443
You're asking him personally?

212
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,614
Well, I heard the celebrities
these days are very prideful.

213
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,887
According to my aides, I should see him
myself for a top star like Sin Jun Young.

214
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,557
Father, were you crying?

215
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,561
Aigoo. Why would I cry, you punk?

216
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,031
Because of dry eyes, I get
like this even with cold wind.

217
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,520
Aigoo, you know the illness I have.

218
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,069
How much do you know?

219
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,680
What do you mean by saying that?

220
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,381
About Father and Sin Jun
Young's relationship.

221
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,084
How much do you know to come here?

222
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,893
I don't know what you're saying.

223
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,202
I must've been mistaken.
I'll be back a little later.

224
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,005
Go in and meet Sin Jun Young.

225
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,709
You...

226
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,113
How much do you know so far?

227
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,517
My relationship with Sin Jun Young...

228
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,588
How much do you know about it?

229
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,761
Father...

230
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,299
As much as you know.

231
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,848
What is he doing?

232
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,203
Did you know I'd come by?

233
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,510
-Pardon?
-You're not even surprised at all.

234
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,811
You caught my poor acting.

235
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,586
When will you die?

236
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,323
Didn't your doctor tell you?

237
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,659
When you'll die...

238
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,497
Why? Do you want me to hurry and die?

239
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,299
If you're bound to die...

240
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,236
According to my doctor...

241
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,606
a human life is up to the man's will.

242
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,142
God can't act rashly.

243
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,812
I'm sorry but I don't have the
intention of dying quickly.

244
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,717
I still have so much to do. And there
are so many things I want to do.

245
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,655
Whatever my doctor says, I said
let me do my best to survive...

246
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,425
I decided to be like that.

247
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,480
I may live longer than you, Choi Ji Tae.

248
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,996
I will be the one to get revenge.

249
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,034
Whether it's your revenge or Eul's
revenge, I'll be the one to do it.

250
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,440
Don't worry and go. Don't mess with
Jeong Eun and lose everything.

251
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,309
As our cool...

252
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,448
sad and beautiful star,
Sin Jun Young...

253
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,217
Close your eyes quietly.

254
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,756
Give me a freaking break.

255
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,660
Hey, Choi Ji Tae.

256
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,530
Jeong Eun is a woman your biological father
thought of as a future daughter-in-law.

257
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,767
I don't know what your plans are. But
don't be a jerk anymore.

258
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,036
Die quietly, Sin Jun Young.

259
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,239
This is my last warning.

260
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,915
I'm not going anywhere so
why keep telling me to go?

261
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,853
I haven't even lived 30
years, god darn it...

262
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,448
Jun Young, PD No Eul is at
your mother's restaurant.

263
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,421
Wow, this is delicious.

264
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,334
No one's stealing your food
so take your time eating.

265
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,374
Thank you.

266
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,558
Was Jun Young that mean to you?

267
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,993
How did you know?

268
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,260
Wow, you're exactly the same.

269
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:24,690
When you get angry and want to cry,
you mix bibimbop in a big metal bowl

270
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,330
and stuff your mouth like crazy, right?

271
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,570
-Why don't you mind your own business?
-Okay.

272
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,443
Why is that punk Sin Jun Young so mean?

273
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,446
He is a total devil.

274
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:45,320
He's so selfish, has no manners whatsoever, knows
of no one but himself... he's so petty and mean

275
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,956
and doesn't think of
others not even this much.

276
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,594
-Are you chewing my son out?
-Yes.

277
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:55,130
I haven't even started yet.

278
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,510
If Jun Young's so awful,
then just meet another guy.

279
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,120
I'd love to do that, but
there are no other men.

280
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,780
Why would there be no other men?

281
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,308
Half the world's population is male.
Even he's a guy.

282
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,277
Hey, he's mine!

283
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,946
Man Ok...

284
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,170
Look at this girl... Why is Yeong Deuk
yours? Did you give birth to him?

285
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,818
That guy is a man too.

286
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,588
-Mister, will you date me?
-Wow...

287
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,994
Yeong Deuk, call the psychiatrist for me saying
that we'll be sending a a patient over there.

288
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,629
Make an appointment.

289
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,334
I'd like to have a talk with
you after you're done eating.

290
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,976
You must think I've forgotten, but didn't
you promise not to see Jun Young again?

291
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,378
Weren't you confident you could do it?

292
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,114
You can just leave him and
forget all about him.

293
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,718
Why chase after him and get so hurt?

294
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,520
Just don't date him.

295
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,525
Why are you looking at me like that?

296
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,062
Please give me a hug.

297
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,699
-What?
-Or should I hug you instead?

298
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,637
Hey, hey!

299
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,809
What are you doing? People are staring.

300
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,980
Please, just a bit.

301
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,554
Please tell me to be strong.

302
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,228
Please tell me not to cry no
matter how hard things might be.

303
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:44,706
Ajumma too. Whatever happens, you
shouldn't cry too much either

304
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,444
and don't become too tired,
but keep fighting instead.

305
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,312
Worry about yourself first.

306
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,084
Are you really not going to let go? People
must think we're so weird right now.

307
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,414
Sort things out. Or if you
can't, should I do it for you?

308
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,016
Just like back then.

309
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,389
If you decided to come to me, you should've cleaned
up your act completely before you came here.

310
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,692
Let's have the next kiss without
you wearing that engagement ring.

311
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,162
I'm not understanding or shallow enough

312
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,800
to warmly welcome a woman who is
still wearing her engagement ring.

313
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,162
Mr. Sin Jun Young?

314
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,832
Mr. Jun Young?

315
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,101
Jun Young!

316
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:32,273
Jun Young, what are you thinking of
so hard that you keep losing focus?

317
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,149
What was your question about?

318
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:45,253
I hear that you are currently trying to
do the first thing of your bucket list.

319
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,822
Could you please give us a little hint?

320
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,624
Oh.

321
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,966
Yes, the first thing
on my bucket list.

322
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:07,242
My girlfriend I'm chasing... I'd like to
confidently bring her into this camera frame.

323
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,160
Oh... you mean Kim Yoo Na?

324
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,046
-No.
-NG! Wait.

325
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,710
Your girlfriend is Kim Yoo Na.

326
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,019
You even revealed your
relationship publicly.

327
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,689
It's cold season these days. My Jun
Young forgot about it momentarily.

328
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,859
That was your hoax, wasn't it?

329
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,030
I'm not allowed to lie
on documentary, am I?

330
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,832
Well...

331
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,360
But what do you mean?

332
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,372
Oh, that... the camera's off, right?

333
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,340
Yes, yes.

334
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,050
So what happened is...

335
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,460
Are you going to continue
with that hoax, CEO?

336
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,214
No, I didn't say anything!

337
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,470
There's been some issues. I'll
tell you more over a meal later.

338
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,756
So then, who is the girlfriend
you're so actively pursuing?

339
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,525
-Is it PD No?
-Hey!

340
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,926
It's not her.

341
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,030
Then is it Director Yoon Jeong Eun?

342
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,440
I told you to watch your mouth!

343
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,420
What the hell are you talking about?

344
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,337
That's right. It's
Director Yoon Jeng Eun.

345
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,406
You're all working so hard!

346
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,760
No Eul! Why are you here?

347
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,680
I came to work! I'll
assist next you, Sunbae.

348
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,380
Wrap up the lines, take care of data, edit,
drive, be your sandbag when you get pissed.

349
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:29,590
There's no need for that, so just go.

350
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:36,297
And look what I have here! I thought you
might need something to energize you.

351
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,567
If he's a no-show...

352
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,671
What a load of bull crap!

353
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,442
He told you to go! How dare you show
up here after you've been fired?

354
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,011
I have equity in this documentary, too.

355
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,414
If you don't bring me back, I won't give
you any of the files I've worked on.

356
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,916
Hey, No Eul!

357
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,452
Wow, look what she's doing!

358
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,687
Hey, call the police.

359
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:04,992
Tell them there's a blackmailing,
coercive con artist right here.

360
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,628
Let's call it a day now.

361
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,231
We were just starting...

362
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,667
Please get out of my house now.

363
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,403
All of you.

364
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,712
What are you doing? He
said to get out now.

365
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,830
He's asking to get out because of you! Because
of you! You were the one who ruined this now!

366
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,686
Just stop it, boss!

367
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,122
Are you really okay, No Eul?

368
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,991
What? Getting hit with a steamed bun?

369
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,894
-It's okay.
-Not that.

370
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,933
I can't do this anymore
out of my conscience.

371
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,737
Boss, even if I have to eat nothing
but rocks all my life from now on

372
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,007
I can't be that jerk Sin Jun
Young's manager anymore.

373
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,878
I'll send you my
resignation through text.

374
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,379
Hey, Jang Gook Yeong!

375
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,183
Oppa, you must be crazy!

376
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,180
Ah, my blood pressure...

377
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,355
Hey, hey, CEO. CEO, are you all right?

378
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:03,838
I was about to call 911. But I didn't
think spreading rumor would be good.

379
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:23,457
Let's go to the hospital, Jun Young.

380
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,031
I will give a call to Doctor Kang
and let's go to the hospital.

381
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,936
Jun Young.

382
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,104
I told you to go.

383
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,309
I told you to go!

384
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,579
Everyone is gone.

385
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,810
Sunbae Yoon and CEO Nam Goong left.

386
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,815
You go, too.

387
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:49,350
Let's get you hospitalized.

388
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,120
Dr. Kang said you have to be
hospitalized as soon as possible.

389
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,257
-I told you to leave.
-Why don't you listen to the doctor?

390
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,393
Let's get you hospitalized
and receive treatment.

391
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,268
Why are you being stubborn!

392
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,538
Because you don't want to
reveal to public you're sick?

393
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,406
Is that even important now?

394
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,176
You...

395
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,980
are dying.

396
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,751
Let's go to the hospital, Jun Young.

397
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,455
Forget the documentary and all.
Let's get you hospitalized.

398
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:30,091
Let's go to hospital and receive all
the treatment that's out there.

399
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,426
Jun Young!

400
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:37,064
Jun Young!

401
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,936
I will tell everyone everything!

402
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,109
If you keep not listening, I will
end up telling everyone everything!

403
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,530
Should I do it? Then your
mom will find about it.

404
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,950
Do whatever you want.

405
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,657
Jun Young! Jun Young!

406
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,800
You're coming home late.

407
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,338
You're late, too.

408
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,248
Whatever happens,

409
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,688
please promise me that you
will never leave Mom's side.

410
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,161
Father.

411
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,097
Okay. I'll do that.

412
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,965
Thank you.

413
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,538
How about you? No matter what, you'd
never leave your mother's side...

414
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:32,173
Can you promise me?

415
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,010
No.

416
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,514
That's why I'm asking you.

417
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,618
Only you, Father...

418
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,955
Please don't leave Mother.

419
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:15,716
Unni!

420
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,586
It's been a long while.

421
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,188
That's right. It's been a while, Ha Roo.

422
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,892
Jeong Eun, would you taste this for me?

423
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,694
Yes.

424
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,197
Me first, Mom. Let me borrow
Unni Jeong Eun for five minutes.

425
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,767
Unni. Talk to me for a minute.

426
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,803
Yes, what's wrong?

427
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:44,144
Unni, when a man loves a woman, he
wants to hold her hand, kiss...

428
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,046
That's normal, right?

429
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,414
That's right.

430
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:48,682
I knew it.

431
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:53,087
While you're dating Oppa, who
initiated physical closeness?

432
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,323
About the first kiss, who kissed
who, when and where was it?

433
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:03,197
I'm a grown-up, Unni. I'm an adult.

434
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,420
I know what I need to know.

435
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:08,220
What kind of secret talk
are the ladies into?

436
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,170
Dad! Oh, Oppa.

437
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,530
Mother invited me to dinner.

438
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,347
That's right. I'm glad you came.

439
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:24,620
Welcome! Are you hungry, right?

440
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:27,150
If you invited Jeong Eun,
you should've told me.

441
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,088
Ji Tae.

442
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:30,220
Let's first wash our hands.

443
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:31,992
I would've come even if
she didn't invite me.

444
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:33,990
I have something important to say.

445
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,962
Something important like what?

446
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,064
Let's go to the dining room for now.

447
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,733
Jeong Eun, taste the salad for me.

448
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,213
That's right.

449
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,084
Let's just stop playing like puppets.

450
00:48:59,130 --> 00:48:59,954
Jeong Eun.

451
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,790
What kind of situation is this?

452
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:09,863
I spoke with Chairwoman and Ji Tae
already. I have another man, Assemblyman.

453
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:13,634
Wow.

454
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:18,772
For helping me out in the past, I believe my
father has paid you back more than enough.

455
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,076
So, trying to hold onto my
ankles using that incident...

456
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,480
I hope it doesn't happen.

457
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,346
Jeong Eun!

458
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,882
Talk to me.

459
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,485
Then I should leave.

460
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,260
Madam, I left the bag you gave
me as a present in your room.

461
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,330
I'm more than capable of buying
a purse like that myself.

462
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,366
Why are you being like
this, Yoon Jeong Eun?

463
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,342
Who is it?

464
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,813
The new man you're seeing?

465
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,942
Pororo, where are you?

466
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,253
-Noona.
-Yes.

467
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,556
Can you give me your hand?

468
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:18,158
My hand? Why my hand?

469
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:19,927
No.

470
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:24,064
Hey! What are you doing?

471
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:30,737
Usually kids start making these
kinds of moves in 12th grade...

472
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,775
Have you already started? Who
are you and who am I?

473
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:41,820
Noona Na Ri, will you kiss me?

474
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,451
Wow, this is not just a small bit.

475
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,520
You're totally crazy.

476
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,292
Even if I kiss you, nothing's changed,

477
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:56,497
so why does Noona Ha Roo feel like her heart's
going to explode just because I held her hand

478
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:59,233
and why is she so shy even if our
hands brush past each other?

479
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,735
Crazy jerk!

480
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,604
Insane jerk!

481
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:20,988
Pororo!

482
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,458
Pororo!

483
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:43,570
-Hyung!
- Who says we could talk? I'm not your manager.

484
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,412
Did you take Pororo?

485
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:48,215
No matter how much I look
for him, I can't find him.

486
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:53,153
Are you kidding me? What excuse are you
going to make up when you call me next?

487
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,389
What are you saying?

488
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:00,561
You just sent Pororo off to the
countryside, to live on a farm.

489
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,698
When did I? When did I
ever send Pororo...

490
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:14,441
Oh, yeah. I did send him.

491
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,877
Seriously, stop messing
with me like this.

492
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,214
I don't want to talk to you.
I'm hanging up.

493
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,956
Sin Jun Young! Open the door!

494
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,063
You even changed the code? How petty?

495
00:53:37,064 --> 00:53:40,000
I have something to tell you, open up!

496
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:44,671
I want to tell you something!
Open the door!

497
00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:01,755
You're pushing me away
on purpose, right?

498
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,726
Because you think I'd have a
hard time after you are gone?

499
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,397
Did you think you were
doing this for my sake?

500
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,601
Don't kid yourself!

501
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:19,840
When did we ever fall passionately
in love with each other?

502
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,910
I can't understand a word you say

503
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,348
and you can't understand me either.
Our timing was always off.

504
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:34,190
That's right I was lying! When I said
let's not see each other as a couple,

505
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,856
it was all a big lie!

506
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,092
I like you.

507
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,962
I love you.

508
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,560
Every second that I don't see you

509
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:48,068
feels like it's being wasted!

510
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:55,250
So from now on I won't do
anything but be with you!

511
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,780
I am going to stuck next to you and stare
at you until I put a hole on your face!

512
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,690
Jun Young, come see me, please!
Open the door!

513
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,297
Jun Young, I want to see you.

514
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,434
Jun Young!

515
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:46,927
Yes, Hyung.

516
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:50,130
There was something I forgot to
tell you, so I called again.

517
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:55,936
No matter how big a star you are, even if
you're the oh so famous Sin Jun Young,

518
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:02,676
you have no right to decieve poor women
and play with their feelings like this.

519
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:06,613
You'll get punished for that.
You'll go to hell for this, punk!

520
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,216
-What's 13 days till statute of limitations over?
-What?

521
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,820
I had an alarm on my phone that said '13 days till
statute of limitation over', what does that mean?

522
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,624
Why ask me that? You should know!

523
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,747
I took off the engagement ring.

524
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,519
Can I come in now?

525
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,707
Shall we kiss officially?

526
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:50,310
If she's the one you like,
why go to another...

527
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:53,800
If you keep badmouthing my Jun Young,
you aren't that much better either.

528
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:56,783
I'm going to propose to the girl I love.

529
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:02,822
Let's end all ties between our families.

530
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,800
Cut this crap while I'm being nice.
Don't you dare touch the things I have.

531
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:13,360
The man you ran over in that hit and
run... Come check if you don't believe me?

532
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:16,050
He's not someone you can
go up against, Jun Young.

533
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,304
Leave when I say so!

534
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:20,340
-Gossip about Sin Jun Young are online!
-No way!

535
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:21,880
This can't be true.

536
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,210
Gossip on Sin Jun Young.
Did you do it, Mother?

537
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:28,148
Please, keep this monitor
well and look over it.

538
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:32,118
I decided to be even more
cruel than such a cruel God.

539
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:36,890
Whose blood being shed would
be more painful and fatal?
