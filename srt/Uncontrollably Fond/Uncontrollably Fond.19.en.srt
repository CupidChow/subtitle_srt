Up next on Entertainment Weekly.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:07,320
This week, it has been revealed that top star
Sin Jun Young is battling a terminal illness,

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,826
a fact that shocked and
saddened many people.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,096
Yes. I still can't believe it.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,099
It is very unbelievable, indeed.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,203
I've heard that he's receiving much
encouragement over SNS, is that correct?

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,409
Yes, that's right. The touching letter of an
elderly lady who is Jun Young's long time fan.

00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,477
=Episode 19=
"Sin Jun Young. Be strong!"

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,830
has become viral on social media.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,520
Sin Jun Young's Asian fanclub has also

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,224
started raising funds for his healing in a project
called "Sin Jun Young's Forest of Healing".

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,094
Why are you watching that?

13
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,565
Since when did everybody
like me so much?

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,880
I thought millions thought I was a rude
jerk, but who knew they loved me so much?

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,439
Are you for real?

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,475
There's people saying they'll
kill themselves if you die.

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,016
Still, it's a relief that you
got rid of those drug charges.

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,751
-Hyung.
-What?

19
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,500
Take care of Pororo. Don't reprimand him for
being picky about eating premium dog food.

20
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,994
Why are you saying this stuff? Like
you're going to die some time soon.

21
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,599
I am going to though.

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,850
Oh right. I parked the car outside but I
think I forgot to turn off the engine.

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,441
I'll go do that.

24
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:41,618
Oh, and I'm truly sorry for insulting you and
telling you that you need to become human.

25
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,356
I didn't know you were ill and were
unable to make sound decisions.

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,258
I went overboard again.

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,940
What's going on? Did you cry?

28
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,460
No, I haven't?

29
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,960
Your eyes are red.

30
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,961
I got something in my eye.
They've always been like this.

31
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,803
If you're going to shed tears in front of
Jun Young, don't even think of meeting him.

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,110
I'm a bit better now,
so I'll go see him.

33
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,980
But does this even make sense?
Jun Young's not even 28.

34
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,886
This punk, really. I just gathered my
strength. Why did you make me cry...

35
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,113
It's me, Eul. I'd like to
see you for a short while.

36
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,267
You're Sin Jun Young, aren't you?

37
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,560
How do you know me?

38
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,290
That's right! It's you,
top star Sin Jun Young.

39
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:18,100
Oppa, can't you sign
an autograph for me?

40
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,700
What do you mean, top star?
I'm just a student.

41
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,620
Stop lying, you are a top star!

42
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,482
I'm telling you I'm not.

43
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,380
It's true that I'm extremely handsome,
but I'm not a celebrity or anything,

44
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,126
so I think you should just go play
with your friends now. Come on.

45
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,295
Really...

46
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,033
Oh well,

47
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,903
I guess I am too handsome
for a prosecutor indeed.

48
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,507
She thought I was a celebrity...

49
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,600
Baby, are you done with classes?

50
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,520
Hey, watch out. Sin Jun Young is mine.

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,820
If you try and hit on him one more time,

52
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:09,200
I'll take you somewhere we can't be
seen and I'll teach you a lesson.

53
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,680
Good job, Cheetah.

54
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,654
Hey, did you see that girl's face
earlier? I think that was 100% a success.

55
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,958
Wow, I think you totally tricked her
into thinking you're my girlfriend.

56
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,430
Eul. You should consider
becoming an actress.

57
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,800
I got it, I got it.
I'll let it go twice.

58
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,175
I couldn't sleep because I was studying for
exams. Just let me lie here for 10 minutes.

59
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,848
I think I'm going to get straight A's again this
time. If I get a scholarship, I'll treat you.

60
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,730
Jun Young.

61
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,553
I'm really going to sleep now.
Don't wake me up.

62
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,605
Look, over there.

63
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,544
Look. He's Sin Jun Young, right?

64
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,910
Yeah, I think he is.

65
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,515
Unni, this oppa is Sin
Jun Young, right?

66
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,685
He kept lying that he wasn't.

67
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,860
What did he lie about?

68
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,558
He said he was just a student,
not top star Sin Jun Young.

69
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,760
Yeah, well he really isn't top star
Sin Jun Young. He's just a student.

70
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,180
No, he isn't? He's the top star...

71
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,730
Can you be quiet? He's sleeping.

72
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,720
Come to think of it, he's a bit
uglier than Sin Jun Young.

73
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,209
It's not him. Let's go.

74
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,779
But he looks so similar...
It's him!

75
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,168
Assemblyman! Assemblyman!

76
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:44,340
Mr. Ji Tae has just been transferred
from the ICU to an ordinary ward.

77
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,184
Oppa...

78
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,480
Stop crying. He's out of the
crisis, so he'll be awake soon.

79
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,140
Who did this to my brother? What jerk...

80
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:11,830
Ji Tae wasn't driving right. He
passed red lights and was speeding...

81
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,002
Why?

82
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,240
There's no one that obeys traffic rules more than
him. If you know someone like that, let me see him.

83
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,610
Dad!

84
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:35,200
Ha Roo. I'd like to be with your
brother a bit. Can you go outside?

85
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,000
Why? I want to be by his side too.

86
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,798
That's right. You've been too much in the
hospital and you've been skipping class too.

87
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,590
I'll take Ha Roo to the
elevator and then return.

88
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,369
I want to stay here too...

89
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,355
It seems that there is no way I can stop
you and Mother with my own abilities.

90
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:11,361
You and Mother have already become
monsters whom I cannot handle.

91
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,396
Please think carefully.

92
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,300
Is there really no way
you two can be stopped?

93
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,168
That's right.

94
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,806
It looks like there is
none, unfortunately.

95
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,445
Cheer me on, Father. So I can win.

96
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,450
Ji Tae!

97
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,102
I.

98
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,242
Used to really like you, Father.

99
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,179
Even if I don't share
a drop of your blood,

100
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,818
I really wanted to become your true son.

101
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,123
That is why I did everything

102
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,694
that would make you happy
or would be of help to you.

103
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,064
Even if I hated it to death,

104
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,936
even though I thought it was wrong, I
knew it would make you happy, Father.

105
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,174
I just endured it and did it.

106
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,178
Because if I hadn't.

107
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,816
I was afraid you'd resent and desert me.

108
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,389
Just like my real dad did.

109
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,400
I was wrong.

110
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,404
I shouldn't have done it.

111
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,676
If something was wrong, I should
have told you not to do it

112
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,146
that you were wrong, and
that I wouldn't do it.

113
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:19,655
Please keep your promise, that
you won't leave my mother.

114
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,327
Because the one that's
bothering you isn't her,

115
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,799
but me.

116
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,638
Abandon

117
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,110
only me.

118
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,339
Some problems have arisen, Chairman.

119
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:17,413
While we destroyed the black box from Ji Tae's car,
the other car's black box captured everything.

120
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,454
What should we do? We've fortunately got a hold
of the black box before the police did, but...

121
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,390
Hello?

122
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,194
Chairman? Chairman!

123
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,367
Oh, wait one moment, Secretary Kim.
I'll put the CEO on the phone.

124
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,382
Hello? What's the matter?

125
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,492
Okay, I understand.

126
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,408
That's right. I was the
one who blocked Ji Tae.

127
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,947
In order to protect you.

128
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,662
Hey.

129
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,829
Peel it three times.

130
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,303
I'll be a better girlfriend from now on.
Peel me three at once.

131
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,511
What should I do?

132
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,280
Should I go around shouting
that I'm your girlfriend?

133
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,551
Or should I write No Eul is Sin
Jun Young's on my forehead

134
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,153
and go around like that?

135
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,657
You write that you're mine
on your forehead as well.

136
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,492
Will you do that for me?

137
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,550
I had a marker here somewhere...

138
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,131
Is the documentary's premiere
the day after tomorrow?

139
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,678
You have to broadcast the bit about
me and Yoon Jeong Eun for certain.

140
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,048
I know it will be hard.
It's a lot to take in.

141
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,285
But still, do it. It's your job.

142
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,360
Though I will be gone, you'll stay
behind and you need to live on.

143
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,399
Create the world you believe in.

144
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:33,275
Don't keep despairing, blaming
others and making excuses.

145
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,514
And make sure you never lose.

146
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,123
That's what I came to say. I'm off.

147
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,659
I was the one who called
you asking to meet.

148
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,529
I had something to tell you.

149
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,180
It's not your fault, Jun Young.

150
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,920
I've thought about it a thousands of times...

151
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,462
and I really didn't want to admit
it, but it's not your fault.

152
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,837
Just... by coincidence that happened.

153
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,509
It just happened coincidentally,

154
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,449
the fact that you were
there when I was there.

155
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,353
It's not your fault, Jun Young.

156
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,807
Jun Young!

157
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,209
It's been a while, hasn't it?

158
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,220
Wow, how many spelling
mistakes does this one have?

159
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,540
It's pretty good for a
foreigner, you punk.

160
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,080
Why am I so sensitive to
spelling mistakes, Uncle?

161
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,590
Do I have some ancestor who died because of
too many spelling mistakes or something?

162
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,228
Come on, point out what's wrong.

163
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,833
I thought you were a straight
A student back in school.

164
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,206
That's right. I only had As.

165
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,277
This isn't from an Australian.
This one is...

166
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,814
Where's Mom?

167
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,483
In the kitchen.

168
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:33,255
For days she's been doing
nothing but peeling onions.

169
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,659
It says here "quick" but...

170
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,246
Mom?

171
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,331
What are you doing?

172
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,867
Are you going to peel all the
onions in the neighborhood?

173
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,479
Your son came so why don't
you show me your sexy face?

174
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,904
Why are these onions so spicy?
Are they garlic or peppers?

175
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,675
Yeong Deuk! You said I won't
tear up if I wear this.

176
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,444
Were you messing with me?

177
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,550
Do you think I'm a pushover? I'm...

178
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,424
I'm the boss in this place. Do you
think your boss is a pushover?

179
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,565
You said I won't cry if I wore that.

180
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,073
Then is it raining on my
face or what, you punk?

181
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,177
I didn't tear up peeling
onions with that on.

182
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,950
Ok, stop it. The customers are watching.

183
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,189
It hurts my pride to be here.
I can't stay any longer.

184
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,826
I'll go home first

185
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,896
so you take care of things
here and then go home.

186
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,899
Create the world that you believe in.

187
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,204
Don't just keep despairing,

188
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,706
blaming others

189
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,275
and making excuses.

190
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,512
You'll win if you don't
let yourself lose.

191
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,454
PD No Eul?

192
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,570
I am CEO Yoon Seong Ho's aide.

193
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,830
He would like to see you. Are you free?

194
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,968
I think he's going to threaten me again.

195
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,710
You're going to take me with you
even if I'm not free, aren't you?

196
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,540
Let's go then. Please get in the car.

197
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:26,889
We had an appointment, right?

198
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,057
I apologize for being late.

199
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,816
My threat must have gone through.

200
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,753
Someone like you even came to my house.

201
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,058
-The footage you have...
-It's a video of Yoon Jeong Eun confessing.

202
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,195
She says she's the one who killed
my dad in that hit-and-run.

203
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,333
That wench must've told
her father as well.

204
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,103
They're probably going to block this from
production and the broadcasting company as well.

205
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,283
This is the video. Go ahead and watch it.
The premiere is on the day after tomorrow.

206
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,953
Inspect it for any inaccuracies.

207
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,426
The program will be on
air no matter what.

208
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,271
Oh, and that is the original file.
There aren't any copies either.

209
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,060
What do you mean by that?

210
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,177
That USB is the only evidence,

211
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,547
so please don't lose it and make sure to
return it before the scheduled broadcast.

212
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,635
Ji Tae! Are you conscious?

213
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,939
Gyu Cheol...

214
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:31,179
Sin Jun Young...

215
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,383
what happened to him?

216
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,688
He's been cleared of the drug charges.

217
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,859
That's a relief.

218
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,498
-It really turned out well.
-It ended up like this after it was revealed

219
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,066
that he was terminally ill.

220
00:25:57,873 --> 00:25:58,974
Ji Tae.

221
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:01,276
So, Sin Jun Young,

222
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,080
how is he now?

223
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,185
Is he feeling alright?

224
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:34,743
No Eul.

225
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,913
Oh, you're here!

226
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,617
You changed your passcode to 0000 again.

227
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,823
Oh, you're wondering why I'm here.

228
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,990
Well, these days I've become a star so

229
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,296
there are so many people
who want to meet me.

230
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,532
So I crashed your place.

231
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,037
Please let me stay here
until I get rid of them.

232
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,977
Wow, I'm so jealous.

233
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,747
I want to go on a trip as well.

234
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,390
-Ow!
-Do you want to drive?

235
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:19,655
-Why?
-I want to keep the promise I made back then today.

236
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,461
My dream was becoming a great
prosecutor, like my dad.

237
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,331
So I wished I could come
up to my dad one day

238
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:33,402
and tell him that I grew up
well like him even without him

239
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,871
and receive his compliments.

240
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,974
So that's why I studied like crazy.

241
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,177
I even passed the first
round of the bar exam...

242
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,501
Hello?

243
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,210
This is Sin Young Ok.

244
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,378
Please

245
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,748
save my Jun Young.

246
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,855
You're in a high position, so you
must know many great doctors.

247
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,359
Please help Jun Young.

248
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,130
Whatever it takes...

249
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,001
I'll do anything you ask, so please

250
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,305
save my Jun Young.

251
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,343
Young Ok...

252
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:05,320
Choi Hyeon Joon... I told him to
live like you as a prosecutor.

253
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:12,027
I told him to not to pass by someone in need,
not to ignore people facing injustice,

254
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,364
I told him to start by listening to the weak and
to take the side of those who have been wronged.

255
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,569
I told him his dad did just the same.

256
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,474
I told him...

257
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:32,013
I taught him he should
live that way too.

258
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,787
How could I? How could I?

259
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,090
I taught him wrong.

260
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,892
Because of me,

261
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,196
because of me, I think my
Jun Young became ill.

262
00:30:49,197 --> 00:30:51,600
My poor, poor baby... how could he...

263
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,440
I think he's being
punished for our sins.

264
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:02,310
What am I going to do
about my poor child?

265
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,680
What should I do?

266
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,018
What should I do?

267
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,993
What...

268
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,110
What is this place?

269
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,813
It's the house I built
for us to live in.

270
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,820
So let's stay here a bit and then go.

271
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,691
You said you built it so you
could live here with me.

272
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:27,562
Let's live here together.
Just for 500 years.

273
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,350
Its pincers are no joke.

274
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,049
Of course.

275
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,306
Eul!

276
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,600
Gosh, how can an octopus cost $40?

277
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,880
If you gave us a $3...

278
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,716
$2 discount...

279
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,587
Please give us a $1 discount!

280
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,591
It only costs $30 over there!

281
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,361
Then go and buy from there!

282
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:12,380
Wow, you're really something else.
After fooling around this much...

283
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,950
Keep the change. Sell a lot!

284
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,050
-Hey, why are you paying $50 for a mere octopus?
-Knock it off this time.

285
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,809
This octopus will probably
shoot out some ink on you!

286
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:21,810
Let's go.

287
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,020
You both got two gwangs.

288
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,630
How can you win all ten games?

289
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,452
But earlier, you said the man with
the umbrella means two points.

290
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,360
If there are three
gwangs, it's 3 points.

291
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,022
Hey.

292
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,691
Hurry up and give me the money.

293
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,662
The man with the umbrella,
bibang, you do get two points.

294
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:44,550
If it's bibang, you do get two points.
You didn't win yet.

295
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,210
Who are you to mess with our game?

296
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,803
Go your own way.

297
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:51,372
That's right, let's go on our way.

298
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,575
Just a second.

299
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,979
This isn't worth 3 points.

300
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,820
The umbrella man is only worth 2 points

301
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:08,690
so this lady only has...

302
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,328
Oh my. You're the one who won!

303
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,998
This girl, really... Hey! Just go away!

304
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,766
All of this...

305
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,038
This is a double pi?

306
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,374
So then I won?

307
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,030
Different regions play it differently!

308
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,550
In my village, that wouldn't be enough.

309
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,730
With woobi, you get two points. That's
the rule throughout the country.

310
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,153
That's what I thought! I
knew you were tricking us!

311
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,223
Who tricked who? Seriously.

312
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,926
Is this Sin Jun Young's phone?

313
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,462
This is Choi Hyeon Joon.

314
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,934
Jun Young, are you listening?

315
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:55,760
Why did she have to butt in?
I'm not playing anymore.

316
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,340
I'm going!

317
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,400
-Where are you going?
-Leave me alone!

318
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,650
-Give that back!
-Give us our money, you con artist!

319
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,530
In my neighborhood, we
give two points for another card.

320
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,583
It's 5 points, lady! 5 points!

321
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:11,486
Yes, I'll be there right away.

322
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,755
No, no. I can go there right now.

323
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,591
Yes. Yes.

324
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,320
Grandmother? How am I? Am I cool?

325
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,720
Why? Are you going to
see your girlfriend?

326
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,173
No, my dad. My dad said
he wants to see me.

327
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,211
Goodbye!

328
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,146
Taxi!

329
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,215
Jun Young.

330
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,300
-When did you arrive?
-Not long ago.

331
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,507
Yet you're leaving again?

332
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,875
I have matters to attend to.

333
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,878
I called you all day yesterday.

334
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,313
I was busy.

335
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,657
Are you mad at me?

336
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,400
-Do I have the right to be mad at you?
-Honey.

337
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:32,133
Ji Tae must think I'm the
one who did this to him.

338
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,171
Let's keep it like that.
Don't get caught needlessly.

339
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,345
-Yes.
-Chairman Yoon Seong Ho is here.

340
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:55,790
It's hard getting a hold of you these
days, so I came to visit personally.

341
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:03,464
This is wild ginseng that I personally
asked for from someone I know well.

342
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,768
When Ji Tae is discharged from the
hospital, please feed it to him.

343
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:08,790
Thank you.

344
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,909
Life is full of obstacles,
of rain, wind and storms.

345
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,546
Let's forget all the upsetting
things we've gone through.

346
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:24,385
I've recommended you for the
post of secretary general.

347
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:30,591
How hard one works is
important, not experience.

348
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:44,839
No matter how much I think of it,
you're the only one I could trust.

349
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,960
Thank you.

350
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,410
Oh, and.

351
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,050
I have a nice nephew
around Ha Roo's age.

352
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,288
Should we have them get
to know each other?

353
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,125
Even though Ji Tae and Jeong
Eun didn't work out...

354
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:09,230
We would like that very much. But our
daughter is lacking in many ways...

355
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:55,610
I heard you quit prosecutor to go into politics.
Assembly elections are next week, right?

356
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,451
To my friends in your district,
I asked them to vote for you.

357
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,423
When do you mean by 'now'?

358
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:12,960
When did we... recently meet?

359
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,698
When I was in high school...

360
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,571
I said when I pass the bar exam...

361
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,442
I said I'd come and visit you.

362
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:34,315
I passed the first exam.

363
00:40:35,283 --> 00:40:40,250
Once I pass the bar exam completely, I'll come
visit you again. Give me your advice then.

364
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:52,133
I hope you become an assemblyman
and build a great nation.

365
00:40:55,736 --> 00:41:00,475
My mother always sighs saying
there's no hope for Korea.

366
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,179
But it's so fortunate that
someone as great as you exists.

367
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,120
Are you feeling ill?

368
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,992
No. I'm just tired.

369
00:41:19,494 --> 00:41:23,064
Then I should leave first.

370
00:41:25,305 --> 00:41:26,378
Have a rest.

371
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,440
Stay healthy until we meet next time.

372
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,142
I'm sorry.

373
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,313
You're Sin Jun Young, right?

374
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,942
Is it you, Jun Young?

375
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,521
Hello.

376
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,550
-What brings you here?
-Can you teach us how to play Go-Stop?

377
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:01,796
Since we don't know the game,
scammers try to scam us all the time.

378
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,030
Yes.

379
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,502
But, what about your husband?

380
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,207
He had to go somewhere.
He'll be back soon.

381
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,742
Please come in.

382
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,712
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

383
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:34,462
Yes. This is Sin Jun Young's phone.

384
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:40,434
Manager Jang, why are you
picking up Jun Young's phone?

385
00:43:40,768 --> 00:43:43,640
Jun Young left his phone on the
table kitchen and went out.

386
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,339
-Who is it?
-PD No Eul.

387
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,910
Hey, PD No, where are you? Aren't you going
to bring the tape that Jun Young filmed?

388
00:43:50,011 --> 00:43:52,146
PD Yoo isn't able to finish
editing because of that.

389
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,360
I heard Jun Young asked you to come
record instead of PD Yoo that day.

390
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:57,818
I couldn't film anything that day.

391
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,700
Jun Young was in too much pain.

392
00:44:01,822 --> 00:44:05,710
Is it true? You know that if you are
saying a big lie, I'm going to kill you!

393
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,562
Why are you so mean to
PD No all the time?

394
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:15,640
Yes, you know... Jun Young is having a
birthday party, so we're extremely busy.

395
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,505
A birthday party?

396
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,730
Yes. Today is my
father's birthday party.

397
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:24,840
I'll let Jun Young know
that you called, PD No.

398
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,480
What do you mean you'll tell?

399
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:29,700
If the reporters take pictures of them
meeting together, it'll cause more problems!

400
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:33,120
Besides, Jun Young doesn't have
time to meet PD No right now.

401
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,413
Honestly, how old are you?

402
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:09,457
Will your thigh be okay?

403
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:15,029
Stop pinching your thigh trying
to hold back your tears.

404
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:21,869
What do you mean hold back my tears?
Punk, I'm a man, you know.

405
00:45:22,903 --> 00:45:27,208
Do you think... I cry...

406
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:30,511
just anywhere?

407
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,625
That looks delicious.

408
00:45:50,297 --> 00:45:53,334
What is this? Is wearing sunglasses
the dress code for today's party?

409
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:57,204
I got it. I should wear them too.

410
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,941
But, is Sin Jun Young's
mother not coming today?

411
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:05,140
No. She's busy.

412
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:07,160
What do you mean busy?

413
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,300
She's such a strange mother! She doesn't
have too many days left to see her son!

414
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,187
Look here, Ahjussi!

415
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,530
No, what I meant by saying that was...

416
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,940
My mom is so shocked.

417
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,328
She gets upset like a little kid.

418
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,101
Alright! Let's start Uncle
Jeong Sik's birthday party!

419
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,901
Blow out the candles and
make a wish, Uncle.

420
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:01,802
Okay.

421
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,910
May I also make a wish?

422
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,313
Okay. Go ahead.

423
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,618
Please take good care of my mother.

424
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,362
Don't let my mom suffer...

425
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:32,132
Don't let her be lonely...

426
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:37,104
Please watch over her, Uncle.

427
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:38,772
Okay.

428
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:49,817
As for your mom... I'll
protect her with my life.

429
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,823
Don't worry about your mom.

430
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,491
Thank you, Uncle.

431
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,032
I'll trust you.

432
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,238
I won't worry about mom as I leave.

433
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:27,748
Who is it? Is it Ahjumma?

434
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,124
I came here together
with noona Na Ri but...

435
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:41,462
Na Ri noona says she can't bear to see
your face. So, she's standing by the door.

436
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,749
Long time ago, Na Ri noona
says she lied to you...

437
00:50:02,182 --> 00:50:04,585
Noona asked me to apologize for her.

438
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:06,020
About what?

439
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,623
When you and my sister were dating,

440
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,164
that it's her fault that
you dumped my sister.

441
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:23,203
Na Ri noona cheated on you
with Miari Sung Joon Ki.

442
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:27,708
Na Ri noona was so confident
about her looks then that

443
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:33,680
she thought a man was like potato chips
she can buy at a supermarket any time.

444
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,184
After she lost you, she realized

445
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:41,789
how cool you are and precious you are.

446
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,527
Ah, Go Na Ri, you're dead.

447
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:51,231
You know you were my hero at one time.

448
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,401
Not now, but at one time?

449
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,638
Now, Hyung...

450
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,274
You're annoying.

451
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,777
If you want to be my hero again,

452
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:07,714
don't die and live whatever it takes.

453
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,921
My dad told me this.

454
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:18,525
People who die are lazy.
That's why they die.

455
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,395
For not practicing breathing.

456
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:25,265
Alright.

457
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,602
I'll practice my breathing
very diligently.

458
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,278
Where's my noona?

459
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,080
-Why do you ask me about Eul?
-When I called earlier, she said she was with you.

460
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,953
No... I didn't see Eul today...

461
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,925
-Where are we?
-The house I built to live with you.

462
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,393
Let's live together then.

463
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:55,963
For 500 years.

464
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,968
Crazy.

465
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:04,972
Crazy girl!

466
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,444
I'm going to the US tomorrow.

467
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,280
With the second son of Minister Oh.

468
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,385
I'll date him for now. And if I can
stand him, I'll probably marry him.

469
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,221
I probably won't be
back for a few years.

470
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,062
While you're in the hospital, KJ turned
you in for embezzlement charges.

471
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:32,199
As soon as you're discharged, you'll be
investigated by the Prosecutors' Office.

472
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:35,836
So, why did you go down that path?
Such a moron.

473
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,238
Being abandoned by your parents.

474
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:42,910
I'm leaving.

475
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,445
Be healthy and be well.

476
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,481
I'm sorry, Jeong Eun.

477
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,754
I should've told you not to do that.

478
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,125
I'm sincerely sorry.

479
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:05,365
When you ran away after
the hit-and-run accident,

480
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:09,269
rather than despising you...

481
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,307
Rather than staying silent...

482
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,043
I should've said you were wrong.

483
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,581
I should've persuaded you
to turn yourself in.

484
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,620
You're escaping it this
time like this, but...

485
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,090
when you finally come to your senses...

486
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,594
you'll be punished for sure.

487
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:36,797
You...

488
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,434
lived your life all wrong.

489
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:45,672
I want to sleep.

490
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:48,942
Please leave.

491
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:24,444
Father.

492
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,483
I'll call you that only today.

493
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,219
I won't call you that ever again.

494
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,691
And... the fact that I was your son...

495
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:44,264
Until the day I die,
I'd feel insulted...

496
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,001
embarrassed...

497
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:53,240
and remember it as a shameful memory.

498
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,411
Be sure to become an assemblyman...

499
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,181
and build a great nation.

500
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:08,121
My mother always sighs saying
there's no hope for Korea.

501
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:12,626
But I'm so relieved that someone
so great like you exists.

502
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,741
I considered someone like him my
father... to protect such a father...

503
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,711
My girlfriend...

504
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:33,580
I killed her.

505
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,093
Hello, this is No Eul.

506
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,531
What is your real reason
for giving me that USB?

507
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:54,735
Just...

508
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,004
I wanted you to be the
first one to see it.

509
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,775
How do you know what I'd do with this?

510
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:07,414
You know very well
what kind of man I am.

511
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:10,684
I know well.

512
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,755
You're Jun Young's father.

513
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,434
Come in.

514
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:11,978
Eul.

515
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,249
Eul! No Eul!

516
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,449
Eul.

517
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,554
I'm sorry.

518
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,060
I'm really sorry.

519
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,133
I deserve to die.

520
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,319
Eul.

521
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:33,126
You have a high fever.

522
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,130
I'm all right.

523
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,566
You don't feel sick when you
have such a high fever?

524
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:43,236
Why didn't you call me?

525
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:49,042
You should've called me saying you're sick,
asking me to hurry up and come back.

526
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,512
I'll call an ambulance.

527
00:58:59,160 --> 00:58:59,886
Eul.

528
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:04,024
-I'm not going to the hospital.
-Then what? You're sick.

529
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:08,261
-But I still won't go.
-You'll die like this.

530
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,897
I don't care.

531
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:14,301
Why?

532
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,104
Do you want to die with me?

533
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,207
You want to come with me?

534
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:26,613
Why?

535
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,215
Can't I?

536
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:32,986
Fine.

537
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,590
Let's die together then.

538
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:14,894
Please save me!

539
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,131
Please save me!

540
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:23,010
-I found it on the street. You keep it.
-Crazy jerk!

541
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,620
How can you do this to a mother
whose son is about to die!

542
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,141
Assemblyman, is everything true?

543
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,711
How dare you fight me?
I'll stomp all over you.

544
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,648
Do you want to go back to that pit?

545
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:37,217
Sin Jun Young didn't
recognize me right now?

546
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:39,886
Do you know me?

547
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:41,921
I'm sorry for not remembering you.

548
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:45,892
The promise that you
won't leave my mother...

549
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,728
You don't have to keep it, Father.

550
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:52,799
You liking men... that's a lie?

551
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,869
An arrest warrant will be
issued for the assemblyman.

552
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,840
This is the world I want to believe in.

553
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,811
This is the world I believe in.
