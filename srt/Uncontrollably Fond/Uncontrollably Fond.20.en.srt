1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,690
Please kill her.

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,120
Pardon?

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,500
She wanted to die so make
her a favor, and kill her.

4
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:20,105
=Final Episode=

5
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,620
Excuse me.

6
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,720
Here are the patient's coat
and her phone is ringing...

7
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,620
Yes.

8
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,070
No. The person you want
to speak to can't talk.

9
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,110
What if a telemarketer like
you called at this hour...

10
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,040
Would you be happy?

11
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,650
It has been five hours since Sin
Jun Young left, aren't you worried?

12
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,720
Not at all, he went to see his father.

13
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,090
Aren't you a bit worried?

14
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,260
What if he suddenly faint?

15
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,090
What if he goes to the
emergency service?

16
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,200
I hope this doesn't happen but,

17
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,440
but if he suddenly collapses,
someone will help him, right?

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,070
And they'll call 911 for him.

19
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,810
The whole country loves
him, he's Sin Jun Young.

20
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,490
I'm... the best at waiting.

21
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,090
I did it a hundred times,
even a thousand times.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,330
I know how long I will wait.

23
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,570
The thing I'm the most scared of is...

24
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,980
That there will come a time when I
won't have to wait for him any longer.

25
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,350
Waking up one day...

26
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,890
and he'll be gone...

27
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,520
It was acute pancreatic.

28
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,190
The doctor is a bit busy right now.

29
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,490
He said that he'll definitely
make sure to kill you next time.

30
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,160
Are you the guardian of No Eul?

31
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,540
She doesn't need hospitalization this time.
Please do paperwork for her discharge.

32
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,650
Get on.

33
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,210
Save me!!

34
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,450
I don't want to die! Save me!

35
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,660
If I die...

36
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,260
What will happen to my mom?

37
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,200
You fools!

38
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,540
I've never been a filial son!

39
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,220
And I lived while breaking her heart!

40
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,550
The things...

41
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,060
The things I always wanted
to do for my mom...

42
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,900
How can I just leave like this?

43
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,490
I want to live!

44
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,030
I don't want to die! I want to live.

45
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,040
The people I love are all here.

46
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,950
But what now!

47
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,020
We're finding happiness,
how can I leave now!

48
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,220
I don't want to leave!

49
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,890
I want to live...

50
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,170
Save me!

51
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,040
I'm... I'm scared.

52
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,980
I'm scared!

53
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,790
I was wrong.

54
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,500
I was wrong...

55
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:27,820
A video about a hit and run went online this
morning, the citizens are in an uproar.

56
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,250
It shows a prosecutor and a politician
involved in a fatal hit and run.

57
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,160
You hit a man crossing
the street and ran away.

58
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,130
I don't know what made you believe
this but you can't do anything to me.

59
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,090
Do you think that won't happen again?

60
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,340
This might be shocking but
the interesting thing is

61
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,710
the people in the video.

62
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,350
You are right. Dae Han Je Il party's Yoon
Seong Ho and his daughter, Sin Jun Young

63
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,210
and also Choi Hyun Joon were
involved in this video.

64
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,020
The viewers made a petition
to reopen the case and so far

65
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,390
57,000 people agreed and signed it.

66
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,460
Congressman Choi he will make a personal
statement to clarify the situation.

67
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,230
Wait a moment. It's said that Assemblyman Choi
Hyeon Joon is arriving at the police station now.

68
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,500
We will report right now.

69
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,840
Excuse me, Assemblyman!

70
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,200
Are you the prosecutor mentioned
in the video? Is this video legit?

71
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,930
Is it true that Mr. Sin Jun
Young is your biological son?

72
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,480
Please answer us.

73
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,930
I'm sorry it turned out like this.

74
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,300
I will answer all your questions.

75
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,430
Congressman Choi is on his way to
be interrogated by the police.

76
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:58,370
If he acknowledges this, he'll lose Congressman
title, and of course, will be sentenced for his crime.

77
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,420
Daebak! Then Sin Jun Young
was really Choi Hyeon Joon's son?

78
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,390
Then our boss was the Chairman's...

79
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,730
Where is your boss?

80
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,180
Congressman Choi Hyeon
Joon did an interview.

81
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:38,420
He personally ordered that video
to be uploaded onto the Internet.

82
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,160
The one that you couldn't ever
forget for the rest of your life,

83
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,560
still, he wasn't a total
scumbag after all.

84
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,700
After receiving a request about a hit-and-run
case, I threatened the prosecutor in charge.

85
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,410
I ordered him to tamper with the evidence
and witnesses and cover up the case.

86
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,020
However, because he wouldn't listen,
I sent him off to the countryside.

87
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:20,890
Also, as the price of tampering
with the hit-and-run case,

88
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,800
I was nominated by
Congressman Yoon Seong Ho.

89
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,640
I'm leaving this country in an hour, so take
responsibility for taking charge and resolve it.

90
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,310
All I did was do what
you ordered me to do!

91
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,140
"That you would take care of everything" and
that "I left for the States because I wanted to".

92
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,510
I lived as if nothing happened, like you told me. I
erased it completely from my mind like you told me.

93
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,110
What did I do wrong?

94
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
Miss Yoon Jeong Eun?

95
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,020
We're the police.

96
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,670
Stop crying, Jik.

97
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,410
Noona, now Father will be
able to rest in peace, right?

98
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,540
Without feeling wronged
in any way, right?

99
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,890
Why did you give it to him?

100
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,290
What?

101
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,160
Why did you give that video to him?

102
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,590
I didn't give it to him.
Someone must've stolen it.

103
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,210
You didn't have thoughts of
kicking him out, right?

104
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,310
No, I was going to kick him out.

105
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,680
Today, I was going to hand over
everything I filmed to Yoon...

106
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,540
Eul.

107
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,480
That's right, I gave it to him.

108
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,390
I don't need it anymore.

109
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,030
Since I found the culprit who killed
my Father, that's enough for me.

110
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,930
If you sweep things under the rug like that, is
it alright to leave those people alone like that?

111
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,200
Can those people live like that? They will
make another unfair case like your father's.

112
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,010
But they didn't.

113
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,810
I could've swept it under the rug but
your father is revealing it to everyone

114
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,080
and receiving punishment for it.

115
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,190
This is the world that
I want to believe in.

116
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,520
It's also the world that I believe in.

117
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,590
Delivery has arrived!

118
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,600
Oh, you've arrived?

119
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,370
Oh, over here.

120
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,010
-We'll be leaving.
-Yes, thank you.

121
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,680
Goodbye!

122
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,920
What is this?

123
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,860
Pororo's house.

124
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,260
Let's bring Pororo over here.
I want to get closer to him.

125
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,580
You have allergies to him.

126
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,900
After taking medicine and receiving
treatment, I've gotten better.

127
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,430
In case it gets bad, I can
just take medicine again.

128
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,440
I'll take care of Pororo from now on.

129
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,470
Aren't I a bit more trustworthy
than Secretary Jang?

130
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,110
Hey. Hey!

131
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,310
-What?
-Hey!

132
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,550
That night, Eul woke me up

133
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,650
and told me how she was going
to live in a world without me.

134
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,790
Honorable words like justice, honesty,
conviction, ethics, or conscience...

135
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,130
Eul did not speak of it as usual.

136
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,230
Eul only spoke of common sense.

137
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,670
That she would live only
according to common sense.

138
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:34,410
That she would live so she wouldn't be embarrassed
in front of her father, younger brother, and me.

139
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:15,150
After Eul's asleep and the sun rose, a text message
from Choi Hyeon Joon, I mean Father, arrived.

140
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,420
Father said that the fact he
was Sin Jun Young's father

141
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,290
would be a happy and proud memory
he would keep until he died.

142
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,400
Forget it Ahjumma, take it back.

143
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,670
Today, Lawyer Jung doesn't have the
right to drink a single glass of water.

144
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,650
Do you think I poured all that money
into you to see this kind of result?

145
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,060
That is, he has stated that he would
give up the right to legal defense.

146
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,390
What do you mean by that?

147
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,760
I told him not to defend me anymore.

148
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,370
Lawyer Jung has done nothing wrong.
I asked him to do things this way.

149
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,140
Please take your leave.

150
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,270
Yes.

151
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,090
In the future, the trial will
proceed without a lawyer.

152
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,930
I won't make an appeal either.

153
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,780
Why?

154
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,590
Just because. I feel like it.

155
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,630
-Honey!
-Ji Tae was right.

156
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:58,880
You and I have slowly turned into
monsters which we even can't handle.

157
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,150
Let's stop it now.

158
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,160
Please. Let's stop here.

159
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,130
Do you know what I did to get
you to where you are right now?

160
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,840
How do you think I brought you who was crawling
the floors of the sewers all the way up here?

161
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,140
Honey.

162
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,280
Why? Do you want to
go back to that dump?

163
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,280
Mother!

164
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,880
You also sent your mom away because
you didn't have money and power.

165
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,960
You couldn't say a word when someone with power cut
in to take the heart that was meant for your mom.

166
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,220
Do you want to return to those times?

167
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,330
-Eun Soo.
-What did you say to me back then?

168
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,170
You said you wanted power and authority so no one
could ever take things that belonged to you.

169
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,640
Do you think the power and authority that you have
is something that simply falls into your hands?

170
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,970
Do you think it's something that simply comes by
living a life that is upright and conscientious?

171
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,610
If you want to obtain those things,

172
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,320
you must bear through that much
pain, sacrifice, and pay the price.

173
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,050
To protect you, I...

174
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,830
had to crash my son in a car.

175
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,640
Get out of this house.

176
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,280
Go back to that bottomless
pit you used to live in.

177
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,210
The promise...

178
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,310
You don't have to keep it.

179
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,320
The promise that you
won't leave my mother.

180
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,760
You don't have to keep it, father.

181
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,660
I'll take care of my mother the
rest of my life. So, Father...

182
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:36,340
She's my wife, too.

183
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,990
Ji Tae... I'll stay with your mom.

184
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,660
Even if the place may be hell worse
off than the bottomless pit...

185
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,050
Didn't he come to work today?
How come I can't see him?

186
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,990
You got a zit on your forehead.
It must be hard for you.

187
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,800
You got a zit on your cheek, too.
It must've been hard for you.

188
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,940
How do you feel? Do you
hate me kissing you?

189
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,140
No.

190
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,050
I'm excited.

191
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,380
You liking men... that's a lie?

192
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,420
You found out who my father is. So, you
lied to me trying to cut me off, right?

193
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,030
Give me your number.

194
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,970
My friends all remember their
ex-boyfriends' numbers. I must be stupid.

195
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,300
Didn't we break up?

196
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,140
We did.

197
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,310
I'll never come to see you again.

198
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,050
I won't call, text, nor kakaotalk.

199
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,820
Then?

200
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,050
Later...

201
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,790
If I can't find another man as
good as you down the road...

202
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,290
I'll call you then.

203
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,040
Fine. Call me. I'll answer your call.

204
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,710
Take care, No Jik.

205
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,950
You, too, Noona.

206
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,710
So, I'm angry.

207
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,790
I buy the blender.

208
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,700
Long long time ago, okay? Okay?

209
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,700
Okay? Fine then.

210
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,910
But... I mean... but you not give me...

211
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,610
You not give me, okay?

212
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,150
What is he saying?

213
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,750
I'm speaking English, right?

214
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,090
Excuse me.

215
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,860
Oh?

216
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,160
Could you check the status of an order?

217
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,770
It seems like the item
she ordered online

218
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,570
hasn't arrived yet.

219
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,340
Yeah. Thank you.

220
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,770
There was a problem in shipping.
So, the product returned to them.

221
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,410
They refunded you two days ago and
sent you an email. Didn't you get it?

222
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,150
They sent me an email. I don't even check emails
in English because I assume they're all spams.

223
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,290
Anyway, you're so cool, Ahjussi.

224
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,690
Where is Sin Jun Young?

225
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,630
Well...

226
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,060
He's not home?

227
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,990
He is, but...

228
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,230
What? Is something wrong?

229
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,070
Unni.

230
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,840
I'm going to take a walk.

231
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,820
Sin Jun Young... he didn't
recognize me just now?

232
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:52,930
Starting a week ago, one day he'd say
"Eul." Another he'd say, "Who are you?"

233
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,800
Since two days ago, I think he
forgot his name is Sin Jun Young.

234
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,820
Jun Young was struggling so
much and was disturbed...

235
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,870
I just act as a helper
that works at this house.

236
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,810
Did you follow me just now?

237
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,620
Yes.

238
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,120
Do you know me?

239
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,590
Yes. Very well.

240
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,530
What kind of person was I?

241
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,000
You said you knew me very well.

242
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,440
Yes.

243
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,440
I asked what kind of person I was.

244
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,550
An annoying person who thought
he was the best in the world.

245
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,680
You were mean with your words and...

246
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,660
Excuse me.

247
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,690
You hurt others a lot.

248
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,690
You thought you were always
wrong and acted all cool.

249
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,620
You can stop.

250
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:32,930
Rude and speak harsh words,
but they were all true.

251
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:40,200
Even when unnecessary, you act all
crazy so that a coward like me...

252
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,290
can be ashamed, feel
small, feel miserable.

253
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,640
Is that a compliment?

254
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,780
It's a compliment.

255
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,390
What's our relationship? We
must've been very close.

256
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,800
We weren't close. I really hated you.

257
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,400
I cursed you saying, "I hope he
disappears from this world."

258
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,040
So... next time...

259
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,980
let's meet again.

260
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,850
I'll be really good to you then.

261
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,020
Like a true brother...

262
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,420
I'll cherish you...

263
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,630
and will love you.

264
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,060
Forget it. What's the heck?

265
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,610
What's this?

266
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:29,180
I found it on the street. You keep it.

267
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,790
Am I a beggar? Why do you give me
everything you pick up off the streets?

268
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,160
Fine. I bought it.

269
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,290
You can have it.

270
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,690
Why do you give me a ring? You
give it to your girlfriend.

271
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,530
You're my girlfriend. What about it?

272
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,310
Yes, I like you. Satisfied?

273
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,110
-You must be crazy.
-I am not crazy.

274
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,750
I'm more normal than any other time.

275
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,550
I am not in the state of mind to go
along with your nonsense. Get out.

276
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,260
Get out before I pour
dirty water all over you.

277
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,470
Crazy jerk!

278
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,510
Are you in your right mind?

279
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,410
My child is dying.

280
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,850
Can you do this to a mother
whose son is about to die?

281
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,220
When you go to see Jun Young,

282
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,290
make sure you definitely wear that ring.

283
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:55,130
Wear it and be sure to show it
to Jun Young and show off.

284
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,270
What is it that you want
me to show to Jun Young?

285
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,640
Punk, are you even called a human being?

286
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,640
Are you even a human
being, you jerk?

287
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,450
Jun Young... He asked me to
look after you as a favor.

288
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:18,960
Show Jun Young that ring. Let him know that even
if he won't be around, his mom will be fine.

289
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,760
I told him that Uncle Jeong Sik
will be sure to make you happy.

290
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,360
Make him feel secure.

291
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,470
I know you feel sorry and guilty,
so you're avoiding Jun Young.

292
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,580
That's why you're not seeing Jun Young.

293
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:47,280
But you are his mom.

294
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:57,360
As a mom, what's there to
be sorry or feel guilty?

295
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,070
Before it's too late, go see Jun Young.

296
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,250
I will be released soon.

297
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:22,950
I won't turn out the way you guys want
me to turn out. I feel so bad for you.

298
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,820
As soon as I get out, I'll get revenge.

299
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,860
How dare you fight me?
I'll stomp on all of you.

300
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:33,230
My dad said he'd pay back every
little thing. Especially your dad.

301
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,808
If my dad steps up, someone like Choi Hyeon
Joon will never be able to make a comeback.

302
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,512
Why aren't you saying anything?

303
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,140
Why don't you act all high
and mighty and preach to me?

304
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,452
If I told you that I almost did fall for you...

305
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,589
Would you believe me?

306
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:02,697
If this woman became my girlfriend,
my life would be fun and happy.

307
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,406
If I told you there was a moment I
felt that way, would you believe me?

308
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,242
You said you will teach me?

309
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,170
I'm totally good at English.

310
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,980
Do you think I asked for a tutor
because I can't speak English?

311
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,682
What I need is...

312
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:25,253
An essay that is mindful and moving.
Good enough to get into an Ivy League school.

313
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,423
You want college entrance examiners will say,
"Oh, my! We should definitely let him in."

314
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:34,029
Trusted and practical tip.
Isn't that what you need?

315
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:43,571
I didn't come through a parachute or back door.
I passed your mom's interview with flying colors.

316
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:50,145
Everyone thinks I'm not a good student
because I'm pretty. But I'm a good student.

317
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,480
On top of that, I can play
couple of musical instruments...

318
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,850
on a professional level. I play sports like
athletes and as for essays or speeches...

319
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,830
What are you doing right now?

320
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,254
I want to make a good impression on you.
So, I'm appealing my charm to you.

321
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,123
I'll introduce myself again.

322
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:07,429
I'm beautiful and have a spectacular resume.
Yet in love with Choi Ji Tae alone.

323
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:12,333
I'm Yoon Jeong Eun who's got tenacity,
endurance, and even loyalty.

324
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:32,320
That's right. With your power,
you'd be able to avoid it.

325
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,925
But don't avoid it and
pay for what you did.

326
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,129
I will wait for you.

327
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,231
What do you mean?

328
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,880
Let's talk about this then.

329
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,401
I asked what do you mean?

330
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,137
Whether you'll be hopeless forever...

331
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:56,044
Or if there's a speck of hope in you...

332
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,381
If there is hope, I'll
be right by your side.

333
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,084
I'll visit you again.

334
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,588
Don't come back.

335
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,258
Don't come back not even twice!
Don't come back until I die!

336
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:16,297
Don't ever appear in front of
my eyes again! I'll kill you!

337
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,048
Who are you?

338
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,123
What brings you here?

339
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,502
Are you here to sell something?

340
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,090
Where did Eul go?

341
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,184
Ah... to the market. Did
you come to see Eul?

342
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,792
Wait for her inside.

343
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,473
Then, you can wait here.

344
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,776
Eul...

345
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,247
When is she coming back?

346
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,082
I don't know about that.

347
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,020
She tried to make yukgaejang and failed. So she's
making curry rice and went to buy ingredients.

348
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,717
Can you taste this for me?

349
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,486
Yes.

350
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,874
Is it delicious?

351
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,890
Wow. Awesome.

352
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,693
It's really delicious.

353
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,108
It tastes exactly just
like my mom's yukgaejang.

354
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,244
What's wrong? Is it not good?

355
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,113
Is there hair in it?

356
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,187
Wait a minute. I'll get you a new one.

357
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,645
I'm sorry for forgetting about you.

358
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:40,248
You look totally pretty today,
Ms. Sin Young Ok.

359
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,318
I went to the hair salon
for my visit to see you.

360
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,323
For my visit, Gook Yeong
bought me this outfit, too.

361
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,261
Man Ok bought these earrings for me.

362
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,901
As for this ring... Uncle
Jeong Sik gave it to me.

363
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,172
Your mom accepted his
proposal, Jun Young.

364
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,607
Awesome.

365
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,310
Congratulations, Mom.

366
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:16,951
Gook Yeong and Man Ok... I got
two good son and daughter.

367
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,588
I'm so fortunate in my old age.

368
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,927
I'm such a bad son.

369
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,496
Ah, feel so guilty.

370
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,634
No.

371
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,172
My Jun Young is a good son, too.

372
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,207
Forget it.

373
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,247
They say your duty as a dutiful son is finished
as you act cute up to the age of three.

374
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:51,786
Our Jun Young always slept well.

375
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:56,123
You ate well. And you even pooped well.

376
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:00,394
You didn't cry, you didn't get sick.

377
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:08,436
You were so happy to see me.
Always smiling.

378
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:15,476
Ah... now that you say that, you
make me sound like such a great guy.

379
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,280
I got it.

380
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,017
Then let's say Jun Young is a good son.

381
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:30,891
Mom.

382
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,004
I hope you didn't think that...

383
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,574
I didn't do my best.

384
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,044
Okay.

385
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,381
I really lived diligently.

386
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,621
Even if I had a chance to live again, I
don't think I can do better than now.

387
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,164
But still, I feel so sorry to you.

388
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,334
I'm sorry, mom.

389
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,436
I'm truly very sorry.

390
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:25,012
I'll leave my door open.

391
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,983
Come by whenever you want to see me.

392
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,257
Even when flowers blossom,
I'll think that you came by.

393
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,430
Even when the wind blows,
I'll think that you came by.

394
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,270
Even when it rains, I'll
think that you came by.

395
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,642
Even when it snows,

396
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,746
I'll think that you just came by.

397
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,554
Thank you, Jun Young.

398
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,560
Thank you for being my son.

399
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,498
Me too.

400
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,339
Mom, it was such an honor

401
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,543
to have you as my mom.

402
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,499
Regarding KJ's problems that were
revealed through the recent tax audit...

403
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,938
As a member of the
management and family of KJ,

404
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,074
Chairwoman Lee Eun Soo and I...

405
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,045
We'll step down as of today.

406
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,325
From now on, KJ management will be taken
over by the professional management team.

407
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,810
Former Chairwoman Lee Eun Soo and I, as
biggest KJ shareholders and family members...

408
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,174
There's a big problem, Assemblyman.

409
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,944
An arrest warrant for you
will be issued soon.

410
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,470
-Have you eaten something?
-Assemblyman.

411
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,081
I've been starving since lunchtime.

412
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:18,652
Find out if there's a restaurant nearby.
A really good yukgaejang restaurant.

413
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,030
Hey. You don't think you
are that pretty, right?

414
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,403
Jik wanted to see me and
asked for my selfie.

415
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,206
Did you walk your mom out okay?

416
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:14,808
Yes.

417
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,514
Hey. What are you looking at?
You don't have any picture of us together.

418
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,852
Hey, why don't you ask a top
star like me to take pictures?

419
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,820
If I do, would you?

420
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,758
Wow. How come I am this pretty!

421
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:34,328
Oh, I look so shiny, I
can't even look at myself.

422
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,833
You're the only one who
says I'm not pretty.

423
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,569
I'm so cool looking.

424
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,706
It's such a waste to show you only.

425
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,576
Hey, why are you taking it so suddenly?

426
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:06,627
You look really tired.

427
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,464
I know.

428
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,234
Today, I really feel very tired.

429
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,790
-Lean on me and sleep.
-If I fall asleep, you'd wake me up again?

430
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,580
I won't wake you up so just sleep.

431
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,243
You'll wake me up again.
To play with you.

432
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:26,413
I won't wake you up. Sleep well.

433
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,424
-Are you asleep?
-Yes.

434
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,660
How come an asleep
person can even answer?

435
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,064
Are you really asleep?

436
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,701
No, I'm not.

437
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,904
Am I really not pretty?

438
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:53,073
You're pretty.

439
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,411
You are so pretty that I
don't even dare look at you.

440
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,827
Are you sleeping?

441
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,205
Are you really sleeping?

442
00:50:35,682 --> 00:50:36,750
I got it.

443
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:39,053
I won't make you talk.

444
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:43,791
I won't wake you up.

445
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:59,973
I know. You're tired, it was a long day.

446
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,979
I won't wake you up so.

447
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:13,020
Forget about your mom.
Forget about your father.

448
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,520
Forget about me too.

449
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:23,163
Don't worry about anything
else and just sleep.

450
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,348
Thank you, Jun Young.

451
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,488
See you tomorrow.

452
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,780
What are you doing not moving boxes?

453
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,800
Oppa, are you going to fool around?

454
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:54,460
Come here and look at this!
The tree has sprouted!

455
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:55,455
What are you saying?

456
00:52:55,722 --> 00:53:00,800
This is the tree that Jun Young was going to dig
up saying it's dead. But look, it's sprouting.

457
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,990
Oh, my... you're right. Daebak.

458
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:09,860
Yes, hello?

459
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:15,142
Oppa! Oppa, what color do you
like the most red or pink...

460
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,712
It's not that. Oppa, what
do you like the most?

461
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,360
I like you, Na Ri.

462
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:21,800
Whatever.

463
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:27,850
You know how we're supposed to see
a movie? But something came up...

464
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,460
What do you mean? Then we
can't see a movie today?

465
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:36,396
No, no, no. Something came up.
So, after we see the movie...

466
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,170
I think I have to eat with
you, Gook Yeong oppa.

467
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,670
You really surprised me a lot!

468
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,572
-What is it?
-Hello?

469
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,720
Hello? Oppa?

470
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,943
Who is it? Which girl is she?

471
00:53:51,511 --> 00:53:53,490
What girl? What girl?

472
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,483
Why do you call a lady
I'm seeing a girl?

473
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:01,989
Hey! There's a weird
picture in this camera.

474
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:23,243
This is Sin Jun Young.

475
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:35,289
Few months ago, my doctor told me...

476
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:40,127
that I won't be able
to live much longer.

477
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:49,102
I was stunned, but all
people die someday.

478
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:07,020
The thing that I'm most
worried about is...

479
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:15,796
if I've ever wronged the people I love.

480
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:23,837
I was sincerely happy.

481
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:31,745
I've spent warm moments with them.

482
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:47,394
Perhaps knowing the limits of time...

483
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,100
helps you reveal true
feelings you've been hiding

484
00:55:53,770 --> 00:56:00,380
and give you courage. It may be
the last blessing given to me.

485
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,718
As of yesterday,

486
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:20,093
I passed three-month
mark my doctor told me.

487
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:31,200
You are watching this
documentary right now.

488
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:45,419
Am I still... alive?

489
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,395
And...

490
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:08,775
My lover, Eul.

491
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:14,147
How are you living your life?

492
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:37,404
CEO! Where is my tape?

493
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,300
I planned on it for over three months.

494
00:57:40,407 --> 00:57:44,444
I protected it even getting paid for it.
Give me the data.

495
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,950
Do you think I came back here to
produce to be treated this way?

496
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,284
Hey! Am I doing this for my own good?

497
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,640
We're talking about
Cheongmun University.

498
00:57:54,754 --> 00:57:58,220
As for rebate, it's customary.
Is that even news?

499
00:57:58,325 --> 00:58:02,870
The known figure is over 3 billion won. There
are hundreds of doctors who were bribed.

500
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,465
-Does it make sense to help them?
-It doesn't make sense, but...

501
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:12,439
But... this makes sense...

502
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,420
What is this?

503
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:20,380
Eul, just this once. Please turn a
blind eye to it just this once.

504
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,849
It's not even a hard thing to do.

505
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:28,488
Freedom of media shouldn't kneel
down in front of capitalism.

506
00:58:30,557 --> 00:58:33,250
But you know, the operation
fee we spent all this time...

507
00:58:33,393 --> 00:58:36,880
After you pay for assistant director,
you must not have much left.

508
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:37,631
That's right.

509
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,633
You should have some, too, CEO...

510
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,468
Not me. Forget about me.

511
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:47,510
As for me... tada! This will do it.

512
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,310
It's a foreign car! Lucky you!

513
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,146
Sunbae, are you taping this okay?

514
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:54,614
Tape what?

515
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,619
There's a hidden camera here, say hi!

516
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:02,556
-Hey, No Eul...
-Thank you.

517
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,893
Thanks to your testimony, I think I can tie
it in with the media news at Cheongju.

518
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:10,363
Take this back and don't get it stolen.

519
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:11,831
You punk!

520
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:20,094
(You did well today)

521
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:40,393
Right? I did really well today, right?

522
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,077
Let's see each other again tomorrow, Jun Young.
