=Episode 6=

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,129
Where are we going?

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,031
I don't know.

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,769
Don't tell me to stop because
I don't intend to ever stop.

5
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,871
It's kind of late.

6
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,641
Isn't it the same for you too?

7
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:01,670
-I was listening to a friend's whining.
-Whining?

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,284
That friend and... that
friend's younger brother

9
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,455
liked the same girl.

10
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:14,550
Oh, too bad.

11
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:15,492
But...

12
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:22,999
Their father wronged the girl's family.

13
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:31,908
My friend had no other choice but to
leave so he had to give up that woman.

14
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,045
That kid's younger brother

15
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,916
took her hand and ran away.

16
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:46,389
That sounds like the story line
of the drama Madam Jang watches.

17
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,792
Right?

18
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,302
Let's skip working out
and have a drink, Father.

19
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:12,682
We can't go any further.

20
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,685
It's not like we can drown in the ocean.

21
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,456
Let's drown and die.

22
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,162
I don't really want to live,
so let's drown and die.

23
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,702
Even I asked you, you wouldn't die.
You're a coward.

24
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,020
-What are you doing?
-You said you wanted to drown and die.

25
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,820
Crazy jerk. Really crazy jerk.

26
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:53,890
If you want to die,
then die by yourself.

27
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,101
Where are you going?

28
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:07,971
No Eul!

29
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,880
The party is not answering.
After the beep...

30
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:49,873
Not answering?

31
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,912
Where did Jun Young take Eul to?

32
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,451
I know he does whatever he wants, but
why is he taking the joke so far?

33
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,340
Wow... Top 10 online searches right
now are all about Jun Young and Eul.

34
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,463
Look at the comments. I think his
fans are going to kill Eul soon.

35
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:33,783
Hello.

36
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,654
-Don't you dare even touch a hair on No Eul.
-What?

37
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,223
You're the President of Sin
Jun Young's Fan Club, right?

38
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,840
If you even mark No Eul
with a fingernail,

39
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,229
tell your minions that I will
pay it back a thousandfold.

40
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,430
Hey!

41
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,333
All the negative comments online,

42
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,638
tell them that if they don't stop it right now,
I'll find all their IDs and IPs and destroy them.

43
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,642
This jerk... Just because I'm letting
you talk... Do you know who I am?

44
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,811
How dare you threaten me!

45
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,349
You... told people to look into No Eul and
get all her personal information, right?

46
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,689
If I catch you, you'll get a serious injury. So
you'd better watch yourself going out at night.

47
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,292
Ridiculous... What's your location?

48
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,720
I'll tell my dad and send the police
over, so tell me your address right now!

49
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,032
Seoul, Dobong-gu, Ssangmun-dong,
Block 102 Apartment 210.

50
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,036
I'll take you on at any time,
so come find me this instant.

51
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,189
Dad, where are you right now? Some crazy guy
is threatening your daughter right now!

52
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,925
What are you saying? Tell
me clearly, Choi Ha Roo.

53
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,764
Why are you answering my dad's phone?

54
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,901
Oh, I'm having a drink with your dad right now,
and he just stepped away to go to the bathroom.

55
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,240
Why? What's the matter?

56
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,573
That thing is... some guy
right now said Jun Young...

57
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,946
Never mind. It's nothing.
Oh my, do you know me?

58
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,382
Why are you so interested in
someone else's personal life?

59
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,293
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

60
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,563
Why do I feel so drunk?

61
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,030
I don't think I drank that much.

62
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,000
Your tolerance has gone
down a lot, Father.

63
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,637
It's because your mother's
been so overprotective of me.

64
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,608
-Let's go home now.
-Yes.

65
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,170
I'm busy tomorrow, too.

66
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,020
-Hey, have you seen my phone?
-I haven't.

67
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,674
Here.

68
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,581
What was the number again?

69
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,653
Three... Nine...

70
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,889
This is Na Ri's number...

71
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,892
Seven, three...

72
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,448
Why did you drink this much?
Did you ask him for a drink?

73
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,984
Yes. I asked him to buy me a drink.

74
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,922
Did you forget that he shouldn't be
drinking because his health has gone down?

75
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:36,125
He's already been lacking sleep
these days because of legal work.

76
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,260
Sorry.

77
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,396
How do you kids only
think about yourselves?

78
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,800
I'll bring him something calming to
drink, so change him out of his clothes.

79
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,202
-Yes.
-This is so upsetting!

80
00:09:59,270 --> 00:09:59,983
Hello?

81
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,452
Hello?

82
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,256
Hello? You should speak if you called.

83
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,996
Do you know... how hard it
was for me all this time?

84
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,334
Acting like I hated you...

85
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,473
You don't know how hard
it was for me, right?

86
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,348
Why did you treat me nicely?

87
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,990
You don't even have money
but you bought me food.

88
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,955
Why did you buy me clothes?

89
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,650
Why did you buy me clothes and
worry whether I ate or not,

90
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,600
and take me to the hospital when
I was sick. Why did you do that?

91
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,469
You were going to reject
me twice like this...

92
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,874
And in front of all the
people and embarrassed me!

93
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:05,515
Why do you make me confused? Why?

94
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,732
What's so great about you, Ahjussi?

95
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:27,360
Huh? You're poorer than Sin Jun Young

96
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,806
and older than him.

97
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,520
You don't even have a car that
Sin Jun Young has three of.

98
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,245
You don't even have a
house or a building.

99
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,416
What right do you have to reject me?

100
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,286
Hand me the cellphone.

101
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,892
Ahjusshi... can't you
think it over once more?

102
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,864
I'm really an okay person
if you get to know me.

103
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,834
I'll be really good to you from now on,

104
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,838
so please accept me, Ahjussi.

105
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,275
Let's date, okay?

106
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,184
Hey!

107
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,423
Hand over my phone.

108
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,925
It's my phone, not yours.

109
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,050
But still, hand it over! I'm not
done talking with Ahjusshi...

110
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,140
Listen to me! That's enough
behaving embarrassingly.

111
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,733
Hand over my phone!

112
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,204
Hey!

113
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,750
Are you all right?

114
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,454
Do you want some water?

115
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,264
It's all because of you, Father.

116
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,737
Because of all the
things you've done, I...

117
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,476
can't go to Eul.

118
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,121
Bring my phone.

119
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,624
It's not your phone, it's mine.

120
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,170
I said to bring my phone, I'm
not done talking with Ahjusshi!

121
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,565
If you have more to say, why
don't you go get it yourself!

122
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,581
That psycho, seriously...

123
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,285
-Come out.
-Let go.

124
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,554
Come out.

125
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,630
Let go of me!

126
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,327
Let go!

127
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,397
Hey! Hey!

128
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,730
Hey!

129
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,781
Don't you see me?

130
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,253
Do you know what I did because of you?

131
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,292
Don't I appear in your eyes?

132
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,395
Ahjusshi...

133
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,299
Ahjussi.

134
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,602
Ahjussi.

135
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,730
Ahjussi.

136
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,900
Ahjussi.

137
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,149
My head.

138
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,400
It hurts.

139
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,010
Why are you guys there...

140
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,737
You didn't have a hole in your stomach?
Like you eat snacks,

141
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,039
I heard you drank five bottles!

142
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,110
-Did I?
-What? Oh my...

143
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,000
I made hangover soup.

144
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,482
I'll bring it over so wait a bit.

145
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,017
Oh, but...

146
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,155
Why are my clothes hung up there?

147
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,300
And why am I wearing this?

148
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,561
It seems like you don't
remember anything!

149
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:55,100
You got into the water and
got your clothes soaked!

150
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,590
On top of that, you were drunk
and throwing up everywhere...

151
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,380
Your husband had a tough
time changing your clothes.

152
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,100
-Husband?
-You don't remember your husband, either?

153
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,244
He's tall and has a Seoul dialect.
Isn't he your husband?

154
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,449
So you mean my husband
took my clothes...

155
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:19,250
No. I mean, are you saying that
jerk... changed my clothing?

156
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,957
Yes. What about it? He's your husband.

157
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,493
It's not like he'd be seeing your
naked body for the first time.

158
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,730
No way.

159
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,071
But where did this guy go?

160
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,908
Your husband had a tough
time changing your clothes.

161
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:17,713
What about it? He's your husband. It's not like
he'd be seeing your naked body for the first time.

162
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:23,119
Ah... If only I could remember...

163
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,422
Whatever, whatever.

164
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,066
-It's all charged, ma'am.
-Thank you.

165
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,969
Oh! Oh...

166
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,020
Ah... I am a native who has never

167
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,420
left this town. Charging
my phone is free, right?

168
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,949
Of course.

169
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,890
But you know it's interesting that a
Gyeongsangdo native is using a Jeollado dialect.

170
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,022
When?

171
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,270
When did I do that?

172
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,780
Oh Jik, I'm sorry. You must've
been worried about me.

173
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,849
Why? Did something happen?

174
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,140
Haven't you seen the
news or the internet?

175
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,110
When do I have time to do that?
Why? Did something happen?

176
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,456
It's nothing.

177
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,194
I'm doing well and nothing's wrong.

178
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,764
-Are you at school?
-Yeah, what about you?

179
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,768
I had some business so I came
down to the countryside.

180
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,137
I'm heading to Seoul right now.

181
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,608
Okay. Oh, my class is starting.
I'm hanging up.

182
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,212
Oh, okay. Make sure to eat too.

183
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,319
But why did you lie?

184
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,290
You didn't go to school, and you haven't slept. You
only worried about your sister this whole time.

185
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,662
If I told her that I was worried,
my sister would be more upset.

186
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,931
Sin Jun Young, you just
wait till you're back...

187
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,067
You're dead meat.

188
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,400
Wow, Ahjusshi is amazing.

189
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,207
How could he not call me once?
Wasn't he worried?

190
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,700
Ahjusshi...

191
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,549
Ahjusshi...

192
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,184
That's enough.

193
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,453
Ahjusshi...

194
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,888
I'm Sin Jun Young.

195
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,025
I don't deserve to be treated like this.

196
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,095
What a spoiled brat.

197
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,131
Ahjusshi...

198
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,701
If you say that one more time, I'm
going to throw you in the ocean.

199
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,408
Aish... get down.

200
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,558
Of course, globalizing the restaurant business
will boost our image and increase sales.

201
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:24,700
That's why we go into business. But...
Where can I find this proposal?

202
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,670
So, on page 32...

203
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,306
I'm not convinced at all with
that reasoning and evidence!

204
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,677
That's why I'm asking you.

205
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,560
-Which side are you?
-What are you...

206
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,720
Team Leader Park gets over being hangover from the
night before by flipping the hourglass at a sauna.

207
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,070
He enthusiastically plays golf,
changing his golf clubs often.

208
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,250
To make up for Team Leader Park, his subordinates
have made errors working late hours,

209
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,364
or Team Leader Park did do a task for
the first time in a long time, but...

210
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,168
Since it's been so long, he left out
what should've been included...

211
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,936
and included what he should've been left out.

212
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:06,960
So like this, there's no justification,
meaning, uniqueness, creativity...

213
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,114
I wonder if that's how such
a proposal came to be.

214
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,349
I'm sorry.

215
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,400
I'll make edits to parts that are
inadequate, in our next...

216
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,820
No, that wouldn't be necessary.
Team Leader Jeong.

217
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,555
Yes?

218
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,270
Take over this project
and develop it yourself.

219
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,762
Okay, Director.

220
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,998
Meeting dismissed.

221
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,000
Oh, it's Ahjusshi.

222
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,260
Hello?

223
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,680
Reporter Kim, why are you
also being like this?

224
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,580
Why did you not answer your phone?

225
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,920
I did, right now.

226
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,000
-Where is he?
-I don't know. Why don't you call him?

227
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,216
It's because Jun Young is
not answering his phone.

228
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,787
Please save me, reporter Kim.

229
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,256
PD No Eul said she doesn't know, either.

230
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,224
I'm begging you, please?

231
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,193
Okay, bye.

232
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,790
Why doesn't she know?

233
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,520
She seduced our innocent Jun Young, took his
hand and ran away in front of reporters!

234
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,634
You heard that, right?

235
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,470
You can just tell only me.

236
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,238
Who seduced whom? I'm also a victim...

237
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,020
I'm also a victim. And who
are you saying is innocent?

238
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,982
That jerk is so much a
rascal and a pervert...

239
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,330
Here you go.

240
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,168
Wiping her off like that won't do anything. Change
her clothes to this so she won't catch a cold.

241
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,003
Thank you.

242
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,480
Say there, Grandma.

243
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,673
What?

244
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:23,200
I'm sorry, but can you change her?

245
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,315
Don't you have hands? Why are
you asking a grandma to do it?

246
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,650
You said she's your wife.

247
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,900
True. But...

248
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:36,470
I'm too lazy to even
change my own clothes

249
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,628
so I wear the same
clothes all week long.

250
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,730
Geez...

251
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,901
Ahjusshi... Ahjusshi...

252
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:15,223
Just because of a strange woman, Sin Jun
Young's life is a strange melodrama.

253
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,765
It is not it.

254
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,170
This is too weak.

255
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,508
Sin Jun Young who is
totally out of it...

256
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,877
He takes the fastest train to retirement.

257
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,713
Ajumma, what do you think?

258
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,217
It's pretty good, right?

259
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,386
Beautiful spy...

260
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,726
He's a goner. Sin Jun Young who used to
be so popular has completely lost it.

261
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:53,128
What do you think, Boss?

262
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,265
Isn't it good?

263
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,968
Deuk Dragon...

264
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,138
What do you mean good my ass?

265
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,707
You guys got caught red-handed.

266
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,975
These guys...

267
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:11,647
I held back since you two know each
other. You think I'm an inanimate object?

268
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:17,986
Beautiful Spy and Deuk Dragon,
get ready to get sued!

269
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,260
Ahjumma!

270
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,156
Boss...

271
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,959
They're innocent.

272
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,830
I'm the one who wrote it and told them to write
bad comments about Sin Jun Young or whatever..

273
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,810
Whether it is lawsuit or
prison food, bring it on.

274
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,810
Ahjumma...

275
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,770
Aren't you being too much?

276
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:39,850
If your only son is faced with this situation,
you should be concerned and embrace him.

277
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,560
Is that something a parent should say?
Are you sure you're his mother?

278
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,000
You can't do this, CEO.

279
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,080
Don't stop me.

280
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:48,740
All this time I held myself back for the sake
of Jun Young. But I can't stand it anymore.

281
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,070
I'll say what I need to say today.

282
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,286
What do you need to say?

283
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,130
What do you have to say to me?

284
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,290
Wow, did you just speak
informally to me?

285
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,060
I'm older than you.

286
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,740
Don't you see all this white hair?

287
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,830
-If it bugs you, then lose the formality too!
-Ahjumma!

288
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,860
You took my quiet, studious boy and turned him into
a cheap entertainer. What can you say to me now?

289
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,104
A cheap entertainer?

290
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,741
A cheap entertainer? How can you call the most
popular Hallyu star a "cheap entertainer"?

291
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:18,100
Other parents would bow down and thank me a
lifesaver for making their kid a star like that!

292
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,350
Then take other kids and make them into stars
if you want them to bow to you rest of your life!

293
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,220
Why did you bother my Jun Young?

294
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,030
Wow, now I understand perfectly!

295
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,830
Why that punk Jun Young is such a
mess and does whatever he wants to do!

296
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,930
It's more strange to be normal growing up under
a mother with such an abnormal mentality!

297
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,480
Wow, I feel so bad for Jun Young!
Poor him!

298
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,420
You look like dog crap,
what are you saying!

299
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,703
Abnormal mentality?

300
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,400
Do you want to get it from an
oppa of an abnormal mental woman?

301
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,307
Father!

302
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,880
Let him go, Oppa.

303
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,878
Go apologize.

304
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:55,050
Say, "I'm sorry for lashing out my tongue. I was
too upset." Apologize to Jun Young's mother.

305
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,419
Let him go.

306
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,056
Okay. Do you know what
abnormal mentality is?

307
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,110
Abnormal mentality means a crazy...
Crazy witch.

308
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,830
He just called you a crazy witch. Do
you think I can just stay still?!

309
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,532
Yeah, please just stay still, please!

310
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,690
You leave Jun Young alone, and
you leave Jun Young alone too.

311
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,138
You guys leave him alone too.

312
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,241
Everybody just stay still!

313
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,513
We can't just stay still!

314
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:26,700
We have to find Jun Young first
before we can stay still.

315
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,984
Gook Young. Let go of me.

316
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,386
Father, please let go.

317
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:33,722
She told you to stay still!

318
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,895
I'm staying still. How can
I be more still than this?

319
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:44,520
My Ok said don't even raise
a hand so I'm being still.

320
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,030
Let me go.

321
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:46,935
What?

322
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,245
Where did that rascal go?
And who is that girl?

323
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,928
Ok, Choi Hyeon Joon went
to your son's concert.

324
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,116
Have you looked into why Sin
Jun Young came to the hospital?

325
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:39,410
The effect of Hallyu in China is mind-blowing.

326
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,323
Not only Korean dramas and
movies are popular,

327
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,260
Korean music and cosmetics are definitely
hot among the general population.

328
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,050
I'm quite surprised at the popularity
of Hallyu in China.

329
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,070
That's why I'm very thankful for it all.

330
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,200
Recently, the most popular Korean celebrity
among the Chinese is...

331
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,739
Sin Jun Young. Sin Jun Young is the
most popular in China.

332
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:01,142
-My daughter really likes him too.
-Really?

333
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,678
That's why I detest him.

334
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,027
I'm sorry, please excuse
me for a moment.

335
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,797
-Take care of Jang Sung.
-Yes.

336
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,545
Sin Young Ok?

337
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:42,384
Young Ok.

338
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,167
It's been a while.

339
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,469
Young Ok.

340
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,908
You are calling me Young Ok again.

341
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,747
It's me, Madam Song.

342
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,619
Five years ago... Bovary in
Samsung-dong... do you remember?

343
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,658
I've been waiting for you
for quite some time.

344
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,028
How could you not come
once after your election?

345
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,336
Stop by some time.

346
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,176
I opened up a store in Cheongdam-dong.

347
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,490
Do I have to go this far?

348
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,720
Yeah, you do. You're the nation's
flower snake right now.

349
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,671
The whole nation became a bunch of
snake hunters and are out to get you.

350
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,942
Let me tell you how much of the vicious comments
have been exaggerated, distorted, reproduced.

351
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,212
The fact that you're filming
Jun Young's documentary.

352
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,647
You got the job by being Kathy Bates in Misery.

353
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,653
That you have a video clip that can't be published
and that you're threatening Jun Young with it.

354
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,356
Who is that? Such nonsense...

355
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,792
Do people really believe that nonsense?

356
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,840
Yeah, they believe it. Even if it's
revealed that it's false later,

357
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,865
people believe what
they want to believe.

358
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,004
Well, at least they mosaic
my face in the newspaper.

359
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,210
It's only like that in the newspaper. Your bare
face is circulating all over the Internet.

360
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,179
Your address and even the brand of
your underwear has been revealed.

361
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,815
What do I do now?

362
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,717
Do I have to emigrate?

363
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,060
Do you really not know
where Jun Young is?

364
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,196
You are with him right now, right? You're with
him and you're lying to me right now, right?

365
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,332
Lie? What lie?

366
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,803
Being called nation's gold digger isn't enough
so now you're out to make me the nation's liar?

367
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,880
I don't know where Sin Jun Young is, so

368
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,520
if you're that frustrated, report
it. Report it to the police!

369
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,210
The one who kidnapped me is him!

370
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,279
Report it to the police
and find that kidnap...

371
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:25,713
What?

372
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:41,696
What is it?

373
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,800
You begged me to come, telling me your
address and sending me an invitation.

374
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,620
Are you scared now that I came?

375
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,803
It's not like that.

376
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,640
A really ugly thing just
appeared so close to me.

377
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,875
It scared me a bit.

378
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,145
What kind of a relationship
do you have with that woman?

379
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,648
What kind of relationship do you have with
her that you have to cover up for her?

380
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,280
And you threw a fit saying you'd kill me
if I even touched a hair on her body?

381
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,419
We're like that.

382
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:10,458
A relationship I can't help but cover and threaten
to kill if you even touch a hair on her body.

383
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,461
So that I won't throw a fit again...

384
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,296
do be careful.

385
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,870
Where is she right now?

386
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,690
Why? Are you going to tell everyone
where PD No Eul is and kill her?

387
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,939
It's nothing like that!

388
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,630
Never mind. Just tell me where she is.

389
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,776
I don't know either.

390
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,718
After he disappeared with that girl,
Oppa Jun Young hasn't been seen.

391
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,822
I checked SNS all day and
no one spotted them.

392
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:45,493
I heard she goes crazy over money. By
chance, did she sell him out somewhere...

393
00:35:51,766 --> 00:35:54,936
If you have any other trashy thoughts,
throw them away here before you come out.

394
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,720
You really!

395
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,275
Think of it as your house
and stay there comfortably.

396
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:02,510
Fine, go ahead and prepare for the bar!

397
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,340
I told you my dad is
a famous prosecutor!

398
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,670
I'm not throwing trash anywhere. I'm
throwing it away in the trash can.

399
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,685
Why should this be reported to the
police? Shouldn't I be complimented?

400
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,961
Is he asking for a fight?

401
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:46,347
Why did you get up? Are you
going to throw up again?

402
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:58,459
Do you really not know?

403
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,995
You really don't know
where Jun Young is?

404
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,666
I don't know either.

405
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:10,104
He wasn't there when I woke up. His
car was still in front of the ocean.

406
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:13,574
By now, Jun Young...

407
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,845
I mean Sin Jun Young must've taken it.

408
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,382
I'll send the address over to you.

409
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,272
Eul, you became a total star.

410
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,810
That's not me.

411
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,314
I know you can't be
caught by other people.

412
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:30,990
What did you do with Sin Jun Young that you're sitting
here? Especially with a man, just two of you?

413
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,887
It's not like that.

414
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,055
Noona.

415
00:39:34,856 --> 00:39:36,380
I think the intestines
are burning over there!

416
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,360
It's okay. They'll turn
over if it gets too hot.

417
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:41,062
Sorry?

418
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:46,220
Joke! It was funny, right?

419
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,738
Gosh, I know how to play
along with such humor...

420
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:53,307
Give me your autograph
before you go, Ms. Star.

421
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,149
Excuse me for this, but aren't your
sunglasses suffocating to you?

422
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,553
On top of that, you trip a lot.

423
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,688
They're suffocating.

424
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,207
You're jealous, right?

425
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,847
If you hadn't run away, you could
have become famous, like me.

426
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:38,486
I know. I guess that's
where my luck stops.

427
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,887
Coward.

428
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:42,924
Yes.

429
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:44,292
Detestable.

430
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:46,294
Yes.

431
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:47,762
Why did you appear again?

432
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,601
If you let go of my hand like that, you shouldn't
appear in front of me again from embarrassment.

433
00:40:54,335 --> 00:40:55,570
I should have done that.

434
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:59,207
I was going to do that.

435
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:04,378
I am sitting in front
of you like this again.

436
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,951
I'm just as shocked as
you are about myself.

437
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,023
The noodles are getting soggy!

438
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,660
Maybe we should've opted for hangover soup
since your stomach isn't feeling well?

439
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,860
Ah. But, how did you know that I drank?

440
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,760
You were the one who called me
telling me you drank a lot.

441
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,177
When did I?

442
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,482
I looked at my call records
and I didn't see your name.

443
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,151
With Sin Jun Young's cellphone.

444
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,054
When you called me,

445
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,391
was Sin Jun Young next to you?

446
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:53,895
I don't know.

447
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,667
What did I say? What exactly
did I say to you, Ahjussi?

448
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,037
I don't know! I can't
remember it either.

449
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,717
Let me take this call for a minute.

450
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,930
Geez, what kind of trouble did
you get yourself into, No Eul?

451
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,704
Hey Jeong Eun.

452
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,939
What are you doing, Ji Tae?

453
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,607
I'm in a meeting for work.

454
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,010
Oh, I'm sorry for calling
you while you're at work.

455
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,380
It's fine. You're doing fine?

456
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,882
Oh, of course.

457
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,787
But Ji Tae, did you go to Sin
Jun Young's concert yesterday?

458
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:55,756
No.

459
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,593
Oh... So you didn't.

460
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,628
Why?

461
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,290
It's nothing. Someone told me
that they saw you at the concert.

462
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,036
I don't have that much free time
to attend celebrity concerts.

463
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,440
That's right. That person must have
mistaken you and got it all wrong.

464
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,443
I said to them that our Ji Tae
couldn't have been there at all.

465
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,083
Jeong Eun, if you have time, do you
want to meet for dinner tomorrow?

466
00:43:28,723 --> 00:43:30,758
What's so great about you, Ahjussi?

467
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:35,663
You aren't as rich as Sin Jun Young.
You are much older than Sin Jun Young.

468
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:41,969
Sin Jun Young has 3 cars and you don't have any
cars. You don't have a house or a building either.

469
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,080
What gives you the right to reject me?

470
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,241
Hand me the cellphone.

471
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,415
Ahjusshi, can't you think
it over once more?

472
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:59,286
I'm really a good kid
if you look carefully.

473
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:02,256
From now on, I will be
really good to you.

474
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:05,960
Please accept me, Ahjussi.

475
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,131
Let's date, okay?

476
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,549
No Eul.

477
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,087
What should I do, No Eul?

478
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:11,258
The psycho that has her
back turned from me

479
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,596
hasn't looked at me once, and

480
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,435
is missing the guy that left her.
What do I do?

481
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,576
I'm Sin Jun Young after all.

482
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,887
Should I try to comfort her
and say not to be like that?

483
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:47,728
Should I threaten her by saying I
will hit her if she keeps doing that?

484
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,367
Because I am sure she is not normal.

485
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,006
Should I immediately take her to the
hospital for a doctor to see her?

486
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,078
Or...

487
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,719
My confession must have been too late.

488
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:19,160
Should I give up,

489
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,131
and let her go to him?

490
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:44,520
Did No Eul go somewhere?

491
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,654
She just left. You didn't see her?

492
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:53,093
By any chance, could it be that Eul
is the daughter of a chaebol family?

493
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:59,133
Judging from your expression, it must be true.
No wonder Sin Jun Young ran away with her.

494
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,771
I didn't do anything all of this
time to make Eul upset, right?

495
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:09,610
Taxi!

496
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,151
Where to?

497
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:18,452
To Geoje.

498
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,655
Please take me to Geoje, Ahjussi. Hurry!

499
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,200
We've arrived.

500
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,551
-Here you go...
-Thank you.

501
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,322
Can you please give me
a bit of a discount?

502
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,492
Taxi fare is fixed and nonnegotiable.

503
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,233
Do you take any installments?

504
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,679
Oh! It's you, plate-of-water Unni.

505
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:21,790
You still didn't find him?

506
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,340
I have people searching
this area thoroughly...

507
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,021
But no one has seen him.

508
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:29,780
Couldn't he be in Seoul?

509
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:34,550
Do you think a star like our Sin Jun Young
would have taken a bus or even a taxi?

510
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,960
What about the police? Did
you report it to the police?

511
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,790
What police? That's a useless mistake.

512
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,970
If the reporters catch on,
we're really done for then.

513
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,711
Did he... maybe drown in the ocean?

514
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:56,350
Jun Young! Where are you?

515
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:00,180
If you drowned and died,
at least tell us!

516
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,056
What if he actually fell in?

517
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,659
What do you mean what do we do?
We have to go and find him!

518
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:10,965
Unni, by chance, did you kill
him to steal his valuables?

519
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,920
The watch he's wearing alone
costs several million won.

520
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,236
-What?
-Unni, you like money a lot.

521
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:23,043
Then I killed him. I wanted Sin Jun Young's money
so badly that I was the one who killed him! So what?

522
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:26,246
How much money do you have with you?
Should I kill you too?!

523
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,918
No, no... I don't have any money.
All I have are loans and debt.

524
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,459
He really proposed to you in front of everyone,
but you reject his proposal.

525
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,931
Do you know how strong
Jun Young's pride is!

526
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,634
If he did something stupid over what
you did, Plate-of-water Unni...

527
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,070
But then I really won't stay still!

528
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:52,840
Where did he go...

529
00:49:56,944 --> 00:49:59,870
Child, haven't you left for Seoul yet?

530
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,881
Grandma!

531
00:50:07,855 --> 00:50:09,256
Here eat this.

532
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,820
Your husband is nowhere to be found.

533
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:20,134
Yesterday evening, a
bunch of people came and

534
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,800
asked when he came and
when he left my house.

535
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:26,580
They asked what you guys did
and if he said anything weird.

536
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,543
Oh my, they barged in as if questioning a
daughter-in-law who got caught having an affair.

537
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,040
Did he really not tell you
where exactly he was going?

538
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:35,482
No, he didn't. He told me to make you
hangover soup when you got up and

539
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,180
told me to let you borrow my clothes
because your clothes were still wet.

540
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:40,320
He just left a bunch of
money and disappeared.

541
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,121
Seriously...

542
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:21,595
Eul, you didn't actually
cause trouble, right?

543
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,468
Saying, "Sin Jun Young, you're
so annoying. Just die..."

544
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:34,041
"Where is the ghost leaving Sin Jun
Young alone?" I didn't say that, did I?

545
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,226
Grandma!

546
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,462
Where is this place?

547
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:31,632
That place? It's the island over there.

548
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,302
-Is this place near?
-Yes.

549
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,005
It takes around 40 minutes
by riding a boat.

550
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,333
Please excuse me.

551
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:44,571
Captain, could you let
me ride the boat once?

552
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,464
Sin Jun Young!

553
00:54:12,032 --> 00:54:13,200
Jun Young!

554
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:39,760
Jun Young!

555
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,975
Where are you, Sin Jun Young?

556
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:59,713
If you are not here then where are you?

557
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:05,452
Where exactly are you
trying to hide, you jerk?

558
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,703
Hello?

559
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,807
This is No Eul. Have you
found Sin Jun Young yet?

560
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,176
No, we haven't found him

561
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,679
no matter where. We think
something serious has happened.

562
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:40,700
If we don't find him by today, we
will be reporting it to the police.

563
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:44,391
Our Jun Young.

564
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:18,992
How come you're sleeping right now?

565
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:21,995
Can you sleep with all these
people worrying about you?

566
00:56:24,197 --> 00:56:25,365
Are you filming a movie or something?

567
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,435
As expected of an actor...

568
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:31,872
I must be crazy.

569
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:35,942
What kind of crazy things have I
done because of this jerk?

570
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,660
I took a very expensive taxi all
the way up to here from Seoul.

571
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:41,882
I couldn't even sleep in the cold and I waited
for the boat while shivering from the cold.

572
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,717
I got bitten by a seagull too.

573
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,520
Ah! My money...

574
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:50,390
I could have fed our Jik some
meat with all that wasted money.

575
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,476
By any chance, do you think
this is all a dream, right?

576
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,180
This is not a dream. It's
true I'm the real Eul.

577
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,383
I came all the way
here just to find you.

578
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,854
Wow, he must really
think he is dreaming.

579
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:24,224
I said I am really Eul!

580
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:29,029
Ah, seriously.

581
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:31,932
I should pinch you so that you
come back to your senses.

582
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,373
Just go.

583
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,108
What?

584
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,144
I said for you to go away.

585
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,948
-What?
-Get out of my sight.

586
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,400
If I ever see him again,
I'll be an idiot, idiot!

587
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:47,250
I really want to apologize to you.

588
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,209
Hit me until you aren't angry anymore.

589
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:50,590
I heard you saw those photos.

590
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:54,281
Christmas rose... I don't
have anything to give you.

591
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,400
Son of a...

592
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,650
Brainstem glioma?

593
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:59,352
Due to its terrible location,
the surgery is difficult.

594
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,254
What if Sin Jun Young wasn't joking and

595
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:04,891
if he seriously liked me. What do I do?
