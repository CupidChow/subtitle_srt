1
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:05,630
=Episode 4=

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,494
She was going towards the
Han River Bridge nearby.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,462
What if she already jumped and drowned?

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,964
Han River Bridge my ass.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,268
Did you really believe what
Gook Yeong said? You idiot?

6
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,849
Awesome! Those are Jun Ho and Lee Yu Bi!

7
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,486
Those two are shooting a movie together
but I guess they're really dating!

8
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,923
I knew it! The heavens
haven't given up on me yet.

9
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,729
Should we take another one? One, two...

10
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,991
Is living that laughable? Do you
think it's that easy to die?

11
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,797
Let's film the documentary.
I'll do it, you stupid!

12
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,512
Prepare the defibrillator.

13
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:45,282
200 joules. One, two, shoot!

14
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,852
300 Joules. One, two, shoot!

15
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,988
The pulse is back.

16
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,523
Okay.

17
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,536
The danger has passed for now and
the surgery finished successfully.

18
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,673
Your sister won't die so
don't worry too much.

19
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,809
-Thank you, doctor.
-Thank you, doctor.

20
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,571
You say you are dropping out of college?

21
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,373
Yes.

22
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,041
But why?

23
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,845
You passed the first test of the bar exam.
Why are you dropping out all of a sudden?

24
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,215
If someone like me becomes a prosecutor,

25
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,186
there will be no hope for this country.

26
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,121
JANUARY 2016.

27
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,460
Hello. Good morning everyone,
this is Park Ji Jeong.

28
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,531
This is me?

29
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,438
As expected, the power
of cosmetics is amazing!

30
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,041
Ah wait. Since you're doing this,

31
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,800
should I add a little gold powder under your
eyes, so you become like a girl group member?

32
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,847
Gold powder my ass...
You got money to waste?

33
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,683
Hey!

34
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,053
I spent the whole morning putting makeup
on you. How come you are doing this?

35
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,080
You want me to go see Sin
Jun Young like this?

36
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,491
Are you trying to tell me to seduce him?

37
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,460
I'm going to see him for work!

38
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,762
Yeah go to work, my friend.

39
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,999
Is he the kind of guy who will be seduced
just because you try to seduce him?

40
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,004
There are plenty of chaebol daughters who
are a thousand times prettier and richer

41
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,040
who are waiting to get his attention.

42
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,178
A girl like you won't be able to grab even the
slightest bit of Sin Jun Young's attention.

43
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,014
So why do I have to wear makeup then?

44
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:37,420
Even though Sin Jun Young has become
someone who's out of our league,

45
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,625
I don't want you to look cheap and be
laughed at as an easy target anymore.

46
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,420
Let them see me as cheap and laugh
at me. Can't they? I'm okay with it.

47
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,267
I'm not okay with that.
My pride won't let me.

48
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,606
Still, those memories where you used to
walk around with your arms around him

49
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,942
make you look pitiful.

50
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,118
Where's the gold eye shadow?
Try putting some on me.

51
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,139
Just where am I sick
when I look this good?

52
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,450
-Jun Young, come outside for a bit.
-Why?

53
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,720
That plate-of-water unni
is outside the front door.

54
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,834
Whatever you're imagining, you'll be able
to see something even better. Let's go!

55
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,614
Oh my, she's trying extra
hard to look good for you.

56
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,584
But why do I feel a
little sorry for her?

57
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,689
But is it because I know that Sin
Jun Young won't take it easy on her?

58
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,500
The neighbors might end reporting her to police for
acting like a crazy woman. Why isn't she coming in?

59
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,803
Leave it. Just go and
feed something to Pororo.

60
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,913
The more I look at myself...
I'm so pretty.

61
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,485
Hiding your pretty looks all this time,

62
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,121
what a hard life you've lived, my Eul.

63
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,930
I'm sorry! You waited
a long time, right?

64
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,164
What's going on that you prevented me from
coming in and told me to wait outside?

65
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,200
Your earrings and bag.

66
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,802
It really concerned me
that they were imitations.

67
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,138
I borrowed the genuine
items from my friend.

68
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:42,830
What?

69
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,806
Bring your ear.

70
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:48,910
Guys like Jun Young will recognize
if it's real or fake really quickly.

71
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,510
Who cares if it's a knock off?

72
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,818
That's really embarrassing!
He might take your life,

73
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,654
as a fake and look down on you.

74
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,860
That jerk will look down
on me whatever I do.

75
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,327
He has such a nasty temper.

76
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,196
His rudeness in the past is
nothing compared to now.

77
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,135
Wow.

78
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,172
The fact that Jun Young lives in this
palace like house all by himself.

79
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,441
I'm getting timid just looking
at the main entrance.

80
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,846
Hey No Eul! There's nothing
to be scared about!

81
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,020
Jun Young has a nasty character? If you blow
your top off, you are almost a dog yourself!

82
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,140
Yeah. Don't worry, my friend.

83
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,625
If Jun Young throws a fit, just
think it's a puppy barking.

84
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,960
I mean, just think how you got his work!

85
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,930
It's a result from your "almost
committing suicide" show.

86
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,967
I didn't pretend to
want to commit suicide.

87
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,670
I didn't say I'd commit suicide.

88
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,707
He just misunderstood
and deluded himself.

89
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,976
How can I leave my Jik and die?

90
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,877
Of course!

91
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:34,884
Yes, hello Manager Jang! This is No Eul.

92
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,687
I'm outside Jun Young's
house right now.

93
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,590
I've been ringing the bell for 10 minutes
already, but there is no answer.

94
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,995
Oh, is that so? What could it be? I'll
check now and call you back later.

95
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,930
-Yes.
-Yeah.

96
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,838
What do you think it could be? It's because
Sin Jun Young's temper has started up again.

97
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,215
Ah, Sin Jun Young!

98
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:09,485
Sin Jun Young!

99
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,121
Aren't you in there?

100
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,858
I'm freezing to death outside here!

101
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:18,127
Please open the door for me.

102
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,101
What is this? Did he call me
over just to play with me?

103
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,481
-Hi.
-Hello.

104
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,218
Hello.

105
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,990
Your doorbell must be broken. The
filming crew will come a bit later....

106
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:50,390
They aren't going to come.
I told them not to come.

107
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,860
Why?

108
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,395
Because I'm not going
to shoot the documentary.

109
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,200
Didn't you say... that you were
going to shoot it last night?

110
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,036
It's because I was fooled by you.

111
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,940
I thought that you were going to jump off the
bridge into the Han River because I said no.

112
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,990
That wasn't me fooling
you, you misunderstood.

113
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,752
Then, "Sin Jun Young, you misunderstood,"
and "I wasn't going to commit suicide"

114
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:17,653
is what you should have told me.

115
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,657
Ah, that...

116
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:27,964
I was definitely going to tell you...
but I just forgot.

117
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,466
Either way, let's forget
about the documentary film.

118
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,971
Pororo, what are you doing?
Let's go for a walk!

119
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,779
I also lost something valuable because of you,
the proof that Jun Ho and Lee Yu Bi are dating!

120
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,790
Were you in the middle of filming a
"Hidden Camera" with celebrities?

121
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,386
Yes! By selling that, I could have earned
two months' worth of my living expenses!

122
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:54,323
Send a text of your bank
account number to my manager.

123
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,395
I'll send you double the amount of that two-months
of living expenses that you lost because of me.

124
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,371
How much will you give me? Do you even know
how much two months of living expense is?

125
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,875
Don't give me small amounts like $300
and $1,000. Try giving me $100,000!

126
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,750
You only need a $100,000? If you
want, I could give you a $1,000,000.

127
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:26,622
I could give you my house, my car, my buildings.
I can give you everything that I have.

128
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,592
Give me a higher number.

129
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,996
I have so much money, so why are
you only asking for $1,000,000?

130
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,390
That's right, it must be nice
for you because you are rich.

131
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,990
I don't have enough money to live, but you
have so much money to look down on people.

132
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,612
You must be happy you can break promises
whenever you want to, you crazy jerk!

133
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,116
Pororo!

134
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,368
What is this? Did you do this to her?

135
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,990
No, Pororo attacked her because
the owner was bothered.

136
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,390
Did Pororo bite this unni?

137
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,190
No, Pororo just barked and ran
up to her but she fainted.

138
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,878
Pororo only barked and ran
up to her but she fainted?

139
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,181
She's putting on a show.
Who does she think I am?

140
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,252
I'm going to workout, Hyung, so
play along and send her home.

141
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,524
I think this unni is really ill.

142
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,410
Jun Young! This unni is a little weird.
Come over here quickly!

143
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,048
I don't think she is faking it.

144
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,788
Call Doctor Kang to come here.

145
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,263
A sudden shock made her
blood vessels expand.

146
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,334
As her blood pressure dropped, it seems
like she went into hypotension shock.

147
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,570
You said that she fainted after
shortness of breath?

148
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:23,005
Yes.

149
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,009
Looking at the reaction on her skin
and the sudden shortness of breath,

150
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,980
it seems like her dog
allergy was the main cause.

151
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,748
Dog allergy?

152
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,485
Since I've given her some medications to raise her
blood pressure and to calm the skin reaction,

153
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,555
she'll be fine after tonight.

154
00:15:41,324 --> 00:15:43,859
Thank you for coming
even on your day off.

155
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,563
If you're thankful, give me
your autograph for my daughter.

156
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,001
Jun Young, you look healthy.

157
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,836
Ah yeah, I think so.

158
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,441
It seems that you've misdiagnosed me.

159
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,478
Since you helped me out
today, I won't sue you.

160
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,256
Pororo, you stay here today. He
said she is ill because of you.

161
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,862
Also, I'm thankful that you were protecting
me, but from now on, don't do it again.

162
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,367
If you had bitten No Eul, I would have
kicked you out of this house, punk.

163
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,936
Got it?

164
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,059
The person you are trying to reach...

165
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,126
Hyung!

166
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,398
Oh, did you take a look around? This is
the perfect place for you and Eul, right?

167
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,390
You're saying that we'll live here?
We don't have money.

168
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,808
There's this hyung I know who ended up emigrating
but he didn't want to sell this or rent it out.

169
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:41,944
So you guys just need to
maintain it well and live here.

170
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,015
-For free?
-Yes, for free. It's good, right?

171
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,685
-I don't want it.
-Why? Why you don't want it?

172
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:56,425
These days, my sister contemplates
how she can swindle people,

173
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,029
how she can mooch off people for free,

174
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,469
how she can turn $1.00 into $100,000. She
dreams about ridiculous things like that.

175
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,307
When even thinking about those things, imagine
what'll happen if she hits jackpot like this?

176
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,211
"See... Indeed it's all about luck."

177
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,913
"There's no need to live
diligently and honestly."

178
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,250
She'll only hope for good flukes, and it'll only
be a matter of time before she destroys her life.

179
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:25,020
I'm thankful for your concern, but
I don't want anything for free.

180
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,790
Besides, I was going to stay at my friend's
house while my sister stays at Na Ri's house.

181
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,763
Since I'll work part-time and my sister already
works, we'll be able to find a house real soon.

182
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:38,167
Okay, I got it. I did wrong.

183
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:41,320
What the heck is living inside of you?

184
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,405
How can you embarrass me
like this every time?

185
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:50,746
What is this?

186
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:54,984
There's a kid I tutor. His
grades went up, so his mother gave this to me.

187
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:57,853
You should use this to go buy a
parka at the department store.

188
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,990
Hey! My parka is fine. You
should go buy one for yourself.

189
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:07,390
Why is there a hole here?
It wasn't here earlier...

190
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,198
You know that my noona
is materialistic, right?

191
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,904
Even though I'd want you to be my brother-in-law,
my noona doesn't think of you in that way.

192
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,873
It's because you're poor like us.

193
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,909
And my sister likes rich people.

194
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,546
Therefore, you should use
this to buy new clothes

195
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,050
and appeal to my sister
as a charming man, okay?

196
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,395
Oh, right.

197
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,400
Oh I won't be late.

198
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:26,900
You're saying
Jeong Eun made all this?

199
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,180
Yes, Madam. I thought she was
just smart and beautiful.

200
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,250
But her skills are great!

201
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,516
That's not much.

202
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,953
Indeed, the professional
skills are different.

203
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,224
How did your mother raise
her child so wonderfully?

204
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,027
How could you have made all of this
in that short time I was gone?

205
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,098
Ha Roo, do you not feel
anything while seeing this?

206
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,332
I do.

207
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,470
That unni is a total jinx!

208
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,790
Ha Roo! How can you, to your unni...

209
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,544
Ah, I'm sorry Jeong Eun!

210
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,948
It's okay. My friends do that to me too.

211
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,117
They told me that I am a total jinx.

212
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,528
There is definitely something there.

213
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,164
What's there?

214
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,101
If she's a human, she
can't be that perfect.

215
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,839
Her household is overly rich, she's overly
good at studying, she has overly good looks,

216
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,176
her body is overly sexy, and her
personality is overly good.

217
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,578
And now she's overly
good at cooking too?

218
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,914
Who? Jeong Eun?

219
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,383
She might not be an earthling.

220
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,754
Perhaps... is she a jinx from a star?

221
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,958
What if she's like that, but
when she goes inside her house,

222
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,663
she catches and eats snakes, rats,
and cockroaches and after that,

223
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,300
when it's midnight, she goes to a
public cemetery and digs up a grave,

224
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,705
and opens the dead person's
coffin door and drinks the blood...

225
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,474
Oh my!

226
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,043
Oh Ji Tae.

227
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,610
I'm home, Father.

228
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,681
Ah what the heck? I was shocked!

229
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,283
So why slander people like that?

230
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,684
Jeong Eun is here.

231
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,453
Yes, I heard.

232
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,360
She came early to prepare the food
for your grandfather's memorial.

233
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,525
Jeong Eun seems to have done all of it.
Compliment her saying, "You worked hard."

234
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,961
Okay, after I wash up.

235
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,770
There really might be something
going on with Jeong Eun!

236
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:39,170
A kind and flawless face like that,
either a psychopath or a sociopath...

237
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,075
Choi Ha Roo!

238
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,612
It was a joke. A joke!

239
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:46,482
Why are you being so
serious and making a fuss?

240
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,084
Making your precious daughter nervous...

241
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,491
You!

242
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,573
I don't like Jeong Eun.

243
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,749
The engagement that the elders from both sides
made without our consent... please cancel it.

244
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,550
Jeong Eun is a good person.

245
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,358
Many well known families are coveting
her as their daughter-in-law.

246
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:34,430
How can I live with a woman I don't
love... no, don't even like?

247
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,200
Mother and Father were in love with each
other so that's why you two got married.

248
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,540
So ask me...

249
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,239
Is there a woman you're dating now?

250
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,842
No, that's not it.

251
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,980
I know what kind of influence Jeong
Eun's father has on you, Father.

252
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,419
I also know that in order to fulfill your
dreams, that Jeong Eun's father is necessary.

253
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,988
But...

254
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,928
Despite all that, this is about choosing
the person I will spend my life with.

255
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,331
It's something my whole
life is hanging on.

256
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:16,672
I understand. I'll call tomorrow
and call the engagement off.

257
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,773
Honey!

258
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:26,849
Although my dream is important, but as a
father, my son's dream is more important.

259
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:38,193
Nothing in this world will exceed
the value of you in my life.

260
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,372
This wine's fragrance is quite nice.

261
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,408
My son chose this, right?

262
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,115
Ji Tae.

263
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,887
It's been hard, right? You worked hard.

264
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,192
If it's commendable, give me a kiss.

265
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,835
Although you're warm, you're not hot.

266
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,907
You're only seeing me out of duty because the
elders told you to treat me well, right?

267
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,010
You don't even love me.

268
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,083
It really must be true.

269
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,854
Ah, my pride is hurt.

270
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:19,995
Let's get married. Let's just skip the
engagement ceremony and get married, Jeong Eun.

271
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,410
Do you love me?

272
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,070
As long as you don't push me away,
I won't ever leave your side.

273
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:30,505
You won't say "I love you" till the end.

274
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:38,981
Even so, it's okay, because
I'll love you more.

275
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,665
It's because when I woke up,
I felt really hungry...

276
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,900
I'll pay for the ramen.

277
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:40,842
No... I'll pay for the ramen. Since we're not
coworkers, I can use informal speech, right?

278
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,512
Is fainting your concept?

279
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,685
It's because my immunity dropped.

280
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,656
I was in a car accident before, and after
I went through three big surgeries,

281
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,558
my body isn't the same anymore.

282
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,934
By any chance... do you
have any leftover rice?

283
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:19,748
That... about that thing
we talked about earlier.

284
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,620
About that thing earlier,
is it still valid?

285
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,593
Uh, so...

286
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,397
So...

287
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:44,439
Well... You said you would give me a
house, a car and even a building.

288
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,375
You said you would give me
anything I'm dying to have.

289
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,846
Hey. I know very well that
you won't give me anything.

290
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,981
I asked just in case that's all.

291
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,520
What is it that you want?

292
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:03,091
Can I say it?

293
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,329
A hundred-million won.

294
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,733
To me, that's the largest
amount of money there is.

295
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,837
Is that too much?

296
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,106
What about 50 million won?

297
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,644
What about 30 million won?

298
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,482
10 million won!

299
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,888
If you give me 10 million won, I won't
bother you about filming the documentary.

300
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,724
I won't appear in front of you anymore.

301
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,600
If you can't just give it to me, then please
lend it to me. Interest free for 82 months.

302
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,609
Interest free for 60 months.

303
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,579
You won't let me borrow it?

304
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,448
-When you're so wealthy?
-No, I won't.

305
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,751
No. Then why did you
make me tell you anyway?

306
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,210
Wow, they say the people who have
it all are the worst, so petty.

307
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,220
Earn your money by working. Why try to get
free money when you have a healthy body?

308
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,380
I have to get work in order
to earn the money?

309
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,831
I barely got this work but blew
it because you are so flaky!

310
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:17,799
Let's film the documentary then.

311
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,702
You're starting it again.

312
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,939
-I said let's film the documentary.
-Ah, yes. Yes.

313
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,649
Why? Is there something wrong?

314
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,010
Please write the contract
for the documentary again.

315
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,470
You said you won't do it, didn't you? Gook Yeong
called me to tell me that you canceled it again.

316
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,925
I changed my mind. I'm going
to be filming it again.

317
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:50,290
I got it. Just in case you change your mind again,
think about it when you wake up tomorrow morning.

318
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,820
I won't change my mind again.

319
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,136
Put in contract, I'll pay 1000 times the contract
amount for breach of contract if I flake out again.

320
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,239
Are you really going to shoot it?

321
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,567
Ahjussi!

322
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:27,135
What is it?

323
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,471
It's an employment present.

324
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,942
My brother and I were mooching off of you so much
all this time when you don't have money yourself.

325
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,478
So much so that you can't even
buy yourself a pair of sneakers.

326
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:42,584
Did you get a job? I thought you wouldn't get a
job in that field because you got blacklisted.

327
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,619
You are awesome, Eul!

328
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,490
Sin Jun Young said he would
film the documentary.

329
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,395
Amazing right? You can't
believe it, right?

330
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,767
People don't know, but I'm a
person full of capability.

331
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,203
All the people who put me down are dead.

332
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,374
Hello?

333
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,178
Ahjussi, why aren't you saying anything?

334
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,082
Did he fall asleep while calling?

335
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,156
It's already after 3 AM.

336
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:28,697
Ahjussi, are you really sleeping?

337
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,469
Then sleep well.

338
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,557
Are you mad?

339
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,931
I'm not kicking you out forever.

340
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,510
I'm asking you to live here for three months,
at the vacation house where the air is fresh.

341
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,170
Just while Hyung is
shooting the documentary.

342
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,606
You can see the clouds,

343
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:17,479
and the sky, and at night, you can see the
moon and stars. It's a really good place.

344
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,953
Then, do you want me to live
here and you live inside?

345
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,260
-Ahjumma.
-Yes?

346
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,932
Please clean up Pororo's fur
that's on the carpet and floor.

347
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,401
What?

348
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:43,204
No, it's just that because
of Pororo's fur, her allergy...

349
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,373
Ah, I will do it.

350
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:56,778
Ta-da! The taro-flavored milk
tea that our No Eul likes!

351
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,810
I filled it with ice, made it sweet, and put
tapioca pearls and even coconut at the bottom.

352
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,021
And I specially added the milk foam and
ordered it. As a jumbo size! How is it?

353
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,593
Oh and the milk foam is... my heart.

354
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,395
Why are you like this?

355
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,832
Wow. Our PD No, your
skin got really good.

356
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,437
See! A person should rest sometimes and then
work. It's good that you listened to me, right?

357
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,642
-What are you saying?
-So since you rested, should we do our work now?

358
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,810
What kind of work?

359
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,630
The Department of
Culture and Tourism called yesterday...

360
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:37,352
asking for us to make a documentary. I'd
like it if you'd produce the documentary.

361
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,055
Ah, I get it.

362
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:41,556
What?

363
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,859
You heard the rumors already, didn't you?
That I'm filming Sin Jun Young's documentary?

364
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,730
Is that so? I never heard such a thing.

365
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:54,469
So how could you have not recognized
such talent and fired me like that?

366
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,106
You really can't read people...

367
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:01,676
I'll double your salary!
More than the other side.

368
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,280
A permanent position with the
four kinds of insurance!

369
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,249
-For real?
-For real!

370
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,423
Ah I need to pick this one up.
I'm sorry.

371
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,728
Amazing!

372
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,466
Yes, Director Choi?

373
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,338
Ah, PD No is in my office right now.

374
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,742
I'll take responsibility and convince her,
so don't worry too much.

375
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:41,316
Thank you. If you convince PD No Eul well, I'll
proceed with the investment that we talked about.

376
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,870
-Why are there flowers in Jun Young's house?
-He changed the cushions and the carpet.

377
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,111
-This rascal.
-He's totally tricky, isn't he?

378
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,030
He was making a fuss that he would never
shoot the documentary, but now...

379
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,651
Actually he pays a lot of
attention to the media.

380
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,121
-But where is Jun Young?
-Where did he go?

381
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,407
Jun Young, are you in the bathroom?

382
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,945
What are you doing? Are you pooping?

383
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,390
Well then, take care of your business.

384
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,503
I wanted to ask, "Why now?"

385
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,510
I was okay. I ate well, slept well.

386
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,748
I even beat my own record of climbing
up Mount Cheonggye by three minutes.

387
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,320
Eul was going to come today.

388
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,324
How much I waited for this time.

389
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,893
Why did it have to be now of all times?

390
00:38:34,595 --> 00:38:39,133
Suddenly, at that time, the promise
that I made back then came up.

391
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,272
Just save Eul.

392
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,308
If you just save Eul,

393
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,382
I will give up all the
happiness allotted to me.

394
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,726
I'll give up on all happiness.

395
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,470
Thank you for the offer and
treating me unconventionally.

396
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,072
Oh my, I'm the one who's grateful!

397
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,009
I was worried that you would be angry and reject
the offer because of what happened last time.

398
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,646
Ah as expected! You are great.
You hold no grudge!

399
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,517
But I'm not... I hold grudges
for a long time.

400
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,819
I'm not going to work for this company.

401
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,155
Ah, what are you saying?

402
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:38,159
You love money so much. I already
said I'll pay you double the amount.

403
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,863
Plus, a permanent position
with the 4 kinds of insurance!

404
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,569
Hey, punk, No Eul!

405
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,746
Double the salary and a permanent position
with the benefits... it's really tempting.

406
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:04,552
If I betray him right now, Sin Jun
Young will really kill me. 100%.

407
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,389
I'm sorry.

408
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,693
No Eul is crazy enough over money to do
anything, but she said she didn't want...

409
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,742
If an evil person like you becomes a
politician, this nation will be hopeless.

410
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,112
If you find the culprit
associated with my father's case

411
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:37,618
that you manipulated, I'll
burn all the files I have.

412
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,255
Hey!

413
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,250
Hey, where are you going? Hey!
Aren't you gonna stop?

414
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,047
Find out about the owner of this phone.

415
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,515
Who is that person?

416
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,551
The person who almost
killed his girlfriend

417
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,455
and saved my father.

418
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:24,612
The friend you ask me to find out, his name is
Sin Jun Young, it seems he's your father's son.

419
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,688
Congratulations, Doctor Park.

420
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,824
You're not a quack.

421
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,461
The speed of the disease's
spread is faster than expected.

422
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,498
How much longer do I have then?

423
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,330
Six months, or three months?

424
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,440
How about if you just get admitted to the
hospital now and get some treatments?

425
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,490
You can get cancer treatment and radiation.
First, we will do everything we can...

426
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,613
Just because I do it, it
doesn't mean I'm not dying.

427
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,983
But we would be able
to lengthen your life.

428
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,820
Whatever.

429
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,924
Please prescribe me a good painkiller
and just make me not feel the pain,

430
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:16,497
so that no one will know that Sin Jun
Young has a life-threatening illness.

431
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:22,470
If possible, so that I
can't detect it either.

432
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,243
If you make it possible for me to feel no pain
until I die, I'll give you 100 autographs.

433
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,125
Isn't that Sin Jun Young?

434
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,393
Yes, I think so.

435
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,530
I wonder what brought him here?

436
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:53,567
I think you should hurry and go in. You
will be late for your appointment.

437
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,736
Ah, that's right.

438
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:13,087
The person you are trying to
reach is currently unavailable.

439
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,031
This ahjumma is joking.

440
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,902
Who does a meeting in a
yukgaejang restaurant?

441
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,806
It's not like she'd call me back...

442
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:52,893
Speaking frankly, Sin Jun
Young is a bit overrated.

443
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,965
Don't say things like
"a bit" or "a little".

444
00:46:58,265 --> 00:47:02,469
You look like you have no confidence and cheap.
Use words like "totally" and "of course".

445
00:47:02,636 --> 00:47:06,740
You must write it with full conviction
for people to think "Ah, is that so?"

446
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,342
Yes, Ahjumma.

447
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,912
Faces like Sin Jun
Young's are super common.

448
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,170
When you go outside, you can
find them anywhere, right away.

449
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,282
Like this, President?

450
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,252
Let me see. "Sin Jun Young's face..."

451
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:22,623
To be honest, his face
is not that common.

452
00:47:22,857 --> 00:47:25,993
You open that door, go outside, and see if
you can find a face like that right away.

453
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,820
Yeong Deok! If you make it sound
like a foolish dreamy story,

454
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,566
people will only think you're
cheap and won't even look.

455
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,635
They won't even click the "like."

456
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,337
Yes, President.

457
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:42,309
Sin Jun Young should retire from
the industry once and for all.

458
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,610
Whenever Sin Jun Young comes
out on TV, I switch channels...

459
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,740
When Oppa Jun Young appears on TV, you do
see people changing channels, right away,

460
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,086
from the channels that Jun Young doesn't
appear on to the channels that he does.

461
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:57,591
My goodness. Look at these people.

462
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:03,150
Trying to retire Jun Young from entertainment,
you're writing hateful comments, right?

463
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,799
You guys should raise your heads.

464
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,603
I'm going to take photos of you and
report you as hate commenter!

465
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:15,330
Hey. Yeong Deok. I said that I'm
pickling garlic and onions,

466
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,112
so did I tell you to peel the
garlic and onions or not?

467
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:22,030
But in those two hours, you
peeled only this much.

468
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,010
You've been bad-mouthing
Jun Young?

469
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,888
Our boss loves to peel Sin Jun Young more
than she likes to peel garlic though.

470
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,457
I need to peel what the
boss says to peel.

471
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,293
Do I have any power?

472
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,962
For real...

473
00:48:35,229 --> 00:48:39,266
What about you, Man Ok? You're Sin Jun
Young's stylist and coordinator...

474
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:43,337
-Is a coordinator an anti-fan?
-What about me?

475
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,107
To be honest, Ahjumma was so pleased when
Oppa Jun Young got admitted into law school.

476
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,078
But he dropped out on his own without saying
a word. How could a human being do that?

477
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,781
Really, no human being
would do such a thing.

478
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,217
Just consider our Jun Young
is ahead of our time!

479
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,788
Ah, what anachronisms we have here!

480
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,940
What would you know about the trend
anyway? You don't know about the trend.

481
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:05,592
That's enough. Stop it.

482
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:07,962
You're the biggest problem.

483
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:14,001
Who do you think Choi Hyeon Joon is? If you showed
up with him as a prosecutor, you think he'd flinch?

484
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,171
" Well done, our Ok"; "Good job, Ok.
You raised him well."

485
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,208
Is that guy willing to shatter
his family and move in with you...

486
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,946
Our Jun Young didn't become a
celebrity because he wanted to.

487
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,016
Because your son caused
a serious accident,

488
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:33,487
he wanted to bail your son out with the contract
money, didn't he? Do you think I didn't know that?

489
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:40,594
How did...

490
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,430
How did she know that?

491
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,702
Knowing all that, she's been
dating me all this time?

492
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:05,085
Jun Young already knows that you're the one
who posts hate comments on his articles.

493
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,622
Because he might possibly see
Ahjumma at the police station,

494
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,291
he's not suing the people
who write hateful comments.

495
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:16,920
Crazy brat...

496
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,170
This is the collection of hate
comments captured by the data team

497
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:29,977
and one million signatures collected,
wanting on-line haters to be punished.

498
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:33,580
These are all the bad
comments said to Jun Young!

499
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,900
They're completely horrible. This
one should get life in prison!

500
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,851
They all warrant life in prison!

501
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,920
I think I know this person here.

502
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:44,525
What does it matter if they keep changing IDs and
IP, they keep copying and pasting their comments.

503
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:50,531
What is this?

504
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:54,535
Oppa Jun Young's documentary
will be produced by a woman?

505
00:50:55,602 --> 00:50:59,773
With this...

506
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:04,678
This weird woman will be lingering
around my oppa for 24 hours?

507
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,654
Is it true that this woman
is even a producer?

508
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,360
She looks too young, and she looks
like she has no skills at all.

509
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:19,126
-She looks suspicious, right?
-Yes.

510
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,963
I feel like the priority is to get rid of
this woman before the comments.

511
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,666
Her name is... No Eul?

512
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,570
Heol! Her name is No Eul?

513
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,611
Anyway, I uploaded her photo in our group
chat room so find out more about her.

514
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,914
Is she a producer? Which
college did she go to?

515
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,685
Where does she live? Ah! Does
she have any family members?

516
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,255
Anything about her past will do. I
will search up in every way, too.

517
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,123
Yes.

518
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:57,610
Excuse me. The No Eul you're talking about, is she a
female producer? The one shooting a documentary.

519
00:51:57,764 --> 00:51:58,565
That's right.

520
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:02,035
-Do you perhaps know her?
-Yes, well a bit...

521
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,672
You really know her? But how?

522
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,408
Perhaps... Are you her boyfriend?

523
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,713
I'm at my part-time job
now so I can't talk much.

524
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,483
If you give me your phone number,
I'll call you when I get off work.

525
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:19,560
You're... not possibly
joking with me, right?

526
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,155
If you don't believe
me, then never mind.

527
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,835
Don't sell my phone number for
voice-phishing or for business.

528
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,871
My dad was an extremely
famous prosecutor, you know.

529
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,444
What name should I save it as?
What's your name?

530
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,760
Oh Jik. What about your name?

531
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:48,715
Choi Ha Roo.

532
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,020
But, is your name really Oh Jik?

533
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:03,500
This project is about wiping out the disgrace of
being at the top in the world among OECD countries,

534
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:08,235
for ten years in a row,
for our suicide rate.

535
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:14,830
Ministers of Education, Health, Family Welfare
come up with an anti-suicide campaign for this.

536
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,940
Opening up the bucket list of the 10
most influential people for teenagers,

537
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:21,815
they will show how to live properly,

538
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:26,120
setting up specific life goals
and living life to the fullest.

539
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:29,590
They will realize the fun and meaning
of life, and come to cherish it...

540
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:32,125
Stop. Turn on the lights.

541
00:53:38,899 --> 00:53:41,235
I can't understand
anything you're saying,

542
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,004
so can you say it simply
so I can understand?

543
00:53:45,505 --> 00:53:46,406
Simply?

544
00:53:48,175 --> 00:53:50,777
-I was saying it simply...
-It's because I'm pretty ignorant.

545
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:59,270
It's very simple. It's telling the
teenagers who think life is hard,

546
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,489
and want to stop living, not to do that.

547
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,659
Do whatever you can to
keep living and never die.

548
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,596
Through Sin Jun Young's bucket list,
you would say those types of words.

549
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:18,672
No matter what the world does to you,
life is worth living. Life is beautiful.

550
00:54:18,939 --> 00:54:23,610
It's like a gift that God has given you,
so have strength and be courageous...

551
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,351
You didn't tell me the
concept was this, CEO.

552
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:35,322
What do you mean I didn't tell you? I
sent all the files to Manager Jang.

553
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,892
I left it on your desk!

554
00:54:39,826 --> 00:54:44,865
For you to read it. Did
you possibly not read it?

555
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,159
Hey. He won't be making a fuss that he's
not shooting the documentary again, right?

556
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,500
-I'm dead then.
-If that happens again,

557
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:19,510
then, the plate-of-water unni, No Eul PD, saying
that she would kill me and kill herself later.

558
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,830
She's going to pull out a knife,
and it's really going to be chaos.

559
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:30,711
I'll vote thumbs up to Sin Jun Young changing his
mind and everything being turned upside down.

560
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:35,182
-Add my vote to the opinion.
-Mine also and...

561
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,610
I said pack all the equipment!
It is over anyway.

562
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,986
I'll try to convince him.

563
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,865
Ah... Let's start then.

564
00:55:56,703 --> 00:56:00,107
What's the first thing
on your bucket list?

565
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:18,725
Let's say you die after a year.

566
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:24,898
What do you think will be the
first thing you would want to do?

567
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,337
Whether you want to go
somewhere or do something.

568
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,873
Or whether you want to see someone.

569
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:39,670
Don't you have anything like that?
If I'm going to die after a year,

570
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:45,540
the only time I have is one year. Is
there anything that you want to do, or...

571
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:47,020
A year is too long.

572
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,058
Let's say there are
just three months left.

573
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,780
Okay then. Let's say you
only have three months.

574
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,932
I'm going to live recklessly and take
care of people who are bad mouthing me.

575
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,034
I'm going to kill jerks that I don't like.

576
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,907
That's not the goal of this documentary.

577
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,030
Through the bucket list, to realize
that life is that precious, and

578
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,670
-beautiful... Excuse me.
-I'll pick up girls at nightclubs.

579
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,348
And I'll sleep around
changing girls every night.

580
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,320
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
The interview is over.

581
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,087
Don't stop and keep going.

582
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,727
Does a broadcast seem like a
joke to you, Sin Jun Young?

583
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,097
I'm not joking.

584
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,634
I'm telling the truth.

585
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:40,674
-What things can I not do when I'm going to die soon?
-Don't you want to do drugs as well?

586
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:44,070
Drink while you're driving, gamble,
and use the bathroom on the streets.

587
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,946
Do you want to date me, No Eul PD?

588
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:52,886
Let's say I die after three months.

589
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,156
Just for three months.

590
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,995
Really deeply.

591
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:48,775
I can upload on SNS that I'm
dating Sin Jun Young, right?

592
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:51,650
-PD No Eul's identity was totally revealed.
-What a gold digger.

593
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:55,080
Ahjussi, can you hire me as your wife?

594
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,270
Are you perhaps her husband?

595
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,310
Am I your husband?

Is it your first time
seeing a superstar?

00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,521
I hope Noona and Hyung
will have nice courtship.

Noona, don't fall for Jun Young.
