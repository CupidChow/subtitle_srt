00:00:01,785 --> 00:00:03,880
=Episode 11=
Come here. Let's go.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,090
Let's go to your mother
and tell her to barf up

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,426
the seaweed soup she drank
after giving birth to you.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,480
Say something that make sense!

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,430
How can she barf up the seaweed
soup that she drank 30 years ago?

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,980
You punk! Did Jun Young commit
a murder or sell the country?

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,441
Why confince the sick kid and
cause this commotion?

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,113
Without Jun Young's help, you'd
still be in a cold prison cell.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,182
You ungrateful punk!

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,985
I am doing this because I am grateful!

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,110
What punk?

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,489
Do you even know where Jun
Young is trying to go now?

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,259
To the holding cell where
PD No Eul is locked up.

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,550
-Holding cell?
-That's right!

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,680
She tried to run over Assemblyman
Choi Hyeon Joon with a car, and

16
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,834
got arrested for attempted murder.

17
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,001
Mom.

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,613
These punks... what are they
doing locking up a sick kid?

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,119
Get up. Let's go to
the hospital quickly.

20
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,022
There. Let's go. Let's go.

21
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,295
I have to go to No Eul, Mom.
Please help me.

22
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,668
I must go now. Help me Mom.

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,874
Mom.

24
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,610
What did you just say? Did
you say Choi Hyeon Joon?

25
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,718
That's right!

26
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,655
Being close to the woman who
tried to kill the Assemblyman,

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,892
what will happen if the
damage spreads to Jun Young?

28
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,661
That's why I locked him up, happy?

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,803
I am saying this because I
didn't hear you clearly.

30
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,609
That... Assemblyman's name is... Choi...

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,347
Choi Hyeon Joon for sure?

32
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,285
Help me.

33
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,057
No! No, no!

34
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,460
Where are you trying to
go in this condition now?

35
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,528
Mom.

36
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,770
You stay put. For now,
I'll go buy medicine.

37
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,044
Choi Hyeon Joon...

38
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:22,152
If you had stayed with him,

39
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,224
he wouldn't have caused harm like that.

40
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:34,164
If you didn't run away
and stayed with him,

41
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,037
he wouldn't have caused
that disgusting harm.

42
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,209
It's all because of you.

43
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:53,183
It's your fault. It's because of you!

44
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:58,688
It's because of you! It's your fault!
It's your fault, all of it!

45
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,658
It's your fault.

46
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,265
What the heck is this crazy
punk talking about?

47
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,870
You are blinded by a girl and can't see
anything else! Have you gone mad?

48
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,509
Do you know how your mother raised you?

49
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,814
Do you even know what she did to prevent
you from being called a bastard?

50
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,453
Should you now be saying such
crap to the mom who raised you?

51
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,821
Oppa.

52
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,457
You punk.

53
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,963
Do you even know how badly
she is hurting inside?

54
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,733
-For someone she calls son...
-Leave us, Oppa.

55
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,250
Sin Jun Young, you punk. You may be a
star outside but not inside the home.

56
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,879
Can't you see things straight
because you are popular?

57
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,184
If you were my son, I'd
have broken your bones!

58
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,820
I told you to leave us.

59
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,656
Leave.

60
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,763
If you make your mother cry,

61
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,401
you will cry bloody tears.
Just remember that.

62
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,414
I'll go buy some medicine and be back.

63
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,617
I'll crawl to her if I have to.

64
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:44,127
If you don't help me, I'll crawl to Eul.

65
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,655
Ok!

66
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,789
Eul.

67
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,864
Jun Young.

68
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,316
Why are you coming now?

69
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,386
Do you know how long I waited for you?

70
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,093
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,797
I'm really sorry.

72
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,647
I... I didn't do it to kill him.

73
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,587
This is the truth. I didn't do
it to kill Choi Hyeon Joon.

74
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,630
I was going to forget everything and
live my life as if I were dead.

75
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,428
This is the truth.

76
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,409
I know.

77
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,014
I'm so scared, Jun Young.

78
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,582
What are you scared about?

79
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,119
I am right here.

80
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,558
-Let's go.
-Where?

81
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,233
We agreed to take a trip...
and come back after 10 years.

82
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,608
Let's go.

83
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,643
Right now?

84
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,478
That's right. Right now.

85
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,067
Let's stay here,

86
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,370
just for 100 years, and then leave.

87
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,715
Let's hide so that nobody
will know where we are,

88
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,452
and just stay for 100 years.

89
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,250
It's already cooled down.

90
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,286
I'll go and warm it up and
bring it back to you.

91
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,726
So what are you saying,

92
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:26,440
has he not eaten a single grain
of rice yesterday nor today?

93
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,665
It's not only a problem of rice, I don't
even think he's drinking any water.

94
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:33,336
What shall we do if Jun Young
just dies like that, Dad?

95
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,273
A man dying simply for a little girl?

96
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:41,130
I should go see him later with a
shovel in my hand. Tell him to wait!

97
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,814
I shall shove some rice
right into his face.

98
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:18,080
You crazy! Jerk!

99
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,098
Jik!

100
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:41,590
Why are you here, didn't you
say you have an exam today?

101
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,006
I was taking my exam
and I just came out.

102
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,677
Right, how could you take an
exam with that state of mind.

103
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,580
It's these kinds of times when
we need Oppa Hyeon Woo the most.

104
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,583
He surely knows a lot of lawyers,
because he lived in a study dorm room.

105
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,920
-Geez, where the heck did Oppa Hyeon Woo go?
-Nevermind.

106
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,227
Both Hyun Woo and Sin Jun Young can get lost.
We can take care of Noona's problem ourselves.

107
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,298
But... What do we do if our Noona cries?

108
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,937
I've never seen my Noona
cry since I grew up...

109
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,475
If I see Noona cry right now,

110
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,112
I think I will go crazy right away.

111
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,616
What should I do, Noona Na Ri?

112
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,889
I'm only letting you off
because I'm around.

113
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,424
Thank you.

114
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,290
Early this morning,
this Ajhumma came in.

115
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,972
I heard she got caught from stealing
her fraternity group money!

116
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,545
Hey you know Lee Mario, right?
She looks exactly like Lee Mario!

117
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,083
-I was totally surprised, you know?
-You're not in a situation to be laughing, girl!

118
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,921
Right. I shouldn't be
laughing right now, should I?

119
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,395
So I said "Hey, it's Lee Mario!"

120
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,532
"What brings you here?" and I
even greeted her like that.

121
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,880
-Awesome, right?
-Noona.

122
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,504
Oh, does our 'oldie' not
know who Lee Mario is?

123
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:28,544
You know, that Ahjussi who dances
like this. Don't you know?

124
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,580
-Noona.
-Na Ri, you must know him.

125
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,318
Like this, like the Ahjussi
who dances like this!

126
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,721
Eul, why are you acting this way?
This is overwhelming.

127
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,857
That's not right.

128
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,597
This is how we do the Lee Mario dance.
Like this, like so.

129
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,433
You're right. That's how it is.

130
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,160
This is how he dances.

131
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,675
Straighten up that frown of
yours, you fool. Will you?

132
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,144
It's not like I'm dying now.

133
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:06,300
When I go out, make sure to find a
good tofu chicken place for us...

134
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,987
Noona, you weren't really trying to
kill that important Assemblyman, right?

135
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,395
Of course, never. Of course not.

136
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,732
I already knew it.
That's good enough then.

137
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,404
I heard that Sin Jun Young was also there.
Then why he hasn't given a statemnet even once?

138
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,020
He should at least certify as a witness
that you weren't trying to kill him...

139
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,878
That jerk. I told you not to
even mention that guy's name.

140
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,400
Jik went to look for Sin Jun
Young to ask for some help.

141
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,253
But, he didn't even
open the door for him.

142
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,610
Don't trust that jerk, Noona.
I shall do everything.

143
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,894
I will prove you were framed and...

144
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,610
If you are a student, you
should go to school and study.

145
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,433
Noona...

146
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,503
Oh, and Jun Young
just called me a while ago.

147
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,640
He said he would come get me. Hey,
he might already be on his way.

148
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,905
Sin Jun Young.

149
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,408
Go to the parking lot.

150
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,344
Get into your car.

151
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,881
Start your car.

152
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,552
The car departs.

153
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,590
Distance remaining: 59 kilometers.

154
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,627
58 kilometers...

155
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,225
That is what you have always wanted to eat, your
mom's yukgaejang. Take a bit of it at least!

156
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,733
If you're thinking of using your starvation as
a means of blackmailing, give up this instant.

157
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,470
They told me not to let you out of this
room, even if you are dying of starvation.

158
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,472
Those are your mom's orders.

159
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,920
I thought one of them would get cut.
So I was waiting. Here, put this on.

160
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,731
Huh? Hey, if you can't
even put on a bandaid,

161
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,667
why act recklessly and cut
yourself in the first place?

162
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,204
You can't even use a knife properly.
Get your mind straight!

163
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,108
Choi Hyeon Joon...

164
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,380
Mom, if you had stayed with him...

165
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,185
he wouldn't have caused harm like that.

166
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,756
If you didn't run away
and stayed with him,

167
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,896
he wouldn't have caused
that disgusting harm.

168
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,801
Ok.

169
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,836
Ok!

170
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,073
Ok, where are you going?

171
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,387
What brings you here without a word?

172
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,058
Please release PD No Eul.

173
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,828
Do you like that woman?

174
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,432
Since when?

175
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,275
From the moment my parents manipulated
the facts and started to ruin her life.

176
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,611
That's right.

177
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:34,717
You were exceptionally
compassionate from a young age.

178
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,740
If you see a person crying on the street "Why
are you crying?" "What can I do to help?"...

179
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,291
-Father.
-But...

180
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,597
Don't you think you have too much to lose
to bet on that one moment of compassion?

181
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,000
I am not afraid.

182
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,336
Right.

183
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,474
Then... you go out and shout.

184
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,511
"When Choi Hyeon Joon was prosecutor,

185
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:08,217
he granted a favor that he couldn't refuse
and covered up an hit-and-run case."

186
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,824
"And his wife, Lee Eun Soo, joined the
effort and pulverized a woman's life."

187
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,594
"In return, the two people,

188
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,999
are getting everything they want and on the
road to success without any obstacle."

189
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,840
"Those two people are my parents!"

190
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,476
Go shout like that to people!

191
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,049
Why? Don't you think you can?

192
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,390
If you don't have the courage to shout,
then shut your mouth and be a coward.

193
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,595
Like I did before.

194
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,425
I am so upset.

195
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,728
I was going to call you.

196
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,990
At this rate, your son will really die!

197
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,368
He won't sleep, and he won't
even drink a mouthful of water!

198
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,872
He won't even eat your yukgaejang.

199
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,041
I am so upset!

200
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,214
What about him? What did he do?

201
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,089
He is such a great person. He can't
even be compared to people like us.

202
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,059
Where did you hear that trash?
Who is it?

203
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,870
Who said that nonsense!

204
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,866
Give me the name! I'll saw his mouth
on a sawing machine. Give me the name!

205
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,169
I told you to give me the name, punk!

206
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,273
I saw it.

207
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,176
What?

208
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,982
I saw it with my own eyes.

209
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,754
The person named Choi Hyeon Joon,

210
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,727
how heinous... selfish...

211
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,696
and how cruel he is.

212
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,770
Why did you love a person
who amounts only to that?

213
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,743
You saw it wrong. You
must have seen it wrong.

214
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,249
That person, while he who had no money
couldn't eat the food he wants to eat,

215
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,786
gave everything away
when he saw poor people.

216
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,556
To this mother,

217
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,080
when people looked down on me
because I was uneducated and poor,

218
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,400
he hid the fact that he was
attending an elite law school

219
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,690
and concerned about my pride acted
like he was uneducated and poor.

220
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,830
He cared for me and thought about me.

221
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,236
Eul's father...

222
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,307
died of a hit-and-run accident, Mom.

223
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,970
Why talk about that now?

224
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,612
The Prosecutor, Choi
Hyeon Joon at the time,

225
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:30,619
fabricated the culprit of
the case for his success.

226
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,323
What?

227
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,860
I thought she was okay now.

228
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,130
Because a lot of time had passed...

229
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,134
I thought she buried everything
and forgot about it.

230
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,440
But she still remembered everything.

231
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,479
I thought she is no
longer affected by it.

232
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,951
But Eul was still living in hell.

233
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,723
While the offender of the
case, Choi Hyeon Joon,

234
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:15,397
had completely forgotten what he did
and lives in heaven day after day.

235
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,668
It shouldn't be like that, Mom.

236
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,606
The world shouldn't
operate like that, right?

237
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,816
Jeong Sik was right.

238
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,388
He was right that you are crazy
over that gold digger, and

239
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,800
-you are out of your mind.
-Mom.

240
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,296
That man, among all the men I know,

241
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,068
he's coolest, handsomest and

242
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,071
and nicest person.

243
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,990
A person like you can't
even follow his heels.

244
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,446
You foolish punk. You
don't even know anything!

245
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,885
And how dare you call
him Choi Hyeon Joon?

246
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,354
-He is your father!
-That's why!

247
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,861
I almost killed Eul.

248
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,767
Thinking that disgusting
person is my father...

249
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,140
To cover up that ahjussi's dirt...

250
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,510
I almost killed Eul.

251
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,256
Is that why?

252
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,394
You dropped out of school?

253
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,867
Is that why?

254
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,405
You think you don't deserve
to be a prosecutor?

255
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,743
That you had no future from the get-go?

256
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:15,951
Yes.

257
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,825
How can I talk of someone else's
wrongdoing after what I've done?

258
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:21,683
On his way over, he caught his fans' attention,
so he was 2 hours and 30 minutes delayed.

259
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,586
The traffic lights must be broken.

260
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,157
So it must take him 1
hour and 50 minutes.

261
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,230
He ran out of gasoline,
so he had to refuel...

262
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,966
He had to change the engine oil too.

263
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,637
While he's at it, he washed his car.

264
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,514
Distance remaining, 43 km.

265
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,650
42.9 km left.

266
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,854
42.8 km left.

267
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,490
How could something like this happen?

268
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,993
I have such great hearing.

269
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,164
I heard everything you and Jun
Young said from the outside.

270
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,201
So, I'll drop you off, Ahjumma and...

271
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,673
will go back to Jun Young's house.
I decided to unlock his room.

272
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,246
With his personality, he can really
die if left alone like that.

273
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,422
Even if you go now, I
heard you can't see her.

274
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,944
I'm Sin Jun Young.

275
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,147
Is Assemblyman Choi Hyeon Joon home?

276
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,621
Is Assemblyman Choi Hyeon Joon not home?

277
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,925
Yeah, the Assemblyman is not home now.

278
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,294
Dad came in just a while ago.

279
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,050
What is it? Someone came?

280
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,610
-No.
-Oppa Sin Jun Young came, Dad.

281
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,035
It hurts, Mom.

282
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,903
You said "Oppa Sin Jun Young"?

283
00:30:22,604 --> 00:30:26,741
It's nothing. Someone got the
wrong house. You go in and study.

284
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,310
Immediately.

285
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:35,160
By any chance, are you talking about Sin Jun Young
as the celebrity Sin Jun Young, that Ha Roo likes?

286
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,551
Oh! That's right, Dad.

287
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,821
Why would Sin Jun Young come
looking for me at my house?

288
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:18,860
I am sorry. The Assemblyman can't see
every person who wants to see him.

289
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,862
I am sorry for barging in.

290
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,731
Did you have dinner?

291
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,399
Yes.

292
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:30,410
You should go in the room. Ha Roo,
you too go in your room and study.

293
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,409
I am going to have a talk with the guest,
so don't even come near my office.

294
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,012
Come this way.

295
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,563
I didn't just see a ghost, right, Mom?

296
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,170
Oppa Jun Young definitely
came to our house, right?

297
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,703
Ha Roo, would you hold me?

298
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,011
You don't look well. Were you sick?

299
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,382
Yes, I was sick.

300
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:22,123
My... But, what's the reason for
this visit when you are sick?

301
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,060
Is it because of PD No Eul?

302
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,530
Yes.

303
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,399
That's exactly what I thought.

304
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,230
But... because of the attempted murder
charge is not based on a complaint,

305
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,443
it won't go away even if
I withdraw my lawsuit.

306
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,347
Isn't that common sense even
for you to be aware of?

307
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,817
The case started with a simple driving
error that didn't require incarceration.

308
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,922
But after a week, it changed to
attempted murder and she got arrested.

309
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,860
Why did you have a change of heart?

310
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:05,133
The fact that that girl tried
to kill me, is an obvious fact.

311
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,370
Why do you think Eul tried to kill you?

312
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,672
That indeed is what I am wondering.

313
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,210
I heard that the suspect
is remaining silent.

314
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:20,215
On my behalf, will you please ask
her why did she try to kill me?

315
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,184
If she really had the
intention to kill you,

316
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,521
she would have had many chances
to do so in the past 5 years.

317
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,592
And if she really had the
intention to kill you,

318
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,863
she would not have turned the
steering wheel as she did.

319
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,066
-Look, Sin Jun Young...
-Of course, if I had been Eul...

320
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:45,907
Never, would I have turned it.
The steering wheel.

321
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,677
Yeong Deok.

322
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,452
Call... call the doctor...

323
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,857
and tell him not to close the door
because a patient is coming soon.

324
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,860
Tell him to wait for me.

325
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,208
You're a busy star, who's used
precious time to come here,

326
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,977
but I'm sorry I cannot help you.

327
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:06,400
And, once again. I'm very thankful for saving
me, even risking to get hurt because of me...

328
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,922
I regret saving you.

329
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,460
I don't have any hard feelings
toward you, Sin Jun Young.

330
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:17,999
I cannot explain how, but if I told you that
I'm feeling some kind of warmth towards you.

331
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,268
Would you believe me?

332
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:27,509
My daughter is a huge fan of yours, Sin Jun Young.
Whenever you can, will you have dinner with her...

333
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,548
What exactly is this?

334
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:40,188
Never again, I would like to
never see you again, Sir.

335
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,691
In this life, I would like today to be...

336
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,534
The last day that I see you, ever again.

337
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,499
What brings you here?

338
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,868
I came to threaten
Assemblyman Choi Hyeon Joon.

339
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:37,905
So...

340
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,377
Did you succeed at threatening him?

341
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,748
I'm not sure.

342
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,570
Secretary Lim, it's me.
About that girl No Eul...

343
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,206
No, you can't. You
cannot let that girl go.

344
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,512
If you let her go, she will
try to kill you again.

345
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,515
-Honey.
-You're Choi Hyeon Joon.

346
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,600
You cannot give in on threats given
by someone like Sin Jun Young.

347
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,487
Please, Ji Tae's father.

348
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,761
Five years ago...

349
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,332
If Eul had brought that USB key
to the broadcasting station...

350
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,836
If you hadn't stolen that
USB key away from her...

351
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,042
Hey, where are you going?

352
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,177
Hey, stop right there!

353
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:37,470
Then, if everyone had been punished for what they
had done wrong. If they had paid for their faults!

354
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,466
Eul would had been living
a different life today.

355
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,737
So that's why you don't have
any qualifications either.

356
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,876
You have no qualifications to be by her. You don't
have the qualifications to be happy too, you punk!

357
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,544
Because you're just like me!

358
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,885
Because you are Choi
Hyeon Joon's son too.

359
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,951
No Eul!

360
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:16,624
You went through a lot.

361
00:41:16,657 --> 00:41:19,861
What do you mean? I had fun
because of Ahjumma Lee Mario.

362
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,397
This girl. First, eat some of this tofu.

363
00:41:28,102 --> 00:41:31,005
From now on, don't go anywhere
near Choi Hyeon Joon.

364
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,020
Who are you waiting for?

365
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,858
Are you waiting for Sin Jun Young?

366
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,297
That jerk is not coming. If he was going to
come, he would have been here already, right?

367
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:31,999
Why is Jik not coming?

368
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,825
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

369
00:42:58,893 --> 00:42:59,493
Yes.

370
00:43:02,229 --> 00:43:03,864
-It hurts.
-What should I do?

371
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:05,866
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

372
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,070
The customer is not answering the phone.
You'll be connected to the voicemail.

373
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,270
Why is not Jik answering his phone?

374
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,561
Didn't I tell you that Sin Jun Young is
not coming? Don't wait for him anymore.

375
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,130
You still don't get it?

376
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,836
He doesn't want to get tangled up with
someone who's been to jail. So, he's avoiding you.

377
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:44,905
Let's just wait 10 minutes.

378
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:46,741
Hey!

379
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,978
This won't do. Let's go home.

380
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,914
I'll tell Jik to come directly
home so let's go quickly.

381
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,617
-Hurry, let's go.
-Alright.

382
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,456
Jik!

383
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:03,858
Jik.

384
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,727
-Noona...
-Are you hurt?

385
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,863
-What happened to you?
-It's nothing.

386
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,531
I sprained my ankle.

387
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:15,603
I'm sorry. I was distracted while
driving and didn't see the student.

388
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,739
I'm really all right, Noona.

389
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,808
Are you alright, Noona?

390
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:31,352
I'm sorry.

391
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:43,164
I said we should go to the hospital to get a complete
check up, but he insisted that he had to come here.

392
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,539
I'm really sorry.

393
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,444
Our Secretary Kim is not a person who
usually makes mistakes like these.

394
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,613
It could've been really bad.

395
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,917
If she had stepped on the
brakes 0.1 second late...

396
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:06,420
Gosh, I don't even want
to think about it.

397
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,037
Go!

398
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,042
Go!

399
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:37,885
Go!

400
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:50,231
This morning, PD No Eul was
cleared of charges and released.

401
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:59,306
Also, your alterations for the
engagement tux is at 4:30 p.m.

402
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,146
Go!

403
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:14,021
Jun Young!

404
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,226
This? What is all this?

405
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,695
You told me you didn't want
anyone to visit you at home.

406
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,698
But all this time, you were not eating anything
but drinking alcohol and playing games?

407
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:29,370
That's right, I'm sorry.
I really deserve to die.

408
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,941
If you say, "CEO, I don't
want to see you. Just die!"

409
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,277
I can just die right here.

410
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,515
But, I don't regret anything I did.
I tried to do my very best

411
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,810
in this world of yellow journalism.
I did my job keeping you unscathed.

412
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,657
What do you mean you
kept him unscathed?

413
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,630
He was on the verge of
death, but I got brave,

414
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,729
gave him CPR and revived him!

415
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,199
All he does is continuously
play video games.

416
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:04,638
Ah, that's right. Hey, I think PD No Eul was
cleared of charges and released this morning.

417
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,645
Hey, aren't you going to visit her?

418
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,781
Why would our Jun Young go there?

419
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,500
Still... he should go see her. She's the love of
his life he's been waiting for all this time.

420
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:22,289
What love of his life?
Anyone can be his love?

421
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:27,795
Five years ago if Eul had taken
that key USB to the TV station...

422
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,031
Only if you hadn't taken
away that USB from Eul...

423
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,770
Only if everyone was punished
for their wrongdoings then...

424
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,106
Only if everyone paid their dues!

425
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:45,212
Eul would be living a
different life now.

426
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:55,022
I'll kill you today...

427
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,024
-Jun Young.
-Jun Young.

428
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:15,576
So that's why you don't have
any qualifications either.

429
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,515
You have no qualifications to be by her. You don't
have the qualifications to be happy too, you punk!

430
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,617
Because you're just like me!

431
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,188
Because you are Choi Hyeon
Joon's son too anyway.

432
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,865
How dare you come here?

433
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,869
What kind of shit storm are you
going to lay on our Jun Young?

434
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,307
Our Jun Young won't play
now with you anymore.

435
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:23,844
So, get lost when I'm being nice to you.

436
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:44,231
-I don't want to.
-What?

437
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,667
I won't get lost.

438
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:49,703
Do you think I am some type of
foam, to disappear like that?

439
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,809
Jun Young didn't come to
visit you even once, did he?

440
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,160
As you know, with Jun Young's temper,

441
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:04,518
don't you think he'd come to see you if
he really missed you and longed for you?

442
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,820
Does he not have a car or legs?

443
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,992
Unless you are a fool, you should
be able to catch on the situation.

444
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,597
Jun Young told me his true feelings
to me when he was drinking last night.

445
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,033
He said he shouldn't love with loyalty.

446
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,410
You'd definitely come mooch
off of him when you get out.

447
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,274
He said he'd want to die just
thinking about seeing you again.

448
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,112
Liar.

449
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,068
It's me, Na Ri. Go Na Ri.

450
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:59,740
There is something I'm curious about.
Why didn't you visit Eul even once?

451
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,177
-Just because.
-Just because?

452
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,649
You! How could you do that to Eul? Do
you know how much she waited for you?

453
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:13,220
I am sorry Na Ri, but I can't
be on the phone very long...

454
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,456
I don't want to have a long conversation
with you either. You bad jerk!

455
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:22,096
I was going to ask you to hold
on to Eul, so she can't leave.

456
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,664
What do you mean by saying that?

457
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,834
Where is Eul going?

458
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,474
Don't cry and tell me properly.

459
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:37,444
Go Na Ri!

460
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,987
I was hoping that we'd never meet again.

461
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:04,705
Do you remember? After the trial, I told
you not to be in my sight again and

462
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,542
that I wanted to end our ill fate here.

463
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,481
But why are you still hanging
around not listening to me?

464
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,120
Did you want to test me
to see how far I'd go?

465
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,896
Your younger brother was quite
smart and extraordinary.

466
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:34,301
If he lives his full allotted life,
I think he'll become quite a man

467
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,038
and take care of his
one and only sister.

468
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,733
What brought you here
at this time of night?

469
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,319
Hey.

470
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:36,890
Congratulations on your
engagement, my daughter.

471
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:38,659
Thank you, Dad.

472
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:42,529
People say first love isn't fulfilled.

473
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,498
It's thanks to you, Dad.

474
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:47,501
I'll never forget it.

475
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:52,850
Her fiance, Choi Ji Tae, is
my daughter's first love.

476
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,408
They say this marriage is...

477
00:54:54,408 --> 00:54:57,360
a merge of political power or cozy
relationship between politics and business.

478
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,246
They are saying that
because they don't know.

479
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,890
Dad! Why would you say that?

480
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:08,055
When her friend wrote "attorney" "doctor" or
"famous pianist" as their future hope to be,

481
00:55:08,455 --> 00:55:12,392
my daughter... what did you write?

482
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,532
Choi Ji Tae's wife.

483
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:24,671
That's what I am saying.
Unlike the way she looks,

484
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,908
she is a fool only looking at
one man for almost 20-years.

485
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,979
Oh! I'm so nervous.

486
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,650
Because I'm so nervous,
I think I'll go crazy.

487
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,021
Dad, by any chance do you happen
to have any tranquilizer?

488
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:50,730
-What is it? Aren't you getting in the car?
-Aren't you really going to tell me?

489
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:53,700
Just what happened for you to run
away not telling even Na Ri?

490
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:57,003
Why? Did the loan sharks say they'd kill
you if you don't pay the money back?

491
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,473
We have no time so hurry
up and get in the car.

492
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,942
Mom and Dad are here, where are
we going leaving them behind?

493
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,830
You can't even speak a sentence of English, so how
will you live abroad? What will you eat to live?

494
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,750
-But still it's better than here.
-What?

495
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,318
Anywhere will be 1000 times
better than this freaking place!

496
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:12,986
No Eul!

497
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,490
If you are not coming with
me, then I'm going alone.

498
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,130
Noona.

499
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,441
Ahjussi, please give us a
ride to Incheon Airport.

500
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:40,981
Ah, that crazy punk!

501
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:46,019
Aigoo. What's wrong with him?

502
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,858
You are going nowhere. Get
out immediately, No Eul!

503
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,167
It doesn't work?

504
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,547
-That one is over the limit, too?
-Why ask when you already know it?

505
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,116
You don't have cash? Any cash?

506
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,930
I do. I probably do...

507
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,590
How can an attorney not even have $10?

508
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,360
Ring it up with this.

509
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,131
-Who are you?
-You are Lawyer Cha Taek Joong, right?

510
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,350
That's correct but who are you?

511
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,871
You were the prosecutor in charge of No
Jang Soo's hit-and-run case in 2006, right?

512
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:41,575
Who are you?

513
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,447
The real culprit that Prosecutor Choi
Hyeon Joon buried at the time...

514
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,118
Who is it?

515
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,361
Yeah, I got it now. The
things that I want to do

516
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,063
before I die. The bucket list.

517
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:41,410
I came to shoot "Making Seo
Yeon Woo" hope we get along.

518
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,880
-Are you ignoring me?
-Why are you here?

519
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,171
I came to film a movie.

520
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:49,040
Just bring Ji Tae before my Jeong Eun.

521
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:51,500
Let's do the engagement ceremony no matter how
late, even if it's just the two of you.

522
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:56,730
Is this why I got embarrassed in front of
people and couldn't get engaged today?

523
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,619
I can't get drunk no matter
how much I drank today.

524
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,089
I have been told that I will die soon.

525
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:05,926
If I die, the truth
will be buried forever.

526
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,228
Just tell me who the real culprit is.

527
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,998
If you are going to shoot a third rate drama like
that, then go to the studio. You crazy punk.

528
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:16,469
If I date you, Ahjussi, that
could be my ultimate revenge.

529
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:20,080
Then let's date, Ahjussi.
