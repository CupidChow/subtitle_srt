00:00:02,113 --> 00:00:05,341
=Episode 3=

2
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:51,734
No Eul! No Eul!

3
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,930
Who are you?

4
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,025
You can't tell who I am? I'm
Sin Jun Young's manager.

5
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:58,700
Why am I here?

6
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,805
That's what I want to ask you.

7
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,842
I was in the middle of a blind
date but Jun Young called me and

8
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,570
told me to come to this
hospital immediately.

9
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,015
He said he'd fire me if I don't come here, and
when I came you were laying here like this.

10
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,185
Where's Sin Jun Young?

11
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:21,424
-Happy Birthday!
-Thank you.

12
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,160
Oh! You came?

13
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,010
If he wants to wish me a happy
birthday, tell him to come in person.

14
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,546
And buy the flowers himself.

15
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,710
You know that Jun Young doesn't
come to these kinds of places.

16
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,485
Oh! It's Sin Jun Young!

17
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,256
Awesome!

18
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,827
Jun Young!

19
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,910
Sorry I'm late. Happy Birthday.

20
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,476
If you're sorry, sing me
a happy birthday song.

21
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,546
I want to hear a birthday
song from Sin Jun Young.

22
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,661
If Na Ri dies, I will kill you with
my own hands too.

23
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,599
This country is in trouble because jerks
like you are trying to become prosecutors!

24
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,190
I know you are annoyed and dumbfounded
thinking I am a leech-like person.

25
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,105
But I am desperate.
I have to make a living.

26
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,445
Did you change your mind?
That's why you came back, right?

27
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,780
Don't you know me?

28
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,015
Don't you know me?

29
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,651
I do.

30
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:03,953
You jerk.

31
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,026
Thanks for this. I'll use it well.

32
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,875
What is wrong? What's happening?

33
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,356
Jun Young!

34
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,510
What's wrong? Why are you being
like this all of a sudden?

35
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,327
Sorry. I'll buy you dinner another time.

36
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,062
Let's go together.

37
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,701
I want to be alone with you today.

38
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,136
Let's go together.

39
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,342
I did nothing to you so I have
no responsibility for you.

40
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,030
-Did I confuse you?
-Jun Young.

41
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,049
Don't overreact. Kim Yoo Na,

42
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,688
to me you're just a fellow celebrity from the
same agency. You're no more nor less than that.

43
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,491
Why did you come to my
birthday party then?

44
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,398
Because my head feels like exploding
because of this one witch.

45
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,101
I thought that if I came here,
I wouldn't think about her but.

46
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,538
I thought wrong.

47
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:34,110
Hey. Oh my God!

48
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,970
You can't leave like this not
getting the proper treatment.

49
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,130
It's okay, I'm all better now.

50
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,216
What do you mean you are all better?

51
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,621
You leave like this now and you'll
sue Jun Young later, right?

52
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,457
What do you take me for?

53
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,726
Not Ahjusshi but Oppa!

54
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:56,699
Don't write stories about Sin Jun Young on the
social media networks and cause problems later.

55
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,868
Let's settle with this.

56
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,703
You like this, right?

57
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,340
Right, you also got fired from your
previous job after accepting bribes.

58
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,060
Why are you counting this in front
of everyone? Don't do it here.

59
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,250
This isn't a bribe. You are giving
me this money for a settlement.

60
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,288
You are not even that old.

61
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,957
So how can you be so openly brazen?

62
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,026
It's $950.

63
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,130
You took $50, right? He
filled it up with $1000.

64
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,100
No. What do you take me for?

65
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,069
That's not true.

66
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,438
I'm telling you that's not true.

67
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,210
By any chance, have you
heard "Brazen Face?"

68
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,046
Of course I've heard of it before.
It's my nickname.

69
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,817
Then have you measured your face
skin to see how thick it is?

70
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,310
You did take all the money
and you even ask for a ride.

71
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,091
This is hard to do with a normal face.

72
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,930
That's my cola!

73
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,897
What kind of woman, without
asking for permission

74
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,420
by saying "Is it okay for me to
drink this?" just drinks like that?

75
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,704
You were going to throw it away anyway. The
carbonation is gone and it tastes bad.

76
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,140
I'm not going to throw it away!
I'm going to drink it all later!

77
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,043
Buy me a new one or spit it out.

78
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,683
Wow... You're really something.

79
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,354
I lost. Unni, you win.

80
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,870
What are you doing? Why are you
taking someone else's stuff?

81
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,904
Hey!

82
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:43,600
Then pay off the debt quickly.

83
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,280
I am paying you. Are
you trying to kill me?

84
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,190
Just when will you pay it off making the
payment amounts the size of ant's poop?

85
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,813
We will probably die waiting for
you to come and pay us back.

86
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,618
Take this and give me the computer.

87
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,720
Without that my Jik...

88
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,460
We took out your security deposit
from your place just now.

89
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,980
-On whose order?
-Mine.

90
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,150
Then... What about us? Where
will my brother and I live?

91
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,550
Why are you asking me?

92
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,774
What kind of crap is this?! What
kind of crap is this suddenly?

93
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,311
So why did you borrow someone else's money?
Next time, it's not going to end like this.

94
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,960
I won't end it like this the next time. I'll
bring your waver for your body you wrote.

95
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,215
Fine. Bring it.

96
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,451
Why don't you kill me instead?

97
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,122
Who are you? Do you know her?

98
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,259
No, I saw her for the first time today.

99
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,228
Right? I'm going to go now.

100
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,730
I'm going.

101
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,880
What kind of mom ignores her son
who is sleeping on the street?

102
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,070
Son, my ass.

103
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,374
Our son died five years ago.

104
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,450
Mom.

105
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,611
I told you, our son died 5 years ago.

106
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,180
Mom? Who's your mom?

107
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,450
Play with me, mom.

108
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,492
I said play with me.

109
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,394
Ahjussi.

110
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,680
Are you ill somewhere?

111
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,131
Yes, I'm ill.

112
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,366
So play with me.

113
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,805
Mom.

114
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,670
Gook Yeong, where are you right now?

115
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,781
Come immediately and take away this crazy
person from the front of our house.

116
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,785
Come see for yourself what
kind of crazy person it is!

117
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,607
Crazy guy.

118
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,740
What did you go to your mom's house for? Did
you think she would welcome you saying,

119
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,282
"Oh my, is my son here?" and
greet you preciously?

120
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,385
I just thought if I saw my mom,
I wouldn't have other thoughts.

121
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,654
Other thoughts?

122
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,993
Of the people I know, my mom's the
one who confuses me the most.

123
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,390
So, in order to distract yourself,

124
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,066
you went and upset your mom?

125
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,810
Uh? Hey, that plate of water
Unni backwashed on that earlier.

126
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,880
Wow, you swallowed it?

127
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,790
Sin Jun Young has a strong stomach.

128
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,216
-Should I puke in the car then?
-Nonsense.

129
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:53,256
But that plate of water Unni's
life is quite miserable.

130
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,670
I'm going to sleep so
just be quiet and drive.

131
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:01,350
At first, I thought that
unni was despicable too.

132
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,180
But after seeing her lifestyle, I
was really able to understand her.

133
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,602
Why she couldn't help but
live an obnoxious life.

134
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,800
Some loan sharks came to threaten
her somehow a while ago.

135
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,341
They even took all of her house deposit.

136
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,545
Young-ah...

137
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,781
Can't you just close your eyes
and film the documentary?

138
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,610
It's not like your valuable face is
going to wear off just by filming it.

139
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,988
Just consider it as
saving someone's life and.

140
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,530
I think I saw that unni go towards the
bridges near the Han River earlier.

141
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,903
What if she fell off and died already? Try
searching for internet articles about it.

142
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,340
I told you I was going to sleep.

143
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,776
I told you to be quiet!

144
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,550
-Get off.
-All right, I'll close my mouth and be quiet.

145
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,626
Get off!

146
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,933
Is this car your car?
It's my car, remember?

147
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,908
You seriously don't have
even an ounce of humanity.

148
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,311
You're bound to have
bad luck in your life.

149
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,149
Hey, my wallet! I don't have my wallet!

150
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,784
Give me my wallet!

151
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,420
Oh! Hyung, it's me.

152
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,957
Let's have a drink together.

153
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,527
Where are you right now?

154
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,963
OK.

155
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,367
I can be there in 10 minutes.

156
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,403
All right, see you in a bit.

157
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,946
At first, I thought that
unni was despicable too.

158
00:14:57,213 --> 00:15:00,216
But after seeing her lifestyle, I
was really able to understand her.

159
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,252
Why she couldn't help but
live an obnoxious life.

160
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:07,290
Some loan sharks came to threaten
her somehow a while ago.

161
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,226
They even took all of her house deposit.

162
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,501
I think I saw that unni go towards the
bridges near the Han River earlier.

163
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,704
What do we do if she
already fell off and died?

164
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,440
Try looking on the Internet for news.

165
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,780
Are you crazy?

166
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,832
No Eul, are you crazy?

167
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,610
Wow, it's Sin Jun Young!
Oppa, I'm a huge fan!

168
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,909
Oppa! Please take just
one photo with me!

169
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:50,760
Han River bridge, my ass.

170
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,759
I love you, customer!

171
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,197
Noona?

172
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,438
Did you eat yet?

173
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,040
I'm eating right now.

174
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,976
What's on the menu?

175
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,411
Meat.

176
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,448
Don't lie to me.

177
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,251
You're eating a piece of
bread again, aren't you?

178
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,590
Stamina is so important for an 11th
grader. Why aren't you eating rice?

179
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,680
I heard the other kids even eat
ginseng and oriental medicine.

180
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,098
You need to at least
eat rice to survive.

181
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,101
Ah you nagging ahjumma,
you're starting again.

182
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,704
I'm seriously eating meat right now.

183
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,472
Show me proof then.

184
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,849
Look here, look here.

185
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:56,852
He's totally rejecting my video call.

186
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,222
This guy, for real...

187
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,650
I'm seriously eating meat right now.

188
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,194
Oh, ahjussi.

189
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,431
Speak for yourself. Are you eating well?

190
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,680
Are you happy now?

191
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,910
Since he's paying anyway, you should have
asked him to buy beef instead of pork.

192
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,145
Did we leave the meat-buying to Hyung?
Have some shame.

193
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,190
Hyung already doesn't
have a lot of money.

194
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,317
Hey, I have enough to buy you guys food.

195
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,388
Eul, I'll be responsible for Jik's food,

196
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,590
so don't starve yourself.

197
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,025
Thank you, Ahjussi!

198
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,529
Even though our Jik tells you it's OK,
you shouldn't buy him just one portion.

199
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,120
Our Jik is a meat lover, so since you are
buying it for him, can you be generous and...

200
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,302
Are you a beggar?

201
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,780
-Jik.
-Even the ticks have faces,

202
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:54,170
no matter how poor we are, let's please at least
keep a small amount of pride and dignity?

203
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,711
Aren't you even embarrassed?

204
00:19:58,814 --> 00:19:59,880
Why are you like this?

205
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:05,821
It may be hard to believe but my
noona wasn't like this in the past.

206
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:13,095
She had strong pride before... and
she was quite cool and awesome.

207
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:21,237
Eul is still cool and awesome enough...
and pretty.

208
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,739
Even as a woman?

209
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,800
Yeah, as a woman too.

210
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,777
Is my noona really pretty?

211
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,915
That's right! She's pretty!

212
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,951
Aunt, one more serving here!

213
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:42,157
Then I'll forget about my manners and
order two more servings, Brother-in-law.

214
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,543
2011.

215
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,012
How much of a bad girl you've been,
that you are this surprised?

216
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,549
Candidate number 2.

217
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:49,258
Hypocrite, heinous person,
devil wearing an angel's mask.

218
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,087
Did the candidate ask you supporters to do this?

219
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:03,172
I'll remove that repulsive
mask for you. Die you bad jerk.

220
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,167
Did you eat?

221
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,504
I didn't eat yet.

222
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,358
It's been four years since we last met,
right? When did you come to Seoul?

223
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,971
I got into pre-law on the second try. And I even
passed my first level of bar-exam two days ago.

224
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,378
That's because you didn't seduce me.
I had nothing to do but to study.

225
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,481
If I become a prosecutor,
it's all because of you.

226
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,356
Where are you going?

227
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,358
To the bathroom.

228
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,920
Is the bathroom that way? Where is
a criminal going to run away to?

229
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,127
Give me your ID.

230
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,740
Why do you want my ID?

231
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,566
Who know you might bolt again?
You have priors.

232
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,970
Why are you going through
someone else's bag?

233
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,073
It's right here.

234
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,310
No Eul.

235
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,113
That is mine! Give it back!
You are a crook!

236
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:28,650
-Oh my.
-Aren't you gonna give it?

237
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,359
No Eul. The picture came out nice.

238
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,660
Hello? This is the
police station, right?

239
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,167
Public Official Election
Act Article 240 Section 1.

240
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,870
For a person who destroys the wall
posters without justifiable reasons,

241
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,306
you either receive a 2 year sentence in prison
or a fine of $4,000 for defacing property.

242
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,778
Tell the person on the other line that you
think you violated that election law.

243
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,450
There's a witness here too.
Should I say it?

244
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,257
Hello? Yes, my name is Sin Jun Young.

245
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,292
Yes I'd like to make a report.

246
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,169
So what do you want me to do?

247
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,242
So what do you want me to do?

248
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,980
I'll turn a blind eye to your crime so

249
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,184
go out with me.

250
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,920
Why aren't you going in? Didn't you say
that you were going to turn yourself in?

251
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,326
Didn't you say that you'd rather eat
rice with beans than be my girlfriend?

252
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,096
What's wrong?

253
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,900
Nothing. You can go ahead
without worrying about us.

254
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,582
You are not asking to date me for real.

255
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,354
But you are asking for me to
pretend we are dating, right?

256
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:54,429
So just for a week to get rid of the
girls following you around, right?

257
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,833
Forget it. I'm totally upset.
You just go to prison.

258
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,277
How can love change?

259
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,480
I'm going to crazy.

260
00:27:11,747 --> 00:27:14,282
I've never loved you so
how can love change?

261
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,319
You watched a movie with
me and ate with me.

262
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:20,320
I only watched a movie with you and ate with you
together because you said you'd lend me money.

263
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,623
That's why I did it.

264
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:26,895
-What?
-Honestly, do you think we look good together?

265
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:33,869
Yeah. I think we do. Totally.

266
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,507
Really? You've never dated
a guy before, right?

267
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,943
I have. I also dated a guy that
looked like Jo In Sung once.

268
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,950
I also, have dated Sin
Jun Young back then!

269
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,140
-No, don't say nonsense.
-It's not nonsense!

270
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,360
-You keep on saying nonsense!
-It's not nonsense.

271
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,160
That's the problem. Do you think I'm stupid?
Why do you keep on saying nonsense to me?

272
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,357
It's not nonsense.

273
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,628
Jun Young!

274
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,703
We used to go out in the past.
It was very heated.

275
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,110
What a waste.

276
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,819
If I knew you were going to become this
glamorous, I wouldn't have let you go.

277
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:35,330
People say that I grew
up as the ugliest icon.

278
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:37,499
Do you think that's true?

279
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,437
I'm not sure. I think so.

280
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:50,178
I also have the sex-appeal,
don't you think so?

281
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,183
I guess...

282
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:02,457
Earlier that guy, because you said we dated, he
seemed like he suddenly had interest in me? Right?

283
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,658
Right?

284
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,931
When did Eul come to Seoul?

285
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,233
You met Eul?

286
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:14,136
Yeah, when she was doing her part-time
job or something like that.

287
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,972
Eul... isn't picky.

288
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,275
If it's related to money,
she will do anything.

289
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,645
What about college?

290
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,047
How can she go to college?

291
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,552
It's hard for her to even eat and live, while making
it possible for her younger brother to study.

292
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,380
Why? You're going to mess
with pitiful Eul again?

293
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,764
Like you did in high school? Don't do it.

294
00:29:44,057 --> 00:29:48,635
Her life is already struggling.

295
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:52,623
She is trying so hard to hide herself.

296
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,709
So you and I should leave her alone.

297
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,512
Don't bother her, okay?

298
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,956
My dearly beloved Fellow Citizens!

299
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:46,460
Candidate Choi Hyeon Joon
is the most trustworthy.

300
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:51,299
He's righteous, honest
and a person of dignity!

301
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:57,105
And as you all may already know,

302
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:02,844
he even donated his kidneys
to his beloved sick wife.

303
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:08,016
He is the most devoted husband
and father of this world!

304
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:11,853
Candidate Choi Hyeon Joon.

305
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:19,090
They say if you see one, you
can know ten things from it.

306
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,765
Candidate Choi Hyeon Joon.

307
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,777
Choi Hyeon Joon! Choi Hyeon Joon!
Choi Hyeon Joon!!

308
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,245
Are you okay?

309
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:39,381
Yes, I'm fine.

310
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:42,150
It doesn't look like you're okay.

311
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,950
I'll go buy medicine,
so stay right here.

312
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,250
No, it's fine. I'm really okay.

313
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,170
That's why you should have
looked where you were going.

314
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,123
Ha Roo!

315
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,358
Sorry for frightening you, kid.

316
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,228
Will you really be all right?

317
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,072
You're partially at fault too. You
should have been more careful.

318
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,441
He's insanely attractive.

319
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,145
Oppa, I want to marry that person.

320
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,616
Ji Tae!

321
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,285
Long time no see.

322
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,587
It's Jeong Eun unni.

323
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,256
You are Ha Roo, right?

324
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,859
You've grown into a woman in
the time I haven't seen you.

325
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,628
You came in from New York, right?

326
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,597
I came from the US yesterday to
help with your father's election.

327
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,934
My dad told me it's important to
look good in these situations.

328
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:41,010
Choi Hyeon Joon! Choi Hyeon Joon!
Choi Hyeon Joon!

329
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,711
When are you going to propose to me?

330
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,880
I think our parents have been
talking about our engagement.

331
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,783
Awesome!

332
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,353
Oppa, are you getting
married to Unni Jeong Eun?

333
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,560
It seems that the victim's daughter
remembers Jeong Eun's license plate number.

334
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:05,867
So, you're going to finish our Jeong
Eun's life by this hit-and-run accident?

335
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,130
There are 3 witnesses.

336
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,940
That's why I came in the middle of
the night like a madman to find you.

337
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:18,446
If I crumble, there's no
benefit for you either.

338
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,220
Your company would have disappeared
without a trace if it were not for me.

339
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,689
I am aware.

340
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,990
That's why my wife and
I are always thankful.

341
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,695
I have no use for the
mere notion of thanks.

342
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:40,802
The reason why humans are better than animals
is because they know how to repay favors.

343
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,706
Isn't that true?

344
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,610
Please reveal the true culprit.

345
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,460
It's candidate number two, Jo Moon Sung!

346
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,885
It's candidate number two.

347
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,121
We'll work hard. Vote for
candidate number two.

348
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,690
We'll work hard. Vote for
candidate number two.

349
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,761
Vote for candidate number two!

350
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,366
I'm fine. I'm going to vote for
candidate number 1, Choi Hyeon Joon.

351
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,775
We'll work hard. Vote for
candidate number two.

352
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,714
We will create a nation you can trust.

353
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,683
Vote for candidate number one.

354
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,319
Please trust us and vote.

355
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,140
Hello, vote for number 2.

356
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,193
Are you looking at me right now?

357
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,728
Why?

358
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,667
What is it...

359
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,043
Your eyelash fell.

360
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,818
And don't work too hard because
candidate number one is a bad person.

361
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,620
Excuse me...

362
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:14,667
Tell me what the problem is.

363
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:18,668
Tell me what you don't like about
me and I'll fix all of it.

364
00:36:18,668 --> 00:36:20,268
Tell me!

365
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,534
Your eyes, nose, lips, ears,

366
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:32,001
voice, height, personality,
and blood type.

367
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:34,467
All right, I'll fix it.

368
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:37,635
If I fix all of it, we can date, right?

369
00:36:37,635 --> 00:36:40,535
I already have a girlfriend.
Her personality is no joke.

370
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:44,033
She will probably kill you
by getting you buried alive.

371
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:46,335
What do you mean you have a girlfriend?

372
00:36:46,335 --> 00:36:48,334
I'm Sin Jun Young's girlfriend.

373
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:56,767
Is our honey all done with class?

374
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:09,668
Our handsome honey!

375
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:17,434
I've only been apart from you for 12 hours, but I
missed you so much I thought I was going to go crazy.

376
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:26,702
For me, it was that times a hundred.

377
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:37,702
I also, did miss you so much!
Didn't you know that?

378
00:37:44,534 --> 00:37:45,468
Your eyes.

379
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,167
Your nose.

380
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:51,734
Your mouth.

381
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:55,168
Your ears.

382
00:37:55,334 --> 00:37:57,401
How is our honey so perfect.

383
00:37:57,767 --> 00:38:00,401
Even if I want to fix something
for you, there's nothing to fix.

384
00:38:01,968 --> 00:38:03,335
Hey!

385
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:17,768
Hey! You better be careful.

386
00:38:18,734 --> 00:38:20,034
Sin Jun Young is mine.

387
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,967
I dare you to bother my boyfriend again.

388
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,367
You'll be dead if that happens.

389
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:28,467
Wash!

390
00:38:30,234 --> 00:38:31,401
Watch!

391
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:35,835
Crazy girl.

392
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,134
Crazy girl.

393
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:46,934
Who?

394
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,178
Me, me, me! I'm the crazy girl.

395
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,750
What am I doing right now being
involved with a psycho like you?

396
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,851
Why am I the psycho here?
Look at yourself.

397
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,890
I think what I did is enough.
I'm going home.

398
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,027
I couldn't sleep because I was studying for
exams. Be my pillow for just ten minutes.

399
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,410
No thanks.

400
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,964
Of the remaining 9 times,
I'll count this as two.

401
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,968
While you're at it, one more.

402
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,571
Decrease it by three then.

403
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,872
Deal!

404
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:26,350
Since I did well today, one more.
Decrease it by four.

405
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,382
Do you want to die?

406
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:21,068
Time is over. Hey, Sin Jun Young!

407
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,479
Did ten minutes pass?

408
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,387
Why are you laughing?

409
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:14,956
Hey.

410
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,202
I suddenly wanted to give Na Ri a call.

411
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:07,141
Na Ri, I don't think I can keep
the promise I made with you.

412
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,913
I'm going to continue to
joke around with Eul.

413
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,317
I'm going to tease Eul, and
I'm going to pester her.

414
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,289
At least like that, I have
to continue seeing her.

415
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,425
I'm sorry, Na Ri.

416
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:45,179
Choi Hyeon Joon!

417
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,090
Please go inside!

418
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,017
Yeah. Go inside, go inside.

419
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,640
Come in, come in.

420
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,255
Come in.

421
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,670
Because everyone helped, the Election Campaign
has come to an end successfully today.

422
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,030
You all have worked hard.
Eat all you want,

423
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,837
stretch your legs, and
sleep deeply tonight.

424
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,373
Thank you so much.

425
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,576
Also,

426
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,881
he knew I loved 'yook gye jang' and
introduced me to a wonderful place...

427
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:27,920
Where is he? Oh, I sincerely
thank Jang Jeong Ja.

428
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:33,995
The braised pork belly and stew are
good here so please eat a lot!

429
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,529
Choi Hyeon Joon!

430
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,420
Choi Hyeon Joon!

431
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,920
Choi Hyeon Joon!

432
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:09,930
Mom!

433
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,234
What are you doing here?

434
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:20,107
My stomach was bothering me.

435
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,910
If your stomach hurts, you should go
to the hospital. Why are you here?

436
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:24,779
Be quiet.

437
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:31,152
If I sit here like this,
it will get better.

438
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,992
Let's go to the hospital, Mom.
Get on my back.

439
00:44:38,526 --> 00:44:40,420
Hospital? I'm telling you, it will
get better if I sit like this.

440
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,997
Are you a doctor? I said
let's go to the hospital!

441
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,273
What are you doing? You have to go
inside and make 'yook gye jang'.

442
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,874
Follow.

443
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:56,310
Come here, come here.

444
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,117
Oh my, are you in your right mind?

445
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,560
Even if Choi Hyeon Joon himself said he
wanted to come, you should have said,

446
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:09,000
"This is not where you belong to. Just go back."
But what's your intention in dragging him here?

447
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:12,293
I did it on purpose, why? I wanted
Ok and Joon to meet each other.

448
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:17,330
Joon has grown up so well. Isn't
it time he meets his father?

449
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,203
Why are you deciding if it's time
or not? Why are you meddling?

450
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,738
Don't you care how much Ok is surprised?

451
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,275
If Ok happens to get a heart disease because
of this, I will break every bone of yours.

452
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:32,947
What do you mean? Do you mean you cherish
her more than your own twin sister?

453
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,850
If you cherish her that much,

454
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,070
"Ok, forget about Choi Hyeon Joon,"

455
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,354
"move in with me, girl." Why shouldn't
you have said so like a real man?

456
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:44,820
Oh my, this leper girl! I'm going
to throw you out right here!

457
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,995
What expression are you choosing to
put my precious Ok? Don't you dare!

458
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:52,166
Your Precious Young Ok? Your Ok?

459
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:54,301
What?

460
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,977
Student! Wait a moment.

461
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,680
I think we've met.

462
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,649
Yes, I think so too.

463
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,922
-Who...
-My mom is a little ill.

464
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,725
Oh dear, you should be on your way.

465
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,520
By the way, I have a car,
so if you need it...

466
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,132
It's all right. We're fine.

467
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,620
Who is he?

468
00:46:30,604 --> 00:46:32,907
He's a friend I've slightly
inconvenienced before.

469
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,443
When he passes the bar exam successfully,
he said he would come to visit me.

470
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,180
It seems it isn't easy.

471
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,586
Lift your head, Mom.

472
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:53,227
Choi Hyeon Joon isn't watching,
so you can lift your head.

473
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:57,998
In the past,

474
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,636
I've gone to meet Choi Hyeon Joon.

475
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,440
When I passed the bar exam,

476
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,976
acceptance in hand,

477
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,112
I was going to go find him again.

478
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:19,520
Before you die, I'll make sure
to go find him and let you brag.

479
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:24,825
I...

480
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:28,762
even without you,

481
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,434
I raised your son well
to be just like you.

482
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,372
I'll let you brag all you want.

483
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,647
When I'm born into the next life, and...

484
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:53,220
If something like this happens
again, don't run away again.

485
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,959
Where do you think any academic and
status differences are in love?

486
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,631
So out of fashion and
old and out of date!

487
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,302
What is this?

488
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:46,240
Choi Hyeon Joon's real self.

489
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,008
How did you film this?

490
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,546
I coincidentally saw it while
working part-time as a driver.

491
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,883
I heard Choi Hyeon Joon was hooked
by that hostess bar madame,

492
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,485
so I recorded it with my camera.

493
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,058
So, what are you going to do with this?

494
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,996
Choi Hyeon Joon is not someone you can go up
against. You'll end up being the one to get hurt.

495
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,401
Even so, I am my dad's
daughter after all.

496
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:18,038
I should do at least something.

497
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:22,643
If I run away because I'm scared, who
will relieve my dad's resentment?

498
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,520
The person you are trying to
reach is currently unavailable.

499
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,591
No Eul...

500
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,928
I'll decrease it by two, so
hurry and come here right now.

501
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:45,032
It's because my mood is absolute
crap right now. So, play with me.

502
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,650
The person you are trying to
reach is currently unavailable.

503
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,450
Please leave your message after the beep.

504
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,553
What is she doing, really?

505
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,403
Hello, this is Choi Hyeon Joon.

506
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,939
This is No Eul.

507
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,341
I'm not sure if you remember but...

508
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:39,146
I'm the daughter of No Jang Soo, who died
in a hit and run accident five years ago.

509
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,683
Ah, who did you say you are?

510
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,487
I'm sorry, but I can't remember.

511
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,289
You can't remember?

512
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,730
I'm really sorry. I'm hanging up now.

513
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:57,340
On April 10th and May 5th of 2009. On March
4th, April 10th and May 15th of 2010.

514
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,766
You might not remember
because you're dumb.

515
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,670
These are the dates that Prosecutor Choi Hyeon
Joon went to the hostess bar to meet Madame Song.

516
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:14,414
Even you did go there one week after
your wife's heart transplant operation?

517
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,919
The world's best innocent
man, yeah right.

518
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,624
Stop committing fraud to innocent
citizens and drop out from the election.

519
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:29,229
If an evil person like you becomes a
politician, this nation will be hopeless.

520
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:34,500
If you beg for forgiveness now
and admit to your wrongdoings,

521
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,003
I will stop everything here.

522
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:43,210
If you find the culprit associated with
my father's case that you manipulated,

523
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,879
I'll burn all the files I have.

524
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,184
Please do whatever you want.

525
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:56,356
I don't know who you demanded this from,
but these threats don't bother me.

526
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,529
-Who was it?
-It wasn't anything important.

527
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,301
They think it seems unfavorable, so the opponent
sides are trying desperately in last minute.

528
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:39,766
Hello? I have a favor to ask KBC.

529
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,480
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

530
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,020
Hey! Aren't you gonna stop? Hey!

531
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,423
Hey! Stop right now!

532
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,730
Noona! No!

533
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:51,990
-Noona! Don't die! No!
-Calm down.  She won't die.

534
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:13,186
When I was younger, my mom
used to take me to the church

535
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:18,058
and made over 100 wishes to God.

536
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:25,470
She also told me to pray for my wishes
because God will make them come true.

537
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,666
Her blood pressure is dropping.

538
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,271
I said where is God in this
world, and refused to wish.

539
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,287
I did wrong.

540
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,158
I will believe that you do exist.

541
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:57,764
So please let Eul live.

542
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,775
If you let Eul live,

543
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,348
I will give up all the
happiness allotted to me.

544
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,719
She is in arrest. Get ready to do CPR.

545
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,423
If you let Eul live,

546
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:30,530
I would be willing to sacrifice
the remaining time of my life.

547
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,734
Please take me with you.

548
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,071
But Eul,

549
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,342
please let her live.

550
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,517
Is life nothing?

551
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,119
Killing yourself is that easy?

552
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,426
Let's do the documentary.

553
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,395
I'm saying now I can just
do it, you crazy idiot!

554
00:58:03,096 --> 00:58:03,964
Yes,

555
00:58:04,431 --> 00:58:05,960
let's do this, Eul...

556
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:07,960
Seeing you again,

557
00:58:08,301 --> 00:58:10,770
will hurt me.

558
00:58:10,937 --> 00:58:13,640
More than opening up my wounds again.

559
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,042
And stabbing it with a knife...

560
00:58:16,676 --> 00:58:18,311
but let's see what happens to us.

561
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,050
I am afraid you've made
a wrong diagnosis.

562
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:50,110
She wants to look good for you.
She's making so much effort.

563
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,380
About filming the documentary,
let's just say I never said that.

564
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,948
Let's skip the engagement,
and get married, Jeong Eun.

565
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,783
Is fainting your concept?

566
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,600
-What do you want?
-100 million won.

567
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,700
Then how many days do
I have left to live?

568
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,923
6 months? or 3 months?
