1
00:00:01,892 --> 00:00:06,088
=Episode 7=

2
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,097
I came all this way to take
you to the island over there.

3
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,540
But I'll go by myself.

4
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,480
If I take you along, I feel like I will
want to hide you away on the island

5
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,317
and not let you go to anyone else.

6
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,656
So don't ever appear
in front of my eyes.

7
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,761
If I see you again,

8
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,768
I will just kidnap you.

9
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,812
Are you sleeping right now?

10
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,085
After worrying a person so
much, how can you sleep?

11
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,209
Are you shooting a film?

12
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,246
As if I wouldn't know that
you're an actor of some kind.

13
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:48,818
I must be crazy.

14
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,923
What kind of crazy things
have I done because of you?

15
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,570
I spent so much on taxi ride to get here. I couldn't
sleep in the cold, shivering and waiting for boat.

16
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,332
I got my hand bitten by a seagull too.
Ah! My money.

17
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,169
I could have fed my Jik so
much meat with that money.

18
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,375
One.

19
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:29,693
Do you think this is all
a dream, by any chance?

20
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,899
It's not a dream. It's me, No Eul. I
came all the way here to see you.

21
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,372
-Two.
-Wow.

22
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,877
You really think you're dreaming, don't
you? I'm telling you, I'm really Eul.

23
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,480
Three.

24
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,886
You have to get pinched
in order to wake up.

25
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,029
Go.

26
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,698
-What?
-I said go.

27
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,769
-What?
-Get out of my sight.

28
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,979
What do I do?

29
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,750
I must have caused a big accident.

30
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,854
What did I do exactly that's worse?

31
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,458
If I ever drink again I'm no better than

32
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,361
a dog. A dog. Seriously.

33
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,820
Have some. You didn't
eat breakfast, right?

34
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,673
-Ouch.
-Sorry.

35
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:30,980
Did I not tell you? That I
become a dog when I drink.

36
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,353
What's even more amazing is that I don't even
remember a second of what I've done while drunk.

37
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,123
Four.

38
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,493
I don't know what I did while drunk,

39
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,331
but in order to apologize or not, I
have to be able to remember first.

40
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,169
I really want to apologize,

41
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:01,010
but I can't remember a second of it.
Darn it.

42
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:03,380
Five.

43
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:23,299
Ahjussi.

44
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,173
Why aren't you picking up the phone?
Where are you?

45
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:37,680
Something urgent came up, so I
couldn't even say bye. I am sorry.

46
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,162
Are you with Sin Jun Young?

47
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,063
No.

48
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,402
Yes...

49
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:18,221
I've done something wrong to Sin Jun Young.
I'm sorry Ahjussi, I'll call you again later.

50
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,905
Going up.

51
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,709
The doors will close.

52
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,413
Director. This.

53
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,348
What is this?

54
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,580
I think Director Yoon
Jeong Eun saw that photo.

55
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,991
You said that you had
stopped the reporters.

56
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,326
I'm sorry.

57
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,997
By the way, did you go to Sin
Jun Young's concert last night?

58
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,134
I think she has started looking
into who PD No Eul is.

59
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,127
Why don't I remember anything?

60
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,936
I can't even remember the tiniest bit.

61
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,781
Six.

62
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,768
Aren't you hungry? I'll buy you food.

63
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,271
Let's go eat something.

64
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,585
Okay fine! I drank and had a
bit of drunken fit! So what?

65
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:34,657
What's wrong with that? My dad
said that the worst type of person

66
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:37,293
is someone who makes a big deal out of
someone having acted out while drunk.

67
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,597
He told me not to even
talk to those people.

68
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,433
Seven.

69
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,340
Do you want to hit me?

70
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:54,744
Hit me, then.

71
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:57,447
Hit me until you relieve
all of your anger.

72
00:09:58,548 --> 00:09:59,182
Here.

73
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,417
Eight.

74
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:37,954
Wow, you really hold grudges.

75
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:41,791
What kind of a man is so petty?

76
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,895
Who's the one who made me
get drunk and act out?

77
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,097
Who is the one who caused all of this?

78
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,600
Isn't the person who should
apologize actually you?

79
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,635
Get off.

80
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,337
I don't want to.

81
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,374
Nine.

82
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,316
Taxi!

83
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,554
I seriously don't remember.

84
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,724
I don't remember what I did
to make you angry like this.

85
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,293
I'm saying I don't remember any of it.

86
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,428
Nine and a half.

87
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,397
Fine. You giving me a piggyback ride?
I remember that.

88
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,680
Nine and a quarter.

89
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,560
I remember throwing up
while on your back, too!

90
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,970
Nine and an eighth.

91
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,372
You changing my clothes...

92
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,679
I remember you changing my clothes too.

93
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,552
I remember you confess...

94
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,659
Hey!

95
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,163
Why are you taking a taxi when
you have your own car? Stop!

96
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,602
Where should I take you, customer?

97
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,571
Seoul.

98
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,590
Manager oppa, hurry and get up please.

99
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,559
Okay, what about Jun Young?

100
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,362
You're saying he left his
car and took a taxi?

101
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,767
Unni, what on earth did
you do to our Jun Young?

102
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:35,905
Exactly. I wonder what I did.

103
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,277
I wonder what I did that Sin
Jun Young is so bothered.

104
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,780
Are you asking me to
answer that right now?

105
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,982
That's true.

106
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,886
I feel like it's something big.

107
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,430
I can't remember it though.
I can't remember.

108
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,160
Look at that. Does that
help you remember?

109
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,380
I remembered a couple
things by doing this.

110
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,429
Oh, really?

111
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,366
Then hold on one moment.

112
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,803
Do you see something?

113
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,767
Mr. Driver, I'm sorry, but
could I borrow your phone?

114
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,737
Oh, Sin Jun Young?

115
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,290
You've started again.

116
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,890
Give me. Why are you stealing my food?

117
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,719
Hey, Young Deuk. What are you doing?

118
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,289
Did I or did I not tell you to steal the
manager's bowl if she's eating bibimbap?

119
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,124
-I forgot.
-Give it to me.

120
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,228
Spit that out too.

121
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,299
What are you trying to do by shoving all of this
in your mouth when you even have a small stomach?

122
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,535
Spit out everything into my hand.

123
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,841
Who is it? Jun Young?

124
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:20,843
Who's Jun Young?

125
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,613
Hello?

126
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,883
It's me, mom. You were
really worried, right?

127
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,921
I'm sorry, but you
called the wrong number.

128
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,930
It was Jun Young, right? The
person who called was Jun Young?

129
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,250
I said it wasn't.

130
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,368
Really? I'll take a look then.

131
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,471
Oppa!

132
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,211
Mom.

133
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,713
It's not your, mom. It's
your uncle, Jeong Sik.

134
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,284
Ah, uncle.

135
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,220
Are you in your right mind or not?

136
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,910
How much more will you upset your mom
before getting your act together?

137
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,960
Do you have any idea how much
your mom worries about you?

138
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,397
Don't say that. Why would
I worry about him?

139
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,600
Hang up. Hang up right now.

140
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,004
Hey, kid. Your mom eating
bibimbap out of a huge bowl.

141
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,350
You know what situation
that is then, right?

142
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,612
That's your mom being worried
to the brim about you.

143
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,470
Jeong Sik, seriously! Hang up!

144
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,817
Hang up!

145
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,780
I know, uncle. I know how
much my mom worries about me.

146
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,627
How did you get entangled
with a gold digger though?

147
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,990
Have you already forgotten?

148
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,501
Our Gook Young got entangled with a gold
digger and lost all of his father's assets.

149
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,439
He gave away even his underwear.
Do you not remember that?

150
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,108
Gook Young even went to
jail for that witch.

151
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,644
You...

152
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,815
Do you not remember how we barely saved
the situation with your contract fee?

153
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,817
She's not a gold digger, Uncle.

154
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,718
What?

155
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,923
Then, if she isn't a gold digger,
then is she a water snake?

156
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,227
You said you're a Hallyu star. You said you have
lots of money, buildings, and are insanely rich.

157
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,598
Does a guy who is that amazing
really not have an eye for girls?

158
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,768
-Where did you pick up a lizard like her?
-I like her, mom.

159
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,437
What?

160
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,642
I only found out recently too.

161
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,847
I really really

162
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,583
love her.

163
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,422
I think he's bewitched by this girl.

164
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,291
Jun Young! You have to be
careful of gold diggers.

165
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,260
That's why I'm running away right now.

166
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,268
If I keep seeing her, I feel
like I'll do something.

167
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,573
That's why, I'm running away.

168
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,450
You're saying he's not joking?

169
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,880
Yes, from what I see at least.

170
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,386
Although it's angering, I think he's feelings
towards plate-of-water unni are sincere.

171
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,530
Last time, even Pororo who
he treats like his sibling,

172
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,859
he sent him out of the house
because you have a dog allergy.

173
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,870
I can't believe it.

174
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,297
It doesn't make sense.

175
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,660
He left behind all of the amazing girls that are
lined up. This is an unbelievable situation.

176
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,669
Exactly.

177
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,773
Unless Sin Jun Young is crazy,

178
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,910
why would he like me?

179
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,512
Oh my. This unni seems quite all right.

180
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,515
At least you coolly
acknowledge what you should.

181
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,652
I love that aspect of you.

182
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,556
I know they say that the
prince in the fairy tale

183
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,528
married Cinderella, but honestly
at least Cinderella is nice,

184
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,300
hella earnest, and upright.

185
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,235
I'm nice too and hell nice! Earnest!

186
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,504
And upright.

187
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,579
Recently, I think Jun Young
seems slightly unhealthy.

188
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,000
Last time during a drama filming,
he hit his head really hard.

189
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,486
Is his brain possibly swollen?

190
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,391
They say that if your brain
swells, you can't think normally.

191
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,850
I should take him to the
hospital sometime soon.

192
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,362
Hey, seriously.

193
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,833
Stop it. That's not something to
say with me sitting right here.

194
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,537
Do you seriously not remember what
you yelled at our Jun Young?

195
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,012
If Sin Jun Young isn't
just playing with me...

196
00:18:52,080 --> 00:19:00,389
If he's sincere... If he really
likes me... what should I do?

197
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,029
When Jun Young goes to the hospital, you
should come get a check-up too, unni.

198
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,456
I'm sorry, Ahjussi, but could you back
up again and go to the back door?

199
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:51,040
Have you been well? You
couldn't even eat, right?

200
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,776
I'm sorry. I'll bring it soon.

201
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,981
Sin Jun Young is really sick?

202
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,853
-Brainstem glioma?
-Yes.

203
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,922
It seems like the situation isn't
good, so surgery will be difficult.

204
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,093
Sin Jun Young himself is
rejecting all treatments.

205
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,970
-His mother doesn't know he's sick, right?
-Yes.

206
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,437
He asked to keep this a secret
from his family and company.

207
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:38,280
Jun Young and his mom...
I feel so sorry for them.

208
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,962
That person isn't qualified. I
understand that you treasure him,

209
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,433
however, he is someone who
is no help to our party.

210
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,340
-Congressman Choi, you're being a bit harsh.
-You know that too, Congressman Kang.

211
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,141
He's guilty of manipulating stocks,
embezzlement, negligence, and tax evasion.

212
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,479
They say that police investigations
are still undergoing.

213
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,390
It makes no sense that you are suggesting someone
like that to be our future representative.

214
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,930
No matter what, he'll be cleared of all
charges. So you don't have to worry about...

215
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,324
Can you cover the sky with your palm? Even if it
doesn't happen now, it'll blow up sooner or later.

216
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:23,826
Here...

217
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,130
there is not one person who is innocent.

218
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,300
When you do big things,

219
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,703
people make one or two
mistakes here and there.

220
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,907
Helping each other out in hard times
is politics after all, isn't it?

221
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,179
In that kind of politics,
you will have regrets.

222
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,251
Because you need to make decisions you
don't like without a choice sometimes.

223
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,824
You sure have a lot of time to spare.

224
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,228
You even have time to be regretful.

225
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,847
That jerk...

226
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,130
What? What?! What happened?

227
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,167
Ahjumma, these people keep
cursing at my Jun Young.

228
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,603
Oh my, I thought there
was a fire or something.

229
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,572
"It's crap that he's everyone's boyfriend.

230
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:47,309
Does it make him happy to run away
with a woman after betraying his fans?"

231
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,481
"I'm going to sue his company
since he led me on."

232
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,783
Also, look at this.

233
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:59,980
Oh my, the idea is the same, but his
betraying skills are like none other.

234
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,524
This is our Jun Young's movie.

235
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,295
We are all ruined because of
Sin Jun Young's first love.

236
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,798
Oh my, why are they putting
so much effort in this?

237
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,834
They have so much time to waste...

238
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,905
Ahjumma...

239
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,842
You know that my dream is
to be Jun Young's wife.

240
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,978
-I told you that it couldn't happen!
-My man's past?

241
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,647
I can be cool and let that go.

242
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,586
However, I don't even know if
that man is dead of alive.

243
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,655
Ahjumma!

244
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,425
Bring me some more perfume
from my room please.

245
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,364
You already used up a truckful.
Stop making a fuss and come out.

246
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,440
I don't want to. It's no joke
how much I smell like trash.

247
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,671
Oh my, what smell are you talking about?

248
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,850
I can only smell flowers!

249
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,778
Come out before you swell up.

250
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,851
So annoying!

251
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:08,223
This jerk. You just
wait for my revenge.

252
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,526
-Who?
-Lee Hyun Woo.

253
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,950
He's studying to be a 7th Grade Civil
Servant. Could I ask which room he's in?

254
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,967
Lee Hyun Woo? Lee Hyun Woo... It's
my first time hearing that name.

255
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,904
It's strange... he's lived
here for over 2 years.

256
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,672
Hold on please.

257
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,912
-It's this hyung.
-I've
never seen him...

258
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,382
-How could that be? Please look again.
-Well...

259
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,053
Where are you, Hyung?

260
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,224
-I'm at your exam accommodations.
-My exam accommodations?

261
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,830
Ah, I moved out of there.

262
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,768
-Did I not tell you?
-No, I didn't.

263
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,405
Where's the one you moved into?
I'll go there.

264
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,943
No, no, no. I am in Daejun because
something happened at home.

265
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,079
Why? Is it something urgent?

266
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,086
Ah, I'm going up right now,

267
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,856
so I'll go to the store you work at.

268
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:17,392
Alright, see you later.

269
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,367
Hyung!

270
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:36,745
What is it about that you're
looking for me so desperately?

271
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,783
It's not that... First, this is
the most expensive item here.

272
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,120
Ah, how can the intro be so obvious?

273
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,789
Tell me.

274
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:49,780
I only have ten minutes
left before I finish my shift,

275
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,827
so I'll give you the
short and quick story.

276
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,098
My noona had a crush on
Jun Young in the past.

277
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,802
When we lived in Sooyuri, I saw
what my sister wrote in her diary.

278
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,706
Although she resolved her feelings after
finding out he was Na Ri's boyfriend.

279
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:10,145
That's why if Jun Young sways her even a bit,
she'll fall for it as if she's been waiting for it.

280
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,754
Isn't that a good thing? That a superstar
like Sin Jun Young likes our Eul.

281
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:24,410
The worlds my noona and Sin Jun Young
live in are completely different now.

282
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,629
Love should only be between people who
live in the same world as each other.

283
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,968
Where the lifestyle is the same, and
what they eat and wear are all the same.

284
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,138
People who are looking towards
the same place together.

285
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,510
So?

286
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,212
What is it that you want to tell me?

287
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,882
Please hold on to my noona.

288
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,286
You're the only one who can
get her mind straight.

289
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:53,689
Please?

290
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,023
When did you wake up?

291
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,660
You seemed to be sleeping,

292
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,562
so I didn't wake you...

293
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,478
Your manager let me in
from the back door.

294
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,448
The... reporters are in
front of the main gate.

295
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,153
Nine and a half. Half... half... half.

296
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:42,057
It's okay now. My fingers are
thick so it doesn't hurt much.

297
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,493
Where are you going?

298
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,262
Aren't you going to eat?

299
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,436
I worked so hard to
make this to feed him.

300
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,611
Then never mind. Don't eat it.
I'll eat it all.

301
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:15,824
Whatever. As long as it tastes good.

302
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,472
Oh, it's salty.

303
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,511
Seriously... But, am I a patient
with a transmittable disease?

304
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,247
Why does he always avoid me?

305
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,819
If he's mad at me, he should look at me and
tell me why, so that we can resolve it.

306
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,389
He's so narrow-minded for a man.

307
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,848
Hey! What are you doing now?

308
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,150
The lights came on and off? Really...

309
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,556
What strange things are
you imagining right now?

310
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,361
Reporter Kim, really, why
are even you like this?

311
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:30,465
We just sent an ahjumma over to Sin Jun Young's
house to feed his dog. Is that why you're like this?

312
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,910
Jun Young is really not at home.

313
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,380
Stop tiring yourselves for no reason and go home
now. Aren't your kids waiting for their father?

314
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:45,580
The Best Of Today's comments: "There is nobody who
has seen Sin Jun Young or No Eul for two days."

315
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,940
"What if these two committed suicide
just like Romeo and Juliet."

316
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,821
Actually, I just got a
call from Jun Young.

317
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,657
Because he was too stressed,

318
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,695
he said what he did was accidental and
he himself doesn't know why he did it.

319
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:06,670
I told him that someone in his position has a right
to go crazy once and for him to go get some air.

320
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,940
"No Eul PD, you changed your title of Nation's Gold
Digger to the Nation's Juliet just overnight ".

321
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,609
Can you not bear to live if you
don't look at those comments?

322
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,315
Of course, Jun Young is alone...

323
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:25,553
Is not alone. He's
together with his manager.

324
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,250
PD No Eul should already be back in Seoul so if you
don't believe me why don' you try calling her?

325
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,392
I'm here.

326
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,963
Right, if our Jun Young
really likes PD No Eul,

327
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,133
I'll just die right in front of you.

328
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,436
If Jun Young's eyes for women really only amount
to that, subtitles ripped and synced by riri13.

329
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,040
I'll give up my life and the
entertainment industry in a wink!

330
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,441
Please don't make such
guarantees like that, CEO.

331
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:56,851
To be honest, there's
a woman he's dating.

332
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,986
Who?

333
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,756
Kim Yoo Na.

334
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:08,280
Right, our agency's actress Kim Yoo Na.
She's dating Jun Young right now.

335
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,732
What are you saying right now?

336
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:16,438
It's been about a year. Some
reporter got wind of it,

337
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,220
and kept digging around
Jun Young and Yoo Na,

338
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:24,145
so I couldn't help but put on an act to
create a diversion. Are you happy now?

339
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,880
Christmas roses again?

340
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,870
I think Director Yoon Jeong
Eun saw that picture.

341
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,586
I thought they suit you well.

342
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,159
Thank you, Ji Tae.

343
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,629
It seems like she started
looking into who PD No Eul is.

344
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,131
Do you want another glass of wine?

345
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,000
Not wine, something else.

346
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,805
A kiss?

347
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,007
Here?

348
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,777
Why not? We'll be married soon anyway.

349
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,794
I heard you saw that picture.

350
00:35:48,796 --> 00:35:52,600
The picture where I was photographed with Sin Jun
Young and that woman at Sin Jun Young's concert.

351
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,020
Her name is No Eul. She's 28 years old. She works
at Sky Production as a freelance documentary PD.

352
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,450
She was a visual & media major
at a correspondence college.

353
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,881
Her parents passed away and
she has a younger brother.

354
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,884
You don't need to hire people
to find out more about her.

355
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,221
What are you doing right now?

356
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,956
I am trying to help lessen your efforts.

357
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,524
What kind of relationship

358
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,562
do you have with that woman?

359
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,966
-I won't accept this question.
-What?

360
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:30,471
If I answer to that question, I won't
be able to keep my promise with you.

361
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,379
Give me an answer. Do you like her?

362
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,316
Let's have another glass of wine.

363
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,484
Answer me, Ji Tae.

364
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,260
I asked you. Answer me, Choi Ji Tae!

365
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,837
Right, I like her.

366
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,732
The meaning of Christmas roses is.

367
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:38,339
'I don't have anything to
give to you', is that right?

368
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,742
That's right.

369
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:48,116
I will definitely make you
regret this very moment.

370
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,253
The reporters outside still haven't left.
They're also blocking the back door.

371
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,324
If the lights are on, they'll
think there is someone here.

372
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,095
Oh, my fate.

373
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,434
They'll probably leave if there's no sign of
anyone for about two hours. You can leave then.

374
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:48,142
My Jik's friend finished at the academy
and came home past 12 o'clock.

375
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,646
His mother was waiting in the elevator.

376
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,850
The elevator passed the first floor,

377
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,621
second floor, third floor

378
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,460
and going up, when his
mom suddenly said,

379
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:14,669
"Do you see me as your mother?"

380
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,208
What are you doing right now?

381
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:24,879
A ghost story. I read in your fan club site
that you're really afraid of ghost stories.

382
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,014
I did that to tease you, why?

383
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,253
"Do you see me as your mother?"

384
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,255
There's a ghost behind you.

385
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,290
What? Oh my!

386
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:53,641
Nine and a half. Half... half... half.

387
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,416
I think you're the one who's
more scared of ghosts.

388
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,683
Is it okay to turn the lights on?

389
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,086
I have blackout curtains.

390
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,522
Why are you telling me that just now?

391
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,124
So I could make fun of you.

392
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,660
Do you have a death wish? Is it fun?

393
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,463
Do you think scaring me is fun?

394
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,204
Ten.

395
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,107
-What?
-I counted up to ten.

396
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,780
I did really try hard to run away.

397
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,512
What are you even saying?

398
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,563
I tried really hard to run away,

399
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,934
but you're the one who's still here.

400
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,936
What are you talking about?

401
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,180
I'm hungry. Let's eat. I said let's eat.

402
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,489
-You said you weren't going to eat.
-When did I?

403
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,335
Have a seat.

404
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,404
Okay.

405
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,700
Why are you being like
this all of a sudden?

406
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,653
What do you mean?

407
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,526
You're like a totally different person
from earlier. You're confusing me.

408
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,428
Am I?

409
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,101
Are you by any chance
Sin Jun Young's twin?

410
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,536
No way.

411
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,441
Isn't it salty?

412
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,544
No, it's delicious.

413
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,919
Oh...

414
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,157
Ah, it blistered. I'll
bring the ointment.

415
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,194
What the hell? Who is that guy?

416
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,264
Is he a ghost?

417
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,614
You went to spit it out because
it was too salty, didn't you?

418
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,317
No. You made it so why
would I spit it out?

419
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,830
You really are a human being.

420
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:40,010
I really thought a ghost
took over Sin Jun Young

421
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,136
and turned into him.

422
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,639
Do I still look like
Sin Jun Young to you?

423
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,173
Gosh!

424
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:53,147
Seriously, why are you acting like
this all of a sudden? It's scary.

425
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,750
You were telling me to get lost
and scaring me not too long ago.

426
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,719
Why are you suddenly so nice to me?

427
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,221
It's a problem even
when I am nice to you?

428
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,790
I heard that when people
suddenly change, they die.

429
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,935
Oppa!

430
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,604
Hey!

431
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,841
I really kept you waiting, didn't I?
I'm sorry I'm late.

432
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,110
Were you getting ready to go out?

433
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,751
No, why would I go out this late? I just
thought there might be reporters around.

434
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,590
I think they're all gone, though.

435
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,500
Seriously? Man, these reporters...

436
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:41,228
They should have at least told me they're leaving.
I wouldn't be bothered with the hair and all if I knew.

437
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:42,863
Where's Eul?

438
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:44,865
She's not home.

439
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,535
-She's not?
-No.

440
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:51,872
She doesn't answer her phone, right? She
did say her battery was running out.

441
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,543
Is she with Sin Jun Young?

442
00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:00,715
Yeah. She said she'd setting some things straight
with him and she told me to go to sleep first.

443
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,586
-Yes, father.
-Where are you?

444
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,970
Let's have a drink with me, Son.

445
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,923
Mom will scold you if I drink with you.

446
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,693
You should quit drinking, too.

447
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,195
Today's the last time, I promise.

448
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,898
Just for today...

449
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,980
be your dad's drinking
buddy, Choi Ji Tae.

450
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,972
I'm sorry. I'm a bit busy right now.

451
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:04,812
You should just go home.
Mom must be worried.

452
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:11,285
Alright. I got it, punk. You
always take your mom's side.

453
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,223
See you later at home.

454
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:38,779
I'll drive from now on. You can go home.

455
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,993
Stop staring at me like that or
you'll burrow a hole through me.

456
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:56,497
Sorry.

457
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:07,541
You want me to sit here
like this today as well?

458
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,478
Without pouring you
drinks or acting cute?

459
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,417
-Yeah.
-Will you not even lay a finger on me

460
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,587
or hold my hand today either?

461
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:21,488
Right.

462
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,426
Are you that afraid of your wife?

463
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,930
Yeah.

464
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:42,109
Then... that woman, Young
Ok, she was your ex, right?

465
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,780
The one who looks like me, you said.
That's why whenever you got drunk,

466
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,049
you called me Young Ok, right?

467
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:52,653
That's right.

468
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,725
You're right. She is my ex.

469
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,363
If she's someone you
couldn't forget by now

470
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,667
you must've loved her a lot.

471
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:07,835
Yeah.

472
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,140
I wronged her very much.

473
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,850
Am I... allowed to
like you, Congressman?

474
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,218
No, don't.

475
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,491
There are no women in my life anymore.

476
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,312
Yes, hello.

477
00:48:56,007 --> 00:48:57,612
Where did you say he is?

478
00:49:12,132 --> 00:49:13,901
Ahjumma, water please.

479
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:19,340
Ahjumma!

480
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,709
-Some water, please!
-Oh, sorry, customer.

481
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,210
Thank you.

482
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,943
Eat up.

483
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:01,515
I really like that too,
but I gave it to you.

484
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,254
Sorry, you're forced to stay
out in the cold because of me.

485
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:14,928
But... aren't dogs usually supposed
to be raised outside, though?

486
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,234
Well, anyway, I'm really sorry

487
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:24,038
and I'll try my best to
get rid of this allergy.

488
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:31,779
Can I really shoot documentary
in this situation, though?

489
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,150
If things go wrong, I'll be beaten
to death by Sin Jun Young's fans.

490
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,187
Oh, God...

491
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,690
Are the reporters still here?

492
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,227
What am I supposed to do now?

493
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:54,768
Should I just go out and tell
them it was all a big fat lie?

494
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,773
Mr. Sin Jun Young, you're
at home, aren't you?

495
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:06,413
You're with Eul as well, aren't you? The
reporters are gone, so please let Eul go.

496
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:11,185
Let her go this very instant!

497
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,993
Who was that? A reporter, wasn't it?

498
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:23,297
Don't you have some kind of underground
passage or something in this house?

499
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,334
Houses this big always have those things, if
movies or dramas are to be believed at all.

500
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,006
Oh, it's all charged.

501
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,309
Rock, paper, scissors!

502
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,770
-I won.
-What the hell?

503
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,714
-You do the dishes.
-Gosh...

504
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,503
I should have put out rock instead.

505
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:13,413
Why did I even play rock paper
scissors when he asked me to?

506
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,590
Hey, Go Na Ri.

507
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,493
Hey, No Eul. Did you
see the news online?

508
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:30,730
No, I didn't. What is it? Did
someone chew me out again?

509
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,333
I really have no words, seriously.

510
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,335
Is Sin Jun Young crazy or what?

511
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,803
What is it?

512
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,364
I'm not sending Eul away.

513
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:10,871
I'm going to keep Eul.

514
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,273
Is she some kind of an object?

515
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:16,677
You were the one who let go of her hand.

516
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:20,647
So please stop this stupid
lingering and piss off.

517
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,617
You're the one who needs to piss
off from Eul's side, I believe.

518
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:26,186
-What?
-I'm not that qualified, but...

519
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,157
I think you deserve her
even less than I do.

520
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:34,094
Think of what you've done to her.

521
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:40,133
How can you look into her eyes and tell
her you love her as if nothing happened?

522
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,040
Sin Jun Young!

523
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,890
Why did you come out? The
reporters are still out there.

524
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,496
I heard you're dating Kim Yoo Na.

525
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:12,532
And that you've been doing
so for over a year.

526
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:18,171
And you've just been using me
to distract people from it.

527
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,009
Who told you such nonsense?

528
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:27,848
It's all over the internet. Your
company's CEO did the interview himself.

529
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:33,420
That you messed with me
just to protect Kim Yoo Na.

530
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,390
It's not true.

531
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:40,127
That's right. It didn't make
sense from the beginning.

532
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:45,866
How could you liking me ever make sense?

533
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,639
I don't know what you've seen
or heard, but it's all lies.

534
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:02,416
At least they're not calling
me a gold digger anymore,

535
00:55:03,684 --> 00:55:05,552
thanks to Kim Yoo Na, I'll be able
to walk the streets freely.

536
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,456
-I told you it's not like that.
-I'm going to sue you for psychological damage.

537
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,160
Now that I know the truth, I should
at least be compensated monetarily.

538
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,296
I need to get something out
of this too now, don't I?

539
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,036
It's not like that. Please
just listen to my words only.

540
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,341
And forget about all those other
jerks' blabbing. Please...

541
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,845
listen to me only.

542
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,186
I love you, Eul.

543
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,564
I love you, Eul.

544
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,801
Drop the act, Mr. Sin Jun Young.

545
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:03,176
Everyone in Korea knows you're a good
actor, so I'm telling you to stop now.

546
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:08,215
I love you... Eul.

547
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,793
Jik warned me so much about you...

548
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:29,202
He was right when he said we
live in different worlds now.

549
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:35,642
I was warned not to get
excited or become delusional

550
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,414
or be swayed or become hurt

551
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,717
because of any of your
words or actions, but...

552
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:56,463
That's right, I'm the crazy witch!
I'm the crazy witch!

553
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,968
I should've just listened to Jik...

554
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:38,240
Stop! What are you doing?

555
00:57:38,738 --> 00:57:42,930
I feel so sorry for PD No Eul. In
the end she was just used I guess.

556
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:46,813
Hiding this expensive watch under your
cheap jumper, who are you, really?

557
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:49,950
Now leave Choi Ji Tae, and
wrap things up with PD No Eul.

558
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,185
I love you, Eul.

559
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:57,691
I never tried to use you or played you.
Ignore them and listen to me only.

560
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,427
Does one really need a special
qualification in order to love someone?

561
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,496
I think it's just about how much
you love and care that person.

562
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:06,933
Do you like her that much? In about a month
you and I will become a family, Ji Tae.

563
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:10,010
-Mom?
-Isn't this that gold-digger by any chance?

564
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,471
She's the girl I like, Mom.

565
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,708
I won't let you go
even if I die, No Eul.
