1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,830
Whatever nasty stuff you might
be doing, I won't get hurt,

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,825
I won't be upset and I won't
misunderstand, so go ahead and keep at it.

3
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:20,507
=Episode 14=

4
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,111
Do you want to sleep with me?

5
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,590
If you don't want to, say it now.

6
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,327
I'll open the door for you.

7
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,734
I am not getting out.

8
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,405
I won't move a muscle and
keep staying by your side.

9
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,618
Please wait just a moment.

10
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,680
Have a nice evening.

11
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,790
Excuse me!

12
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,325
Yes?

13
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,828
What would you like to order?

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,897
Yes, I will clear this up.

15
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,640
Have you enjoyed your meal?

16
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,367
Yeah.

17
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,204
So one bean paste stew and
a plate of yukgaejang...

18
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,013
-Call me later...
-Tell me just three reasons why I can't date Eul?

19
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,520
The reasons why Eul and I can't date. It's because I
can't remember suddenly. I told you all of them.

20
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,270
-Please hurry up with the check.
-Yes, sure.

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,690
I am sorry.

22
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,859
It's crazy busy in here. Call me later.

23
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,463
Sure, sure.

24
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,534
Please give me a bottle of soju!

25
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,536
I'm going to Eul then.

26
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,307
If you can't come up with an
explanation either or you've forgotten it

27
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,447
then we can pretend there is no such
explanation and I'll go to Eul.

28
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,082
If Eul would've managed to take that USB
to the broadcasting station 5 years ago.

29
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,453
Hey, stop right there!

30
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,424
If you hadn't taken it from her.

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,126
Today is my father's memorial day.

32
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,062
Oh, my.

33
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,068
Well, I'm sure this wasn't intentional, so
please calm down and buy it again with this money.

34
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,069
Eul...

35
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,915
Eul remembered it all.

36
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,153
I thought she was okay, but she's
still been living in hell.

37
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,111
I am Sin Jun Young.

38
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,519
Six months ago.

39
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,590
I heard from my doctor

40
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,429
that I don't have much
time left to live.

41
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,407
Well, I was a bit flustered,
but we all die eventually.

42
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,279
This is why...

43
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,240
Why are you doing the dishes here?

44
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,700
-Oh, I quit being Jun Young's manager.
-Why?

45
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,726
I have my principles when it
comes to my job, you know.

46
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,490
I figured I just couldn't work
under such a rude and lowly being.

47
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,040
Why say that about Jun Young?

48
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,580
How could someone like
you raise such a punk?

49
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:06,140
Of all people, he can't do that
to PD No Eul if he is a human.

50
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,078
-What?
-Why are you fooling around instead of working?

51
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,610
Punk! If you are still drunk, you
should go home and sleep it off!

52
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,820
Why come here and babble nonsense?

53
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,052
It's not nonsense!

54
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,100
If you would've seen what he did

55
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,759
no matter how much you would hit him, the
next morning you'd want to hit him again.

56
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,093
-This brat...
-Wait!

57
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,696
Wait a minute. What if I went to him

58
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,665
and when he asks me why I quit

59
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,536
I told him "Hey, Sin Jun Young, you jerk! Before
becoming a star you should've become a person!"

60
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,439
and give him a kick in
the butt or something?

61
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,608
Shut up, you crazy fool!

62
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,777
What makes you think you
can hit him, where?

63
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,513
You, on the other hand, should
get hit a lot by me today.

64
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,585
Let's see, where did I put that
thing for hitting stupid jerks?

65
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,910
You're dead when I catch you!

66
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,624
Stop right there!

67
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,040
What a rat. Stop hiding and come on!

68
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,363
Let me ask you something.

69
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,150
If me, my sister and Jun Young were drowning,
you would save Jun Young first, wouldn't you?

70
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,330
This kid... are you in
elementary school or something?

71
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,571
He is, Dad.

72
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,340
But you always favour Jun Young.
Saying "My adorable kid."

73
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,780
So he's jealous, like an immature kid.

74
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,040
How dare you call your brother immature?

75
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,649
What do you mean I'm jealous?
What. What. What?

76
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,319
I really went too easy on you...

77
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,710
Don't hit Man Ok.

78
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,000
Why hit her? She hasn't
done anything wrong.

79
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,300
That hurts. Let go, now.

80
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,795
You're all crazy! What the hell are
you doing right from the morning?

81
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,664
And Yong Doo! Are you not going
to let him go this instant?

82
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:41,037
What is it? What did Jun Young do to that No
Eul or cloud or whatever her name was?

83
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,707
What did my Jun Young do so wrong?

84
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,014
The reason why I wanted to see you is

85
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,150
that Jik says he won't go to college.

86
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,750
What did Jik say?

87
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,658
Someone with Jik's grades could even
get into a SKY University easily.

88
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,628
But he said that he's not
thinking of college...

89
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,598
Jik!

90
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,370
How could you call my sister, Teacher?

91
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,510
I told you it was a secret for now.

92
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,174
Because it was a shame.

93
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,240
Why would someone like you not go to college?
Your original dream was becoming a doctor, too.

94
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,282
Anyway, I won't. I already
made this decision, so...

95
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,787
I'll have a little talk
with Jik and return.

96
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,630
Are you insane? Why the hell
won't you go to college?

97
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,397
Why do you think I've been
working so hard to earn money?

98
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,433
Are you in your right mind?

99
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,606
You can't even pay off all our debts with that
money, so how can I expect you to pay for my college?

100
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,270
You think Med school is cheap?

101
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,030
I have money. I have a
lot of money, so...

102
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,613
If you have so much money,
then get us a house.

103
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:02,819
Even if it's a room in a basement, it'll be better
than around friends and neighbours, so go ahead.

104
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,070
Okay. I will get a house, so...

105
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,659
And if you have that much
money, pay off our debts first.

106
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,200
Let's live comfortably without
worrying about loan sharks every day.

107
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,900
Okay. I'll get a house and pay off
the debts and do everything, so...

108
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,270
After you do all that, I'll go then.

109
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,640
Don't talk me about college anymore.

110
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,676
Hey, No Jik!

111
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,987
-Hello?
-This is Lee Eun Soo, from KJ Group.

112
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,423
You do remember me, right?

113
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,635
Eul won't be coming here anymore,
so you can live with me inside.

114
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,641
But what is this?

115
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,779
You are supposed to be a gentleman,
but you have stuff on you.

116
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,673
Yes, Doc.

117
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,609
The weather's so nice today, isn't it?

118
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,411
Have you thought about it?

119
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,016
Please get admitted to the
hospital, today's not too late.

120
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,810
Then I'd be dying at the hospital.

121
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,720
-But if you get treatment at the hospital...
-I'm going to die anyway. At the hospital.

122
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,010
As a doctor, I can't
stand still anymore.

123
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,480
I will tell your family.

124
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,352
I have always thought of you so fondly.
Don't make me have to meet you in court.

125
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,923
-Mr. Jun Young...
-I have something urgent, so I'll call you later.

126
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,994
What brings you to my home?

127
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,635
Why did you send me this?

128
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,972
I don't know why you did it,

129
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:13,509
but I am engaged to someone.

130
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,648
Exactly.

131
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,219
But you do know that I did
not only send this to you

132
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,957
but to all the directors and producers

133
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:33,696
as well as other company representatives to
apologise for the mess I caused during filming.

134
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,274
It is a bit excessive for an apology.

135
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,377
If it's too uncomfortable to
receive, you can just leave it here.

136
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:59,021
Oh, and I would like to
apologize and thank you.

137
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:01,591
You even kneeled in front of Yoon Woo.

138
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,494
If I hadn't, then you would've had to.

139
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,099
I couldn't have someone else
do it to that type of person.

140
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,853
I'll be going then.

141
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,623
Alright.

142
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,841
What did you say then?

143
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,483
When you rescued me at the swimming pool,
it seemed like you said something.

144
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,586
What was it?

145
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,488
It's a secret.

146
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,556
Please tell me.

147
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,575
You said you were engaged.

148
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,279
-So what?
-I didn't know back then.

149
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,081
Forget about it.

150
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,518
It's okay. Please tell me.

151
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,890
Drive safely and have a nice day.

152
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,642
Hey, get to work, get to work!

153
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,160
If that's how you'll greet me, then don't come here
anymore. I am no longer an executive director.

154
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:38,114
Then, I'll talk without formalities.

155
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,120
You reckless fool. Did
you have to do this?

156
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,788
I'm doing what I was told.

157
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,892
They didn't tell me to quit, so I'll
be working like this without quitting.

158
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,596
Why call me reckless when all I do
is listen to my parent's words?

159
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,365
Will you keep having a
standoff with the chairman?

160
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,670
If you look close to me, it'll hurt your
career. So don't come here anymore.

161
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:06,442
I saw PD No in the lobby earlier.

162
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,847
I think the chairman called her.

163
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,250
Why would my mom?

164
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,390
You don't look too good. Has
something bad happened?

165
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,092
Yes.

166
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,995
What was it?

167
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,738
You have someone threatening me not to touch
as much as a hair of yours as a protector.

168
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,407
I will not leave the country.

169
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,143
I will stay here.

170
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,847
Sure. Koreans should stay in Korea.

171
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,415
Who said anything about that?

172
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,189
-Secretary Kim, bring it here.
-Yes ma'am.

173
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,107
It's a billion dollars.

174
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,278
I'll keep it short. Take the money

175
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,617
and let Ji Tae be with Ms. Yoon. She's loved
no one but him for the past 20 years.

176
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,687
You shouldn't do this to
her as a fellow woman.

177
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,356
What did she do wrong?

178
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,194
It's not like you like Ji Tae, either.

179
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,607
I've clearly warned you not
to do anything to Eul.

180
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,277
-I told you that I wouldn't...
-I didn't scold her. I just gave her some money.

181
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,710
Can't I give some money to someone
who's struggling financially?

182
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,816
Mother!

183
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,468
This...

184
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,130
-isn't counterfeit money, isn't it?
-Eul.

185
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,106
If you don't believe me, go to a
bank and confirm for yourself.

186
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,608
You're giving it to me after
all, so I doubt it's fake.

187
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,611
I'll use it well.

188
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,781
No Eul!

189
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,592
Give the money back.

190
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,662
What you need to receive
isn't money, but an apology.

191
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,465
-I'm sorry. I apologize.
-You know I won't be hearing that any time soon.

192
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,904
Your parents won't say sorry
even if the world was ending.

193
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,880
-Eul.
-Even if I cause ruckus my entire life,

194
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,747
they won't apologize. And now that
I have no one to listen to me

195
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,020
no matter how much you try to protect me, stepping
all over someone like me won't be an issue for them.

196
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:09,770
So why should I fight? It's obvious
it's going to be a lost battle.

197
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,710
This is still wrong...

198
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,561
I just sold you for a million dollars.

199
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,335
I can't even comprehend how much money that
is yet, but thanks to you I hit the jackpot.

200
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,837
I'll buy you expensive alcohol later.

201
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,902
You haven't left yet?

202
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:58,407
This river is so beautiful.

203
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:07,583
How did you think of building a
house in such a beautiful place?

204
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,420
Aren't you cold? The
wind is pretty cold.

205
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,556
What is your relationship to PD No Eul?

206
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,670
Did you stay so you could ask me that?

207
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,797
It seems that PD No really likes you.

208
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,500
I really like Eul too.

209
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,239
That's why I beat up Yoon Woo
Young to revenge for my Eul.

210
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,976
Then why did you act so
cold in front of her?

211
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,111
She's too beautiful for me.

212
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,282
That made me furious.

213
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,653
How ridiculous...

214
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,125
Aren't you and Choi Ji Tae both crazy?

215
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,380
Why go nuts over a wench
that isn't even up to...

216
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,029
Please talk a bit more nicely.

217
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:58,767
As I've told you, we're talking
about a woman I really like.

218
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,361
Are you okay?

219
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,664
No, I'm not.

220
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,354
Don't get startled because I won't
do anything but treat your wound.

221
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,460
Your words were right after all.

222
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,035
What?

223
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,230
The thing you gave to me as a present,
you said this would give me good luck.

224
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,260
I won the lottery, friend!

225
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,945
What are you talking about?

226
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,020
With your luck, how could
you win the lottery?

227
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,770
What do you want to do
with a million dollars?

228
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,218
Can't you see me working my
butt off right now, Friend?

229
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,160
Say your nonsense later at home...

230
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,170
I asked you what you wanted
to do with a million dollars.

231
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,458
Well, I'd do a lot of
things with that money.

232
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,300
I would want to buy clothes
and bags and shoes...

233
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,830
Okay! I'll buy it all for you.

234
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:40,035
I only received things from you,
but today I'll buy it all for you!

235
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,274
What about this?

236
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,310
It's pretty.

237
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,250
It's pretty, but...

238
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,414
Okay then! Then we'll get this too!

239
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,318
Are you really buying me that?

240
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,554
This store's clothes
are super expensive!

241
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,990
I have nothing but money now.

242
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,326
-What about this?
-Did you cause trouble?

243
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,662
Wrong, that's incorrect!

244
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,206
That's $8370.

245
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,908
Are you crazy? How can
it be so expensive?

246
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,512
Wait a second. Eul, I
don't want to buy this.

247
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,030
I'll just have this scarf.
Just this one scarf.

248
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,516
Hey, don't be so tacky.

249
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,421
Why are you being like this? This
is an expensive store, after all.

250
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,389
Please pack it all up.

251
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,660
Are you crazy?

252
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,330
Even if you won the lottery, how
can people like us do this?

253
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,798
What about our place?

254
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,835
In the world, the one with money is it.

255
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,510
Can I pay with this?

256
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,341
Yes.

257
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,946
It's not counterfeit
money, so don't worry.

258
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,119
It's really a million dollars.

259
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,656
Hey, don't pack that.

260
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:14,263
I'm sorry customer, but we
cannot process this money.

261
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,932
But why? Why can't you?

262
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,601
It's not just a piece of paper.
It's money!

263
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,560
Please use this card.

264
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,540
Hyun Woo!

265
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,546
He isn't Hyun Woo. His
name is Choi Ji Tae.

266
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,349
He's Choi Hyun Joon's son, Choi Ji Tae.
He's been fooling us all this time.

267
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,885
What are you talking about?

268
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,055
Please use this card.

269
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,590
No, don't.

270
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,162
Why don't you stop interfering with other
people's lives and go see your fiancee?

271
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,269
Don't use a cent of this money
and give it back to my mother.

272
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,240
Who told you you could sell me off? Do
I only amount to a million dollars?

273
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,910
And am I really the only one
you sold with this money?

274
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,812
Didn't you sell your father as well?

275
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,619
If you really want to do that, ask
my parents for all their assets.

276
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,654
Only that way it would be right!

277
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,741
You are quite good at ice packing.

278
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,478
It's because Eul falls down frequently.

279
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,648
She sprains her ankle easily, too.

280
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,891
Forget it. I think I can walk.

281
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,669
Will you really be okay?

282
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,654
I'm sorry, but can you drive?

283
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,556
My ankle hurts and I can't step
on the acceleration properly.

284
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,897
Thank you.

285
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,601
Is it really okay if you
don't go to the hospital?

286
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,371
It's just a little sprain. It
will get better with time.

287
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,576
I also got ice properly put there.

288
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,718
How do you think of me as a woman?

289
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,589
Am I charming?

290
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,195
You probably are.

291
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,098
As much as the No Eul that you love?

292
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,938
You have a different kind of charm

293
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,707
from Eul's.

294
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,343
Do you have any thoughts of seducing me?

295
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,619
You have a fiance.

296
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,392
That fiance of mine is
absorbed by that No Eul.

297
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,796
He even called off our engagement.

298
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,868
No Eul seems to be
interested in you still

299
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,172
but my fiance keeps acting like a moron
in spite of knowing that very well.

300
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,350
I'd like to steal you from her.

301
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:03,091
So that she could feel
the same pain I do.

302
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:12,033
Choi Ji Tae would realize how
charming the woman he lost is, too.

303
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,772
Do you think we could do that?

304
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,269
You'll be fine even without
me carrying you, right?

305
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,972
I'm not someone that could be photographed
doing such a thing, you know.

306
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,707
Of course.

307
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,112
I left the key in the ignition,
so you can ask for valet parking.

308
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,713
Please take care.

309
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,853
You haven't answered me.

310
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,895
Can I steal you from No Eul

311
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,131
as I wish?

312
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,633
No.

313
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,570
I don't think you'll be able to.

314
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,360
Sir, I'm sorry, but can you make a
U-turn after that traffic light?

315
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,634
Why isn't this girl not answering
her phone, making me worry?

316
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,617
-Eul!
-Na Ri, good you're out here. Help me with this.

317
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,810
So you bought them?

318
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,026
I went to the bank and changed
it into $100 cashier's checks.

319
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,164
-What are you doing? I said come and help.
-You are crazy.

320
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,533
You are insane!

321
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,002
Thank you!

322
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,676
This is all yours now. Except
for these, they're Jik's.

323
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,850
And you know that dress you said was pretty but was
expensive so you didn't like it, I bought that too.

324
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,649
-Let's go upstairs later and...
-Are you even a human being?

325
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,086
Are you even a human being, girl?

326
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,670
Of course I am! I'm not a
doll or something, right?

327
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,758
What kind of...

328
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,894
He said you sold your
dad for this money.

329
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,765
He said you got this money from KJ
Group to shut up about your dad.

330
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,267
That's right. I got that money. So what?

331
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,705
So what if I sold Choi Ji Tae
and my dad for this money?

332
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,576
It's not like my dad would've come
back to life if I didn't get it

333
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:19,130
or like the culprit would've got caught and the
unfairness of this all would've been exposed.

334
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,030
It's not the end of the world,
so what if I got this money?

335
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,720
-Still, it doesn't mean that you can do this.
-It was a losing fight from the beginning.

336
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,770
Should I keep fighting? Just to go to the
police and jail and lost at court again,

337
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:31,526
and have loan sharks
chasing me every day

338
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,863
-and live my entire life like that?
-Does that mean you can accept the money they gave?

339
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,833
-What would your father say?
-He'd say I did well.

340
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,240
My dad was always unpleased by the fact

341
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,410
that girl like me who kept giving endlessly to
others and kept getting the short end of the stick,

342
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,977
was worried about how I would
survive in this dangerous world

343
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,446
-but now he can finally close his eyes peacefully.
-Crazy wench...

344
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:55,160
-Do you even hear yourself talking?
-With this money...

345
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:59,721
I can send Jik to college, send him to study abroad
and make sure he won't lack a thing his entire life.

346
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,524
Why? Are you jealous?

347
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:06,661
Are you super jealous that this worst
beggar became super rich all of a sudden?

348
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,264
Why would that money...

349
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,766
Have you always been this dirty, No Eul?

350
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,820
You weren't like this before.

351
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,539
I'm going to buy a house with
this money and move out of yours.

352
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,941
I'm going to live in a
nice house with Jik.

353
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,077
Okay. Get out then.

354
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,847
I can't stand to live with such
trash any longer, so get out!

355
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,883
You think I won't?

356
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,887
I'll leave and sleep in a
five star hotel! Satisfied?

357
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,473
Jeong Eun learns work
faster than I had imagined.

358
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,810
I thought she only cooks well,
but she's really smart.

359
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,700
Including investment work as
well as group related work...

360
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:06,387
She's understood things in such a short time
and she's complimented by the employees.

361
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,059
Who am I talking to right now?

362
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,827
Honey.

363
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,831
-What?
-Are you listening to me?

364
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,935
-What did you say?
-Come on. Have I been rambling on to myself?

365
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,539
I'm sorry. I had some
things to think about.

366
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,075
What were you saying?

367
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,513
-Choi Ha Roo.
-Just a second, mom.

368
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,350
Gosh, this girl never ages...

369
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,552
Have you heard of this?

370
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,356
-Hey, Ji Tae!
-Oppa.

371
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,359
-I'll fix you a meal soon.
-Yes, Ahjumma.

372
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,737
When you're not around, they say Team Leader
is a ridiculous personnel from the clan...

373
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,439
They chew her up.

374
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,811
Everyone was like this when you first
became seated as branch leader as well.

375
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,982
They were all frustrated because

376
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,653
they thought it's ridiculous a young person got
high position because you're chairwoman's son.

377
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,256
But since you showed your skills,
no one said a word afterwards.

378
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:22,230
It's been a while, son. We've last seen each other
at the restaurant around a month ago, right?

379
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,835
Stop pushing Jung Eun so much.
There's no way I'm going back to her

380
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,104
so stop using Jung Eun

381
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,608
like a puppet.

382
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,411
Please.

383
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,311
Where is it?

384
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,092
It's hard work since you're
not used to it?

385
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,798
Mother gave Eul a million dollars.

386
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,502
-How far is she planning to go...
-So...

387
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,571
did she refuse?

388
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,144
"You've got the wrong person. Do I
look like I could be swayed by money?"

389
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,215
Did she argue with your
mother or yell at her

390
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,384
and refuse the money?

391
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,854
So she received it.

392
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,092
What are you protecting as you're
stooping so low, Choi Ji Tae?

393
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,896
Get some rest.

394
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,711
Hyun Woo, I mean...

395
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,146
Is this Choi Ji Tae's phone?

396
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,353
Yes.

397
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,190
-That's right, Go Na Ri.
-Is money everything?

398
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,327
You think you can just ruin someone
just because you have money?

399
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,165
-Na Ri.
- Our Eul

400
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,670
wasn't very sane, but
she wasn't this weird.

401
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,874
Because of your money,
Eul became total trash.

402
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,845
Change her back. Change her
to who she was, god darn it!

403
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,721
Gyu Cheol.

404
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,127
Everything my mother and father owns...

405
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,865
I'll have to take it all away.

406
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,632
What are you doing and not going home?

407
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,204
-Oppa.
-What?

408
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,339
What if...

409
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:07,114
What if... I had not run away and
stayed with Choi Hyeon Joon...

410
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:11,319
what would Choi Hyeon Joon have become?

411
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,456
Well, you would've had few more
of Jun Young's siblings and...

412
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,860
and lived happily receiving
love from your good born kids.

413
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,232
If I had stayed with Choi
Hyeon Joon and not run away,

414
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,537
would Choi Hyeon Joon
like Jun Young said,

415
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,242
not become so terrible?

416
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,650
If you feel so bad, go
now and take him away.

417
00:41:43,017 --> 00:41:49,423
From the look of Choi Hyeon Joon's face, he looked
like he'd come running if you asked him to.

418
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,001
But what will happen to my
pitiful Jun Young, Oppa?

419
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,938
Because of his father's sin,

420
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,943
he can't even love the woman he loves.

421
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,015
Hey, there, tennis shoes...

422
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,652
Do you think I'm unlucky, too?

423
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,826
What did I do so wrong? You
tell me one thing, too.

424
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:05,266
No... shut up!

425
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:11,505
You'll sound like ethics textbook.
Don't say a word!

426
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,509
You little...

427
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,048
Does a thing like you know the world?

428
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,627
Bad wench...

429
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:39,467
We've been friends for ten years.
How can you call me trash?

430
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:47,141
Tell your owner that she was bad!

431
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,755
Dad!

432
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,498
I just wanted to call you.

433
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,889
You didn't do anything wrong.

434
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,927
You didn't do anything wrong, Eul.

435
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:20,561
Eul.

436
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:27,110
Why are you here? You said
you'd go to a five star hotel.

437
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:40,548
Mom, should I just forget everything and
live the way I want to before I die?

438
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,254
Hold Eul's hand next to her, kiss her...

439
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:56,030
Embrace her small shoulders
warmly, watch movies, travel...

440
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,867
Laugh and be happy...

441
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:05,606
Should I just live like that and go?
No one will say anything about it.

442
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:39,206
Noona, are you really going to fail
your college exam for the third time?

443
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:43,377
I can't focus because of you.
What can I do?

444
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,950
But... this is for government officials.

445
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:55,489
I'm going to take exams for government officials
as soon as I graduate. I need to make money.

446
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,027
Wow... then, we can't
become a campus couple?

447
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:04,632
You think you can attend a college
in Seoul with your grades?

448
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,403
That's right. I'm a numb skull who's
not good at studying. Satisfied?

449
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,178
Noona.

450
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,480
You still haven't gotten out
of Sin Jun Young's fan club?

451
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:27,554
I did, I did. Thanks to you, I got
chewed out by the club members.

452
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,291
I didn't even eat breakfast and
my stomach is about to burst.

453
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,034
Don't tell me. Are you jealous?

454
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,470
What jealousy?

455
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,240
I'm worried you'll really fail
your exam for the third time.

456
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,443
You're too old to be into celebrities...

457
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:53,414
Alright, I got it. I can't worry my man.

458
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,350
I'll study really hard and
get into college this time.

459
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,004
You need to use substitute here.

460
00:49:16,307 --> 00:49:26,524
First change 4log 9X into  2log 3X
and substitute it as A.

461
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:29,738
Square A plus 2A minus 3...

462
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,985
Noona, what are you doing?
Are you a pervert?

463
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,091
Ah, my head...

464
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,411
You said you'll sleep in a five star hotel.
Instead, you sleep in front of the house?

465
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:08,015
I made some hangover soup,
so have some, you bad wench.

466
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,553
Why was I sleeping in front
of Na Ri's house yesterday?

467
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,458
Did I come to her house drunk?

468
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,429
Geez...

469
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,816
Go Na Ri...

470
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,637
Branch Leader Yoon Jeong
Eun asked me to get you.

471
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,074
Is this a good time?

472
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:17,084
Give me this one. It's a birthday
gift, so please wrap it up nicely.

473
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,887
Yes, I understand. I'll
wrap it up very nicely.

474
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:33,467
Yes, hello. I'm Sin Jun Young.

475
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,602
Yes, hello.

476
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,405
I want to meet with
Director Yoon Jeong Eun.

477
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,741
Where should I go?

478
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,025
This way please.

479
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:10,270
Your guest has arrived.

480
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:21,481
Today is my birthday, but I didn't
have anyone to share a meal.

481
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:23,250
Have a seat.

482
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,525
-Should I hang your coat?
-No, I'm okay.

483
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:39,810
I want to talk to her privately. So
just prepare the food and go home.

484
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,434
Okay.

485
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,773
This is a restaurant I manage.

486
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:51,078
I wanted to see you alone, so I told
them not to accept any customers.

487
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,680
You know who I am right?

488
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:56,216
Yes.

489
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,651
Who am I?

490
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,480
Team Leader Yoon Jeong Eun.

491
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:02,422
What else?

492
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,497
KJ Group Department Head.

493
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:11,698
Not that.

494
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,470
Beyond that, I...

495
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,205
I am Choi Ji Taek's fiancee.

496
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,376
Of course, we couldn't have our
engagement party because of you.

497
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:26,079
And I get to eat alone on my birthday.

498
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,450
Don't you have something to say to me?

499
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,690
-I'm sorry...
-Instead of that.

500
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:39,559
-I'm truly sorry.
-Instead of that.

501
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,897
-I don't have words to say to you.
-Not that.

502
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:56,320
From now on, I'll never see Ahjussi... I
mean, I'll never see Choi Ji Tae again.

503
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:59,980
Of course, you shouldn't. You
have received 1 billion won.

504
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:12,959
Look here!

505
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,831
Where are you now? With Jeong Eun?

506
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,101
That's right. She's with me.

507
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:25,505
She said that she would never see you
again, but did she already tell on me?

508
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,640
Jeong Eun.

509
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:31,712
This girl is really bad. She received 1
billion won and can't keep a promise.

510
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,614
I'll have to tell your mother.

511
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:38,385
Let Eul go and talk to me. I'm
on my way there. Talk to me.

512
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:45,325
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry? What are you sorry for?

513
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,028
What should you be so sorry for?

514
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:56,470
How can someone like you...
How dare someone like you...

515
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:01,408
I want to be jealous, but you're not even at
the level for me to get jealous. How dare you!

516
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:06,179
I am sorry. Sincerely.

517
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:10,450
I didn't want to hurt you, Director.

518
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:12,052
I'm really sorry.

519
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,123
If you're that sorry, just die.

520
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,627
If you are that sorry you
should die right now.

521
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:23,263
So that Choi Ji Taek can't see you.

522
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:25,332
Get out and die!

523
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,868
Stop right there.

524
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:30,771
Let her go!

525
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,543
Stay outside.

526
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,044
I am sorry.

527
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:45,820
-Eul.
-I won't see him again. Don't worry about it.

528
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,402
How far should we go?

529
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,907
If I become even more cruel,
would you give up then!

530
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,097
The door is opening.

531
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,737
If you love her, just
love and let it be.

532
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:48,208
Playing around with a person's life...
once wasn't enough?

533
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,812
I'm not going to take revenge anyway. You're
of no use to me anymore, Choi Ji Tae.

534
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:56,630
-How can a son bring up his mother's dismissal?
-Why are you doing this to me?

535
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,686
Did you finally get enough courage
to yell out in front of people?

536
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:03,523
You blew 10 million won overnight!

537
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:06,226
How did you do the audio check?

538
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:09,129
He doesn't have a father?

539
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,910
He didn't make a sound on purpose.

540
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,099
Are you kidding me?

541
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:19,406
Please tell me. How seriously
ill is Jun Young?

542
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:23,476
What is your intention? Why
did you approach Jeong Eun?

543
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:27,480
Do you want to be shaken up by me...
no, would you like to shake me up?

544
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,517
So that you can fill up my mind?
