00:00:01,632 --> 00:00:05,607
=Episode 12=

2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,712
There is a song that my mother always
sings when she's in a good mood.

3
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,053
"On that green pasture, I want to
build a house like a picture."

4
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:40,824
"With my beloved one, I want
to live a hundred years."

5
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,027
The lyrics start the song like that.

6
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,865
So I don't exactly know when it
started, but very naturally,

7
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,801
I started to dream one dream.

8
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,871
On that green pasture, I want to
build a house like a picture.

9
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,310
With my beloved one, I want to
live happily for a long long time.

10
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,894
Even when I knew I didn't
have much time left,

11
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,430
I didn't give up on my dream.

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,500
I only reduced the time... from
a hundred years to three months.

13
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,850
The remaining distance 5 meters left.

14
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,487
The remaining distance 4 meters left.

15
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:04,274
Even though it might not be 100 years, I will spend
the time I have left loving the person I love.

16
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,614
So let's not spend it feeling
sad or that it was unfair.

17
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,338
The remaining distance is zero.

18
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,781
Let's just give up. Sin Jun Young
won't even show up. It's over.

19
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,250
Now it is really over.

20
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,561
What do you mean by that? Where
are you saying you are going?

21
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,168
I'm leaving.

22
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,614
But now I am... the very last
dream I dream in this world...

23
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,767
...I am folding it here.

24
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,006
The thing I must do putting
what's left of my life on,

25
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,542
is not to live happily with Eul
in the house like a picture.

26
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:30,700
But to leave after I return to her the truth
and justice that I took away at the start.

27
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,824
Please lend me $10. I'll
give it back tomorrow.

28
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,490
You haven't paid back the $50
you borrowed the last time.

29
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,240
I said I'd pay it back by tomorrow.

30
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,299
Just give me $30.

31
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,635
Hey! I'm not a bank...

32
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,720
Here's the money for the food.
I've paid it all back.

33
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,840
Who's the real culprit behind
No Jang Soo's hit-and-run case?

34
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,340
Then who do you think it was?
They already caught the culprit.

35
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,583
Not the culprit Choi Hyeon Joon set up.

36
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,252
I mean the real culprit.

37
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,154
Gosh, you're quite something.

38
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,189
Please leave while I'm
telling you nicely.

39
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,993
Otherwise you can get sued
for obstruction of business.

40
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,365
That's why after I left, the
world that Eul lived in

41
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,001
overcame the long and cold winter

42
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,574
while awaiting the mild
and warm spring days.

43
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,416
You are going nowhere. Get
out immediately, No Eul!

44
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,389
I said to get out, Eul!

45
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,225
Ahjussi!

46
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,162
I'm sorry for making you wait.

47
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,265
Before leaving, can you
please open the trunk for us?

48
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:50,367
Okay.

49
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,105
No, please don't.

50
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,907
Please do so.

51
00:05:58,308 --> 00:05:59,275
Ahjussi!

52
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,346
Jik, can you carry the
bag into the house?

53
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,248
-Ahjussi!
-Hurry!

54
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,182
Yes.

55
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,421
Please be sure to explain what you've
been doing up until this time, later.

56
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,657
Okay.

57
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,359
Jik, wait a moment.

58
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,595
-I'm going, Noona.
-Jik!

59
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,980
What are you doing showing up
suddenly from out of nowhere?

60
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,520
You don't have to run away
so just stay right here.

61
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,377
Did Na Ri tell you something, Ahjussi?

62
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,780
I just happened to hear about it.

63
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,617
I heard that Assemblyman Choi
Hyeon Joon's wife threatened you.

64
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,120
That's why you're running
away so ridiculously.

65
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,924
If you know, don't stop me.

66
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,194
It's enough that I lost my Dad.

67
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,060
I don't want to lose Jik as well.

68
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,436
If I miss my flight, are you going to
take responsibility for that, Ahjussi?

69
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,920
Jik! Put down the bag and come quickly!

70
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,673
Eul!

71
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,250
Stop acting like you know
me and leave quickly.

72
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,390
By acting like you know me
and you needlessly get hurt...

73
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,590
I'll block it! I'll prevent
it from happening!

74
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,880
Those people are much scarier

75
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,821
than what you're imagining.

76
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,340
They're not the kind of
people we can deal with.

77
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,459
They are my parents!

78
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,334
Assemblyman Choi Hyeon
Joon is my father.

79
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,971
Madam Lee Eun Soo is my mother.

80
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,975
I'm their son.

81
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,485
That was really funny.

82
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,621
Your sense of humor was usually corny.

83
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,665
What the heck?

84
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,902
It wasn't a joke?

85
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,737
That's right.

86
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,239
It's not a joke.

87
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,244
But your name is Lee Hyun Woo.

88
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,650
If you are Choi Hyeon Joon's son,
your last name should be Choi.

89
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,784
I'm sorry. I deceived you.

90
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,860
Eul.

91
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,428
Don't come closer.

92
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,565
-No Eul!
-I said not to come any closer!

93
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,867
Don't come even a step closer!

94
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,880
-What did you do?
-What?

95
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,362
I took Eul's USB and almost killed her.

96
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,564
At least I did those kinds
of rotten things to her.

97
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,866
But, what did you do?

98
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,769
Your parents!

99
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,006
Threatened Eul.

100
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,144
And when they tried to chase
her out of this country,

101
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,981
what exactly did you do?

102
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,878
Why isn't the groom coming? Ten
minutes have passed already.

103
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,582
Maybe there's a lot of traffic.

104
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,420
Is he not picking up?

105
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,138
Isn't Oppa seriously crazy?

106
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,812
Today is your daughter's
birthday, right?

107
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,440
-While I'm being this nice, please go away.
-I won't go away either,

108
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,150
until you tell me who
the real culprit is.

109
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,789
Where is the real culprit?

110
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,160
I told you, the man who turned
himself in is the culprit.

111
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,299
But, this coat, you know it
really doesn't suit you?

112
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,536
This coat is wearing
down your handsome face.

113
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,017
I'll give you all the coats I wear
later, so do you want to wear them?

114
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,592
I told you not to come.

115
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,190
How can a father not come
on his child's birthday?

116
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,096
A father? What kind of father are you?

117
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,460
You don't have the right to
act like a father to Bo Ram.

118
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,604
Bo Ram doesn't think of you as
her father either, so leave.

119
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,224
Hey! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
Give me your phone.

120
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,210
Hey, Sin Jun Young came to Room 6101.

121
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,570
-Really?
-Yeah!

122
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,020
He says that he's Sin Jun Young, but he's
even more handsome than Sin Jun Young.

123
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,733
-Oh no, how did this happen?
-Come on, let's go.

124
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,668
Let's go.

125
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,142
-What in the world!
-What is he doing here?

126
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,078
Happy Birthday Bo Ram.

127
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,281
I'm really Oppa Jun Young.

128
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,623
How can these kids believe me?

129
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:41,197
Hi Sister.

130
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,670
Oh, he looks similar!

131
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,332
Right?

132
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,635
-Maybe he is Sin Jun Young!
-That's right!

133
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,170
Bo Ram, did you not see
the movies that I was in?

134
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,174
Really, there isn't any kid
who doesn't know this.

135
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,900
Don't open your eyes like that.
It makes my heart flutter.

136
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,815
Hi, transfer student!

137
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,820
As expected, when I came in, you seemed the
smartest out of everyone here.

138
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:12,261
But how does a famous person
like you know Bo Ram?

139
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,932
I'm a fan of Bo Ram's Dad.

140
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,504
Bo Ram's Dad is the prosecutor that
I respect the most in this world.

141
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,650
Really, my Dad? You respect my
Dad the most in this world?

142
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,847
Of course! Your dad is

143
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:38,754
the most brave, the most
just, handsome, cool person.

144
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,393
Ah, but his fashion sense would be
a little flaw, if it was a flaw.

145
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,001
If only my dad was as amazing and cool
as your dad, how great would that be?

146
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,172
Hey, Cha Bo Ram! I'm
freaking jealous, really.

147
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,182
You were here.

148
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,089
Ah, dirty. Why would you eat
something that fell on the floor?

149
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,393
Why would you exaggerate to a kid?

150
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:24,600
I didn't exaggerate, it's true that you are the
person that I respect the most in the world.

151
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,703
Not including my mom.

152
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,621
"For No Jang Soo's hit-and-run case, someone
else decided to turn themselves in,

153
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,059
so cover up everything that you've investigated
so far, and just do what I tell you from now on."

154
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:57,890
"For your sick daughter, she'll get surgery at the
best hospital, pay for all her surgery costs."

155
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,535
-Look here!
-Is what...

156
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:06,142
the current chief prosecutor at that time, said
to lure the lawyer in charge, also known as you.

157
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,545
-Look here, Sin Jun Young.
-"Excuse me, Chief Prosecutor!"

158
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,649
"In order to save my only daughter, you want me
to cover up the truth because of a prosecutor?"

159
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,380
"I cannot do that,"

160
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,421
is what you pleaded.

161
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,458
As a result of your plea, you
were demoted to the countryside.

162
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,850
You weren't able to get rid of your dark past with
your gang, so you got fired from as a prosecutor.

163
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:29,899
To your wife and child, because
of your petty conscience,

164
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,235
you were perceived as a person who
left his family and even got divorced.

165
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,471
Film your dramas at the studio.

166
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,714
I have been told that I will die soon.

167
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,421
If I die, the truth
will be buried forever.

168
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,194
So unload the baggage that you will have
to carry for the rest of your life,

169
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,097
and give it to me.

170
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,435
You little punk won't stop, will you?

171
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,707
If you are going to shoot a third rate drama like
that, then go to the studio. You crazy punk.

172
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,348
Assemblyman Choi Hyeon
Joon is my father.

173
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:27,189
That man doesn't know that I am his son.

174
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,227
And...

175
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:39,735
No Jang Soo, who passed away from the hit-and-run
case, is the father of the person I love.

176
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,913
I don't even get placed as 2nd
place for having grudges.

177
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,186
But if I can't do anything and die, I'm going to
appear as a ghost every night and haunt you.

178
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,889
Not exaggerating, but for real.

179
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,760
Who is this?

180
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,333
I am No Eul. Please open the door.

181
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,669
No one is home right now.

182
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,772
Don't lie to me.

183
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,641
Please open the door.

184
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,244
There is really no one home right now!

185
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,147
I have something to say to the
assemblyman and the madam.

186
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,482
Please open the door.

187
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,687
Really, there is really no one
home right now! Please go back.

188
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,246
I know that it's like
hitting an egg on a rock,

189
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,250
and I know that someone like me isn't
even a handful to people like you,

190
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,255
so to my father, I said even if
it's unfair, to suppress it!

191
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,859
To forget it all, and
comfortably close your eyes!

192
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,195
If it's that unfair,

193
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:52,701
in the next world be reborn as a powerful person
with connections. That's what I said to him!

194
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,376
That's why I was going to get lost for
you! Because you wanted me to get lost,

195
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,611
I was going to get lost for you.

196
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:10,100
I was going to live crawling so I won't be
in your sight, as if I don't even exist!

197
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,992
But why are you like this? Why did you
send your son to keep a watch on me!

198
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:19,028
Was I that scary?

199
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,232
What's so scary about me. Do you
know how much of a coward I am?

200
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,437
Do you know how weak I am? I can't
even make a sound when you step on me!

201
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,043
People like you are scary,
what's scary about me?

202
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,116
Eul!

203
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,452
Mom, are you okay?

204
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,721
Don't you need to go the hospital?

205
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,423
I'm okay.

206
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:49,758
Mom is okay.

207
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,729
Choi Ji Tae... How can he be like this?

208
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:59,168
How can he, none other than my own
oppa, backstab you and Dad like this?

209
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,703
Is he on medication or something?

210
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,975
Secretary Kim, contact the hospitals
and police stations again to see

211
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:10,946
-if Vice President Choi has gotten in an accident.
-Yes. I will.

212
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,106
-What about Dad?
-He's probably with CEO Yoon.

213
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,909
Unni Jeong Eun's Dad is freaking scary.

214
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,178
It can't be that he's
hitting my dad, right Mom?

215
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,457
I don't have anything to say to you.

216
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,270
I have raised my son wrong.

217
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,432
Is there another woman
whom Ji Tae I seeing?

218
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,267
There is no one.

219
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,572
He's not one to make these kinds
of mistakes. He probably has...

220
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:18,147
By tonight just bring
Ji Tae to my Jeong Eun.

221
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:24,820
You cannot cancel this wedding
without our Jeong Eun's will.

222
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,955
Even if we're going to cancel
it, we will cancel it!

223
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,597
It's okay even if it is late at
night, so when you bring Ji Tae,

224
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,467
let's make them do the engagement
even if it's between the two of them.

225
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,202
CEO.

226
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,019
Hello.

227
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,123
Director, was everything done properly
for your engagement ceremony?

228
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,529
Do I look like a pushover in your eyes?

229
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,000
How dare you clothe me in this dress?

230
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,900
Why is the dress... Was there
any problem with the dress?

231
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,540
Because of this lousy and frivolous
dress, I couldn't get engaged.

232
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,309
Because of this dress!

233
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,214
I was totally humiliated in front
of people and couldn't get engaged!

234
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,250
Director! Director, wait a moment!

235
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,850
Please let this go! Hold her!

236
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,670
Are you okay?

237
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,675
You're hungry right?
Do you want to go eat?

238
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,848
-Ahjussi.
-Yeah.

239
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,384
If I met Ahjussi,

240
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,088
ahjussi's parents would
be really upset, right?

241
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,027
-They probably would.
-If I said I would date Ahjussi,

242
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,299
ahjussi's parents would
think the sky is falling,

243
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,067
right?

244
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,405
They would.

245
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,075
Maybe,

246
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,881
this might be the ultimate revenge

247
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,518
that I can do to Ahjussi's parents.

248
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,620
Right?

249
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,830
Then let's date, Ahjussi.

250
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,871
You have drunk a lot, Director.
Director!

251
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:09,511
Who are you to tell me what to do?
How arrogant.

252
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,289
I can't seem to get drunk no
matter how much I drink today.

253
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,844
Excuse me. Please come to your senses.
Excuse me.

254
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,854
You are still a person
that has a lot to do.

255
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,758
So, you can't die on your
own without my permission.

256
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,659
Alright?

257
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,598
Director! Director.

258
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,740
Director! Hurry, hurry!

259
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,379
It's too late.

260
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,049
Now there's no evidence, and no witness.

261
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,421
There's no way you can catch
them through the law.

262
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,770
I'll do whatever it takes to catch them,

263
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,628
so just tell me who is the real culprit.

264
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,075
Before it's too late...
Please, Attorney.

265
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,762
It's Daehan First Party's Chairman Yoon Seong
Woo's one and only daughter, Yoon Jeong Eun.

266
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:24,766
Yes, I got it now. The things I want
to do before I die. The bucket list.

267
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:31,072
Sin Jun Young's bucket list.
I'm really anticipating it.

268
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,608
Then, should we get down to business?

269
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,011
Yes, let's start.

270
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,616
Cut. Yes, that's good.

271
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:46,800
As expected, since our veteran PD Yoon is
filming it, the quality is surely different!

272
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,692
Camera, walking angle, everything
is the word perfect itself!

273
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,827
Isn't it? Gook Young?

274
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,830
Ah, yes. Ah, it's different.
It's totally different.

275
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,168
PD Yoon! PD Yoon!

276
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,604
Ah, totally different? What do
you mean by totally different?

277
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,920
In my opinion, whether it's PD
Yoon or PD No, it's the same.

278
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,008
Man Ok!

279
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,444
Ah, why did you hit me, CEO?

280
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,746
You haven't even eaten lunch.
Aren't you hungry?

281
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,914
Yes...

282
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:17,752
Ah, no. I can buy something to
eat on the way to the office.

283
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,189
If you don't have anything urgent,
you should eat here before you go.

284
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,459
Hyung, let's order black bean noodles to
eat. For me, spicy seafood noodle soup.

285
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,529
Oh, okay... For me, black bean...

286
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,131
Order sweet and sour pork, too...

287
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,233
For me, spicy seafood
noodle bean soup...

288
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,851
PD Yoon.

289
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,670
Good job!

290
00:32:52,787 --> 00:32:54,789
PD Yoon, you're a dipper, too.

291
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,293
I'm sorry, I did
it unconsciously...

292
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,300
Ah, our CEO is so self-centered.

293
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,133
How many times did I say I don't like pouring
the sauce over it, I like dipping it in?

294
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,635
Right. Sorry.

295
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,874
This bird-size head! How can I be
a CEO with having this kind of head?

296
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,544
Gook Young. I'll retire today,
so do you want to be the CEO?

297
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,382
No matter how much I think about it, I
don't think I have the right to be a CEO.

298
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,518
Ok, you know,

299
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,760
have you ever seen it being so
suddenly awkward and serious

300
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:30,191
over pouring or dipping the
sweet and sour pork sauce?

301
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,363
Even someone whom I know says they
will resign their CEO position!

302
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:41,669
After firing PD No Eul and
switching it to PD Yoon,

303
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,671
the CEO seems like he is being extreme.

304
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,776
Was that a whisper, by chance?
I can hear it so well.

305
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,151
Just speak comfortably. Is there someone
here that doesn't know of that?

306
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,888
CEO, just be as you always are, too.

307
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,794
Since our PD Yoon is new here, say
"fighting" and let's work well together.

308
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:10,532
The taste of the sweet and sour pork suits me,
and I feel like he will be a great partner, too.

309
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,204
Fighting.

310
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,780
-CEO!
-Hi.

311
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,047
I'll be coming in.

312
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:31,220
Oh my, I smell the scent of an
unemployed person in the air.

313
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,487
What brings you here?

314
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,458
Did you eat black bean ramyun?

315
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,710
-How did you know?
-Here.

316
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,036
-Hey, PD No.
-Yes?

317
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:54,609
Choi Ji Tae asked me for a favor, so I
did come, but I don't think I can do it.

318
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,044
What is it?

319
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:03,690
Hey, when you meet the Vice
President, can't you say that

320
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,422
I tried my hardest to give you
work to do, but you rejected it?

321
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,323
Please.

322
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,025
Please.

323
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,865
Ah, wait a moment!

324
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,535
What's the work?

325
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,507
Something our PD No Eul can never do. Seo
Yeon Woo's movie VJ.

326
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,244
But, why can't I do that?

327
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,412
Didn't you hear the rumor
about Seo Yeon Woo?

328
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:35,817
He's harsh and picky, has a
phobia that's like a sickness,

329
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,280
and controls all of the staff's
perfume choices that go with him.

330
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,723
And Seo Yeon Woo's staff
are all typically,

331
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,180
34-24-35.

332
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,680
They're pretty enough to
be celebrities themselves!

333
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,810
And the beauties have to shower
at least twice no matter what.

334
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:56,404
Why? Because Seo Yeon Woo seriously
hates the dirtiness and the smells.

335
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,975
So? So what?

336
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,048
I think our PD No barely
looks at the mirror...

337
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,490
And here, too...

338
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,528
Alright, since you're already
resting, take a good rest,

339
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,365
and I'll try to give you work that
will perfectly fit PD No's style.

340
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,269
So talk to Vice President Ji
Tae's for me. Please help me?

341
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,437
I'll be going.

342
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,290
You should have at least
washed your face...

343
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:02,470
President. This is No Eul.

344
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,907
I want to be Seo Yeon Woo's VJ.
Please give it to me.

345
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,611
I just want to hang in
here and not run away.

346
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,047
If those people say they
are going to kill me,

347
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:19,420
a person wouldn't die that easily right?

348
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,927
Let's talk about that
issue tomorrow afternoon.

349
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,400
Resign, Choi Hyeon Joon!

350
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:33,550
Resign, Choi Hyeon Joon!
Resign, Choi Hyeon Joon!

351
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,760
Guarantee the right to life!

352
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:39,900
Guarantee the right to life!
Guarantee the right to life!

353
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:45,570
Justice, citizens, how long has it been since you
said that. The store I've managed for 20 years,

354
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:48,816
in one morning, what you
guys call justice?

355
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:52,854
Do you think, we, picked you,
Choi Hyeon Joon, to do that?

356
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,950
Resign, Choi Hyeon Joon!

357
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,259
Resign! Resign! Resign...

358
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,031
I will ask just one thing.

359
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:09,070
Your stores. Did you run your businesses with
proper license from the government or the city?

360
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:16,978
Well that's because... even without that, we
have had good business for tens of years!

361
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,780
What do you mean, even without that?

362
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:23,451
Running an unregistered street
stall is clearly illegal.

363
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,456
It can call for up to two years of imprisonment
or fines of to 7-million won in penalties.

364
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:34,195
The city and assemblymen in the
district, including myself,

365
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,633
didn't want to to conducting forced evictions,
so we gave you as much time as possible...

366
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,269
-We did our best...
-You gave them as much time as possible,

367
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,739
and you did your best.
Are you sure about that?

368
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,421
With as little money as possible,
you wanted to kick them out,

369
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,126
and you didn't hire the largest
number of thugs with your big budget?

370
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,431
As far as this is concerned, to
benefit the citizens for public good,

371
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:14,001
-it's legitimate way to carry out the law...
-In name of public good, violence is glorified,

372
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,805
for the convenience of others, you've
pushed these people over the edge.

373
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,475
Is this what Assemblyman Choi
Hyeon Joon calls justice?

374
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:34,155
Then how about the property taxes
they never paid for many years?

375
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,991
How about the damages done to surrounding
vendors who have paid their dues faithfully?

376
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,360
Also, what damages will be
incurred in the future?

377
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,132
If people who abide by the law are damaged and
get hurt, who would want to abide by the law?

378
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,340
Is that kind of world
a world of justice?

379
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,937
That law. If these people could
have kept it, they would have.

380
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,441
Because it's illegal to be discriminated
against and looked down upon,

381
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,110
they wouldn't have to be anxious about
the threat of being forced out.

382
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,670
You should probably stop the 'perfect
citizen' cosplay right now, Choi Ji Tae.

383
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:03,684
You've never been near the vicinity
of where those people live,

384
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:09,220
so acting as though you know them, and like you're
on the same side, makes it comfortable to look at.

385
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,527
If you were on the same side, and acted as though
you were different from them from the start,

386
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,365
doesn't it make you uncomfortable that you
pretend to not know even when you know everything?

387
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,403
From my knowledge, I know that Assemblyman
Choi Hyeon Joon's parents worked at a food stand.

388
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,397
Did you at least organize a bit?

389
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:52,967
What organizing?

390
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:01,943
A man can be like that when
he has something big to do.

391
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,779
I was like that too.

392
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,349
It can be confusing if whether
what you're doing is right,

393
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:13,500
make you nervous, and the
responsibility can be burdens...

394
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,223
I won't get married to Yoon Jeong Eun.

395
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,161
Is it because of that No Eul?

396
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,703
I will not live my life for
you, Father, or Mother anymore.

397
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,207
From now on I won't do anything,

398
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:40,348
if it is for your or Mother's benefit,
that makes you happy or makes you smile.

399
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,782
Ji Tae!

400
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,492
If you do not like my abilities, you can kick me out
any time, whether from the company or from home.

401
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,462
I will pack my things
and leave any time.

402
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,565
What is this?

403
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,334
It is a movie my company
is investing in.

404
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:10,504
I was going to leave it
to Ji Tae, but you do it.

405
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:15,476
We are family after all.

406
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,348
I was dumped, Mother.

407
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,885
When? We never called
off the engagement.

408
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,457
-Mother.
-That day, you clearly did the ceremony.

409
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,528
The dress was very very pretty, and
the bride was even more beautiful.

410
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,270
No matter what anyone says,
you are my daughter-in-law.

411
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,540
So from now on, I will share
everything that happens in our group,

412
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,715
as well as the influences and
secrets which our family shares.

413
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,418
I will tell them to you.

414
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,744
It's for a detective!

415
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,881
Don't you think this is too much?
You don't have anything else?

416
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,282
Then what about this?

417
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,284
Give this to your
boyfriend, your boyfriend.

418
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,019
Bring a new set.

419
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,487
Where is my phone?

420
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,861
You have really overlooked me, right?

421
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,833
To the point to assign the PD that Sin Jun Young
had fired while shooting the documentary...

422
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,510
I look at you with very
detailed eyes, Seo Yoon Hoo.

423
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,712
How dare I, put Hallyu's
ultimate star, Seo Yeon Woo...

424
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,685
To be honest, about Sin Jun Young's
firing with the documentary,

425
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:09,623
the PD does her work well, but Sin Jun Young keeps
seeing her as a woman and keeps hanging around her,

426
00:45:09,757 --> 00:45:12,326
she kept it in for a long time, until
she suddenly burst out and left. Bang!

427
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:15,463
But, is that PD that amazing?

428
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,601
I heard that the level of women
Sin Jun Young sees is no joke.

429
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,438
Not at all. You'll
probably see later, but

430
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:31,412
you've heard that Sin Jun Young's
taste is close to a pervert's, right?

431
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,781
Most people who know him, know.

432
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,187
That PD does her work skillfully,

433
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,891
but you really shouldn't
expect anything more from her.

434
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,729
Some say they blocked that PD from coming into the
filming site, thinking she was a homeless person,

435
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,401
and another person even tossed some coins to
that PD thinking she was a beggar, I hear.

436
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,438
Who are you?

437
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,760
Hello. I'm here to film Seo Yoon
Ho's Behind The Scenes, I'm No Eul.

438
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,712
Please take good care of me.

439
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:45,920
Gook, you're looking carefully right?

440
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,756
Yes, I'm looking carefully.

441
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:54,728
Get lost!

442
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,499
When you see Manager Jang coming
in, you must just clap once.

443
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,640
You told him to be on the lookout for me when
I come, but what are you doing by yourself?

444
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,807
I'm not doing anything.

445
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:12,680
Really? Move out of the way. Wow, you're
really packing things to eat skillfully.

446
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:16,820
Who are you packing this for? Did you...
Did you suddenly find a new hubby?

447
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:20,120
What do you mean by a new hubby? Ah, move
out of the way. Get out, get out, get out.

448
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:24,525
Ah, then is this to give to Jun Young?

449
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,570
What do you mean by Jun Young...

450
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:31,580
Don't go! For a rascal that
yells harshly at his own mom,

451
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,240
what is so pretty about that that you're
packing food and giving it to him?

452
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:38,572
He'll cook ramen, or drink tap water.
Drop your interest in him!

453
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,610
Wait! What do you mean by he can
cook ramen or drink tap water?

454
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,850
Are you saying things the way you
want because he's not your son?!

455
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:49,350
Whether I give him side dishes, or cook at the
store to give it to him, you should lose interest!

456
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:53,587
-Lose interest, and...
-Okay, I'll start the car.

457
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,925
How were you going to carry something
this heavy and ride a taxi?

458
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:02,062
I can carry this, right? You're
going to take this, right?

459
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,398
Come out. Hurry come out.

460
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,790
You should sit here
calmly until I clap once.

461
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,849
I'll unload, okay?

462
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,817
Whatever. Whatever.

463
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:39,967
Ah, this Ahjumma really
doesn't listen to what I say.

464
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:45,372
I'll be at the sauna right here. When
you are ready to go home, call me.

465
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,044
No, it's okay. Let's go.
Let's just go home.

466
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,883
You've come all the way here, so you should see
Jun Young's face, and see him eating, too.

467
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,687
I said it's fine. I'm just going to go.

468
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,827
Are you embarrassed to
see your son's face?

469
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,497
Oh my! Are embarrassed
from seeing your son?

470
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,133
What are you saying?

471
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,702
Then go in.

472
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,200
Young Ok?

473
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,408
Why are you this way?

474
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,477
You keep asking for a beating!

475
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,360
-Just go inside.
-I told you I don't want to.

476
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,670
How many times do I need to tell you
to leave them here and let's go?

477
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,783
Sin Young Ok!

478
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,234
It's you, right?

479
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,063
Hurry up and let's go!

480
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:50,531
Good bye!

481
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:53,100
What are you doing here, Noona?

482
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:54,701
Jik!

483
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:00,600
No. The world these days is so cruel and scary.
I am worried someone might try to hurt you.

484
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,476
You are the most scary, Noona.

485
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,480
And who'd hurt me? It's
not like I am a child.

486
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:11,051
No... I am not saying
someone will hurt you.

487
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:15,856
I am just worried someone might hit you
with a car like before.

488
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,050
Let's go. Shouldn't you be at work?

489
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,495
I'll go right after walking you home.
Let's go!

490
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,130
Stop right there!

491
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:29,169
Who is this strange woman?

492
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,005
Strange woman? Me?

493
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,042
-What brought you here?
-I came to see you. So what?

494
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:42,716
Why are you ignoring me? How hard is it to respond
once that you are doing your best to ignore me!

495
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,660
I thought you had a
cast on your fingers.

496
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,850
We are not close enough to converse
on Talk, are we?

497
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,157
Oh... You are putting up an iron wall.

498
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:56,230
I thought we became quite
close, did we not?

499
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,731
Not at all.

500
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,250
-You're counting chickens before they hatch.
-Who the heck are you?

501
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,736
-Who are you to hold our Jik's hand that freely?
-Me?

502
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,380
We know well enough to hold
hands like this...

503
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:11,011
Well enough to wrap my arm
on his shoulder...

504
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,149
Well enough to spank...
his butt.

505
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,820
The who the heck are you?
Who are you?

506
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,955
The person who likes Jik! So what?

507
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:43,076
No! No! No, it can't be.

508
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,183
Cut! Okay.

509
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,557
Good work! That was very nice!

510
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,150
Let's pull out now.

511
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,740
Good work everyone.

512
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,763
Good work everyone.

513
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,513
Thank you.

514
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,118
Ahjussi.

515
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,834
Why go this far?

516
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,542
I will do it.

517
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,845
Didn't we decide to date?

518
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,437
Don't overdo it.

519
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:21,241
You have many places to work
aside from Seo Yoon Hoo.

520
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,916
This is cheating.

521
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,387
Why is the woman who is so pretty
making a bachelor's heart flutter?

522
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,790
You are still the same, Seo Yoon Woo.

523
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:45,640
Thank you for coming on
board to do our movie.

524
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:50,170
I thought it was wasted
because of the funds.

525
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:58,612
But, your support for your man is no
joke since you got engaged, Madam.

526
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,081
Then, can't I be?

527
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,686
But who is the antagonist actor?

528
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:08,188
Playing a psychopath
character is not that easy.

529
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:12,392
It's Kim Soo Chan. He'll
join the filming tomorrow.

530
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:15,062
Is that right? That's good.

531
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,800
His star quality is slightly less than Sin
Jun Young's, but his acting is good enough.

532
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:24,410
I hear he's good natured. Jun
Young jerk is too impudent...

533
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,672
Are you bad mouthing me?

534
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,684
Why are you here?

535
00:55:37,684 --> 00:55:41,000
I came to film the movie. I'll do your
counterpart. The psychopath part.

536
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,589
You turned it down, didn't you?

537
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,394
I am not that irresponsible. Since
I started, I'll finish it as well.

538
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,599
And I admit that I am impudent, but I
am nothing compared to you, right?

539
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,800
Yoon Woo.

540
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,002
Answer your phone.

541
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,276
Yes, this is Seo Yoon Woo.

542
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:08,682
Uh, Hee Joon! I came down to the
South Sea to shoot a movie. What?

543
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,486
Why? She said she's in
your room now, right?

544
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,858
I'll see you again, Jeong Eun.
I'll call you.

545
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:23,463
Be careful, Hyung. The
reporters are everywhere.

546
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,736
Excuse my behavior on our first meeting.

547
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,939
This isn't our first meeting, is it?

548
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,711
I wasn't going to act like I know you.

549
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,681
I'm Yoon Jeong Eun.

550
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:48,855
I'm Sin Jun Young, although
you must already know that.

551
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,196
I'll protect Eul, so you
just take care of yourself.

552
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,765
Right now, you can't even
take any responsibility.

553
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,737
How dare you? How dare
a person like you?

554
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:13,730
You are not doing this movie because
of Team Leader Yoon Jeong Eun, right?

555
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,408
Do I look like I am joking?

556
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:17,410
I don't believe it.

557
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:20,914
What do you know? How do you
know what I'm going to do?

558
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,630
She's gone to the deep end?
I think she's gone mad.

559
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:28,450
If anyone even touches a hair on
her, I'll never let it slide.

560
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:31,120
He can't be doing that if he's a human!

561
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,780
Evil jerk!

562
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,500
You have to get rid of the
trash like me quickly.

563
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,596
Shoot me quickly. Hurry up and shoot me!

564
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:38,660
Cut!

565
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,934
You'll be blacklisted in this field.
