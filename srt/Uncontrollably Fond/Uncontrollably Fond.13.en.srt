1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,357
I'll be going on a date with
Dad, so wash up and sleep.

2
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:17,402
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,675
Yoon Jeong Eun, 30 years old.

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,446
It's Daehan First Party's Chairman Yoon
Seong Woo's one and only daughter.

5
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,914
Dad!

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,710
The license plate number Seoul 3
Ga 3126. Type of car Chet TF30.

7
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,920
Color of the car, red. Totaled
soon after the accident.

8
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,692
You there!

9
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,464
Stop there!

10
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,390
Thank you.

11
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,593
Take one. Thank you.

12
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,767
Who are you to be ordering me around?

13
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,606
So arrogant. Why am I not getting
drunk no matter how much I drink?

14
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,304
The CCTV at the hit-and-run
site was broken.

15
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,630
Three witnesses... as if
they promised each other...

16
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,778
they changed their testimonies.
No witnesses. No evidence.

17
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,848
Probability of appeals
request to be made, zero.

18
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,299
What did you do earlier?

19
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,637
A test recording for the movie.

20
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,710
Why, so suddenly?

21
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,541
I've made up my mind.

22
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,512
I heard the new team leader of that
investing company is a beauty.

23
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,930
So... you didn't change your mind because the
investing company's team leader is a beauty?

24
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,852
You're right.

25
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,587
-Please!
-Geez!

26
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,590
I forgot to take my blood
pressure medication today.

27
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,926
Let's try to minimize such upsetting
jokes, alright, Jun Young oppa?

28
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,510
Do I look like a joke to you?

29
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,267
No.

30
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:48,600
That Team Leader Yoon Jeong Eun... I hear
she'll become KJ Group's daughter-in-law.

31
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,307
She's not the type for you to hit on...

32
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,941
She plans to, but she's not yet.

33
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,543
Man Ok, give me some Chung shim hwan...

34
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,818
Take what's good for you.

35
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,426
There aren't any. No more.

36
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,330
Say it ain't so. Please
tell me you're joking.

37
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,898
No, I don't want to.

38
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,550
You said they started taping Seo Hyeon Woo's
portion. Let's hurry up and go meet them.

39
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,900
Wait. Kim Soo Chan is supposed to play that role.
They already published articles saying that.

40
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,643
I know. According to the coordinator
unni over there, their team...

41
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,144
is going as well.

42
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,913
That case...

43
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,384
call the agency and tell
them to take their pick.

44
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,156
Will they take Kim Soo Chan who barely
starred in one independent movie or

45
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,894
will they take Sin Jun Young, a top notch Hallyu
star and 10 million audience driving actor?

46
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,020
I'll go after meeting with the director.

47
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,930
You're really not doing this movie because of Team
Leader Yoon Jeong Eun, right? You lied, right?

48
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,550
It's true. She's rich from an amazing family.
On top of that, they say she's a beauty.

49
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,650
Since when did you go after women
with money and family background?

50
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,808
For a long time. You just
never caught on, Hyung.

51
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,650
But still...

52
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,646
She has a fiancé and is
about to get married.

53
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,452
Hey! If it's that KJ,
Assemblyman Choi Hyeon Joon...

54
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,722
Team Leader Yoon will become Choi
Hyeon Joon's daughter-in-law!

55
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,380
Stop lying.

56
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,327
It's true. KJ Group only has one son.

57
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,064
You didn't think that far?

58
00:06:56,733 --> 00:07:00,770
What a relief you found out now. You would've
been in big trouble if it wasn't for me!

59
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,846
Well, now that it's come to this,
let's do your best in acting.

60
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,749
In any case, it was a movie you
didn't want to miss out on.

61
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,057
Yoon Jeong Eun. Choi Hyeon Joon and
Lee Eun Soo's daughter-in-law to be.

62
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,961
Choi Ji Tae's fiancée.

63
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,550
I mean... what's wrong with that Oppa?
Didn't Jun Young oppa like PD No Eul?

64
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:38,875
I don't know. Who'd decipher
that crazy guy's heart?

65
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,410
I'm okay.

66
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,557
Lots of people can see us. This
is one of our company's resort.

67
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,527
There are lots of people from KJ here.

68
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,090
Kim Soo Chan, they'll
start filming tomorrow.

69
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,837
Oh, really? That's good.

70
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,207
Days remaining for statute of
limitation to expire, 46 days.

71
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:16,720
Days remaining for me, minimum
30 days, maximum 60 days.

72
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,630
There's no one.

73
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,148
Is someone talking bad
about me over there?

74
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:29,092
What are you doing here?

75
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,340
I came to film the movie. Your
counterpart. The psychopath role.

76
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,031
You dropped it saying you
don't want to do it.

77
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,769
I'm not that irresponsible. I should
wrap things up if I dropped the ball.

78
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,333
See you again, Jeong Eun. I'll call you.

79
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,905
The reporters are all over.
Be careful, Hyung.

80
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,111
Excuse me at our first encounter.
Alright then.

81
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,682
This isn't our first encounter.

82
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,486
I wasn't going to acknowledge that.

83
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,457
I'm Yoon Jeong Eun.

84
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,127
I'm Sin Jun Young, even though
you probably know it already.

85
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,300
-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

86
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,422
You haven't changed your phone number?

87
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,326
You're ignoring my texts and
not answering the phone.

88
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,795
I thought you changed your number.

89
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,032
I wanted to change it,
but didn't get to.

90
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,403
Why aren't you picking up?
And ignoring my text?

91
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,474
-Just because.
-Just because?

92
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,060
Sorry, I'm busy. I have nothing to say.

93
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,220
Why don't you have anything to say?
I have a lot to say.

94
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,883
I don't want to listen.

95
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,751
Jun Young...

96
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,288
I'll see you soon.

97
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,543
I'll go back, please rest.

98
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,728
I'm sorry.

99
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,766
-Is that all?
-If you could get married soon,

100
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,368
it would be a bit less confusing.

101
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,671
I'm really sorry.

102
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,673
Ji Tae...

103
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,663
Wanna drink together?

104
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,862
What kind of trouble am I
going to cause while drunk?

105
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,596
CEO! What are you doing?

106
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,467
Would you like to party with me tonight?

107
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,814
Did you come because
you wanted to see Eul?

108
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,051
-I was shooting a movie.
-I thought you refused to do it.

109
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,689
Oh, that. Well, the team leader was
very beautiful so I changed my mind.

110
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,125
I have a bit of a soft
spot for beautiful people.

111
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,680
I'm sorry, it slipped my mind. You shouldn't
be drinking, right? Because you're sick.

112
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,583
I'm not sick.

113
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:48,631
Brain cell glioma, the tumor has spread
too much to even consider surgery.

114
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:55,438
Life expectancy is estimated...
at 2 months.

115
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,975
Am I right?

116
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,851
I will take care of Eul, so why don't you
focus on taking care of yourself first?

117
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,053
The way I see it,

118
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,090
you don't have much time left to waste.

119
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,198
You won't even be able to take
responsibility because you'll be gone soon.

120
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,971
Stop shaking her up.

121
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,110
I will take this.

122
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,180
-Let's have one more drink.
-You'd better move!

123
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,717
Hey, are you not even going to say hi?

124
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,019
Go away, please!

125
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,930
Wow, you're so cool!

126
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,225
You won't even look into my eyes.

127
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,980
Long ago, Man Ok used to bother
me so much saying she likes me.

128
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,135
She was all like Oh, oppa,
let's go out just this once...

129
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,205
Stop it! Aren't you going to step aside?

130
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,180
You... your accent...
playing hard to get...

131
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,946
Man Ok, you're the cutest when
you speak with your accent.

132
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,800
Stop talking like you're from Seoul, because
it doesn't suit you. And keep in touch, okay?

133
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,255
Are you really not going to move? If
you keep this up I'll be calling oppa!

134
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,859
What? Ok then! Call him.

135
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,397
Come on, I'm dying to see him.
Call him, come on!

136
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,832
I'm not scared one bit!

137
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,534
Just move already!

138
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,039
She said to let her go! Are your
ears rotted away, jerks!

139
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,402
Yes, Joo-Jun Young.

140
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,305
-Where are you?
-Well...

141
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,574
These jerks!

142
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,712
You brat! Hey!

143
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,981
I'm going crazy...

144
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,452
If you want to drink, drink nicely!

145
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,990
You're dead.

146
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,700
Hey!

147
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,447
What are you doing? Are
you guys gangsters?

148
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,240
It's not like that. They were
being like this to our Man Ok...

149
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,119
Shut up.

150
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,857
Jang Gook Yeong, Jang Man Ok, get out.

151
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,761
Ah, really. Why for me?

152
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,990
-This brat!
-No!

153
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,803
Why are you calling Gook Young by name
when he's 2 years older than you?

154
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,373
You're not even sorry?

155
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:02,084
Mr. Jang is innocent.

156
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,088
Those punks were the ones
who picked on Man Ok first.

157
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,289
So what?

158
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:11,680
What do you mean so what? It's that...

159
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,595
It's that what?

160
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,905
I'm hurt.

161
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,248
I was scratched here

162
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,418
and I've had some hairs pulled out.

163
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,588
Those guys also hit me here

164
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,591
and now I have a wound here too.

165
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,468
And I can't show you, but I have
a bruise this big on my butt.

166
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,311
I think I might have broken a rib too...

167
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,753
Or is it this one?

168
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,430
That's why you have no right either.

169
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:20,229
You have no right to be by Eul's
side and make her happy either!

170
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,600
Just like me, you...

171
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,270
have no choice but be
Choi Hyeon Joon's son.

172
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:39,014
Excuse me.

173
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,017
Yes? What is it?

174
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,350
Do you know any hospital nearby?

175
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,322
Yes, there's one about 10 minutes away.

176
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,810
This woman seems to be hurt. I'm sorry,
but could you please take her there?

177
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,161
Sure, I will.

178
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:57,333
Go, then. Take care of yourself.

179
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,273
Let's go. Are you badly hurt?

180
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:09,578
No, I'm alright. Sorry.

181
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:55,691
How did you get in here?

182
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,240
You're up. You had a lot to drink
yesterday, didn't you? Want some coffee?

183
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:03,132
What are you doing in
someone's room uninvited?

184
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,835
Your mother told me to
call her when you get up.

185
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,473
Mother, Ji Tae is up.

186
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,941
Just a second.

187
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:22,885
Yes.

188
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,387
Good morning! Have you had
a good night's sleep, son?

189
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:30,559
I eventually assigned the investor's team leader
position I had in mind for you to Jung Eun.

190
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,461
Haven't you heard?

191
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,963
I have.

192
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,235
I was thinking of a position for you, but
it's below Jung Eun's. What do you think?

193
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,172
Yes, I'll be happy to take it.

194
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:51,280
I'm also thinking of giving Jung Eun the position
you had as department leader. Is that okay?

195
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,481
Please do.

196
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,053
That means you need to vacate
the room you're staying in.

197
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,050
That room is not for
lower-level employees' use.

198
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,326
Sure. I'll clear everything up.

199
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,140
Alright. I heard you had a bit too much
to drink yesterday. Do you want some...

200
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,171
I don't care what you'll be doing
to me, but leave Eul alone.

201
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:23,045
If you touch as much as a hair of Eul,
of her brother's or of anyone's near her

202
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,614
I will not let it slide.

203
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,870
You know very well which card I'm
holding in my hands, Mother.

204
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:32,850
Choi Ji Tae!

205
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,357
If you have nothing more
to say, I'll hang up.

206
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:42,364
Congratulations, Department
Head Yoon Jung Eun.

207
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,371
I will be waiting for you to return.

208
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,376
-If you return, I'll...
-That won't happen any time soon. Not at all.

209
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,603
It will get gradually worse.

210
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,674
Excessive pain and headaches

211
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,245
as well as problems
with your motor nerves.

212
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:15,962
I look more like a panda after a night's sleep.

213
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,398
Is there a hospital nearby?

214
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:28,236
This woman seems to be hurt. I'm sorry, but
could you please take her to the hospital?

215
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,173
That cold-hearted jerk...

216
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,396
Hello, I'm the person who
asked for a raw egg earlier.

217
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,400
I'm sorry, but could I
please have another one?

218
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,298
Have you seen the $5 I
dropped around here?

219
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,438
I haven't.

220
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,809
This is the only place
I could've lost it...

221
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,813
Lift your shoes a bit.

222
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,954
Take them off.

223
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,658
Are you sure you haven't
hidden them in your sneakers?

224
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,100
That's weird. Where could it have gone?

225
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,936
This one too.

226
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,024
I don't believe it.

227
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:11,032
They say you're avoiding
me because you're afraid.

228
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:17,339
That you're afraid I might
soil your career or something

229
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,875
but I don't buy that.

230
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:26,615
How could I, when I
know what you're like?

231
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,356
You're not one to run away from me
for such a simple reason. I know it.

232
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,699
What do you know?

233
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,936
How do you know me so well?

234
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,742
I just do.

235
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,178
I know it all.

236
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,849
I even know what you're thinking of now.

237
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,320
I missed you, Eul.

238
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,323
I missed you so much.

239
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,893
It's okay to just say it.

240
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,531
You must live so comfortably.

241
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,036
You could misinterpret
everything and delude yourself.

242
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,775
If it's easier for you to believe that, then
fine, live while thinking you're right.

243
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,345
I missed you too, Sin Jun Young.

244
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:37,886
A lot. Totally. Extremely.

245
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,689
I missed you like crazy.

246
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,727
That's my answer to your thoughts.

247
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,139
See you later.

248
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:04,079
Tomorrow, the day after, and every day.
Let's see each other like crazy.

249
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,693
Did you pull out the radishes
and onions from the field?

250
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,395
Why are you here so late?

251
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,080
What? Is anything wrong?

252
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,632
The boss is really strange.

253
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,270
She brought boiled pork instead of yukgaejang
and booze to someone who asked for water.

254
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,507
A customer asked for a
spoon, she gave a ladle...

255
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,610
What's all this?

256
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,117
-What is it?
-You already bought these things.

257
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,388
Should I call Dr. Jo's office?

258
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,757
To make an appointment for two patients?

259
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,118
What is it, Ok?

260
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,820
What?

261
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,410
You never liked coffee with sugar.

262
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,015
No, I do now. My tastes have changed.

263
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,929
Have you been well?

264
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,233
Of course.

265
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,635
Oppa...

266
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,142
I mean, you did well too,
didn't you, Mr. Congressman?

267
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,910
Why were you at Sin Jun Young's house?

268
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,184
Have you gotten married?

269
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,640
Why did you call me? What is it?

270
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,080
Well, I wouldn't want you to sit around all alone
in the parking lot. Have some tea with us.

271
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,171
Have a seat.

272
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,147
This is his father.

273
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,918
Oh, right.

274
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,222
Hello!

275
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,591
Yes, hello.

276
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,728
I had no idea, so I haven't
greeted you properly.

277
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,874
Honey, what would you like to drink?

278
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,745
Water is fine.

279
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,418
Jun Young is my son.

280
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,792
His dad was really against
him becoming a celebrity

281
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:29,297
so he lived apart from us, but now we should
live together. We're family after all.

282
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,567
Oh, so that was it.

283
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,807
It must be so nice having such
a famous star as your son.

284
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,210
Well, yes...

285
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,419
But... what brought you to our Jun Young's house?

286
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,427
I owe him a lot.

287
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,331
He saved my life.

288
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:11,306
Wow, the world is so small.

289
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,414
Well, he takes a lot after his dad

290
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,318
because he can be so
nosy and meddlesome.

291
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,510
Honey, do you need some hot water?

292
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,126
-No, I...
-Honey...

293
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,590
And? Anything else you know about Jik?

294
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,090
Family, friends, personality,
hobbies, habits, blood type,

295
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:18,339
height, weight, clothes and shoes sizes, I even
told you what lotion he uses, but still more?

296
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,470
Doesn't he have a secret
past or something?

297
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,178
Why do you want to know
someone's secret past?

298
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,685
Is finding out about other people's
background your hobby, Noona?

299
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,887
It's not like that.

300
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,358
So your name is No Jik, not Oh Jik.

301
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,494
So that No PD is really...

302
00:39:41,662 --> 00:39:44,832
Is PD No Eul your sister?

303
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,405
From now on, if you say one more thing
about me or my sister, you're dead meat.

304
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,440
How much do their meals cost?

305
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,850
Why are you paying for that? I
treated your friends after all.

306
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:05,070
That's right, this girl is interested in
you so she bribed us for some information.

307
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,623
-Ma'am, don't they suit each other?
-This Noona apparently has a ton of money!

308
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,161
Date, date, date!

309
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,229
I asked you how much does it cost!

310
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,599
Do you even have the money?
I told you I'm paying.

311
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,404
Let go. Why would you
pay for my friends?

312
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,539
Noona...

313
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,376
-Really?
-Yes!

314
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,381
You're saying she's out of it?

315
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,952
The doctors say she's fine, but
she can't remember anything.

316
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:43,524
She doesn't remember who she is or where her house
is and she won't come to the police station either.

317
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,325
Her phone?

318
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:48,262
I think she lost it, I tried to
find it but it wasn't there. What should we do?

319
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,640
Hi. Do you remember me?

320
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,709
What about him?

321
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,479
-No.
-What's your name?

322
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,690
-Elsa.
-Whats our country's capital?

323
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,749
-San Francisco.
-What year is it?

324
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,885
Sometime in the Silla period?

325
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,689
-What is this?
-A cow!

326
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:16,858
Follow me.

327
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,331
I don't think she has amnesia,
but she's definitely crazy.

328
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,536
-So what should we do?
-She's crazy about you.

329
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:34,942
She's crazy about you, she wants to spend more time
with you. She's a crazy girl pretending to be nuts.

330
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,580
She must have not studied at all
and read tons of comics instead.

331
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,985
That method comes out in
"Queen of Hitting on Men 13."

332
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,355
What does she take me for...

333
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,390
-What?
-Well,

334
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,895
what does she see in me that she feels
the need to pretend to be crazy?

335
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,899
I think she's so popular among guys.

336
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,700
She's cute.

337
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,537
That's why she's crazy!

338
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,308
Jik! What are you going to do?

339
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,282
"My Jik's favourite
girl group is GFRIEND."

340
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,318
"Favourite movie, A Murderous Memory ."

341
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,322
"Karaoke song: Number 18, Let's Ride a Horse.
Favorite chicken area, chicken breast."

342
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,024
This is all wrong.

343
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:28,710
Except for family and height, it's all
wrong. My favourite girl group is Fin.K.L.

344
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,699
Movie I like is Memories of Murder,
not A Murderous Memory.

345
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:34,068
Number 18 at karaoke is What's Wrong With My Age.

346
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,071
And my favourite chicken
area is drumsticks.

347
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,547
Stop asking my friends all this
stuff and just ask me directly.

348
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,483
I'll tell you everything.

349
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,619
Jik...

350
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,074
Hello.

351
00:43:13,074 --> 00:43:17,080
Seo Yoon Woo is on standby already and waiting.
What are you doing, why aren't you coming out yet?

352
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,346
Oh, about that...

353
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:38,499
What are you trying to do right now?
Broadcasting must be easy?

354
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,402
It's easy making money working
in broadcasting, right?

355
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,139
Have you even got a brain?

356
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,377
Why does the VJ for the
Makings Of look like this?

357
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,146
About that...

358
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,349
I had some personal issues...

359
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,385
Why is a camerawoman

360
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,021
wearing those sunglasses anyway?

361
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,024
Do you think you're some actress?

362
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,328
I'm sorry.

363
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,932
You're such a mess.

364
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:17,638
Are you kidding? Did you come
here to work or to fight?

365
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,309
You're the one who hit the PD, punk!
Making her eye swell up like that!

366
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,245
Hyung.

367
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,390
I'm very sorry.

368
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,593
We'll make sure this
doesn't happen again.

369
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,862
What are you doing? Beg for forgiveness.

370
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,732
I apologize.

371
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,469
-I will take caution...
-Forget that.

372
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,780
-Go home.
-But sir...

373
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,911
Slippers and what's with your outfit?

374
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:04,452
When have you washed these clothes?

375
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,989
Geez, so dirty...

376
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,160
It stinks of kimchi all
the way up to here!

377
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,039
-Don't you understand? Go home!
-Mr. Seo...

378
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:34,348
A camerawoman is just supposed to film. Do
I have to present myself cleanly as well?

379
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,884
It's not like I'm even
going to sleep with you.

380
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,086
-What did you say?
-Hey, No Eul!

381
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,625
-Wow, this woman is crazy...
-I'm totally sane.

382
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,595
This is why everyone
calls you a pervert.

383
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:53,300
It's okay to not wash up or wear dirty
clothes. It's not like I'm stained with poop.

384
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,337
Hey, piss off. Piss off already!

385
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,840
You don't even know your place and...

386
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:02,309
Oh, I get it!

387
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,646
This is why Sin Jun Young
fired you, isn't it?

388
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,850
Hey! If you knew she was a hobo,
working as my camerawoman,

389
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,153
you should have let me know
of trash like this beforehand!

390
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,631
I didn't know, that PD No came
to you as your camerawoman.

391
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,667
If I did, I would've
told you, obviously.

392
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:33,908
No Eul?

393
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:41,816
Your business here is over. I'll make sure no
one will want to hire you, so be prepared.

394
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,280
-Mister.
-Yes.

395
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:49,360
You're the same. How dare you stick
me up with this tacky person?

396
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:53,427
-Do you want your business to go bankrupt?
-No, of course not, sir...

397
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,565
Hey, No Eul!

398
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,335
No Eul! How can you leave like that!

399
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,330
No Eul!

400
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,037
Why are you here? Aren't you
supposed to be filming?

401
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:41,575
I got fired.

402
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:48,115
I'm sorry, you tried
hard to get me hired.

403
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,419
Want some tea?

404
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,737
You were fired too, right?

405
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,040
I heard the team leader changed.
To the woman we saw yesterday.

406
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,809
It's the woman I almost got engaged to.

407
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,447
You almost got engaged to her?

408
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,320
On the day of the engagement
ceremony, I didn't go there

409
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,322
but went to see you instead.

410
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:43,237
Do you like Sin Jun Young that much?

411
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:49,343
-Please don't meddle in someone else's life.
-Even when you're hurting so much,

412
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,147
you keep wanting him, why is that?

413
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,615
Do you have no pride?

414
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,451
You're like that too.

415
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,956
When you could've gotten engaged
to such a woman, and got hurt,

416
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:05,459
why do you keep being interested in me?

417
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:08,195
Do you have no pride?

418
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,666
It's not pride. I'm clever.

419
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,871
If I wait for long enough.

420
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,809
I know that you will
come my way eventually.

421
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,015
That won't happen.

422
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,385
We could never be together.

423
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,587
You know it better than I do.

424
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:38,692
Nothing's set in stone. You never know.

425
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:47,368
Should we go to Seoul as a pair of
rejects? We could even have a date.

426
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,273
Where are you going?

427
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,210
I'm not going to be Sin Jun
Young's manager anymore. I'm done!

428
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,611
Are you crazy?

429
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:03,217
He just watched PD No Eul get unfairly treated and
he knew that she got hurt trying to protect you

430
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,818
but he was all "I didn't know,

431
00:50:04,952 --> 00:50:09,490
if I knew she was going to be your camerawoman I
would have said something..." How can he say that?

432
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,326
Even if I have to clean plates
all my life with my dad

433
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,797
it's better than working under
such a low-life. I quit.

434
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,330
Stop right there. If
you move, I'll shoot.

435
00:50:41,388 --> 00:50:44,391
I don't want to. I'm going to move.

436
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,695
Hey. Hey.

437
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:53,100
Shoot. Shoot. Hey.

438
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:57,571
You should get rid of trash
like me quickly. Shoot.

439
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,008
Hurry up and shoot! Hurry and shoot!

440
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:06,647
Lee Myung Taek! You killed innocent people
like it's a joke. Tell me who you killed!

441
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,515
Hurry up and tell me!

442
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,230
Hey, why are you hitting me?

443
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,033
This isn't the scene where
Jun Young hits him.

444
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:29,150
Hey! Wait a minute! Stop!

445
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,338
Hey, someone stop Jun Young!

446
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:32,940
Cut!

447
00:51:58,132 --> 00:52:02,202
Excuse me. Can you give me a few
plastic bags? To put in wet clothes.

448
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,804
Just a moment.

449
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,107
Please give us our keys.

450
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,010
Did you finish filming already?

451
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,245
You said you're taping into the night.

452
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,014
There's been an accident. The
filming has been canceled.

453
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,429
I misunderstood the acting
sequence as me hitting Yoon Woo.

454
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:32,699
Yoon Woo is throwing a fit saying
he'll sue you, Sin Jun Young.

455
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:35,090
The director is trying
to talk him out of it.

456
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,336
Tell him to sue me.

457
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,408
I hit someone. I should pay the price.

458
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:49,016
Mr. Sin Jun Young!

459
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,825
Wait.

460
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:09,603
Before the reporters find out and things get
bigger, you should apologize, Mr. Sin Jun Young.

461
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,708
Mr. Sin Jun Young.

462
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,711
Yoon Woo hyung made a mistake
like this before with me.

463
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,915
He broke my nose back then.

464
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,186
He didn't apologize to me either.

465
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:36,980
He said, "While an actor is filming,
things like this happen all the time."

466
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:40,267
It was so difficult to get this movie
going. Should we cancel this movie then?

467
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,360
Cancel it. I have nothing to lose.

468
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:49,676
I'm frustrated.

469
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,413
This movie... it's my first
project as a team leader.

470
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,899
Which hospital did you say?

471
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,651
I'm sorry. Forgive me, Hyung.

472
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:33,680
-I don't want to.
-Yoon Woo.

473
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,410
I'm sorry. I was so out of it that
I misread the acting sequence.

474
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:43,300
I heard you've made mistakes like this before.
He's apologizing to you. Please accept it.

475
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:47,534
jerk did it on purpose to screw me over.

476
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:53,140
No way. Why would I beat you up
on purpose? I like you so much.

477
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:56,209
-Kneel then.
-Yoon Woo.

478
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,746
I'll forgive you if you
kneel in front of me.

479
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,550
Why? You can't do that?

480
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,788
Seo Yoon Woo. You're so bad.
What's wrong with you?

481
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:15,929
I'll just kneel.

482
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,132
I can just kneel in his place, right?

483
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:39,586
Forgive me, Hyung. Forgive me
generously and let's get along...

484
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,588
and let's make this movie.

485
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,925
You did that for me, right?

486
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:26,790
Seo Yoon Woo. You beat him up
for me, right? To revenge me?

487
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,905
Your Princess Syndrome is
more serious than I thought.

488
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,384
It's true. You did it because of me.

489
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,686
If you care for me so much,
why do you pretend not to?

490
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,588
Why do you continue to be mean to me?

491
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:02,002
I couldn't sleep since last night.
I'm going to sleep.

492
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,771
Will you leave?

493
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:10,477
If you're trying to tease me, continue.

494
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,860
No matter how mean you are
to me, I won't get hurt.

495
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:18,051
I won't be disappointed or misunderstand
you. Continue on all you want.

496
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:36,102
Do you want to sleep with me?

497
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,551
If you don't want to sleep
with me, tell me now.

498
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,455
I'll open the door for you.

499
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,860
Take this and return my
Ji Tae to his fiancé.

500
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,200
You and Choi Ji Tae both.
Aren't you both crazy?

501
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,320
How could you both fall
for substandard girl...

502
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:56,016
Are you crazy? Why won't
you go to college?

503
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,518
I'm sorry, but would
you drive me please?

504
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,640
I sold you out at 1
billion won, Ahjussi.

505
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:01,930
Who says you can sell me?

506
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,258
What is it you want to protect being
destroyed like this, Choi Ji Tae?

507
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:09,262
I know I'm no match for this fight.
Who cares if I receive some money?

508
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:14,134
The reason Eul and I can't be together. I can't
remember suddenly. I told you everything, Mom.

509
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,310
Do you know what the world is like?

510
00:59:16,436 --> 00:59:19,020
I feel so sorry for my Jun Young.
What am I going to do, Oppa?

511
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,942
He can't even love someone he loves.

512
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:26,046
If I become even more cruel,
would you give up then?

513
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:31,518
Should I just forget about everything and
live the way I want to before I die?

514
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,453
If you're that sorry, just die.

515
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:35,989
Get out and die!
