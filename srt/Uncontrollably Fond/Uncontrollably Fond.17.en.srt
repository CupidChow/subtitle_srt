00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,480
=Episode 17=

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,555
Pororo!

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,026
Pororo!

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,843
Hyung! Did you take Pororo?

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,813
No matter how much I look
for him, I can't find him.

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,918
You just sent Pororo off to the
countryside, to live on a farm.

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,889
When did I? When did I
ever send Pororo...

8
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,858
My doctor had warned me.

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,740
As my illness worsens,
it can affect my memory.

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,897
Oh, that's right.

11
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,568
I did send him.

12
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,805
-What does "statute of limitation, 13th" mean?
-What?

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,409
On my phone, I got a notification that said
"statute of limitation, 13th." What does it mean?

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,380
Why are you asking me such a thing?
How would I know, you punk?

15
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,988
No, that would never happen.

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,228
I said God won't be that cruel
and ignored my doctor's warning.

17
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,109
I took off the engagement ring.

18
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,780
Can I come in now?

19
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,133
But beyond question, God
didn't forget to be cruel.

20
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,104
Only to me and Eul.

21
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,278
Aren't you satisfied to see me?

22
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,916
Why are you looking at me like that as if
you were a person who doesn't know me?

23
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,334
Who is the criminal behind the hit and run case
of Eul's father that Choi Hyeon Joon covered up?

24
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,908
It's Daehan First Party's Chairman Yoon Seong
Woo's one and only daughter, Yoon Jeong Eun.

25
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,710
I will give up on Ji Tae.

26
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,940
Mother, please you should give up too.

27
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,920
No matter what I do, Ji Tae
won't come back to me...

28
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,721
It's too late.

29
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,325
There is no evidence or any witness.

30
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,528
There's no way to catch
the culprit lawfully.

31
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,197
Have you sobered up?

32
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,667
Let go!

33
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,969
Let go of me, you scumbag!

34
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,470
Let's have the next kiss without
you wearing that engagement ring.

35
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,708
I'm not understanding or shallow enough

36
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,213
to warmly welcome a woman who is
still wearing her engagement ring.

37
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,550
So, I'll catch the culprit somehow.
So you people, just watch me.

38
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,028
You came sooner than I thought,
Director Yoon Jeong Eun.

39
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,733
I haven't had dinner yet.

40
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,037
-Will you be able to make some ramyun?
-Sure.

41
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:53,683
So, I decided to be even more
cruel than the cruel God.

42
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,608
Shall we kiss?

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
Officially.

44
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,403
More than the wound I gave her, I
hope I'm sick a thousand times more.

45
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,676
More than the pain I caused her, I hope
I'm a ten thousand times more in agony.

46
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,321
You know, right? You know the
man Jeong Eun is seeing?

47
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:07,123
I don't know.

48
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,292
Ji Tae!

49
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,095
I said I don't know.

50
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,910
Long time ago... it tastes just like
when I used to eat after fishing.

51
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:31,948
I have good fortune
when it comes to food.

52
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:37,020
Here, let's drink this...

53
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:41,057
And let's end all ties between
our families right here.

54
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,320
Chairman.

55
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,934
No matter how hard I try to grill, boil, and fry
the media, people with ears all know already.

56
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,538
The fact that my Jeong Eun got stood up
at her engagement party by her fiancé.

57
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,740
It's tiring to make excuses
about it with everyone I meet.

58
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,079
I'm ashamed.

59
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,183
The secretary general position you were
supposed to take over, Assemblyman Choi...

60
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,787
I think I'll hand it over
to Assemblyman Baek.

61
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,570
It's only been five years
since you came into politics.

62
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:17,994
Think about it. Putting a five year old
to take charge of the family affairs...

63
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,666
Just between the two of us... it
never made sense to begin with.

64
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,610
But still, you had already
spitted those words out.

65
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,220
It's unfortunate, but I don't think I can
help you out either, Chairwoman Lee.

66
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,390
What do you mean by saying that?

67
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,647
Various national projects that
will be implemented next year...

68
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:43,019
Wake up from your dream of KJ
Construction receiving the project.

69
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:52,829
Who is the woman you chose
after dumping my Jeong Eun?

70
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,168
Actually, I'm asking
from pure curiosity.

71
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,442
Speaking of Jeong Eun... why did
she go to a jerk like that?

72
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,411
Honestly, for my curiosity.

73
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,490
What... another guy?

74
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,985
You must've not have known,
Representative. Jeong Eun has a man.

75
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,730
Even today, she left our house
and went straight to that man.

76
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,490
Honey.

77
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,892
Do you have any evidence?

78
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,208
Who is this man?

79
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,349
He's Sin Jun Young. He's a celebrity.

80
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:23,887
-What's this?
-You can take it.

81
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,040
-Is this a present?
-No, it's not.

82
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,091
It's not a present.

83
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,193
I found it on the street.

84
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,810
-It's new.
-I know. Someone must be very rich.

85
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,599
Throwing away a new hat.

86
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,890
I don't want to wear something someone
threw away. Give it to someone else.

87
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,670
No one threw it away.

88
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,441
-Then Oppa, did you buy it?
-Yes.

89
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,410
-To give it to me?
-Yes.

90
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,947
So, wear it nicely.

91
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,320
-Oppa, do you really like me?
-Yes.

92
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,058
No. Am I crazy?

93
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:11,501
Oh? That unni... isn't that the woman who
was flirting with me asking me to date her?

94
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,730
What are you doing here?

95
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,879
I just happened to
come all the way here.

96
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,684
Just ignore me and go. I'm sorry.

97
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,188
If you want to change Jun Young's heart,
you should sprawl in front of his house.

98
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,820
No matter how much you whine here,
it's no use. You're just upsetting Ok.

99
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:38,061
I know.

100
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,432
I think I'm not in my
right mind right now.

101
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,620
I'm sorry for intruding like this.

102
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,750
If you're sorry, you shouldn't behave this way. If
you continue, my kind hearted Ok will struggle.

103
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
-Oppa.
-What?

104
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,810
Why don't you go on your way?

105
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,924
Are you crying?

106
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,058
No.

107
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,570
I'm so breathless, the
tears won't come out.

108
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,136
What's wrong? Tell me.

109
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,409
Are you being like this
because you want food?

110
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,412
-No.
-Good.

111
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,251
We closed, and we're out of yukgaejang.

112
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,789
Do you want to come to my house?

113
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,174
But why was No Eul in
front of your house?

114
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,842
I don't know.

115
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,879
She must have no pride.

116
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,116
How can she keep coming even though
she's being so firmly rejected?

117
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,087
Do I need to explain how a puppy feels?

118
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,956
-No.
-Let's stop talking about her.

119
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,530
Who is it, at night?

120
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,532
Is it No Eul?

121
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,609
This is Mr. Yoon Seong Ho's aide.
Is this Sin Jun Young's house?

122
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:41,117
Mr. Yoon wants to see you.

123
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,125
-I'll be back.
-I think my dad knows you're seeing me.

124
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,810
Don't go. My dad is scary.

125
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,420
It's fine. I'll explain.

126
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,101
This is not something you can fix!

127
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,760
I'll explain it to him.

128
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,743
I'll fix this and come back to you.
Leave it to me.

129
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,581
I love you.

130
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,284
You might not believe this but...

131
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,256
I really love you.

132
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,466
That's good, then.

133
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,171
Don't be late. If you run too late...

134
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,408
I'll have to come there.

135
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,021
I told you I'll give you
food, so why make ramen?

136
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,393
Someone said they'd be
making ramen for Jun Young.

137
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,164
That's why I felt like having
ramen all of a sudden.

138
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,820
No but... did someone tell Jun Young
that she would do ramyun for him?

139
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,460
Yes, some woman did.

140
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,372
A woman? He's dating someone?

141
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,274
Looks like it.

142
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,142
Crazy punk.

143
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,978
Who is that woman?

144
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,085
A really cool woman.

145
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,000
She's super rich, has loads of
connections, and she's really hot.

146
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,233
She's smart too. She's like a goddess that
I can't even dare to compare myself to.

147
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,372
I'm suddenly feeling
sick to the stomach.

148
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,374
Geez!

149
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,244
I brought this for me to drink it!

150
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,314
Did I just drink?

151
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,184
Heol, I really did.

152
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,830
You thought it was water?

153
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,026
Yes! I can't drink!

154
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,764
I'm going to get in trouble again!

155
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,501
Hey!

156
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,804
Yes?

157
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,442
Let's have a drink together, then.

158
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,210
Come on, try and cause trouble.

159
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,980
I want to see just how bad you can be.

160
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,024
When, how and where...

161
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,765
I don't know how much longer I'll be able
to remember this, so I'm making this video.

162
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,174
My mother, Sin Young Ok.

163
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,445
She has a yukgaejang place.

164
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,418
Her level of education: middle school.

165
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,256
She gave birth to me and
raised me on her own.

166
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,660
My dad...

167
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,565
is gone.

168
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,103
He was always gone.

169
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:22,209
My dad is Choi Hyeon Joon. Former prosecutor,
now congressman. He doesn't know about me.

170
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:33,275
When he was a prosecutor, he covered
up a hit-and-run case, and...

171
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,956
Oh! What made you call me?

172
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:51,193
If you miss me, I'll come running.

173
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,350
Did you say the legs
from the chair broke?

174
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,160
Is there anything else
you want me to do?

175
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,790
The chair... what about the washing
machine? Does it work well?

176
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:23,192
I'm not sure if your drain
is already clogged.

177
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,960
Eul is in your room.

178
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,599
You said the chair was broken.

179
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,069
I didn't think you'd come
if I told you Eul was here.

180
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,038
-Mom...
-Are you dating someone?

181
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,676
You were willing to die for this girl
and now you're seeing someone else?

182
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,412
If you really love No Eul, then
why are you seeing someone...

183
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,680
Mom!

184
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:52,721
What? Are you looking down on her because she
doesn't have rich parents or connections?

185
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,057
Is your mom pitiful then?

186
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,161
Eul's asleep.

187
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,935
She couldn't sleep for the past 4
days, so I had a drink with her.

188
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,776
She insisted that she becomes a wreck when she's
drunk, but she just kept quiet and fell asleep.

189
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,980
I told her I wanted to see
just how bad she is, but...

190
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,455
I have to go, something came up.

191
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,091
I'll be back, so just stay at home.

192
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,028
-Mom!
-What if she wakes up and really goes mad?

193
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,308
I'm going to the spa with the
ahjummas in our strip mall.

194
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,846
If it gets late, I'll sleep over,
so you go home by yourself.

195
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,933
Where am I?

196
00:23:26,658 --> 00:23:30,201
(Only strong-willed people can succeed. Failure
results from little efforts rather than lack in time.)

197
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:35,893
(Books in law)

198
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:45,529
(Don't leave today's matter to tomorrow. Sin Jun Young,
Department of Law, Seoul National University)

199
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,430
(I have to do it.
So I can do it.)

200
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:18,347
(Any witness of red sports car hit-and-run accident
with the plate of 3GA3126, please call the victim's family)

201
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:28,037
(The drive is a female. With a reward)

202
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:33,090
(No Eul:  010 3691 0115
Sin Jun Young: 010 7664 4389)

203
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,865
Have you slept well?
What about Jun Young?

204
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,900
Was Jun Young here?

205
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,940
Since you're my guest, I'll make you
some hangover soup. Just wait a minute.

206
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,220
-Jun Young did all he could.
-Excuse me?

207
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,484
The law school he got into
after so much struggle,

208
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,623
the bar exam that he passed
after working so hard,

209
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,393
he gave them all up.

210
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,498
That's right.

211
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,570
My Jun Young doesn't take after his parents.
He's got conscience and appropriate.

212
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,373
So don't resent him.

213
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,343
If you keep badmouthing and hating
him, you're a bad person too.

214
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,215
Wash up. You've got sleep in your eyes.

215
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,322
But... was Jun Young really here?

216
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,176
The view outside is very nice. Can
we talk outside for a minute?

217
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,958
What's your plan?

218
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,001
You blackmailed me with that USB

219
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,639
and I'm sure you knew that Jung Eun was
going to become my daughter-in-law.

220
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:33,241
You keep doing these
unacceptable things...

221
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,378
What do you want?

222
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,714
I want fairness.

223
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,290
Build social welfare state.

224
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,819
-Stop playing with words.
-I'm not playing.

225
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,658
I...

226
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,997
I'm a man who would have no problem trampling
all over someone like you, Sin Jun Young.

227
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,666
Are you blackmailing me?

228
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,550
You were the first to do it.

229
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,471
Realize a just society and...

230
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,807
Build a social welfare state.
Is that a threat?

231
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,112
That's what politicians like you say
every time you open your mouth.

232
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,050
-So are you going to keep doing this dirty
rebellious stuff?  -You were the first

233
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,085
to start doing these dirty deeds.

234
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,055
Have you already forgotten

235
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,228
what you've done while you were a
prosecutor, supposed to protect the law?

236
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:32,367
If screwing my life is what
you're aiming for, attack me.

237
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,906
Leave my wife and kids out
of it and come at me!

238
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,109
No.

239
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,415
Your family needs to suffer too.

240
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,750
After all, having someone
like you as a husband

241
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,553
or as a father

242
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,422
is a huge fault.

243
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,391
I'm warning you again.

244
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:02,431
Destroying a punk like you is as
easy as one-two-three for me.

245
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,700
Stop it while I'm being nice.

246
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,403
Don't mess with anything of mine.

247
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,611
I'd like to give you a
piece of advice too.

248
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,416
Stop giving me warnings
and just destroy me.

249
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,187
I'm going to put all that's
left of my life on the line

250
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,558
and become a huge pain
in the neck for you.

251
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,296
Go ahead and break me
before I break you.

252
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,201
Before I become more of a jerk.

253
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,880
Just you wait. I'll go
to Jun Young soon.

254
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,349
Give me my phone.

255
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,190
Just because your wedding was called
off, did you decide to live recklessly?

256
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,970
No. I've lived recklessly until now, but I'm
finally going to start to get my life together.

257
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,170
Even if you're so immature, of all people,
you had to pick a celebrity or whatever?

258
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,767
He's the one that I love.

259
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,550
What?

260
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,736
He's the one that makes me happy.

261
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,344
What time is the earliest
flight to the States?

262
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,580
I'm going to send Jung
Eun over there today.

263
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,515
Dad!

264
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,817
Okay. Get things ready.

265
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,710
You're leaving today. Don't you even
think of returning before I call.

266
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,680
I don't want to! I'm not going!

267
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:40,262
You are! You're not able to
judge properly right now.

268
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,798
Just like 10 years ago.

269
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,803
Come in.

270
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,640
Mr. Choi Ji Tae is here.

271
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,778
Tell him to come in.

272
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,093
Can I have a word with Jung Eun?

273
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,840
I know I have no right
to say this to you...

274
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:29,750
If you know, then don't.

275
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,714
Find another man. Someone
other than Sin Jun Young.

276
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,318
Yoon Jung Eun, there are many great
men who'd come running to you.

277
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,155
What if I'll just ignore them and stick
with Jun Young, who I like best?

278
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,292
Thanks to Sin Jun Young, I even
find it hard to remember you.

279
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,200
Will you step aside? I have to put
on a suicide show or something.

280
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,070
Saying if he tries to get me away from Sin Jun
Young, I'll kill myself in front of my father.

281
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,138
Sin Jun Young

282
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,345
is pursuing you because
he has something in mind.

283
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,130
-What?
-It's not because he is interested in you...

284
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,020
Ji Tae.

285
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:12,754
He wants to get revenge on my dad.

286
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,303
Yes, sunbae.

287
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,806
Now?

288
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,780
Who did you say was the chick
that keeps hitting on Jik?

289
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,282
The daughter of the guy who owns
the rib place across the street.

290
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,021
Honestly, if things go well with her,
Jik can eat all the ribs he wants

291
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,830
and she's the owner's only daughter

292
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,310
so if she inherits her family's
business... Wow, Jik would be so lucky.

293
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,432
I'm about to get really
honest right now...

294
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:36,304
I was afraid Jik might feel embarrassed, so
that's why I didn't bring it up earlier,

295
00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:42,160
but if things work out between us, eating ribs
won't be a problem. I can get entire cows for him,

296
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,479
and if I just tell my mom, she
can give him a building...

297
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:48,883
Ok, I know you're delusional, but Jik
really needs to meet a rich girl.

298
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:52,387
He's had such a hard life
because his family was poor

299
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,740
so he has to find his
luck with a rich woman.

300
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,024
I know!

301
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,495
If things work out with me, he can totally
benefit from a woman and live in lap of luxury.

302
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,498
Actually, I...

303
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,638
I'm the heiress of KJ Group.

304
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,560
Wow, that's amazing!

305
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:19,180
Told you! I didn't want to
throw you off like that, so...

306
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,950
If you're the KJ Group heiress,
then I'm an oil magnate.

307
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,086
Yeah, I knew you wouldn't believe me.

308
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,196
This is my mom, and this is my dad.
You've seen them on TV, right?

309
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,731
Do you believe me now?

310
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,604
Don't be too shocked.

311
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,742
You can just treat me the
same way you did until now.

312
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:48,843
Go away.

313
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,479
Hey, chaebols are people too.

314
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,810
We eat when we're hungry, drink water
when thirsty, go to the toilet if we...

315
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,520
Erase Jik's number right now, and don't you dare
call Jik, send messages to him or talk to him on SNS.

316
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,480
Why are you being like this? You
said you wanted him to marry rich!

317
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,027
Not you. Even if I die,
he can't be with you.

318
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,910
Get out, now.

319
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,120
I don't want to! No! Why are
you being like this! No!

320
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,270
-Get out now!
-I don't want to!

321
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
I'm not going.

322
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,200
Why won't you listen to me?

323
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,007
Ha Roo.

324
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,747
Jik! Unni Na Ri says we two
can never be together.

325
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,349
No Jik. Cut off all ties with Ha Roo.

326
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,517
Why, all of a sudden?

327
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,887
I know, right? What's wrong with you?

328
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,550
You're not even his real sister.

329
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,926
If I was his real sister,
you'd be bald by now!

330
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,362
Finish things before your
sister finds out. Now!

331
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,135
What's with her? Who
is she to break us up?

332
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,705
I'm already having such a hard
time because of my family...

333
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,680
Why is she like this?

334
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,145
I'm not going to break up
with you, don't worry.

335
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,480
What?

336
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:13,228
No matter what Na Ri or my sister say, I
won't break up with you, so don't worry.

337
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,662
Really?

338
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,930
So stop crying.

339
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,337
You can't let go of me, okay?

340
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,407
That rib place girl is no match for me.

341
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,620
But Jik...

342
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,981
-Yeah?
-Did you just hug me?

343
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,250
Very tightly.

344
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,180
So just stop crying.

345
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,700
I don't know what to do
if you're like this.

346
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,565
No. I'll keep crying.

347
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,910
I'm going to cry all day.

348
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,638
Why is Na Ri noona being
like this, really?

349
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,486
Sin Jun Young has an ulterior
motive for pursuing you.

350
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,930
It's not that he's interested in you. He
just wants to take revenge on my dad.

351
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,978
I heard something
unbelievable from Ji Tae.

352
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,750
But if you deny it, then
I will believe you.

353
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,660
You need to deny it. Tell me
that Choi Ji Tae is lying.

354
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,359
We haven't met by chance.

355
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,632
I've been watching over you for a while.

356
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,637
I have an ulterior motive. I want to screw
the life of the father who abandoned me.

357
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,809
The unbelievable thing Choi
Ji Tae told you is true.

358
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,781
This puts me in a very
uncomfortable position.

359
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,620
I was certain you would deny it and that
it would be just a ridiculous statement.

360
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,187
You can run away now.

361
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,927
I don't know that story I'll come with to
deceive you and try to hang on to you.

362
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:04,666
Run away and never look
back, Yoon Jung Eun.

363
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,208
How can you put your straw anywhere you want
to any time? Don't you have any self-respect?

364
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,740
What's self-respect? Do they
sell it at the supermarket?

365
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,140
If you come to the set to film
the documentary one more time,

366
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,551
the guy from Sin Jun Young's company
said he'd destroy your career!

367
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,800
Should I get plastic surgery? So
that no one can tell it's me.

368
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,991
Geez, you're such a leech.

369
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:37,732
Yes, this is Yoon Joon Woo. Who is this?

370
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,300
Sin Jun Young?

371
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,705
How come you're calling me yourself?

372
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,776
Yes. Oh, yes. Okay, I understand.

373
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,780
What did he say?

374
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,784
He said that he wants you to come
instead of me for tonight's shoot.

375
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,355
You saw it too! He called me himself!

376
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,193
He keeps changing his mind...
is he kidding me or what?

377
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:34,655
Why don't you straighten up your face? If
you don't want to hear me, just leave.

378
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:43,865
I haven't quite got the feel yet.
What are we shooting today?

379
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,402
My first thing on the bucket list.

380
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,575
Today, I'm going to propose
to the woman I love.

381
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,413
In front of the camera, I'm
going to propose to her.

382
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,140
Are you really not
going to the hospital?

383
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,987
It's a very important day
to me, so let's cooperate.

384
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,758
If you're going to keep filming with
that expression, I'll call PD Yoon.

385
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,328
-Should I?
-What's wrong with my expression?

386
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,466
Is this okay?

387
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:27,275
But who are you going to propose to?

388
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,078
Who, you ask?

389
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,919
Can't you smile a bit?

390
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,327
KJ Group's director, Yoon Jung Eun.

391
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:54,202
I'll go drink some water and come back.

392
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,661
So cruel.

393
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,565
He's proposing to another woman and...

394
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:28,936
how can he ask me of all
people to film that?

395
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,005
This jerk...

396
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,762
Hello, CEO Lee Eun Soo.

397
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,198
This is Sin Jun Young.

398
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,371
No matter what will happen,
I will be with Jung Eun.

399
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,175
I will start taking away

400
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,379
all the things that you want

401
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,981
one by one.

402
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,343
-Hello?
-Have you had a nice talk with Sin Jun Young?

403
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,590
If you're done with him, just come back.

404
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,919
Come back and let's go ahead
with your marriage to Ji Tae.

405
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,625
I don't love Ji Tae anymore.

406
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,427
Do you think marriage
needs to be about love?

407
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,095
I'll hang up.

408
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:06,634
Ten years ago, when you hit
someone with your car and fleed,

409
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,339
there was CCTV on that street
that recorded everything.

410
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,680
I thought I should get rid of it, but
then I thought it might prove useful...

411
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:15,843
You're lying.

412
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,981
If you don't believe me, come see it.

413
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,418
If that video is revealed, I'm
not the only one going down.

414
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,524
-Congressman Choi too...
-Sure, it'll be revealed, he helped a monster.

415
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,528
But between the big shot
whose daughter is a criminal

416
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,767
and the prosecutor who was forced to cover
it up and place the blame on someone else...

417
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,405
Who do you think will
be more disadvantaged?

418
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,810
Come back, Jung Eun. I'm waiting.

419
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:07,962
Haven't you run away yet?

420
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,398
What is your final goal?

421
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,236
If I hadn't found out, how
far were you willing to go?

422
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,104
Marrying you.

423
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:24,412
I wanted to steal what my father had
been protecting and cared for so much.

424
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:29,950
You were willing to marry someone you didn't love
just because you wanted to spite your father?

425
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,786
Feelings always change.

426
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:36,257
Just like you came to me when you
wanted to take revenge on Choi Ji Tae

427
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,393
and ended up falling for me,

428
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,263
even now, when you know
you've been deceived.

429
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,801
Stop lingering and just run already.

430
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,208
You're a player indeed.

431
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,013
You know women all too well.

432
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,516
Let's go.

433
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,854
It seems like your goal and mine

434
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:09,223
are pretty much the same anyway.

435
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:15,996
Let's go together. We'll talk about
forgiving and forgetting later.

436
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,451
I'm sorry I'm late. I've been
caught up with some stuff.

437
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,721
Can this really be aired?

438
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:46,560
I don't know. You never know
what our PD will edit out.

439
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,005
Should I get a different PD?

440
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,977
No, it's okay. I really like this one.

441
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:09,450
Hello. I'm Producer No Eul.

442
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,121
We've got a special relationship,
haven't we? Please film us well.

443
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:17,458
If I look bad, feel free
to fix it in Photoshop.

444
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,092
Hyun Woo?

445
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:58,098
Oh, it's you! It's really you!

446
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,834
Have you been well?

447
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,337
I don't know. I don't!

448
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:08,360
Do you know that I felt myself growing
older with each day that you weren't here?

449
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,476
I was a bit busy.

450
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:13,080
Oh, but what's wrong with you?

451
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,350
Why are you so cool?
You're just my type!

452
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,152
What do you think I am like?

453
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,121
Handsome, cool,

454
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,757
-sexy...
-I...

455
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,428
am very rational,

456
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,564
calculative,

457
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,436
fair and good, or so I thought.

458
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:39,840
That's a bit tricky. I don't
really know you that well.

459
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,509
So let's meet more often.

460
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,512
Call me over at your place too.

461
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:49,483
Ji Tae, we're in trouble.

462
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:53,354
You've got the wrong person.
His name is Hyun Woo.

463
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,823
A gossip article on Sin
Jun Young just got posted.

464
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:08,602
This can't be.

465
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,604
Unbelievable!

466
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,941
This is really about our Jun Young?

467
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,478
-Yeah, 100%.
-I can't believe this.

468
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,214
I got you two!

469
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:24,084
How dare you waste time
with dating at work?

470
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,021
It's not that. Something
big's going on, oppa.

471
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,790
Why? Did you get caught
posting mean comments?

472
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:34,061
I'm so glad. Mean commenter
like you should get caught...

473
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,650
What's this? Is A Jun Young?

474
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,267
-Yeah.
-This is fake, right?

475
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,637
Are you messing with me? These...

476
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,140
What did Jun Young...

477
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,947
You shut up and do your job.

478
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,460
Go talk to Jun Young.

479
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,085
-Father, did you read this?
-Yes, I did.

480
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:03,220
And you... call your CEO and tell him
to find out what's going on quickly.

481
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:06,293
Dad, you know Jun Young's
in trouble, right?

482
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:08,690
This is all over the internet...

483
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,965
You crazy jerks!
Stop talking about it.

484
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:15,903
If Young Ok hears about this, it's
not going to end up well. Got it?

485
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:21,809
If anyone of you dares tell her about
any of this, I'll go ahead and...

486
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:22,710
What?

487
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,046
What are you talking about
that's made you so worked up?

488
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,350
-Ok...
-What is it?

489
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,987
Did something happen to Jun Young?

490
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:37,992
Jun Young...

491
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,399
I'm sorry.

492
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,925
Can I ask a few more questions?

493
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,560
As much as you want.

494
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:18,399
A public figure like you, Yoon Jeong Eun deciding
on a public proposal must not have been easy.

495
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,190
-What's the reason to stand in front of the camera.
-That's my bucket list...

496
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,203
Ms. Jeong Eun, please
answer us this question.

497
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,743
I've decided on Sin Jun Young. I don't
want anyone to shake me up nor...

498
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:33,614
threaten me. I wanted to
make it known publicly.

499
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,419
You two must love each other sincerely?

500
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:39,853
Of course.

501
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:42,456
Mr. Sin Jun Young, can you please
give us your answer to that?

502
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:48,162
Yes, of course.

503
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,165
-Since when exactly did you love her?
-What?

504
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,667
When exactly did you start
loving Ms. Jeong Eun?

505
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,036
Exactly when? What month, day, and year?

506
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,790
I don't remember exactly when, but...

507
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,650
How is it possible that
you can't remember it?

508
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:14,360
What about you, PD? Do you happen to
remember every moment you fell in love?

509
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,560
What month, day, and year that was?

510
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:17,458
Of course.

511
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:21,595
It was on March 15th, 2005 at a
playground in my neighborhood.

512
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:27,334
Because we had no mother, some kids made fun of my
little brother and that person said this to him...

513
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:32,039
Hush, don't cry. Why
is a big boy crying?

514
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:38,579
Jik, I was also teased a lot by other kids when
I was your age because I didn't have a father.

515
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:41,915
-But, I never cried.
-Why?

516
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:42,950
Why?

517
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,754
That's what those punks
want... me to cry like a baby.

518
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,991
I was never going to do
what those guys wanted.

519
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:57,731
I won't cry anymore either.
Just like you.

520
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,337
Of course, Jik. You're such a cool guy.

521
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,705
You are so cool, No Jik.

522
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:10,611
After that day, no matter what the other kids
say to my little brother. He never cried again.

523
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,315
After that day, I fell in love with him.

524
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,823
Mr. Sin Jun Young, how do you love?

525
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,727
I don't get the main
point of your question.

526
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,400
Before meeting Ms. Jeong Eun,
didn't you love another woman?

527
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,265
Excuse me.

528
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,306
Yes, I did.

529
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,308
Did you even love that other woman?

530
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,877
I don't remember.

531
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,053
-You don't remember?
-No, I don't.

532
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:59,193
When I begin new love, I
erase my previous love...

533
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,163
Without a speck of dust.
I tend to erase it all.

534
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,371
I'm sorry. We'll take
a five minute break.

535
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,556
Sin Jun Young, You are a scary man.

536
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,836
Oh! What a nice camera.

537
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,439
What brand is it?

538
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:51,311
When everything is over,
shall we start over again?

539
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:55,382
What is your dream?

540
00:53:55,716 --> 00:53:56,416
Excuse me?

541
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,359
I wanted to become a prosecutor
just like my father.

542
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:14,334
So, I wanted to go find my father someday and
say, "I grew up just fine without you, Father..."

543
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:16,803
I wanted to get his compliments.

544
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:21,375
Didn't you blame your father for
abandoning you and your mother?

545
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,278
I thought you wanted to get revenge.

546
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,515
My father had no idea I
existed in this world.

547
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,223
So, I studied hard with not-so-smart brain
and even passed first level of bar exam.

548
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:45,932
But one day, I found
out about my father.

549
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:55,742
My father whom I respected the
most in this world is actually...

550
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:02,349
someone who'd do anything to fulfill his
ambition. Contemptible and cruel...

551
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,087
A scary man.

552
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:30,477
Why?

553
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,880
What is it that your father did?

554
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:40,754
As a prosecutor, he covered up a hit-and-run
accident as a favor from the higher-up.

555
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:47,361
He got rid of the CCTV, bribed the witness, changed
the driver and made him give false testimony.

556
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,632
He demoted his hoobae prosecutor to another
province for wanting to reveal the real culprit.

557
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,302
Are you all right?

558
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:59,240
I have to go to the restroom.

559
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,807
-Do you want me to go with you?
-No.

560
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,176
It's ok.

561
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,904
I'm sure I turned it off.
When did it record?

562
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,741
By chance, did you touch my camera?

563
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:51,491
From now on, monitor this. Don't
look away and watch this carefully.

564
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,194
What are you talking
about all of a sudden?

565
00:57:12,279 --> 00:57:13,547
Are you behind this, Mother?

566
00:57:14,548 --> 00:57:15,640
What do you mean by saying that?

567
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:19,686
Gossip about Sin Jun Young's drug use.
Did you do it, Mother?

568
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,823
Sin Jun Young did drugs?

569
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,661
Please read it once again.

570
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:36,937
Top actor and singer Hallyu star
"A" is known to abuse drugs...

571
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:42,409
sending shockwave to everyone. According
to people who have accompanied him...

572
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:50,250
he used illegal drugs at private club and has been
involved in drug parties with women escorts...

573
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:54,788
That person is not Sin Jun Young, Ok.

574
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,657
Who the heck...

575
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,629
would make such a non-sense
accusation to our Jun Young?

576
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,202
I will chew him and eat him up.

577
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:12,239
Wait until I catch him.

578
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:16,543
Sin Jun Young's real name has
been revealed online already.

579
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:22,482
The police and Prosecutors' Office will soon
begin the investigation on Sin Jun Young.

580
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,852
Okay. Good job.

581
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,788
Was this the only way?

582
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,791
He's still your flesh and blood.

583
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,803
Your Father called you.

584
00:58:45,805 --> 00:58:46,907
Thank you.

585
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:52,779
A prosecutor is human, too. He can't
live life like an ethics textbook.

586
00:58:53,313 --> 00:58:58,518
At times, he can be cowardly,
shaken up, or commit wrongdoing.

587
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:02,689
People live like that.

588
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,892
Not the prosecutors I know.

589
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:12,365
No matter how much loss they suffer and
their family think then incapable...

590
00:59:12,732 --> 00:59:17,704
They live with all their heart to uphold
their conviction, justice and conscience.

591
00:59:17,837 --> 00:59:23,009
So, is that why you allured me in order to take
revenge on your father over such a measly thing?

592
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:28,481
The victim, who died from the hit and run
accident, was my girlfriend's father.

593
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,618
And I...

594
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:37,257
My girlfriend who wanted to reveal the
facts behind her father's death...

595
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,560
Hey, stop right there!

596
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:55,075
Thinking of such a man as my father... to
protect my own father, I killed my girlfriend.

597
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:08,188
I killed that child.

598
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:52,065
Eul, you saw it clearly, right?

599
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,869
Did you two plan this together
and play me all this time?

600
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:59,005
Sin Jun Young, you're under
arrest for abusing drugs.

601
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:01,100
You guys must've had fun.

602
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:05,120
That gossip article. It's all wrong.
It's all a lie.

603
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:07,250
What conscience? What guilt?

604
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,684
What does that have to do with me?
What do you want me to do?

605
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:15,055
Is there really no way to stop you two?

606
01:01:15,722 --> 01:01:19,070
I remember now. The face of the
hit-and-run driver who killed my dad.

607
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,320
Please help me, Ji Tae.
I'm so scared, Ji Tae.

608
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:25,100
Cheer me on, Father. So
that I can win for sure.

609
01:01:25,198 --> 01:01:26,366
Ji Tae!

610
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,610
Run away to another
country with your mother.

611
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,600
What are you going to do
