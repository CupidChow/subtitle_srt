1
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,830
[ Queen: Love and War ]

2
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,380
That's impossible.

3
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,940
There must be something wrong.

4
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,290
It's not mine!

5
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,960
The King ordered to
arrest the culprit swiftly.

6
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,940
Take Lady Hong away!

7
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,040
Yes!

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,580
What are you doing? Let go of me!

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,940
Let go of me!

10
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,160
Even so...

11
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,410
you can't just take away a
candidate during the selection!

12
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,710
Could she at least explain...

13
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,000
How dare you step in?

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,600
I'm carrying out the king's order.

15
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,340
Step aside.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,170
Step aside!

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,440
- Take her away!
- Yes.

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,980
I said it's not mine!

19
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,680
Let go of me!

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,690
I said, let go of me!

21
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,230
It's not mine!

22
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,380
Please check one more time!

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,660
Officers, lock Lady Hong
in a cell first.

24
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,510
I'll join you after I report
to His Majesty.

25
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,930
This is completely nuts...

26
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,040
King.

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,470
What is going on anyway?

28
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,840
How could my dear
palace lady get killed?

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,750
Lady Hong was just arrested
as the culprit of the murder.

30
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,320
What? Did you just say, "Lady Hong?"

31
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,780
King, did you hear that?

32
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,720
- Lady Hong committed the murder...
- Again?

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,680
What have you done this time?

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,800
King.

35
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,150
I'm the Royal Investigations
Bureau captain Sung Gi Chil.

36
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,560
Thankfully, we were able to
capture the culprit quickly...

37
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,740
You were wrong.

38
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,680
- Pardon?
- Lady Hong is not the culprit.

39
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,790
Take away the charges immediately
and restart the investigation.

40
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,940
But we found poison in
Lady Hong's belongings.

41
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,620
Did you just say poison?

42
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,070
Yes, it was a poisonous grass.

43
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,700
The palace lady was killed
by a poisonous grass as well.

44
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,990
And I am not sure what happened,

45
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,590
but we found the letter she received
from the Queen Mother as well.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,310
Also...

47
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,830
there is an eyewitness who saw her
meeting with the victim privately.

48
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,020
This is slander.

49
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,760
This is all a conspiracy!

50
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,660
Where is Lady Hong right now?

51
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,760
She was taken to the
Royal Investigation Bureau.

52
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,060
Your Majesty!

53
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,400
Your Majesty!

54
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,200
I'll come by later.

55
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,290
What are you talking about?

56
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,140
She committed murder?

57
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,580
It seems she was poisoned.

58
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,400
She was arrested immediately
since the evidence was clear.

59
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,440
Did you say the victim
worked for the Queen?

60
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,630
She was also the one who reported
His Excellency Kang Yi Soo.

61
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,970
As soon as there was a rumor
about the dead queen's return,

62
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,250
the palace lady who
reported Kang Yi Soo died.

63
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,210
Since they acted so
hastily, they must be...

64
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,800
Delay the scheduled selection

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,200
and let the candidates wait
in Yeonghwadang first.

66
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,220
Yes, Your Highness.

67
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,320
How is the King doing right now?

68
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,800
Your Majesty!

69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,590
Get out of the way.

70
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,380
Please compose yourself.

71
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,280
Are you telling me to leave
her in prison then?

72
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,810
If you go to the Royal Investigation
Bureau and free her yourself,

73
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,650
you would be breaking
the law as the king!

74
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,020
Exonerate her first, Your Majesty.

75
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,400
If you prove her innocence,
she would be freed naturally.

76
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,200
They planned it and framed her!

77
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,840
There is clear evidence too!

78
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,290
Someone must have
put the poison in advance...

79
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,220
Your Majesty.

80
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,500
In my dream last night,

81
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,170
a woman snuck into that room.

82
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,320
Was it really poison?

83
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,210
Did it really come from
my belongings?

84
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,050
Yes, it was poison
made of monkshood.

85
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,620
How could you get arrested
for murder all of a sudden?

86
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,410
The evidence is clear too...

87
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,490
Hey, what if something bad
really happens to you?

88
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,190
Monkshood poison?

89
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,520
Queen Mother told me to
give this to you.

90
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,800
Did she send that letter
to me to frame me?

91
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,010
Please go to Baek Ja Yong's
residence immediately.

92
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,170
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong?

93
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,340
Go tell him that we need
Queen Dowager's help.

94
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,600
Geez...

95
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,930
Everything is going
according to the plan.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,500
You remember how to
explain that letter, right?

97
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,300
Yes.

98
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,770
I never wrote and sent such a letter.

99
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,300
- It's not even my handwriting.
- Yes.

100
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,470
But would King really
let this happen?

101
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,770
I even sacrificed my
servant for this.

102
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,350
We cannot allow
anything to go wrong.

103
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,310
Please do not worry.

104
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,550
Everything will go as we wish.

105
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,150
So...

106
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,950
what is waiting for us next?

107
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,680
We should start
pressuring the King.

108
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,980
You happened to be in the palace.

109
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,070
Yes, I heard there was a
terrible murder in the palace.

110
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,170
I was on my way to meet
His Majesty regarding that.

111
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,100
Would you come with me?

112
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,580
Let's go.

113
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,900
From the way she was dressed,

114
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,210
she was definitely one
of the candidates.

115
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,280
Which one of the
candidates testified?

116
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,810
Was it Lady Kim?

117
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,640
It was Lady Jo, Your Majesty.

118
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,330
His Excellency
Jo Heung Gyeon's daughter?

119
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,540
Yes.

120
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,990
I knew it.

121
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,130
I never liked the way
she looked at His Majesty.

122
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,040
Your Majesty, the ministers
including the Chief State Minister

123
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,110
are requesting to meet with you.

124
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,910
Your Majesty.

125
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,510
How could a candidate for the
selection commit murder in the palace?

126
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,840
This is the worst incident since
the selection system was

127
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,100
first introduced under
the King Taejong.

128
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,580
Please order an interrogation to

129
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,420
investigate Lady Hong's crimes

130
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,980
and settle this horrific incident.

131
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,200
I cannot do that.

132
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
Her charge has not
been determined yet.

133
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,120
I will investigate more thoroughly.

134
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,360
The evidence has
already been found.

135
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,930
What if the evidence
involves a lie?

136
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,820
Who would take responsibility?

137
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,170
There is no way the
evidence involves a lie.

138
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,350
Will you take responsibility then?

139
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,330
Pardon?

140
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,180
Even though the poison was found,

141
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,200
Lady Hong has no motive
to kill the palace lady.

142
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,410
Lady Hong's father, Governor Hong Ki Ho,
who is mentioned in this letter

143
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,320
is alive and well.

144
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,330
Forgive me for saying this,

145
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,760
but there is a rumor
within the palace

146
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,110
that Lady Hong is the
resurrected queen.

147
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,730
That should also be looked
into as soon as possible.

148
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,940
Perhaps you should make
her clarify herself.

149
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,530
Please schedule the interrogation.

150
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,590
Your Majesty, I agree with him.

151
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,420
You must investigate
everything thoroughly

152
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,770
in order to uphold the
royal family's honor.

153
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,950
Please listen to our
plea, Your Majesty.

154
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,300
Please listen to our
plea, Your Majesty.

155
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,700
Why does an officer of
the Bureau want to see me?

156
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,330
Well, you know
Kang Eun Bo, don't you?

157
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,070
That woman is accused
of killing someone.

158
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,870
- She's in prison now.
- What?

159
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,350
Is that true?

160
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,450
Yes.

161
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,100
By the way, who are you, and
why are you telling me this?

162
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,880
Did Eun Bo ask you to do this?

163
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,910
Well, the thing is...

164
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,390
It's kind of a long story.

165
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,520
Anyway, I've known
her for a long time.

166
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,430
But more importantly,

167
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,400
she's in a dire situation, sir.

168
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,940
I heard the Left State Minister
always moves in the shadows.

169
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,520
Maybe he did that this time too.

170
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,510
How about the people in your family?

171
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,560
Everyone says they always
behave recklessly.

172
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,980
Why did you testify that you saw
Lady Hong with the palace lady?

173
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,260
I thought you two were friends.

174
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,350
You are the one who
made her look suspicious.

175
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,440
That's because...

176
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,050
What did I expect to
hear from you, anyway?

177
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,690
Anyway, didn't things
work out for both of us?

178
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,010
What would happen to Lady Hong?

179
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,540
I'm not sure either,

180
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,280
but she probably won't be
able to come back here.

181
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,210
She won't die, will she?

182
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,520
Are you all right?

183
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,390
Lady Jo, please come
outside for a moment.

184
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,200
Please go ahead.

185
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,410
- Your Majesty.
- I wanted to ask you about something.

186
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,710
Pardon?

187
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,000
Where were you last night
after the bell rang?

188
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,800
I was in my room thinking about
the mission for the final round.

189
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,140
Were you in the room
the entire time?

190
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,710
I went out to the Yeonghwadang's
backyard to get some fresh air.

191
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,230
And you saw Lady Hong and the
palace lady together then?

192
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,440
Yes.

193
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,570
Did you ever go inside
Lady Hong's room?

194
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,180
What do you mean...

195
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,640
By chance...

196
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,220
are you suspicious of me?

197
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,260
Why...

198
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,360
Where is the skirt you wore
during the first round?

199
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,280
I asked you why you
are suspicious of me.

200
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,860
The truth...

201
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,610
starts with a suspicion.

202
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,010
I am suspicious of
everyone, not just you.

203
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,970
If so...

204
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,600
you should be suspicious
of Lady Hong first.

205
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,000
She is undoubtedly the one who
was picked out as the culprit.

206
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,300
Not to me.

207
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,250
There was flower embroidery
on the handkerchief

208
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,380
that was covering the poison bottle.

209
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,760
Did you say embroidery?

210
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,090
Is that why you met with
Lady Jo, who embroidered

211
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,370
her skirt for the first round?

212
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,810
It did not seem like she was lying

213
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,660
when I asked her where
she was last night.

214
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,820
Don't you think it was
probably Lady Kim then?

215
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,310
If I hastily questioned Lady Kim,

216
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,950
she might hide her tail.

217
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,350
I need to be sure.

218
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,180
What are you talking
about right now?

219
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,120
She's locked up at the
Royal Investigation Bureau?

220
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,800
A man who's supposedly
Eun Bo's partner came by.

221
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,520
It seems like she fell into a trap.

222
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,000
We must get her out.

223
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,630
Is there a way?

224
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,040
First, send the priestess
to Queen Dowager and...

225
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,480
What's the King doing right now?

226
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,390
He said she's his woman.
How could he let this happen?

227
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,330
He's probably figuring
things out hurriedly.

228
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,110
Your Excellency.

229
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,490
We need to prepare for
the worst-case scenario.

230
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,790
We might lose both her
and military rights...

231
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,250
We shouldn't be discussing that yet.

232
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,030
Please look into the situation
thoroughly before doing anything.

233
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,040
I told Hong Ki Ho to meet with
Eun Bo. Let's wait and see.

234
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,200
I will make sure to keep the
promise I made with you

235
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,070
under the sun, moon,
and stars right here.

236
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,820
Could you wait for a little
bit longer until then?

237
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm letting you in briefly
while switching shifts.

238
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,880
You don't have a lot of time.

239
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,360
What brings you here?

240
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,100
Are you doing okay?

241
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,500
Yes, at least for now.

242
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,500
They will conduct an interrogation
on you tomorrow at noon.

243
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,570
Queen Mother made someone put
the poison in my belongings.

244
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,520
Probably a royal servant or a candidate
who can enter Yeonghwadang.

245
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,980
We must find them.

246
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,790
Please ask Queen Dowager for help.

247
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,300
Not to King but Queen Dowager?

248
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,820
Queen Mother is still King's mother.

249
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,000
Could he get his mother
indicted so easily?

250
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,450
But would Queen Dowager help you?

251
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:02,940
I've told Queen Dowager that I'll catch
the culprit of the assassination myself.

252
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,220
She saw that I made it
to the final round.

253
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,620
She'd help me just to
give me a chance.

254
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,560
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,540
Because of this incident,

256
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,600
you may end up getting hurt, sir.

257
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,860
You're the one locked in.
Don't worry about me.

258
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,530
When I gave you
my daughter's name,

259
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,560
I decided to accept anything
that might happen.

260
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,210
Just worry about yourself.

261
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,900
They probably framed
my father the same way too.

262
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:43,330
Thinking about him dying
so wrongfully makes me so angry.

263
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,620
A letter from the
governor of Gyeonggi?

264
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,680
What does it say?

265
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,670
He is asking for my help.

266
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,990
Your Highness.

267
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,420
Lady Hong might face
something terrible

268
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,690
if you leave things alone.

269
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,070
Perhaps you should accept
his request and step in.

270
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,490
But there is no clear solution...

271
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,930
His Majesty is here.

272
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,830
What brings you here at this hour?

273
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,080
Please make them inspect
Yeonghwadang first thing in the morning.

274
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,450
What do you mean, "inspect?"

275
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,850
A candidate reportedly smuggled
poison into the palace.

276
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,620
We should conduct surprise
inspection on other candidates

277
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,800
for security measures.

278
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,950
Please order as the
head of the inner court.

279
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,750
As you know,

280
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,900
we recently had a heinous incident.

281
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,840
Because of that, we'll have
to inspect your belongings.

282
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,950
It's Queen Dowager's order.
Please follow through.

283
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,630
Begin now.

284
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,020
Did you find it?

285
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,250
Is this what you saw in your dream?

286
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,490
Who is the owner of
this handkerchief?

287
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,800
The interrogation will start soon.

288
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,700
Get ready quickly and
bring the criminal out.

289
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Yes, sir.

290
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,680
I'm going crazy here.

291
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,210
What are the King and
the Queen Dowager doing?

292
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,390
Open the door.

293
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,300
Yes, sir.

294
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,900
I'm sorry. I think I forgot the key.

295
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,810
What?

296
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,600
You bastard!

297
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,300
Nothing you do is to my liking.

298
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,770
- Officer Kim.
- Yes.

299
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,010
- Bring the key.
- Yes, sir.

300
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,130
I'm so sorry.

301
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,800
Please come in.

302
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,300
Your Majesty?

303
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,820
Why did you put a bottle of poison
in Lady Hong's belongings?

304
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,730
Pardon?

305
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,880
I'm not sure what you mean...

306
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,440
Why did you do such a thing?

307
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,370
It wasn't me. It wasn't me!

308
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,800
Who told you to do that?

309
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,120
Let go of me!

310
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,590
I'll go on my own.

311
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,930
Come out right now.

312
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,310
Come out.

313
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,170
I don't know anything!

314
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,810
I know nothing!

315
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,810
That night...

316
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,760
You went into Lady Hong's room
while she was asleep.

317
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,910
You took out the poison wrapped with
the handkerchief with violets embroidered.

318
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,440
And with those shaky hands,

319
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,210
you planted the poison among
Lady Hong's belongings.

320
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,580
Do you still know nothing about it?

321
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,490
If you confess now,

322
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,070
I will not make you
responsible for everything.

323
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,290
Who was it?

324
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,070
Who made you do such a thing?

325
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,300
Who was it?

326
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,250
It was the minister of justice!

327
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,800
He summoned me the night
before I entered the palace.

328
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,150
Sir.

329
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,710
Good work.

330
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,280
Who are you, and why
did you summon me?

331
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,240
I'm Kwon Ik Soo,
the minister of justice.

332
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,220
I met your father
a long time ago too.

333
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,670
I see.

334
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,250
I heard that your family
isn't doing well

335
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,300
and the entire family is
struggling financially.

336
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,750
By chance...

337
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,720
wouldn't you like to help
your parents and siblings?

338
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,520
I'm not sure what you mean...

339
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,940
I'd like you to run an errand for me.

340
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,510
If so, your family will be rewarded.

341
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,140
If you refuse,

342
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,300
your family will also
pay for it as well.

343
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,020
I deserve to die.

344
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,260
He threatened to harm my family.

345
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,340
I didn't know it was
a bottle of poison.

346
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,840
I didn't know a palace lady
would get killed.

347
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,340
I really had no idea!

348
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,810
Is everything you said true?

349
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,260
Yes, it is.

350
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,910
Arrest Kwon Ik Soo,
the minister of justice.

351
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

352
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,240
We already have clear evidence.

353
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,720
Confess your crime now.

354
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,600
Why did you kill the palace lady?

355
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,960
This is a conspiracy.

356
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,710
I didn't kill that palace lady!

357
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,930
Everyone!

358
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,570
Go ahead and start
the torture until

359
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,380
she confesses her crime!

360
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,460
Yes, sir!

361
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,430
Stop!

362
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,740
It is the King's order to arrest
Kwon Ik Soo, the minister of justice.

363
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,510
Capture him right now.

364
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,600
Yes, sir!

365
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,630
What are you doing right now?

366
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,540
What was the King's order?

367
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,980
I was told to imprison

368
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,490
the criminal immediately for
framing an innocent person

369
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,340
by fabricating evidence.

370
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,670
Take him away!

371
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,290
Yes, sir!

372
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,070
Let go.

373
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,580
Let go of me!

374
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,230
Let go, you bastards!

375
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,160
Let go, you bastards!

376
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,070
The King found the person who
planted poison in your room.

377
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,480
His Majesty did?

378
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,640
So who was it?

379
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,200
Well, it was...

380
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,280
Lady Ha confessed everything.

381
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,990
Since we found the real culprit,

382
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,070
I am thinking of conducting an
interrogation, as you recommended.

383
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,400
I will investigate
Kwon Ik Soo's crime

384
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,100
and settle this horrific incident.

385
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,350
Your Majesty, the allegation
has not been proven yet.

386
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,280
Yes, and what if Lady Ha
was testified untruthfully...

387
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,960
Why could you not be that careful

388
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,100
when Lady Hong got arrested?

389
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,830
I will investigate the
incident comprehensively

390
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,500
and arrest everyone
who was involved.

391
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,670
For the interrogation,

392
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,210
I want Han Ui Geum, the minister
of the court, to be in charge.

393
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,150
Pardon?

394
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

395
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,770
Oh, my...

396
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,000
His Excellency.

397
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,300
Lady Hong is about to
return to the selection again.

398
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,430
Do your best to fulfill your duty.

399
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,540
Are you suggesting to
uphold His Majesty's wishes?

400
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,170
His Majesty already won this
round regarding this incident.

401
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,650
Although I carried out that plan,

402
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,480
I never expected to
get much out of it.

403
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,930
If so, why did you tell
the Chief State Minister

404
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,640
that Lady Hong is the dead queen?

405
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,580
I just wanted to start a rumor.

406
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,830
It was the Chief State Minister

407
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,820
who undermined himself
by planning the murder.

408
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,630
What will we do now, Father?

409
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,260
With the Minister of Justice's arrest,

410
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,760
our involvement in the
murder will get revealed.

411
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,480
- Hyungnim!
- Father!

412
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,630
Stop fussing.

413
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,890
We just need to cut the tail off.

414
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,110
Will you abandon
His Excellency Kwon Ik Soo?

415
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,940
We can easily find another dog

416
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,130
who would be loyal to our family.

417
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,690
What is there to worry?

418
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,360
Look at you now...

419
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,600
Please help me, Your Excellency.

420
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,010
Don't worry about your family.

421
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,030
I'll look after them for
the sake of our friendship.

422
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,890
What do you mean...

423
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,950
Say that the palace lady

424
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,490
spoke badly of you to Queen Mother

425
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,260
and things got out of hand.

426
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,010
Leave it at that.

427
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,220
Are you telling me to...

428
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,510
take the blame for
everything right now?

429
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,910
What nonsense are you spewing?

430
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,990
You planned everything
from the beginning.

431
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,940
That makes you
responsible for everything.

432
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,140
I was being loyal to the Kim family.

433
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,110
I'm aware, however...

434
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,010
you shouldn't have
gotten the wrong idea.

435
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,040
Did you think that your
surname became Kim

436
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,430
just because we hung out together?

437
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,400
My goodness...

438
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,010
I believe you understood
what I said.

439
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,210
Don't just think about yourself.

440
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,140
You need to think
about your family.

441
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,420
Got it?

442
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,000
His Excellency!

443
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,030
Did you really do this on your own?

444
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,740
That's correct.

445
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,980
I did everything on my own.

446
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,940
I murdered the palace lady

447
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,930
and framed Lady Hong
for the crime.

448
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,160
Come out. You've been acquitted.

449
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,390
What are you doing? Come out.

450
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,720
The royal servants are
here to greet you.

451
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,500
Hurry up!

452
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,450
I heard Kwon Ik Soo
confessed to all of his crimes.

453
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,260
I had no idea he was doing
that behind our backs.

454
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,150
As you promised me last time,

455
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,420
please confess your crime.

456
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,740
What crime?

457
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,910
That you ordered the dead palace lady
to make a false confession.

458
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,660
Order a false confession?

459
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,340
Who did?

460
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,460
I think you misunderstood
what I said last time.

461
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,140
I did not mean that when
I said I would reveal the truth.

462
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,540
I wanted to use her as a messenger

463
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,770
to prove to you that I am innocent.

464
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,570
But what should I do now?

465
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,370
The dead palace lady
cannot talk anymore.

466
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,420
The truth has been buried.

467
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,100
Are you there, Chief Eunuch Hwang?

468
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

469
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,650
Investigate the servants who
worked for the queen right now.

470
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,020
I must find someone to prove
that Kang Yi Soo never tried

471
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,000
to indoctrinate his daughter.

472
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,040
Let's go now.

473
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,710
I think she knows that
you helped her.

474
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,000
That is a relief.

475
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,530
You must have been through a lot.

476
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,690
The final round will commence
at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.

477
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,690
Queen Dowager relays the message

478
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,330
that you take a rest today.

479
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,050
Thank you.

480
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:37,220
I didn't think you'd make
it back this time.

481
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,130
I didn't think Lady Ha
would do such a thing.

482
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,600
If so...

483
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,290
- why did you do that?
- What do you mean?

484
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,460
That testimony...

485
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,290
It's true that you met
with the palace lady.

486
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,060
Couldn't you at least
let me explain myself?

487
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,840
Why do I have to do that?

488
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,510
We're competitors, after all.

489
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,620
Did you look into it?

490
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,240
Well, the thing is...

491
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,220
What is it?

492
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,150
Everyone must be scared because
of the palace lady's death.

493
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:17,760
They're all saying they
don't know anything.

494
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,210
So no one would say anything?

495
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,370
Not even one person would speak?

496
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,500
- I apologize.
- Your Majesty.

497
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:28,070
Perhaps you should end this now.

498
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,600
The longer you drag this out,

499
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,070
the worse the rumors would
become in the palace.

500
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,260
Although she committed
a serious crime of slander,

501
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,360
considering she
confessed on her own,

502
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,800
Ha Dan Young will be removed
from the selection and

503
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,050
the Ha family will never
participate in the selection

504
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,970
nor work for the government.

505
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,570
For committing a heinous
murder in the palace

506
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,860
and framing an innocent
person, Kwon Ik Soo will be

507
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,500
removed from his position
and sent away to Hongdo.

508
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,500
I think the reinvestigation
for the Kang Yi Soo's case

509
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,020
will not take place
for the time being.

510
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,930
Queen Mother must
feel relieved too.

511
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,050
So...

512
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,970
I heard that the minister
of justice was exiled.

513
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,530
He must be grinding
his teeth against us.

514
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,310
So what if he grinds his teeth?

515
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:31,670
Everyone in the court knows
that he worked for us.

516
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,490
Be careful what you do for a while.

517
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,100
- You must take caution.
- Yes.

518
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,530
You heard that, right?

519
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,860
- He said, "take caution."
- What?

520
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,410
Mind your own business.
You punk...

521
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,120
Don't worry.

522
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:51,270
I'm good at pretending to
remorse in front of others.

523
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,060
Nothing to brag about.

524
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,100
By the way, Hyungnim...

525
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,330
What should we do
with the selection now?

526
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,730
If our family does
something in this situation,

527
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,640
it might backfire.

528
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,950
We already bribed the royal family.

529
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,560
Things are beyond our control now.

530
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,540
We just need to let Song Yi
take care of the rest.

531
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,810
Please bring the thing

532
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,420
you are willing to
sacrifice in that box.

533
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,920
Do you know how
precious these shoes are?

534
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,370
Who made them dirty?

535
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,410
We didn't do anything.

536
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,550
- That stain was already...
- Be quiet and clean them.

537
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,630
May I send someone to
my house briefly?

538
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,690
I need something for the mission.

539
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,040
I heard you found the real culprit.

540
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,520
I'd like to thank you one more time.

541
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,030
I had no doubt about it.

542
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,640
There is no need to.

543
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,300
Did you get hurt at all?

544
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,960
I am okay.

545
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,710
Please do not worry.

546
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,430
Your Majesty.

547
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:52,080
There is something
I would like to tell you.

548
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,620
Tell me.

549
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,690
Last time, you told me

550
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,590
that you would turn
everything back to normal.

551
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,400
To be honest, I was concerned
about what you said.

552
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,200
I wondered if it would be okay

553
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,640
to depend on you and not
catch the culprit myself.

554
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,890
I was afraid while being locked up.

555
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,720
I was afraid I would
end up like my father.

556
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,790
I felt victimized and enraged.

557
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,420
I was angry with the
people who framed me.

558
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,900
I want to have power.

559
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:31,390
Not the kind of power
you use to destroy other people,

560
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,840
but the type of power
that seeks justice.

561
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,350
They took the palace lady's
life away as if it's nothing

562
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,900
and they framed a
powerless young lady.

563
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,410
I want to be more
powerful than them.

564
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,940
And...

565
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,640
I want to get there even more

566
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,670
if that means

567
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,570
I would be by your side.

568
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,880
The angrier and more
upset I got in prison,

569
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,600
I wanted to see you more.

570
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,750
I was afraid that I might

571
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,700
never see you again.

572
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,960
Please let me participate
in the selection as Hong Yeon.

573
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,260
I want to be by your side

574
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,310
even if I have to use
someone else's name.

575
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,810
That is how I feel now.

576
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,700
I also want to have you by my side.

577
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,590
Promise me instead.

578
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:04,550
Do not put yourself into
danger no matter what.

579
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,330
Do not be afraid,
no matter what happens.

580
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,160
Because you have me.

581
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,230
Are you done preparing
for the evaluation?

582
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,020
Yes.

583
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,620
I have notified the female royal
family members to enter the palace.

584
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,650
I'm glad Lady Hong made it
back safely, Your Highness.

585
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,000
We can count on
Queen Dowager's choice, correct?

586
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,130
Yes.

587
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,410
Due to the priestess' message
and the recent incident,

588
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,870
the mighty Kim family is stymied.

589
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,700
I'm sure she will choose Eun Bo.

590
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,100
After we send in Eun Bo
as the queen

591
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,590
and if she falls in
danger like this time,

592
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,920
do you have a plan?

593
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,330
Don't worry.

594
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,760
The palace will be turned
upside down before that.

595
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,620
We need to turn

596
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,050
one of the King's
inner-circle into our ally.

597
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,630
We should start...

598
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,120
figuring out the King's movement.

599
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,800
Whom do you mean
by his inner-circle?

600
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,210
You wanted to make a report?

601
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

602
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,570
Is the palace in peace now?

603
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,760
In peace?

604
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,700
What does that have
to do with you?

605
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Geez, seriously.

606
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,000
What does it have to do...

607
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,100
Even so, am I not allowed to ask?

608
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,000
What?

609
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,400
You bastard!

610
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,940
Come on. "Bastard," you say?

611
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,840
I work for the Royal
Investigation Bureau now.

612
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,390
Calling me names is a bit...

613
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,570
Your Majesty.

614
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,770
How could you offer him
a position to someone like that?

615
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,110
That's enough. You might
grow to like each other.

616
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,460
"Like each other," you said?

617
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,930
- How could you...
- Say something so horrific?

618
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,750
My goodness...

619
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,490
Are you worried about the queen?

620
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,990
That's not exactly it...

621
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,170
About this man I had mentioned.

622
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,350
The man who approached
a courtesan named Cho Hyang.

623
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,610
I heard there is a burnt mark

624
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,000
on the back of his neck.

625
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:37,950
But I'm still not sure if
he's Gae Pyeong or not.

626
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,800
On the back of his neck?

627
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,510
Do you remember seeing the name
"Gae Pyeong" in the address book for hunters?

628
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,560
I have not seen that name.

629
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,180
Look into it further.

630
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,810
Find out if all hunters have tattoos
on the back of their necks

631
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,760
and if any of them
got them removed.

632
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,580
Perhaps your report
might be an important clue.

633
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,460
Yes, Your Majesty!

634
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,220
I need Hong Yeon now.

635
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,550
Bring her here.

636
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,660
There will be about three
or four days of hiatus

637
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,250
until they announce the
result of the selection.

638
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,130
Hurry up and bring
Hong Yeon to Hanyang

639
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,570
and find out about
Kang Yi Soo's wife too.

640
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,680
Yes, sir.

641
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,930
What's the matter?

642
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,320
She was with Hong Yeon
at the temple.

643
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,470
The two of them were together?

644
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:00,040
I never thought of that.

645
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,680
Bring both of them here.

646
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,560
Yes, sir.

647
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,850
Your Majesty.

648
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,990
The final round finally started.

649
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:46,180
I'm not even a candidate,

650
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,410
but I'm so nervous.

651
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,570
Everything...

652
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:53,140
Everything will go well.

653
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,170
Lady Hong will...

654
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,070
It will go well.

655
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:05,230
We will hear your answers to the
question we asked last time.

656
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,150
Lady Kim, would you like to start?

657
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:09,840
What could you give up
to become the queen?

658
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,720
This is my answer.

659
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,600
They are too lovely of
shoes to get rid of.

660
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,810
What does it mean?

661
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,610
My uncle got these
shoes made for me.

662
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,770
From what I learned,

663
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:41,490
the ladies in the palace should
not be so politically outspoken.

664
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,670
Although my uncle is
in the highest position,

665
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,930
I do not wish to be
partial toward him.

666
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,720
So I want to give up this gift.

667
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,750
What?

668
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:54,480
Are you saying you can give
up your family right now?

669
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,840
Please do not get me wrong.

670
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,920
What I meant is that

671
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,020
I will be more aware and
try not to become

672
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,200
a queen who is blinded by power.

673
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,530
She's not entirely wrong.

674
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,180
The royal family can abandon our
children, morality, and humanity.

675
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,010
You must not be partial to anything.

676
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,130
I appreciate your answer.

677
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,570
It is an honor.

678
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:26,240
I've been absent for too long
because of the selection.

679
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,960
I'm thinking of going
back to Gyeonggi today.

680
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,630
Do you feel uncomfortable
to see Eun Bo?

681
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,000
How much longer will you
leave her in the dark?

682
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,000
We need to let her know
what our intention is.

683
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,580
I will tell her everything
when the selection ends.

684
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,090
Everything she's
been curious about.

685
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,680
Including changing the
owner of the throne and

686
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,250
starting a new world
is our final goal.

687
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:01,120
That is the skirt you wore
during the first round, is it not?

688
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,030
I remember praising you
for fixing ruined clothes.

689
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,880
Yes, I was happy.

690
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,580
But why do you want
to abandon it?

691
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,870
When I found out that
the skirt was ruined,

692
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,500
I was angry,

693
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:22,000
and I was afraid and sad
that I might get disqualified.

694
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,360
But then I had a joyful time
with the young ladies

695
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,530
who worked on the
embroidery with me.

696
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:29,800
If it reminds you of
such a nice memory.

697
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,830
I do not understand at all.

698
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:34,200
Whether it was a happy
or sad memory,

699
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,990
it is the queen's duty to
move on from the past

700
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,750
and start anew.

701
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,660
Abandoning your happy,
angry, and sad moments?

702
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,530
It sounds like you are willing to
give up on your entire past.

703
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,260
That is correct.

704
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,040
I understand your determination,

705
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,710
but giving up on your past is
not always the best.

706
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:00,720
What is your answer, Lady Hong?

707
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,340
It is a silver spoon.

708
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,700
Silver spoons are
used to detect poison.

709
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,410
So they are used for dining.

710
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:26,950
What do you mean by that?

711
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:31,940
In households without
enough utensils,

712
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,880
they use wooden spoons to
eat kimchi or vegetables.

713
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,020
But if you have to make rice cakes
by steaming pine needles

714
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,010
or dirt because you're poor,

715
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,840
your hand becomes a spoon.

716
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,610
You steam dirt and eat
it with your hands?

717
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,000
I cannot believe it.

718
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,760
You sound like you
have experienced it.

719
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,950
Is it really true?

720
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:55,220
Yes.

721
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,230
I have witnessed and
heard about it myself.

722
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,030
It is a clear picture of people's lives

723
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:04,180
that none of us know about.

724
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,280
Continue.

725
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,240
I do not own anything special

726
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,590
compared to these
two young ladies here.

727
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,440
So I thought about the things

728
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,510
I could give up on if
I became the queen.

729
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,950
I wish to give up on
this silver spoon

730
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,750
and become a citizen
closest to His Majesty.

731
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,730
As the mother of the nation,

732
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,150
one should be willing to
use a wooden spoon

733
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:30,340
or hands or sometimes starve

734
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:34,270
with the people and share their pain.

735
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,710
Give up on your silver spoon and

736
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,530
use a wooden spoon
along with the people?

737
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:45,890
It is not very realistic since it
goes against the royal etiquette.

738
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:50,380
But I am impressed
with your heart.

739
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,600
Ma'am!

740
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,800
What are you doing?

741
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,400
The two of you...

742
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,400
will have to come with me.

743
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:26,600
Who are you anyway?

744
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,800
Priest!

745
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:43,110
This way.

746
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:54,800
My lady.

747
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,470
My lady, my lady!

748
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,920
My lady...

749
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,770
I appreciate all of your answers.

750
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:35,750
Since this is the final round
that selects the queen,

751
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,700
instead of making the decision now,

752
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,310
we will take a break.

753
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,790
Queen Mother, royal family members,

754
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:43,840
and I will carefully make the decision.

755
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,590
You may leave the palace now.

756
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:48,150
Court Lady Jung.

757
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,420
Please follow me.

758
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,390
My lady!

759
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:20,210
Yeo Wool.

760
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,160
Are you okay?

761
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,990
You were in the palace one day

762
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,990
and you were in prison
the next day.

763
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:28,700
Do you know how shocked I was?

764
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,840
Did you get hurt by chance?

765
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,870
I'm okay now. Don't worry.

766
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,010
How was it? Did you do well?

767
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,820
Did you make any mistakes?

768
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,550
- I need to stop by somewhere.
- Yes.

769
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,170
Unni.

770
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,700
I'm sorry.

771
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:06,590
I started this to find the
person who did this to you.

772
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,260
But I...

773
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,040
fell for...

774
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,130
I fell for His Majesty.

775
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,090
I feel like...

776
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:24,140
I'm stealing your spot
and your name.

777
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,000
I'm sorry.

778
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,350
I'm so sorry.

779
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,520
I will get punished, right?

780
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,000
By both you...

781
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,400
and the one who thinks I'm you.

782
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,580
Will I ever be forgiven?

783
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:10,210
Song Yi.

784
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,650
Song Yi, how did
the selection go?

785
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,450
What have you been doing?

786
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:18,240
You told me to start a rumor.

787
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,450
But you couldn't
even kick her out.

788
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,420
Seriously...

789
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,990
Huh?

790
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,140
Hey, Song Yi!

791
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,540
What happened?

792
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,200
- Song Yi!
- That little...

793
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,000
If you get disqualified
from the selection,

794
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:37,030
I won't just sit and watch.

795
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,800
Have some.

796
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:50,710
Why are you doing
this to a crook?

797
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:54,220
Are you really the one who
accused me of being a crook

798
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,080
in front of His Majesty?

799
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:00,020
If I told him that we
know each other,

800
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,160
I thought Lady Hong Yeon
might be in a bind.

801
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,320
How about me?
Is it okay if I'm in a bind?

802
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,040
I should be born as a
woman in my next life.

803
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,690
Anyway, forget that.

804
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,980
You still can't do that when we
used to live under the same roof.

805
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,700
That's why I'm
apologizing right now.

806
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,350
Whether it's alcohol or food,

807
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:20,240
- it's all on me.
- What's this?

808
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,790
Please stop being upset.

809
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,800
Geez.

810
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
What was this thing called?

811
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,710
I heard it's the most expensive
ginseng drink at this watering hole.

812
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:30,720
Aigoo.

813
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,450
Aigoo, yes.

814
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:36,560
It smells amazing.

815
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,530
Ah, yes...

816
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,770
Aigoo...

817
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,690
Aigoo, that's excellent.

818
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,870
By the way, what are you wearing?

819
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:50,920
Well, have you noticed?

820
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,800
I was trying to cover it.

821
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,870
His Majesty sent me to the
Royal Investigation Bureau.

822
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:59,260
His Majesty did?

823
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,520
Wow, do you see him often then?

824
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,750
Well, yes...

825
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,720
What do you do at the
Royal Investigation Bureau?

826
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,750
Well, what I do is...

827
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,840
this and that sort of thing.

828
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,900
I actually take orders
directly from His Majesty.

829
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,380
- You made it!
- I didn't make it...

830
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,550
But still, be careful.

831
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,900
Never mind.

832
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,030
It's probably a false rumor.

833
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,440
A rumor? What rumor?

834
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,840
Haven't you heard the
rumor from the market?

835
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,960
No, I haven't.

836
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,070
Come closer.

837
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:40,700
Well, the King apparently
abandons people

838
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,100
when he doesn't
need them anymore.

839
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,470
Even his own father-in-law.

840
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,130
I don't think so.

841
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:01,500
It's time for you to tell
me what your plan is.

842
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:12,200
Your eyes have changed, Sweetheart.

843
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,840
I will change.

844
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,310
I'll act like your daughter.

845
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,200
I'll reveal that the woman
from the Hong family

846
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,320
is the resurrected queen
in front of everyone.

847
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:30,140
A traitor's daughter lied
about her identity

848
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,920
and fooled the royal family.

849
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,850
She deserves to die.

850
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,130
I finished preparing as
you told me to do, sir.

851
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,690
I want to hear it too.

852
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:56,000
Go ahead then.

853
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,030
I brought Hong Yeon and
Kang Yi Soo's wife

854
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:09,450
to a warehouse in Baeksagol.

855
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:12,960
Well done.

856
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:37,350
My apologies for
causing a disturbance.

857
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:42,640
But I hope you forgive me since
it's an important matter.

858
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:46,900
That woman over there is

859
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,450
not a young lady
from the Hong family.

860
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:54,020
She's the daughter of Kang Yi Soo,
who committed high treason!

861
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:17,030
I heard Kang Yi Soo's wife was sent to
a government office as a slave.

862
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,170
Hurry up and find out
where she is.

863
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:20,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

864
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,570
- What's this about?
- I'm from the royal palace.

865
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:42,520
I'm looking for a slave here.

866
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,900
Today is finally the day
they announce the result.

867
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,780
I really hope it's you.

868
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,960
I was told she ran away
from the office.

869
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,580
And it was before the first
round of selection started.

870
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,270
How about Jo Heung Gyeon's people?

871
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:18,390
I didn't detect anything suspicious.

872
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:19,700
By the way, Your Majesty...

873
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,580
I heard someone recently visited the
office and drew a picture of her face.

874
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:27,430
I wonder if they work for
the Left State Minister.

875
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:35,270
Lady Kim made an unexpected
decision and proved her cleverness,

876
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:39,920
but cleverness itself could not
move this old woman's heart.

877
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,990
On the contrary, Lady Jo's
determination was memorable.

878
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:48,180
But it did not quite fit the quality
that's required from the queen.

879
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,610
The leader of the inner court must

880
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:55,830
know how to care for the
livelihood of the people.

881
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:59,540
Even though her promise
might be a bit unrealistic,

882
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:03,380
but since she understood
the people's lives well,

883
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,310
I'm thinking of selecting
Lady Hong as the queen.

884
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:11,610
What are your opinions, ladies?

885
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,690
We have...

886
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,670
chosen Lady Kim.

887
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:25,360
I probably do not need to
hear Queen Mother's answer.

888
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:28,040
We must not choose
Lady Hong, Your Highness.

889
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,540
How so?

890
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:31,190
Her face brings bad luck.

891
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:34,780
She got the highest score for the
face reading during the first round.

892
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,780
It is because she was
the queen before...

893
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,490
Let's be honest.

894
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,800
Is there anyone who doesn’t question
that Lady Hong is the dead queen?

895
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,560
She's a shrewd woman mocking the
royals by faking her identity.

896
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,870
Is there evidence that
she faked her identity?

897
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:54,760
It cannot be more obvious.

898
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,630
Bring the evidence.

899
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,470
Enter the palace before me.

900
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:07,210
I will join you right away.

901
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:10,420
Yes, Father. I'll be waiting.

902
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,220
His Excellency.

903
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,270
Someone came from the palace.

904
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,120
Father.

905
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,100
It's probably nothing
serious. Don't worry.

906
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:28,730
Tell Gae Pyeong to be
prepared. I'll contact him.

907
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:29,920
Yes.

908
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:39,070
Your Majesty.

909
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:41,950
Why did you summon me?

910
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:47,900
Your Majesty.

911
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,130
Bring me Kang Yi Soo's wife.

912
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,290
What do you mean by that?

913
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:59,360
I know that you want to reveal
Kang Yi Soo's wife in front of everyone.

914
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,920
I know what your
intention is as well.

915
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,050
Forgive me, but

916
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:11,080
I cannot do that.

917
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,110
You cannot?

918
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:13,710
Lady Hong is...

919
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:19,530
I mean, Kang Yi Soo's daughter
committed high treason.

920
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:22,400
Proving her crime for
fooling the royal court

921
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,540
is my duty as your servant.

922
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,390
Are you truly my servant?

923
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,160
You dare ignore the king's order.

924
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,340
How does that make
you my servant?

925
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,550
Your Majesty.

926
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:38,950
Please consider my patriotism.

927
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:40,640
I'm saying this out of

928
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,710
my loyalty to the royal
court and Your Majesty.

929
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:45,830
That is not loyalty, but greed!

930
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:48,390
I...

931
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:53,080
am no longer a young prince who
was afraid of your threats.

932
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,440
Is that so?

933
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:02,750
May I dare to make
a deal with you then?

934
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:11,150
Please accept my daughter

935
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:14,810
as the queen, Your Majesty!

936
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,400
What?

937
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,950
If you do that,

938
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:22,650
I will give you Kang Yi Soo's wife.

939
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:26,420
The woman who pretended to be
Hong Yeon will save her life too.

940
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:28,430
What if I won't accept it?

941
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:31,150
It will go as you expected.

942
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:33,570
The mother and daughter
will face each other

943
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,770
and both of them will
follow the path of

944
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:39,970
Kang Yi Soo, who
committed high treason.

945
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:43,030
Everything has already
been prepared.

946
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:44,670
Go ahead.

947
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:48,170
I will pay back what
I received no matter what!

948
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Your Majesty.

949
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,100
When making deals,

950
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:58,590
you must hide what the
most precious is to you.

951
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:00,640
The moment you reveal it,

952
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,200
your opponent will take
advantage of that.

953
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,430
But...

954
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:09,340
you already showed me

955
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,970
what your weakness is.

956
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,200
I will take you to the
announcement room.

957
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,880
Follow me.

958
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:16,600
Here comes His Majesty!

959
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,160
King.

960
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,580
This is where the ladies of the
royal family choose the queen.

961
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,630
You should not be here.

962
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:32,310
Is the result of the
selection written there?

963
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:33,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

964
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,200
- Bring it to me.
- King!

965
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,800
What are you doing?

966
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:50,230
[ Announcement: Governor Hong Ki Ho's
daughter has been selected as the queen ]

967
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,930
What are you doing right now?

968
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,950
Lady Hong cannot
become the queen.

969
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:02,150
She is already selected
as the queen.

970
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:03,770
That cannot be.

971
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,490
[ Queen: Love and War ]

972
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:46,800
I need to bring back
Kang Yi Soo's wife safely.

973
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,260
Your dream won't turn out
to be true this time.

974
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:50,890
I think I changed the dream.

975
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:52,340
Please stop caring for me.

976
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:53,600
I'm the king's woman now.

977
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,130
I will only bring trouble to
you and His Majesty.

978
01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:00,450
He will slowly run out of breath
and die with paralysis.

979
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:02,710
