00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,650
Why will you not tell
me to believe you?

3
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,360
Beg me to believe you just once.

4
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,130
How could I do that?

5
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,820
That would only make
you suffer more.

6
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,620
But what if I still want to
try to believe you?

7
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,080
If only that's possible,

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,920
I will...

9
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,530
only love you for the
rest of my life.

10
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,240
Do not follow me inside.

11
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,820
Your Highness.

12
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,800
What is your real name?

13
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,020
It is Eun Bo.

14
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,370
Kang Eun Bo.

15

Kang Eun Bo.

17
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,810
It has been so hard

18
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,330
to finally hear that name.

19
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,060
Eun Bo.

20
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,730
I will not lose you.

21
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,630
I will keep you by my side.

22
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,750
Promise me one thing.

23
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,820
Promise me that you will always be

24
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,360
your true self,

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,910
Kang Eun Bo at least in front of me.

26
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

27
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,990
I will do that.

28
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,230
By the way,

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,500
I found out where
your mother is staying.

30
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,390
I sent Han Mo there.

31
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,830
Let's trust him and wait.

32
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,490
Is that true?

33
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,290
She is probably safe, is she not?

34
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,240
Do not worry.

35
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,570
It will be okay.

36
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,030
Aren't you the one

37
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,630
who helped me and
Lady Hong Yeon last time?

38
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,600
I was sent here by His Majesty.

39
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,370
It might be dangerous
if you stay here.

40
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,290
You must find a
different place to stay.

41
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,940
Please follow me.

42
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,250
Pardon?

43
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,870
Why all of a sudden...

44
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,670
Is His Excellency Baek Ja Yong
also aware?

45
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,160
He told His Majesty
about this place himself.

[ Theory of Enlightenment ]

47
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,220
I have no other regrets.

48

[ Theory of Enlightenment ]
But...

49
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,290
for what I did to you
and your daughter,

50
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,880
I will apologize to you
in person soon.

51
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,070
I think I need to go back.

52
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,030
I can't leave His Excellency
Baek Ja Yong like this.

53
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,000
Pardon?

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,300
- Sir.
- You should follow me.

55
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,300
The rest can head to
the dock ahead of us.

56
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,500
Yes, sir.

58

My Lady.

The wind is cold tonight.

61
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,770
Do you feel better now?

62
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,310
Yes.

63
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,370
I'm your servant now
whether I live or die.

64
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,920
You took me in instead
of abandoning me.

65
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,760
I'm so thankful for that.

66
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,150
Let's thank His Majesty
instead of thanking me.

67
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,420
I made him suffer too much.

68
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,500
It is shameless of me to say this,

69
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,800
but I will make up for it by his side.

70
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,390
So...

71
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,900
Yeo Wool, you should also
help me by my side.

72
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,540
The conjugal visit has
been rescheduled.

73
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,240
This is from your father.

74
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,910
It's a high-end musk pouch.

75
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,950
He told me to give it to you
for the conjugal visit.

76
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,200
- Put it away.
- Your Highness.

77
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,310
What is the point of all this?

78
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,840
In any case, he will not come to me.

79
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,780
He does not even look at me.

80
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,150
He treats me so coldly,

81
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,470
but he mentions
Consort Hong all the time.

82
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,750
What is so great about that woman?

83
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,710
What is it?

84
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,060
Your Highness, are you all right?

85
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,250
Please calm down, Your Highness!

86
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,060
Your Majesty.

87
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,420
I have not heard of
the sinner's death.

88
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,340
By the way, Your Majesty...

89
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,190
Where are you headed to?

90
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,230
Let's go to Consort Hong's chamber.

91
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,600
There is something I
did not get to ask her.

92
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,510
You could have summoned her.

93
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,510
That means you must
be the weak one.

94
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,660
They say the one who is
more in love is the weak one.

95
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,530
It is important to play
games in relationships.

96
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,830
But you are the one who
is desperate all the time.

97
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,840
What does a eunuch know?

98
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,500
- Listen to yourself.
- Your Majesty.

99
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
That is a strong prejudice.

100
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,000
When I was about five years old,
I met my first love

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,330
and was the talk of the town
before becoming a eunuch...

102
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,040
Your Majesty, I am telling the truth!

103
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,530
What are you doing out here?

104
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,160
Were you waiting
for me by chance?

105
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,500
Not precisely, but...

106
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,190
I am happy to see you here.

107
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,450
Would you like to take a walk?

108
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,320
Well, the thing is...

109
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,310
There are many eyes around us.

110
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,700
I feel a bit self-conscious
walking by your side.

111
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,780
Is it because of the Queen?

112
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,660
Not at all.

113
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,360
I just feel...

114
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,910
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

115
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,890
Eun Ki...

116
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,570
Where is your sister's body?

117
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,130
I buried her near Choan Mountain.

118
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,530
There was a reason why
I could not find her body.

119
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,380
I want to make her a proper grave.

120
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,040
Because I thought Eun Ki was you,

121
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,790
her fate was switched around.

122
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,960
My heart is heavy for it.

123
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,390
It is not your fault.

124
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,090
I am sure being on the boat

125
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,350
and floating a lantern with you

126
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,060
must have been
a happy memory to her.

127
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,740
Since we could not reveal
that we were twins,

128
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,220
we had to stay inside the
house since we were young.

129
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,620
You could not reveal
that you were twins?

130
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,660
Aside from my family,

131
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,890
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong
was the only one who knew.

132
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,250
Your Majesty.

133
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,160
What will happen to
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong?

134
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,730
May I ask you that?

135
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,600
What are you doing?

136
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,700
Sir.

137
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,180
Why are you here...

138
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,710
You can't come here right now.

139
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,520
You should've left
Hanyang already!

140
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,740
I'm here to take you with me.

141
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,110
I prepared a horse nearby.
Please come with me...

142
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,720
I will get arrested before that.

143
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,680
That will put you in danger too.

144
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,200
- Please go without me.
- Your Excellency.

145
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,610
I've already made up my mind.

146
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,600
Please safely hide and
plan for the future.

147
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,000
Hurry!

148
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,780
Why...

149
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,670
Why are you doing this?

150
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,020
I'm...

151
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,820
not as great of a prince
as you think I am.

152
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,440
Why are you determined
to die for me?

153
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,500
You saved me from
my father's violence

154
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,700
and hunger when I was a child,

155
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,100
but I...

156
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,970
betrayed you.

157
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,230
What do you mean?

158
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,330
Before the assassination
during the royal procession,

159
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,120
I made a deal with
Jo Heung Gyeon secretly.

160
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,300
He came to see me in Jemulpo.

161
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,760
Wouldn't you like to become
the new king for the country?

162
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,000
What? What is this?

163
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,900
The King is alive and well.

164
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,730
Don't utter such words!

165
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,060
I heard in the near future,

166
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,890
some unidentified assailants
would carry guns

167
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,580
and ambush the King.

168
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,180
Wouldn't we need a new
king if that happens?

169
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,490
Ambush?

170
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,590
Is that really true?

171
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,400
He asked me if I wanted
to become the new king.

172
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,300
And I said yes.

173
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,100
We've been invaded!

174
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,040
Since I tempted the throne,

175
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,950
I made a deal with a man who's
opposed to our greater cause.

176
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,330
That's who I really am.

177
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,220
I wanted to become...

178
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,280
the king to take revenge on the
royals instead of the greater cause.

179
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,460
I'm cowardly and cunning.

180
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,920
That's the kind of person I am.

181
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,960
It was important to become
the king and seize power.

182
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,150
I can imagine how you felt.

183
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,360
I can understand that.

184
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,020
Ever since I met you
a long time ago,

185
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,630
I only had one master.

186
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,580
Since you grew up as
a powerless citizen,

187
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,220
I'm sure...

188
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,850
you would've become a king who
empathizes with the people's pain.

189
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,840
We've been invaded!
Search everywhere!

190
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,890
Sir!

191
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,530
Please leave now.

192
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,220
Take him away!

193
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,210
No!

194
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,750
I can't go by myself!

195
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,390
Take him away now!

196
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,560
Over there!

197
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,820
Sir.

198
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,230
Please achieve something great.

199
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,200
Sir, we need to go.

200
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,400
Hurry up!

201
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,290
We need to go now!

202
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,730
Hurry!

203
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,450
Sir!

204
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,850
Hurry!

205
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,600
The guards chased after the Prince,
but they could not capture him.

206
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,400
And Baek Ja Yong
committed suicide.

207
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,920
All right.

208
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,040
Your Majesty.

209
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,300
Baek Ja Yong is nothing but
a traitor who tempted the throne.

210
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,400
Please do not let someone
like him trouble you.

211
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,690
Although his method was wrong,

212
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,600
he dreamed of a good world.

213
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,490
If he started a world
like that with me,

214
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,580
it would have been good.

215
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,300
I find it to be a shame.

216
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,750
Free Wal tomorrow and
summon Hong Ki Ho.

217
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,090
And we must keep

218
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,370
tracking down the Prince.

219
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,930
Although the group disbanded,
there must be some remnants left.

220
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

221
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,480
Your Majesty, it's Han Mo.

222
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,990
How about Kang Yi Soo's wife?
Was she at Chunggye Temple?

223
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,920
Yes.

224
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,180
I brought her and let her stay
at my house for now.

225
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,630
What should I do?

226
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,800
Good work.

227
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,790
Let her rest since it is late at night.

228
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,550
Let her meet with Consort Hong
when the day breaks.

229
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

230
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,790
I am so relieved to hear that

231
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,390
she was there safely.

232
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,430
Yes.

233
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,900
Thankfully, Baek Ja Yong
did not tell me a lie.

234
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,800
He trusted us with the greater cause and
left the way he intended to, sir.

235
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,460
Are you keeping that stuff safely?

236
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,520
Yes.

237
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,300
Here. It's called a motherwort.

238
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,210
I heard it's a medicine that women
who want to conceive avoid.

239
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,460
Good work.

240
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,630
Deliver it safely to the Consort.

241
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,620
Yes.

242
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,100
Father!

243
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,060
Father, Father.

244
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,000
How dare you come home now
after being gone all night?

245
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,750
Will you throw away the head of
the Bureau position I got you?

246
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,700
Speaking of which, the
Inspection Bureau head...

247
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,800
Not me, but the previous
one, Baek Ja Yong

248
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,300
committed treason with
the Prince but failed

249
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,100
- and killed himself!
- What?

250
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,400
- Treason?
- Yes.

251
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,760
I heard His Excellency Baek Ja Yong

252
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,240
ended up killing himself.

253
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,800
My Lady.

254
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,950
Officer Han is here.

255
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,890
Mother.

256
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,740
Eun Bo.

257
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,760
His Majesty told me
to bring her here.

258
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,460
Are you all right?

259
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,880
Did you get injured at all?

260
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,300
You told His Majesty that you're...

261
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,200
Eun Ki's twin sister?

262
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,720
Yes.

263
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,980
Why are you so surprised?

264
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,700
It's nothing.

265
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,880
Anyway,

266
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,370
what is going on?

267
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,150
You became a concubine using
Lady Hong Yeon's name?

268
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,510
Mother.

269
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,690
Please trust me and wait a bit.

270
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,910
I will make sure to clear
Father and Eun Ki's name.

271
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,040
Are you trying to do something?

272
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,800
Eun Bo.

273
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,120
I'm just happy that I found you.

274
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,520
If you're put into danger too,

275
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,080
I won't be able to live.

276
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,560
Do not worry.

277
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,700
His Majesty is there to protect me.

278
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,940
I would like to be helpful to
him in return as well.

279
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,270
Since we can't foresee
what's coming,

280
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,630
we should split up
and act individually.

281
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,560
I'll get back in touch
when the time comes.

282
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,790
So keep a low profile
in the meantime.

283
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,620
Yes, sir!

284
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,650
The people are talking
in the market.

285
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,980
That the Prince and
Baek Ja Yong are traitors.

286
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,930
They say to know a person's mind is impossible
like knowing what's deep under the sea.

287
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,610
I remember the day
I took you to Jemulpo

288
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,050
with me to meet with the Prince.

289
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,330
I'm talking about the day

290
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,130
I asked the Prince if he'd like
to become the new king.

291
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,350
I had no idea that he was a beast

292
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,280
raised by Baek Ja Yong.

293
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,490
Yes.

294
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,490
We should release our men to

295
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,330
search for the Prince as well.

296
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,220
We must not let him get
caught by the King

297
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,950
and talk about what
happened that day.

298
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,320
Yes.

299
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,640
What happened to the owner
of the Buyong Agency?

300
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,060
Now, let me think.

301
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,970
If Officer Kim is a spy at
Royal Investigation Bureau...

302
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,650
What does that mean exactly?

303
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,020
Seriously...

304
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,650
Aigoo, you came.

305
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,110
Come out.

306
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,390
The King ordered to free you.

307
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,800
If so...

308
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,130
how about Consort Hong?

309
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,910
You will know when you come out.

310
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,630
Hey!

311
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,070
My Lady.

312
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,710
Wal.

313
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,200
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

314
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,540
You keep suffering
because of me.

315
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,760
Aigoo, come on.

316
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,160
Please. You're embarrassing me.

317
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,350
I'm fine.

318
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,620
You're okay now, right?

319
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,000
Don't worry.

320
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,100
Is it true that the Prince
and Baek Ja Yong

321
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,540
committed treason together?

322
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,390
Wow, I didn't think the Prince
would be like that.

323
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,420
I got the chills all over my body.

324
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,070
Anyway, I found out something
while being locked up.

325
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,830
But I had no one to tell it to.

326
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,400
Find out? What?

327
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,810
The spy at the Bureau!

328
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,700
The one that's planted
by Jo Heung Gyeon!

329
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,170
Shut your mouth.

330
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,570
Report it to His Majesty first...

331
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,050
Did you say Jo Heung Gyeon?

332
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,940
What are you talking about?

333
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:00,590
The owner of the Buyong Agency
hasn't returned to the Bureau yet.

334
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,930
It's a poisonous needle.

335
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,300
If he comes back, stab him
when you get a chance.

336
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,880
You must know how since
you've done it before.

337
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,980
The cause of death...

338
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,230
seems to have been a poisonous
needle, Your Highness.

339
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,600
That man was practically dead
from the torture, but...

340
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,030
Are you telling me to kill
someone alive and well?

341
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,440
Return Wal back to the Bureau first

342
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,160
and have him watch the one
who's suspected to be the spy.

343
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

344
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,100
Forgive me, but Wal suddenly told
Consort Hong about the spy.

345
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,790
I couldn't stop him.

346
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,770
I was going to tell her about
the culprit soon anyway.

347
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,350
I will take care of that myself.

348
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,300
So you may leave now.

349
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,600
Yes.

350
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,540
Your Majesty.

351
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,940
Hong Ki Ho, the governor
of Gyeonggi is here.

352
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,700
Let him in.

353
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,400
I already did something
unforgivable against you.

354
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,090
I will pay for my sin with death.

355
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,130
Why did you turn your back
against the Prince?

356
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,820
I heard from Baek Ja Yong.

357
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,400
I suspected that...

358
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,450
when you asked me to understand

359
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,930
Consort Hong's true
intention last time too.

360
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,940
At the last minute,

361
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,790
I thought their way was wrong.

362
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,210
If so,

363
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,700
should you not prove that?

364
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,150
I will hang onto your life, which you
are willing to give up.

365
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,820
So I want you to return that favor

366
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,090
to the people of the
country instead.

367
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,870
Work for me and devote
yourself to the people.

368
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,320
Prove that they were
wrong that way.

369
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,250
But Your Majesty...

370
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:35,360
How could you be so
generous to a sinner?

371
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,040
There is another thing
you can do for me.

372
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,440
Please temporarily take care
of Kang Yi Soo's wife,

373
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,240
who has been held
hostage by Baek Ja Yong.

374
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,120
Since she stayed with
your daughter before,

375
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,980
I do not think it is too much to ask.

376
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
Yes.

377
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,100
That is not difficult to do, but...

378
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,680
Your Majesty!

379
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,900
Thank you in advance then.

380
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,870
Please leave now.

381
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,920
Isn't this Consort Hong?

382
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,170
I've always wanted to meet you.

383
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,350
But why...

384
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,740
Because I have a request for you.

385
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,030
His Majesty and the Queen's conjugal
visit is coming up in three days.

386
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:53,330
Could you ask His Majesty to

387
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,210
visit the Queen's Palace that day?

388
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,600
That is up to His Majesty to decide.

389
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,280
It seems His Majesty is
forgetting one thing.

390
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,120
That as long as a certain
woman is by his side,

391
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,510
that would always
become his weakness.

392
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,700
So allow me to thank
you in advance.

393
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,680
Everyone...

394
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,780
has a weakness.

395
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,630
We should wait and see whose

396
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,160
weakness will become
more vulnerable.

397
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,660
You must have already heard
from the Queen Mother's Palace.

398
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,400
Brew this into a tea
and keep serving it

399
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,900
to your masters, the Queen
and Consort Hong.

400
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,900
You will be rewarded
handsomely every month.

401
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,480
I knew it.

402
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,300
It was you, Yong Ho.

403
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,520
What are you doing right now?

404
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,270
I haven't seen you in a while.

405
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,500
I was so happy to see you.

406
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,200
Well, sir...

407
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,600
Since Chief is not here today,

408
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,720
shall we start the day
with some drinks?

409
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,230
It's on me!

410
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,020
Don't be like that. Let's go.

411
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,230
Let me treat you.

412
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,800
Let's go! I know a place.

413
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,160
Her Royal Highness the
Queen wants to see you.

414
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,460
Your Majesty.

415
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,050
Have you been having
trouble sleeping lately?

416
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,600
Why do you ask?

417
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,130
Your pulse is slow and irregular.

418
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,580
Your energy is off balance

419
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,110
as if you haven't slept in a while.

420
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,980
That is also the reason why

421
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,230
you felt dizzy all of a sudden.

422
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,990
Is it serious?

423
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,810
He is fine for now,

424
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:03,090
but it'd be dangerous
if the condition persists.

425
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,800
Firstly, I will make you tonic
that helps with sleeping.

426
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,400
Try to avoid overworking

427
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,160
and try to sleep soundly.

428
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,640
You told me that

429
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,180
His Majesty will reveal the truth

430
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,700
and you will receive your
punishment, did you not?

431
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,330
I summoned you since
I have not heard any news yet.

432
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,750
Show me.

433
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,770
Whatever that truth might be.

434
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,480
And what your sin is.

435
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,450
By chance, do you know

436
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,240
what your father has done to me

437
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,030
as well?

438
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,490
What?

439
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,810
He did something terrible to me.

440
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,640
And also to His Majesty.

441
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,800
Your father...

442
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,500
- made His Majesty...
- Shut your mouth!

443
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,410
He told me to persuade
His Majesty

444
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,300
and help him visit the
Queen's Palace.

445
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,370
I told you to tell the truth.

446
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,540
What are you talking
about now?

447
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,270
Byeol, are you out there?

448
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,610
Yes, Your Highness.

449
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,590
Prepare a Dalcho.
[ Dalcho: hitting one's calves with a stick ]

450
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,670
She is not willing to confess.

451
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,010
I should discipline
her with beating.

452
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,380
You, right there.

453
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,260
Aren't you the Queen's
palace lady?

454
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,410
What are those things
you are holding?

455
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,850
Well...

456
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,770
the Queen ordered us
to run an errand.

457
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,140
It looks like they are for
disciplining someone.

458
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,760
But what for?

459
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,150
Will you not answer?

460
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,880
I asked you why the Queen
needs disciplining sticks.

461
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,450
The thing is...

462
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,080
She wants to punish Consort Hong.

463
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,810
What?

464
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,260
Your Majesty.

465
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,620
Cold air is not good
for your health.

466
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,790
The physician told you so.

467
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,680
You need to take a rest.

468
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,540
If you keep having
those dreams,

469
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,270
your body might become weak.

470
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,190
I wonder if it is because
of those dreams.

471
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:38,800
Summon the priestess
discreetly when it gets dark.

472
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

473
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,800
Your Majesty.

474
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,900
Forgive me for
approaching you rudely.

475
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,620
It is because I was so
worried about Consort Hong.

476
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,390
What do you mean by that?

477
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,020
The thing is...

478
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,980
Her Highness the Queen is...

479
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,900
Lift your skirt.

480
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,710
Did you not hear what I said?

481
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,880
Stand up and lift your skirt!

482
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,130
How dare you?

483
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,450
Should I force you to stand up?

484
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,440
- Byeol.
- Yes, Your Highness.

485
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,940
What are you doing?

486
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,700
Stop! Let go of me!

487
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,150
His Majesty is here!

488
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,030
What are you doing right now?

489
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,160
Your Majesty.

490
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,510
The thing is...

491
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,440
I am trying to maintain the
order within the inner court.

492
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,770
What?

493
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,870
The order?

494
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,880
What did Consort Hong do to you

495
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,770
and why was she house arrested?

496
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,510
I need to know.

497
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,100
If she gave you a drug that
could have harmed you...

498
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,940
Everyone, leave us!

499
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,180
Are you all right?

500
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,180
The Queen raised
a disciplining stick?

501
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,850
Against Consort Hong?

502
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,300
Yes. She had to let out her anger.

503
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,560
She is more daring
than I thought.

504
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,990
Something even I do not do.

505
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,920
By the way, why did
you tell King about it?

506
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,700
I should at least pretend to be
friendly with Consort Hong

507
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,340
to get His Majesty's attention.

508
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,750
That's right.

509
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,430
And if His Majesty grows
to hate the Queen more,

510
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,220
that would be a good thing
for Consort Kim too.

511
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,230
If King distances the Queen more,

512
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,440
would he not get closer
to Consort Hong?

513
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,970
Do not worry.

514
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,690
That is why we are
using motherwort.

515
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:06,000
So, did you deliver the medicine
to each chamber safely?

516
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,100
Yes.

517
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,870
What do you mean,
an aphrodisiac?

518
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,790
What nonsense is that?

519
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,020
If so...

520
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,430
what was the drug you made
Officer Han examine?

521
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,730
Are you spying on me now?

522
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,160
There are hundreds and thousands
of eyes in the palace.

523
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,360
You know that better than anyone.

524
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,880
Nobody knows why Consort Hong
was under house arrest.

525
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,200
That is why there
are vulgar rumors.

526
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,710
Please tell me.

527
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,850
I examined the drug
that Baek Ja Yong

528
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,670
and the Prince used to try
to assassinate me.

529
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,310
Consort Hong's house arrest was

530
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,740
to protect her in case they
try to hurt someone

531
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,390
I cherish the most.

532
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,570
Cherish the most?

533
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,060
Are you satisfied?

534
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,900
I will never forgive this
unruly behavior ever again.

535
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,650
This will be the last time

536
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,870
I will be warning you as well.

537
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,700
Why is it always that woman?

538
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,050
What is she to you exactly?

539
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,040
How about me?

540
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,570
I always...

541
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,180
had my eyes for you.

542
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,940
I do not know about politics.

543
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,340
I did not participate in the
selection for my family, either.

544
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,840
I just...

545
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,090
wanted to become your wife.

546
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,800
A wife of someone I love.

547
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,160
Do I deserve to be treated
so coldly for that?

548
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,570
Do you not...

549
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,120
find me pitiful at all?

550
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,700
I do.

551
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,220
I pity that you tempted
something that is not yours

552
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,500
and became miserable.

553
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,140
What do you mean,
what is not mine?

554
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,700
This spot indeed belongs to me.

555
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,930
No.

556
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,240
You will go back to
where you belong.

557
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,650
What...

558
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,210
does that mean?

559
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,480
Did you get hurt at all?

560
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,690
No, I am all right.

561
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,480
I heard Wal told you
about the culprit.

562
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,930
Why did you not tell me?

563
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,620
I was worried that you
might feel tormented

564
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,210
and enraged while serving
the culprit's daughter.

565
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,190
And why is it okay for
you to endure that pain?

566
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,000
Please share your pain
with me from now on.

567
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,850
I would like to share in your pain.

568
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,910
Byeol.

569
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,170
Byeol!

570
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,850
Yes, Your Highness.

571
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,840
Send a message to
Father right now...

572
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,100
No.

573
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,800
No, I cannot.

574
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,050
Your Highness.

575
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,450
I need to step outside
the palace secretly.

576
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:37,170
But you are the Queen!
Go where?

577
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,630
You are not allowed to leave
the palace without approval.

578
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,790
Prepare a court lady's
uniform and a litter discreetly.

579
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,960
Pardon?

580
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,640
I heard Baek Ja Yong
committed treason.

581
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,720
Is that true?

582
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,770
Yes, it is.

583
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,510
I'm thinking of presenting
a young woman for the selection.

584
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,830
I'd like you to take care of her.

585
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,700
By the way,

586
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,210
what does he want to see me for?

587
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,770
You will find out once
you get there.

588
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:36,940
The side effects of prophetic
dreams you mentioned last time...

589
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,380
Pardon?

590
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,370
Prophetic dreams...

591
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

592
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,370
You said one's body
becomes weak, did you not?

593
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,060
What happens afterward?

594
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,710
Can one become weak
all of a sudden?

595
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,680
Since...

596
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:00,900
not anyone has the ability
to have prophetic dreams,

597
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,210
it will not be considered unusual

598
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,950
even if something happens.

599
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,100
Then, is there a way to
relieve the symptoms?

600
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,850
One way is to perform
an exorcism.

601
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:20,020
I have done it a long time ago.

602
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,910
It drives away the dreams.

603
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,240
You mean it stops you from
having prophetic dreams?

604
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,720
Yes.

605
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,360
Forgive me for asking this,

606
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,370
but why do you ask me that?

607
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,000
Just answer my questions.

608
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,530
You should not speak
of this meeting either.

609
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,050
And not to the
Queen Dowager either.

610
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,550
Yes.

611
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,380
I will follow your order.

612
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,900
Who's inside?

613
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,800
She's the court lady
of the Queen's Palace.

614
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,400
She's stepping out urgently for
an errand given by the Queen.

615
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,680
Go ahead.

616
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,010
Brother Gae Pyeong.

617
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,390
What are you doing here?

618
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,500
You could have just come in.
Why ask me to come out?

619
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,940
The Queen would like
to see you discreetly.

620
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,320
Follow me.

621
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,920
It's late at night.

622
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,930
Is it okay for you to be out?

623
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,980
I have a favor to ask.

624
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,390
What could the Queen need
from someone like me?

625
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,570
It's something only you can do.

626
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,270
You're the only one
who could do it.

627
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,300
Please...

628
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,600
- get rid of Consort Hong.
- Your Highness.

629
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,580
She might know everything.

630
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,790
No, she indeed knows everything.

631
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,030
She knows that Father
tried to kill her

632
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,800
and His Majesty.

633
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,640
And His Majesty is...

634
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,390
trying to replace me
with Consort Hong...

635
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,480
I just need to get rid of her.

636
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,290
If so, His Majesty

637
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,210
will not say that he will turn
things back to normal.

638
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,800
So please get rid of that
woman, Gae Pyeong.

639
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,300
- I cannot do that.
- What?

640
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,720
Please talk to
His Excellency about this.

641
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,490
He will find a solution for you.

642
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,420
I cannot talk to Father.

643
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,590
He will put His Majesty
into danger again!

644
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,940
I will give you
everything you want.

645
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,610
I can do anything.

646
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,890
Please just this once, please?

647
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,510
I cannot do anything without
His Excellency's order.

648
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,140
Please pull yourself together.

649
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,970
I said I would never let us
get revealed, did I not?

650
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,570
I just want that woman...

651
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:19,070
to disappear in front of me.

652
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:24,010
When I see His Majesty
and that woman,

653
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,320
I feel like my heart is
being ripped out.

654
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,190
I cannot do this anymore.

655
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,020
I...

656
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,960
I cannot do this anymore.

657
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,100
If you cannot do it, I will do it.

658
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,700
I will do it with my own hands.

659
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,100
- Your Highness.
- So answer me.

660
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,130
That you will do it for me.

661
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,200
It is noisy inside and outside the palace
because of the Prince and Baek Ja Yong.

662
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,900
I suspect whether they are related
to the assassination as well.

663
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,500
I do not think that is true.

664
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,000
What proof do you have
to think that?

665
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,600
I was curious about
what is on your mind.

666
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,900
Did you forget about your promises

667
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,060
since you became a concubine?

668
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,110
You said you would find the culprit
and punish him yourself.

669
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,200
If you gave up on that,

670
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,460
you should only focus
on your duty as a concubine.

671
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,140
But if that is not true,

672
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,010
you will have to tell me what

673
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,340
you and King's plan is.

674
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,780
Your Highness.

675
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,340
Forgive me, but perhaps you
should ask His Majesty directly...

676
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,080
So...

677
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,940
something is indeed
going on, huh?

678
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,620
Your Highness, the Queen is here.

679
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,200
Let her in.

680
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,300
Let us talk some other time.

681
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,530
Yes.

682
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,510
Why are you coming out
of this chamber?

683
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:26,240
I just came to greet her.

684
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,800
I did not tell her anything.
So do not worry.

685
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:30,740
What?

686
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,780
The fact that you tried
to discipline me.

687
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:34,490
Your Highness.

688
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,880
Great Royal Dowager Queen
is waiting for you.

689
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,520
Please go inside.

690
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:56,300
You want to step outside
for a Gijaeurye?
[ Gijaeurye: conception ritual ]

691
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,430
You want to do that yourself?

692
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,240
Yes.

693
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,050
I heard there is a famous rock
in Inwang Mountain.

694
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:06,460
I would like to get energized physically
and spiritually before the conjugal visit.

695
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,800
- Please allow me.
- You may not.

696
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,000
If you really want to,
send the priestess instead.

697
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,900
No one else can be
as desperate as me.

698
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,000
Grandmother.

699
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,190
You are aware that

700
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,980
His Majesty is ignoring
the Queen's Palace.

701
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:29,230
It is an embarrassing
wish I have as a wife.

702
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,730
I just want to...

703
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,900
get his attention no
matter what it takes.

704
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,210
How could anyone
pray in my place?

705
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,780
I understand.

706
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,820
Go ahead then.

707
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,460
I have another request.

708
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,590
Please let me go out
with the concubines.

709
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,650
You want to take the
concubines with you?

710
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:57,780
Why is that necessary?

711
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,890
Since I have been
feeling anxious lately,

712
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:02,850
I was not able to be
generous to them.

713
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,360
We are serving His Majesty
together, after all.

714
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,260
I would like to become close to
them using this opportunity.

715
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,660
Nothing could be better
if we could pray

716
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,500
for the prosperity of
the royals together.

717
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,830
If so...

718
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:19,100
- tell His Majesty about it...
- No, Grandmother.

719
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,520
What if that makes him
hate me more?

720
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:27,150
If only you could allow me
to as the elder...

721
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,510
Your Majesty.

722
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,820
Please let the priestess
perform an exorcism.

723
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,890
Even if you do not have
prophetic dreams,

724
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:49,770
nothing dangerous will happen
to Consort Hong anymore.

725
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,290
I hope that is true.

726
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:53,960
I am sure it is.

727
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,070
She is inside the palace

728
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,580
and by your side.

729
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:03,070
I am sure she would like you
to take care of your body.

730
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:09,800
So as I, Officer Han, and
Great Royal Dowager Queen.

731
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,890
Let me think about it.

732
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,240
Gijaeurye?

733
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,250
She wants to do that tomorrow?

734
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,320
Yes.

735
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,380
The Queen's Palace
sent a message.

736
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,520
I heard the Queen Dowager
already approved as well.

737
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,260
She wants the concubines to
get ready and come along as well.

738
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,050
Why all of a sudden...

739
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,400
Tomorrow noon at the
entrance of Inwang Mountain.

740
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,770
In the near future,

741
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,600
I will come up with an excuse to leave
the palace with the concubines.

742
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,590
And I will contact you
through Byeol.

743
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,100
You should attack me
then as well.

744
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,800
- Your Highness.
- Do as I say.

745
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,880
I need to get attacked as
well to avoid any suspicion.

746
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,750
There will be minimal security.

747
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,280
Run as soon as you are done.

748
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,540
Understand?

749
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,400
Are you telling me to hurt
you with my own hands?

750
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,810
Please do.

751
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,360
You are the only one I got now.

752
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,890
Brother Gae Pyeong.

753
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,420
Her Highness wants
a clear answer from you.

754
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,820
Tell her...

755
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,800
I'll follow her order.

756
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,000
Yes.

757
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,760
You came, sir.

758
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,980
Isn't that Byeol who
just passed by?

759
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,570
Yes.

760
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,970
She stopped by to pick up
something for Her Highness.

761
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,400
You said you prepared an army?

762
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,490
Yes.

763
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,670
They are training as
hard as they can.

764
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,010
Let's go inside.

765
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,360
Yes.

766
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:35,900
Chief Eunuch Hwang!

767
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,490
Is Chief Eunuch Hwang out there?

768
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,970
His Majesty is here.

769
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:55,490
Your Majesty!

770
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,400
Your Majesty, what is the matter?

771
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,600
I had a dream.

772
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,200
You got shot in my dream...

773
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,050
Did you have a nightmare?

774
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,800
What happened to me
in your dream?

775
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,800
Never mind.

776
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,020
I just had a nightmare.

777
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,480
Make sure not to leave
the palace for a while.

778
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,300
- Do you understand?
- Pardon?

779
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,300
I have to go on a Gijaeurye
with the Queen tomorrow.

780
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,800
What? You must not!

781
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,640
What is the matter, Your Majesty?

782
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,290
Outside the palace,

783
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,720
someone is trying to harm you.

784
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,600
What do you mean,
harm me? Who is that?

785
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,490
How did you know that
I will be in danger?

786
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,000
No, actually...

787
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,600
if the Queen's Palace
is planning that,

788
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,000
- all the more reason to go.
- What?

789
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,140
It might be a chance to
catch Jo Heung Gyeon.

790
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:09,720
Are you suggesting putting yourself
in danger to catch the culprit?

791
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,910
I just need to be there
when we leave.

792
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,710
If I say something is wrong
with my litter on the way,

793
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,400
I will be able to cause a delay.

794
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:20,080
And I can return to the
palace like that.

795
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,580
You cannot.

796
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,010
It is too dangerous.

797
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,210
If I do not come, the Queen
will cancel the plan

798
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:33,270
and we will have to wait for another
chance to catch the culprit.

799
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:36,930
It is something I can do.

800
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,750
It is something only I can do.

801
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:44,530
I will surely return to you safely.

802
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,310
Please trust me.

803
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,190
You are really...

804
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:53,650
Your Majesty.

805
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,620
The assassination will
take place in the mountain.

806
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,460
Would you really be able
to return before that?

807
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,650
Yes.

808
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:05,160
We will have to corner
him tightly so that

809
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,450
Gae Pyeong cannot escape.

810
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,380
Wal could be of help.

811
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,030
Wal?

812
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,660
Please remember one thing.

813
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,150
Your safety is more
important than anything.

814
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,300
You must change the
route on the way.

815
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,900
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

816
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,600
Han Mo.

817
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,140
Go to Wal right now.

818
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,800
Let the spy at the Bureau leak
the information on Gae Pyeong.

819
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,420
If that spy gets scared and
runs to his master tomorrow,

820
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,110
you and Wal must locate
him and chase him.

821
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,760
Do you understand?

822
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

823
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,800
Do you remember me
changing the dream last time?

824
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:01,020
Yes.

825
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:05,200
You prevented Consort Hong
from facing the danger.

826
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:07,330
I need to do the same this time.

827
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:11,260
Nothing will happen.

828
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,830
By the way, Your Majesty...

829
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:15,050
You felt dizzy all of a sudden

830
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,750
when you changed
the dream as well.

831
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,300
Perhaps you should not
change the dream this time.

832
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,430
Stop.

833
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,390
Do not speak anymore.

834
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,400
I am certain that
Officer Kim is the spy.

835
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,100
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm telling you!

836
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,470
I searched everywhere
in his room

837
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:45,030
and found silver coins.
Silver coins!

838
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:47,150
How could an officer
at the Bureau

839
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,730
afford to have silver
coins anyway?

840
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,670
There's no doubt, I'm telling you!

841
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,200
Listen to me carefully now.

842
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:55,300
Yes, yes.

843
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,320
His Majesty ordered
you to do something.

844
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,790
What is it?

845
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,100
I need to tell you
something urgently.

846
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:05,050
Please come to the back alley.

847
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,220
Geez...

848
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,330
You must have shoulder pain.

849
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,520
Well...

850
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,270
I think I slept funny.

851
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,770
You should've been careful.

852
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,020
So, you wanted to
see me privately.

853
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,350
What is it?

854
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,610
You know my background, right?

855
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,880
I was the owner of the Buyong Agency.
The Buyong Agency, I said.

856
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,440
I'd like to give you an
amazing piece of information.

857
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,010
What information?

858
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,790
Look.

859
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:05,300
This is the man who
attacked me here last time.

860
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,730
His name is Gae Pyeong.

861
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:10,570
If you catch him, you are
guaranteed to get promoted!

862
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,020
When did you get that
drawing made?

863
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,030
Come on!

864
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:15,160
That's not important right now!

865
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:20,100
You saw His Majesty's
security guard last time, right?

866
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,900
To tell you the truth,

867
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,400
I'm here because of
His Majesty's order.

868
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,210
But come to think, it'd be
difficult to catch him alone.

869
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,520
But how could I tell this to the
Royal Investigation Bureau?

870
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,350
So apparently...

871
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:36,200
at the Royal Investigation Bureau,

872
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,440
there's a spy. A spy!

873
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:43,650
So...

874
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,470
how am I supposed to
trust anyone?

875
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,640
So...

876
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,430
would you like to...

877
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:52,140
try catching this man?

878
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,560
I'm not sure.

879
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,320
My Lady.

880
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:09,430
You should get ready to go now.

881
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,600
We all serve the King together.

882
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,800
Why should we pray
for her to conceive?

883
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,700
We have a fond memory of
participating in the selection together.

884
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,980
I am sorry that I could not
be friendly to you lately.

885
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,400
Please forgive me
if you were upset.

886
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,840
Let's go out and get
some fresh air together.

887
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:30,600
I am grateful for
your thoughtfulness.

888
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

889
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,480
Let us get going then.

890
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,180
You scared me!

891
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,340
Geez...

892
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,360
The door was unlocked.

893
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,750
I remembered you said to
come here with urgent matters.

894
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:21,360
That owner of Buyong
Agency found out about you.

895
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,900
To what extent?

896
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,500
He knows your name, and he
even had a drawing of your face.

897
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,700
He said he is working
for the King too.

898
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,600
So what would happen to
me if you get caught?

899
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,510
What did you tag along?

900
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:54,510
What are you talking about?

901
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,280
I can't get caught like this.

902
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:03,500
There is something I must do today.

903
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,400
Remember this.

904
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,900
We must catch him alive,
no matter what.

905
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:10,800
Yes.

906
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,950
Chase him!

907
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,300
- Take the spy to the Bureau.
- Pardon?

908
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,080
Report to His Majesty
about the situation.

909
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,520
Excuse me...

910
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,860
Excuse me!

911
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,620
You heard him, right?
Why don't you do that?

912
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:41,430
I have to see him get caught
with my own eyes, okay?

913
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,860
Hey, hey!

914
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,630
Stop the procession for a moment!

915
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,370
What is going on?

916
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:13,300
It looks like something is wrong
with Consort Hong's litter.

917
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,900
Put down the litter.

918
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,360
Put down the litter!

919
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,540
What is going on?

920
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:44,870
The thing is...

921
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:47,260
I think the litter carrier
sprained his ankle

922
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,080
and injured himself.

923
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,360
What?

924
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,100
You should go ahead of me.

925
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,600
We'll take care of the
situation and join you later.

926
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:58,390
No.

927
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,470
We need to arrive by noon when
the mountain energy is the strongest.

928
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:08,120
Consort Hong,

929
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,870
you should leave the
litter and walk with us.

930
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,600
- Pardon?
- Why are you so shocked?

931
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,930
Did I say something wrong?

932
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,200
If you go ahead, we will
hurry and follow you.

933
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,630
- So...
- Walk with us.

934
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:22,810
If you think about it,

935
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:26,450
it is wrong for a concubine to
use a litter like the queen.

936
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,630
If you do not like that,

937
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,840
would you like to use
my litter instead?

938
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,270
Your Highness,
that would be wrong.

939
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,120
Byeol.

940
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:41,510
Put Consort Hong in my litter.

941
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:43,130
I will walk.

942
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:45,380
Consort Hong, what are you doing?

943
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,780
I understand.

944
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,760
I will walk and follow you.

945
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:01,280
Get going!

946
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,890
My Lady.

947
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:00,790
Did Consort Hong come back?

948
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:02,410
I have not heard from her yet.

949
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:04,040
What do you mean, not yet?

950
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,010
She should be back in
the palace by now!

951
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,700
- Go find out.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

952
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,200
S***...

953
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:58,210
The Queen left the palace?

954
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:01,280
Tomorrow is the day chosen
by the Ministry of Royal Affairs!

955
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,190
She should take every
precaution! How could she...

956
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,600
The man ran into the Inwang Mountain,
and Officer Han is chasing him.

957
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,700
We must not lose this
opportunity. We must catch him.

958
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:19,780
Your Majesty!

959
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:23,010
I heard Consort Hong is
following the procession.

960
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:24,400
What?

961
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,460
What are you talking about?

962
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,300
Stop the procession.

963
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,200
Your Highness, we are entering
a mountain trail from here.

964
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,640
You cannot travel in
the litter anymore.

965
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,380
The assassination will take
place in the mountain trail.

966
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:01,600
They say we need to walk
from this point on.

967
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,800
Let us go then.

968
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,830
Just one second.

969
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,570
It's the path you will be on.

970
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:24,100
Perhaps we should send the
guards first and inspect the area.

971
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,200
Please do, Your Highness.
It feels unsafe around here.

972
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:31,570
I appreciate the thought,
but it is not necessary.

973
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,190
Hurry and follow me.

974
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,400
Who are you?

975
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,600
What?

976
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,110
Over there!

977
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,930
I finally get to see you.

978
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:15,170
You're the maniac
who kills people for fun.

979
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,200
Drop the rifle.

980
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,930
Surrender yourself.

981
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,800
No, My Lady!

982
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,100
[ Queen: Love and War ]

983
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,230
The world was about
to become mine!

984
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,300
Do you realize what
you have ruined?

985
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,900
Prepare the soldiers.
We must arrest him.

986
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,200
Is that true?

987
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,540
We allowed her in as the queen...

988
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,900
What are you doing?
Tie up the criminal right now!

989
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:28,330
Protect Her Highness
the Queen and His Excellency!

01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:30,650
You asked me if I wanted
to become the king.

991
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:32,030
Remember?

992
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:33,840
I am here to ask
a question this time.

993
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:37,990
Would you like to make me
the new king of this country?
