1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,000
[ Queen: Love and War ]

2
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,390
I feel like I am dreaming right now.

3
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,970
Being under the sun with you

4
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,380
makes me forget about
my power as the king, position,

5
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,580
revenge...

6
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,880
and everything.

7
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,030
As long as I have you.

8
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,580
I feel the same way.

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,930
They say the reason His Majesty
is keeping you close lately

10
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,890
is because...

11
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,030
your daughter is actually
the dead queen.

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,030
Consort Hong.

13
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,450
Is she indeed your daughter?

14
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,130
I do not think I need to answer that.

15
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,630
What?

16
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,680
I said I have no reason to
answer your question.

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,730
Is that all you had to say?

18
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,480
Think carefully.

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,000
I do not know what kind of promotion
His Majesty promised you,

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,580
but depending on what you tell me,

21
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,020
I could give you something
a lot greater than that!

22
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,870
His Majesty would never
make a promise like that.

23
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,690
And even if he did,

24
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,250
I would have refused.

25
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,450
Because I do not use my child

26
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,910
to become successful
like some people.

27
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,300
What?

28
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,940
What do you mean, "some people?"

29
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,070
Whom are you talking about?

30
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,350
You will definitely regret

31
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,860
this very moment.

32
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,950
I will get going if you are
done speaking to me.

33
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,460
This...

34
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,190
This bastard!

35
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,920
How arrogant...

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,060
Your Majesty.

37
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,580
You must rest more.

38
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,530
You still look a bit pale.

39
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,820
I said I am fine.

40
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,050
Let us walk a bit longer.

41
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,330
If so...

42
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,420
we can walk toward
your bedchamber.

43
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,570
I will walk you there.

44
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,990
What?

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,030
Fine.

46
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,100
Walk me there then.

47
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,450
We are here, Your Majesty.

48
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,690
Please go inside and rest now.

49
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,570
This time, I will walk you
to your chamber.

50
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,800
Pardon?

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,570
I was supposed to walk you here.

52
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,750
If so...

53
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,030
you can walk me back here again.

54
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,330
Do you want to keep
walking back and forth?

55
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,260
We will end up spending
all day doing that.

56
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,840
That sounds good too.

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,400
I did not know you were together.

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,470
What did you want to see me
for so early in the morning?

59
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,360
I would like to talk to you privately.

60
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,780
What did you just say?

61
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,200
Kim Man Chan is spying
on Consort Hong?

62
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,340
Yes.

63
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,890
Since he even approached me,

64
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,820
he probably tried many
different things already.

65
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,960
Since the Queen's Palace is empty,

66
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,090
he must be anxious that
Consort Hong might take over.

67
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,550
I think so as well.

68
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,390
Your Majesty.

69
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,130
Perhaps you should stop
His Excellency Kim Man Chan.

70
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,030
He might try to threaten Consort Hong.

71
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,340
I am worried.

72
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,750
By "the truth,"

73
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,380
you mean the fact that
she's the dead queen?

74
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,760
No.

75
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,070
She's not the dead queen.

76
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,000
She's her twin sister.

77
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,260
If this truth is revealed, neither
Consort Hong nor the royals

78
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,190
will be left unharmed.

79
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,630
Is...

80
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,200
Is Consort Hong really her twin?

81
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,990
Twin sister...

82
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,540
How did you learn about that then?

83
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,130
The one who placed her
in the selection

84
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,330
is me.

85
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,700
Does that give you enough
reason to work with me?

86
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,960
Chief Eunuch Hwang,
are you out there?

87
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

88
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,910
Did you summon me?

89
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,690
Tell the ministers and chancellors
to gather in the Royal Council Hall.

90
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

91
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,840
I would like to talk to you privately.

92
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,820
Could something be
going on again?

93
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,700
He shouldn't be work too hard yet.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,400
You would like to make medicine
for His Majesty yourself?

95
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,700
I have never done it before.

96
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,040
I need you to help me.

97
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,220
What kind of ingredients
should I use?

98
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,550
Lately, I've been mainly
using Siberian ginseng

99
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,720
and geonchil in his medicines lately.

100
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,040
Could you prepare those
ingredients for me?

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,500
I am...

102
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,980
not planning to accept
a new queen for a while.

103
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,060
Your Majesty.

104
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,240
That position is for
Your Majesty's wife,

105
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,000
but it ultimately is for the mother
of the people of this country.

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,210
Yes.

107
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,670
Leaving such a position empty

108
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,110
will be unimaginable.

109
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,070
It means that I will not hurry.

110
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,130
The royal wedding caused
an unfortunate event

111
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,990
and I still have not
caught those traitors yet.

112
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,270
I cannot accept another
queen in this situation.

113
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,670
Making people feel safe by

114
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,480
arresting the traitors
will be my priority.

115
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,990
I feel the same way, Your Majesty.

116
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,260
You must arrest the traitors
as soon as possible

117
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,730
and strengthen the law
and order of the country.

118
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,980
Since I have expressed my opinion,

119
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,600
I want you to try your best
to arrest the traitors.

120
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

121
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,210
Hyungnim.

122
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,290
This is entirely different
from what we expected.

123
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,470
He wants to leave the
Queen's Palace empty?

124
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,600
We thought he'd give the position
to Consort Hong right away.

125
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,420
Since he's coming out this way,

126
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,140
we can no longer dig more information
on Consort Hong, either.

127
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,820
What should we do?

128
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,970
I'm sure he's hiding something.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,600
What? What do you mean, hiding?

130
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,430
I...

131
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,660
still cannot believe it.

132
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,260
Since His Majesty was resurrected,

133
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,690
I thought the same thing
happened to her as well.

134
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,670
Why couldn't we think that
she could be her twin?

135
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,880
The country banned twins from
being born a long time ago.

136
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,100
That's why we didn't
think twins would exist.

137
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,290
Twins were banned?

138
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,750
You will find out soon as well.

139
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,600
Because of that prophecy,

140
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,720
the whole country...

141
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,210
will turn upside down soon.

142
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm back, sir.

143
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,360
Did you have a look
at the headquarters?

144
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,800
Yes. Thankfully,
it was still the same.

145
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,830
It seems like they
haven't found it yet.

146
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,580
Good work.

147
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,320
Get ready to move there with
Jo Heung Gyeon and his daughter.

148
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,600
I have something I need
to do tonight.

149
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,100
Yes.

150
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,380
Is this how you do it?

151
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,970
Yes, My Lady.

152
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,470
You just need to keep boiling it
for about two hours.

153
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,970
By the way, My Lady...

154
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,230
Why don't you let the female
royal physicians take over?

155
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,790
Yes, My Lady.

156
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,630
It's hard work. You don't have
to do that yourself.

157
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,980
That's for the female
royal physicians.

158
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,200
I want to make it with my own hands.

159
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,520
Just let me.

160
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,920
His Majesty called the ministers

161
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,770
and said he would leave
the Queen's Palace

162
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,790
empty for a while.

163
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,450
What?

164
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,670
Why did he have to say
that to the ministers?

165
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,170
When I mentioned the
reinstatement last time,

166
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,900
neither King nor Consort Hong

167
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,630
seemed happy to hear it.

168
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,380
I wonder what they are afraid of.

169
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,610
I heard he said...

170
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,410
it is his priority to
catch the traitors right now.

171
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,090
Perhaps that is why.

172
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,640
Do you think that is all?

173
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,650
That is the list of the royal servants
who work in the detached palace.

174
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,570
You said none of these people were

175
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,360
willing to testify regarding
Kang Yi Soo, correct?

176
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,830
Yes.

177
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,840
At least one person needs to testify

178
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,240
in order to clear his name.

179
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,890
I will ask around again, Your Majesty.

180
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,770
Fix your posture.

181
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,130
My Lady!

182
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,680
You're here.

183
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,350
I will let His Majesty know.

184
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,760
No.

185
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,740
I do not want to bother him.
Just deliver this medicine to him.

186
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,020
It supposedly restores one's energy.

187
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,600
If so, I will walk you to your chamber.

188
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,510
My Lady, please do not do that.

189
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,670
Please bother His Majesty.

190
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,550
I keep telling him that he
needs to take it easy,

191
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,270
but he just will not listen.

192
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,490
She wants to go. Why do you keep...

193
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,400
You should be quiet.

194
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,960
Please forgive me, My Lady.

195
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,410
Your Majesty.

196
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,460
Consort Hong is here.

197
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,040
Let her in.

198
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,530
Geez...

199
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,310
I wanted to go outside with her
and get some fresh air.

200
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,960
How could you tell me not to...

201
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,500
Fine.

202
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,300
Let's leave them alone and
get some fresh air with me.

203
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,120
Let go of me!

204
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,000
- Let's go...
- Let go!

205
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,840
I said, I am all right.

206
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,350
But now that I took my medicine

207
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,970
and got to see your face,
I feel a lot better.

208
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,930
I will bring you more
medicine in the evening.

209
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,700
Chief Eunuch Hwang
told you to take a rest.

210
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,890
Why would you not listen?

211
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,790
Chief Eunuch Hwang
became such a tattletale.

212
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,600
Everything is all right, is it not?

213
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,340
It seemed like

214
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,100
His Excellency Hong Ki Ho had
an urgent matter to discuss.

215
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,880
The Kim family apparently

216
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,710
approached Hong Ki Ho to
find out about your true identity.

217
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,800
Is His Excellency Hong Ki Ho all right?

218
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,300
Do not worry. He will be all right.

219
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,180
I ordered Han Mo to

220
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,360
reinvestigate the royal servants
in the detached palace.

221
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,690
It will not be easy,

222
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,030
but I will prove your father's
innocence no matter what.

223
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,520
You should be careful until then.

224
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,420
Do you understand?

225
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

226
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,680
Where are we moving to?

227
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,160
I heard they have a hiding place
around Samgak Mountain.

228
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,220
He thinks it'd be better since it's

229
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,280
inside the mountain,
and there's an escape path too.

230
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,230
He will join us there when
he's done with his outing.

231
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,050
You will have to walk for a while.

232
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,070
Would you be all right?

233
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,300
Do not worry.

234
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's go.

235
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,030
My Lady.

236
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,370
My Lady!

237
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,880
Hey, hey, hey!

238
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,180
It's burning. It's burning!

239
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,530
Hot!

240
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,780
Geez...

241
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,300
- Ow!
- Are you all right?

242
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,980
What are you thinking about anyway?

243
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,430
Well...

244
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,830
What are you doing here, by the way?

245
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,570
I'm here to run an errand
for His Majesty.

246
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,530
Step aside for a moment.

247
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,590
Pardon?

248
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,020
Yes, My Lady.

249
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,330
What do you mean, an errand?

250
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,020
I was lying.

251
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,080
It felt too stuffy inside.

252
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,480
I got His Majesty's
approval to visit you.

253
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,230
By the way,

254
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,270
is something wrong?

255
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,910
You even burnt the
medicine for His Majesty.

256
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,310
I feel like...

257
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,200
I'm burdening His Majesty too much.

258
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,970
The Kim family framed my father

259
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,890
and it will not be easy to prove that.

260
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,700
Do you want me to do
something about it?

261
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,100
- Do something about it?
- My Lady.

262
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,600
I'm the owner of the Buyong Agency.

263
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,170
I'm Wal, who tracked down
Gae Pyeong too.

264
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,790
Just ask His Majesty to
let me step outside.

265
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,540
This is all burnt. See?

266
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,150
Will you be coming home late, sir?

267
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,600
Yes.

268
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,650
Why?

269
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,060
Do you have something to tell me?

270
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,540
The thing is...

271
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,160
His Excellency Kwon Ik Soo,
who is in exile

272
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,320
keeps sending letters.

273
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,710
What should I do?

274
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,410
Geez, Kwon Ik Soo...

275
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,650
Father is dealing with
a lot of things lately.

276
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,790
You'd better not get him upset.

277
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,170
Go ahead and just burn them all.

278
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,830
I'll be right back.

279
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,430
Yes, sir.

280
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,450
I heard you know
where Wal went to.

281
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,190
Where did he go to?

282
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,910
He went to the watering hole.

283
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
- The watering hole?
- Yes.

284
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,620
He used to go there often
to collect information.

285
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,040
So Rang!

286
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,160
My goodness! You came, sir.

287
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,300
Yes, yes, yes. How was your day?

288
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,930
- I was waiting for you.
- Aigoo!

289
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,290
Isn't this the inspector general?

290
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,870
Who are you?

291
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,930
Right!

292
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,500
Aren't you that fidgety officer?

293
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,100
Yes. I'm that fidgety officer.

294
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,620
You still remember me.

295
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,710
It's such an honor, sir.

296
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,410
I wouldn't say "an honor."

297
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,900
- Have fun then.
- Aigoo, sir.

298
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,700
What are the odds we ran
into each other?

299
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,230
Why don't we drink together again?

300
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,900
- With you?
- Of course! Let me treat you.

301
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,280
Go get five or six bottles
of the ginseng drink...

302
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,930
Get something a lot nicer
than the ginseng drink.

303
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,600
Let's go. Come on, let's go!

304
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,610
My goodness...

305
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,670
Gosh. Poor me.

306
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,460
Now I have to see those
two losers in one room.

307
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,120
Who are you?

308
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,600
If I take these, what do
I need to do for you?

309
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,800
You need to spread
a rumor in Hanyang.

310
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,410
Can you do it?

311
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,020
A rumor?

312
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,970
That's easy.

313
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,080
Two days will be enough.

314
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,460
By the way,

315
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,160
what's the rumor
you want me to spread?

316
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,460
It's cold.

317
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,280
Where's So Rang?

318
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,040
Why is So Rang not coming in?

319
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,330
She will come when she can.

320
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,400
By the way, sir, you remember
His Excellency Kang Yi Soo?

321
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,900
- Kwon Ik Soo?
- No. Kang Yi Soo.

322
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,940
Yes, Kwon Ik Soo!

323
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
Geez...

324
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,990
Why do I keep hearing
that name today?

325
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,850
It's ruining my appetite.

326
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,950
He doesn't even understand
what I'm saying.

327
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,670
Aigoo.

328
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,260
I'm getting pissed off
thinking about it.

329
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,300
If he was sent on exile,

330
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,780
he should stay quiet.

331
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,940
How dare he keeps
sending letters?

332
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,760
How dare he asks me to
take care of his family?

333
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,620
Pardon? Who did?

334
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,640
I'm talking about Kwon Ik Soo!

335
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,290
Kwon Ik Soo!

336
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,100
This is why you cannot
mingle with the ones

337
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,900
outside of the Kim family.

338
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,000
By the way...

339
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,360
You.

340
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,470
What's your last name?

341
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,800
I'm...

342
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,970
Not only do I not know
my last name,

343
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,660
I don't even know my real name.

344
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,840
Kwon Ik Soo?

345
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,340
That sounds very familiar.

346
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,530
Kwon Ik Soo is...

347
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,910
the one who was sent back home

348
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,890
for murdering the palace lady.

349
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,780
He took full responsibility for it,
as I remember.

350
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,060
The Kim family must have
promised him something.

351
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,740
They probably said

352
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,030
they would take care of his family.

353
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,170
Right.

354
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,460
I heard something similar from
the son of the Kim family too.

355
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,630
He said something about his family.

356
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,030
He said Kwon Ik Soo is bothering
him by keep sending letters.

357
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,670
Kwon Ik Soo...

358
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,230
must know everything about
the family's corruption.

359
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,120
Do you think they are treating him that
way because they believe he will not

360
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,150
be able to betray them?

361
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,250
I will give you the royal badge
and a handwritten letter.

362
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,690
Could you meet with
Kwon Ik Soo yourself?

363
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,630
Me?

364
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,160
As long as you can persuade
him and get him to testify,

365
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,200
we can punish the Kim family.

366
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,300
But would he testify so easily?

367
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,250
On your way there,

368
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,380
find out how Kwon Ik Soo's
family is doing.

369
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,820
Me?

370
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,190
Aigoo...

371
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,170
I shouldn't have butt in.

372
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,100
Now I have to do all this work.

373
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,470
Seriously...

374
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,400
- It's a good horse, right?
- Yes, sir.

375
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,070
Aigoo...

376
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,860
Aigoo, seriously.

377
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,870
Why is he so enormous anyway?

378
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,060
Aigoo.

379
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,320
Aigoo...

380
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,430
I'm off.

381
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,790
Are you worried about Wal?

382
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,610
Not at all.

383
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,410
He is probably excited now
thinking he is on vacation.

384
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,820
He found the palace to be stuffy.

385
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,900
Since he is a vagabond by nature,

386
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,430
he cannot be strapped
down in one place.

387
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,120
He disappears all the time.

388
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,420
But...

389
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,070
he always comes back safely.

390
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,610
He always does
whenever I need help.

391
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,060
I talked too much, did I not?

392
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,810
Not at all.

393
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,820
Are you upset?

394
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,350
Why would I be?

395
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,330
I am just feeling jealous.

396
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,630
Just ignore it.

397
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,760
Pardon?

398
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,900
Wal is just a friend.
He is like my brother.

399
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,090
Do you really feel jealous?

400
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,690
Even you?

401
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,750
Why?

402
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,160
Do you find me silly
because I am the King?

403
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,630
Not at all.

404
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,600
- It is not like that...
- You said it's not...

405
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,390
This is not good.

406
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,640
I cannot look silly anymore.

407
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,840
Stop worrying about Wal
from now on.

408
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,250
It is an order.

409
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,830
Like you said,

410
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,470
Wal will surely come back.

411
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

412
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,280
How much is this?

413
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,000
Do you want one?

414
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,650
Aigoo, you picked a nice one.

415
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,040
Just give me two nyang.

416
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,490
Aigoo, why is it so expensive?

417
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,730
Right.

418
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,900
By the way, have you guys
heard that rumor?

419
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,800
- Rumor?
- What rumor?

420
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,990
You know His Majesty's concubine?

421
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,820
I mean the Royal Noble Consort Hong.

422
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,760
I heard she's actually...

423
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,800
the dead queen's twin sister.

424
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,200
What? No way. A twin?

425
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,220
I guess you guys didn't know.

426
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,800
I thought you already knew. Gosh...

427
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,390
I'm such a big mouth.

428
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,770
Aigoo...

429
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,270
Did you just hear that?

430
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,190
The dead queen and Consort Hong

431
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,660
are twins!

432
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,850
Aigoo, is that really true?

433
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,230
What? Her twin sister?

434
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,500
Is that true?

435
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,660
Then, did he really let
both of the twins

436
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,400
inside the palace? How vulgar.

437
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,000
Aigoo, how blasphemous.

438
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,260
By the way,

439
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,030
how could there still be twins
after that prophecy?

440
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,320
That's what I'm talking about.

441
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,640
Don't you think?

442
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,220
- What...
- Geez...

443
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,360
What do we do?

444
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,130
You should have one too.

445
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,370
Here.

446
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,960
Sir.

447
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,220
Do you want to hear

448
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,290
an interesting story I heard
from the market?

449
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,050
An interesting story?

450
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,470
Father!

451
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,130
Father!

452
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,620
My goodness...

453
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,830
Father.

454
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,800
She's her twin. Her twin...

455
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,450
Aigoo, you wreak of alcohol.

456
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,020
Did you swim in alcohol again?

457
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,670
She's her twin!

458
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,240
What did this twin do anyway?

459
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,320
That's not what I'm saying.

460
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,200
Consort Hong is the dead
queen's twin sister!

461
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,850
How dare you talk drunkenly?

462
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:20,010
There's a rumor about Consort Hong
in the market right now!

463
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,460
Consort Hong and the dead queen...

464
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,800
are twin sisters who look
just like each other!

465
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,300
What? Where did you hear
such a ridiculous rumor?

466
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,500
- Stop talking nonsense!
- Hold on.

467
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,600
What is it, Hyungnim?

468
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,800
- Her twin?
- Yes.

469
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,000
- Her twin.
- Yes!

470
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,410
I didn't know there was a place
like this in the mountain.

471
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,160
It has some household goods too.

472
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,170
It looks quite livable.

473
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,970
It still will be uncomfortable
for you, right?

474
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,890
It all feels the same to me

475
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,650
unless it's the Queen's Palace.

476
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,060
You must be tired from walking.
You should rest.

477
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,400
I will heat some bathwater.

478
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,000
But where's Father?

479
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,500
How did your outing go?

480
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,730
The rumor must be spreading
everywhere in the market already.

481
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,850
That's all we needed to do.

482
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,390
You mean you'll let
Kim Man Chan pressure

483
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:38,160
the royals with the rumor?

484
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,700
What in the world...

485
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,420
are you talking about right now?

486
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,870
There is a rumor that Consort Hong
is the dead queen's twin?

487
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,040
I heard that's what the people

488
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,820
are talking right now.

489
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,830
If that's a false rumor,

490
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,480
you must find all the people who
are spreading the awful rumor

491
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,830
and punish them severely.

492
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,500
But before that, I think...

493
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,700
you need to get to the bottom of

494
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,960
this rumor first.

495
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,400
There have been a lot of rumors

496
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,440
about Consort Hong so far.

497
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,600
Stopping the rumor

498
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,100
from spreading cannot
be the best solution.

499
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,430
Your Majesty.

500
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,200
Please order us to find out the truth.

501
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,960
Your dear citizens are

502
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,820
trembling in fear right now.

503
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,330
Why would they not?

504
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,350
They must be terrified that

505
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,640
the prophecy from 20 years
ago might come true.

506
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,510
Did you say, "the prophecy?"

507
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,130
Did you not know?

508
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,960
"Eulminyeon...

509
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,430
Bangassangchul Hangyeokse."

510
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,730
There was such a prophecy
during the former king's reign.

511
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,500
Who did you say is a twin?

512
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,160
I told you earlier.

513
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,400
I said that her face
brings bad fortune.

514
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,130
That woman finally caused trouble.

515
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,730
I asked you who is a twin just now.

516
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,630
There is a rumor that Consort Hong
is the dead queen's twin, Your Highness.

517
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,720
I was in shock when I heard
that from my uncle too.

518
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,930
Bring the record of...

519
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,130
the prophecy from
20 years ago right now.

520
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,720
By "the prophecy..."

521
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,960
Which one are you referring to?

522
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,050
The one regarding twins.

523
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,410
Bring me all the records
related to that!

524
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

525
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,130
Your Highness.

526
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,260
What brings you all the way here?

527
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,300
- Is it true?
- Pardon?

528
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Is it true that you are the
dead queen's twin sister?

529
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,610
How did you know that,
Your Highness...

530
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,700
Your Highness, are you all right?

531
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,030
Your Highness!

532
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,000
From now on,

533
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,490
you will have to answer every
single question I ask you.

534
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,920
Does King know about
this already or...

535
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,220
did you and the priestess
plan this together

536
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,330
to deceive and mock the royal family?

537
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,810
Forgive me.

538
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,390
Forgive me, Your Highness!

539
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,470
I asked you if the King knows it too!

540
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,460
He does.

541
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,660
But because of me, His Majesty...

542
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,060
It's all because of me!

543
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,110
What kind of ill-fated relationship
do we have with your family?

544
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,760
You and your sister should
have died 20 years ago.

545
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,260
But you ended up ruining the
King and disturbing the royals.

546
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,600
That prophecy ended up
becoming a curse.

547
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,750
The prophecy?

548
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,600
A curse?

549
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,920
What do you mean by that?

550
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,240
Your family has sinned
by deceiving the royals.

551
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,860
I hope you are ready to pay for it.

552
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,960
My Lady!

553
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,530
Are you all right?

554
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,700
I need to see His Excellency Hong Ki Ho.

555
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,210
Your Majesty.

556
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,430
Do you know anything about this

557
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,750
prophecy about twins as well?

558
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,170
I have heard about the
prophecy before.

559
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,180
But why...

560
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,800
Tell me...

561
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,000
everything you know about it.

562
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,160
The thing is,

563
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,120
20 year ago,

564
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,120
there was a prophecy from
the Royal Shaman Temple.

565
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,760
A prophecy from the
Royal Shaman Temple?

566
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,240
Yes.

567
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,310
It said the world would change
because of the aristocrat-born

568
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,960
twins that were born in 1895.

569
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,200
So giving birth to twins
in aristocrat families

570
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,070
was banned for a while and...

571
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,170
No, no!

572
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,050
Stop!

573
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,580
Give us our children back!

574
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,410
No!

575
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,480
No, you bastards!

576
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,060
No!

577
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,050
You will burn in hell!

578
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,780
Even the twins who
were already born

579
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,690
were killed as soon
as they got caught.

580
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,230
I once heard from
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong

581
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,230
that His Excellency Kang Yi Soo

582
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,000
tried his best to

583
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,310
hide his daughters away
from the harsh regulation.

584
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,020
They killed...

585
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,070
all the twins?

586
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

587
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,200
There was a report like
that at the time,

588
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,800
but I don't think they
could've killed all of them.

589
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,440
No matter how strict they were,

590
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,090
there's no way to know
what's going on in every family.

591
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,580
I'm sure some families raised
their children in secret.

592
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,790
How could they have let
their children die?

593
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,670
Since we could not reveal
that we were twins,

594
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,930
we had to stay inside the
house since we were young.

595
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,750
Kang Yi Soo must have

596
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,420
done that as well.

597
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,280
That is why they raised
the sisters in secret.

598
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,530
Pardon?

599
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,220
Consort Hong is...

600
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,140
the dead queen's twin sister.

601
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,570
Your Majesty.

602
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,390
What do you mean by that?

603
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,220
My goodness...

604
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,100
Be careful, be careful, be careful!

605
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,580
One, two!

606
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,790
Aigoo.

607
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,990
I said we should stay inside!

608
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:46,690
Why would you want to be among
all these men, Your Highness?

609
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,180
One!

610
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,030
Stop addressing me that way.

611
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,330
Pardon?

612
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,700
I am no longer the Queen.

613
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,310
But still...

614
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I have something I want to ask you.

615
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,500
Go ahead.

616
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,130
His Majesty won't be able to do
anything to Consort Hong.

617
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,620
All he'd do is to kick her
out of the palace.

618
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,690
You're probably not planning
just to sit and watch

619
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,510
Consort Hong being
punished so lightly?

620
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:36,040
You said you placed her
in the selection yourself.

621
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,650
If so...

622
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,990
that means she betrayed you.

623
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,100
Don't you feel resentful?

624
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,350
Resentful?

625
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,060
I...

626
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,290
want that woman to

627
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,620
go to hell like me.

628
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,400
What are you planning
to do with her?

629
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,130
It said the world will change
because of the aristocrat-born

630
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,790
twins that were born in 1895.

631
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,810
My Lady.

632
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,090
Consort Kim is here.

633
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,280
The Queen Mother told me
to bring you with me.

634
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,900
Did you not hear me?

635
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,270
The Queen Mother
wants to see you!

636
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,990
Bring her out.

637
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,100
Pardon?

638
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,480
Drag her out!

639
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,460
It is an order from the
Queen Mother!

640
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,990
I heard you knew about it.

641
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,450
How come you just let her be?

642
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,050
You should have punished
her accordingly!

643
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,930
You should have expelled her!

644
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,550
Why did you keep her around

645
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,900
even fooling your
own grandmother?

646
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,540
I...

647
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,110
love that woman.

648
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,960
What did you just say?

649
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,550
I...

650
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,290
love that woman, Grandmother.

651
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,980
I got to meet her when
I was the crown prince.

652
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,720
Since then, I have

653
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,460
held her close to my heart all along.

654
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,300
I found out later that
the dead queen was

655
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,740
her twin sister.

656
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,590
She participated in the selection

657
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,120
to find the culprit
who killed her sister.

658
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,030
She wanted to clear
her family's name.

659
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,590
Who put her in that situation?

660
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,000
How could you say she is
the only one to blame?

661
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,490
So...

662
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,440
did you think you could be
with her if you accept

663
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,170
her as the queen by lying
about who she is?

664
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,360
That you could keep
her by your side?

665
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,980
Please wake up, King.

666
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,350
There was an ominous prophecy
about her before she was born!

667
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,060
That means this is
an ill-fated relationship!

668
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,800
I do not believe in

669
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,470
such a thing as a prophecy.

670
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,200
But do not worry.

671
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,030
I will send her away soon.

672
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,830
I already promised that
I would clear Kang Yi Soo's

673
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,530
name and let her go.

674
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,800
I want you to expel her tonight.

675
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,630
I will say that she ran away
since she got caught lying.

676
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,900
And you must not meet
her ever again.

677
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:40,010
This is the last bit of generosity
I can provide you with.

678
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,190
Your Majesty, it's Chief Eunuch Hwang!

679
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,070
I need to speak with you urgently.

680
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,370
Come in.

681
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,410
Your Majesty.

682
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,520
I heard Consort Hong was taken forcefully
to the Queen Mother's Palace.

683
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,270
How shameless and cheeky.

684
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,560
Go ahead and talk with
your own mouth.

685
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,260
Say that you are still
Hong Ki Ho's daughter.

686
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,320
Let's see if you can

687
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,180
still say that.

688
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,250
The Queen Mother is
asking you a question!

689
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,030
Since she cannot answer,

690
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,960
that means she is not His Excellency
Hong Ki Ho's daughter.

691
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,150
Your Highness.

692
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,420
You should strip her and find out.

693
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,420
If there is a scar, she is
the dead queen

694
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,220
and if there is not,

695
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,430
the rumor that she is her
twin must be true.

696
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,580
Strip her.

697
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,120
What are you doing?
It's Her Highness's order!

698
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,380
Yes, Your Highness.

699
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,260
Stop that!

700
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,170
Do not do this.

701
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,450
I would rather do it myself.

702
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,840
What?

703
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,590
If you are that curious,

704
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,650
I will strip and show you myself.

705
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,800
But there is no scar.

706
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,510
I...

707
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,920
am not the dead queen.

708
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,750
Then...

709
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,630
who are you?

710
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,800
I asked you who you are!

711
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,140
His Majesty is here!

712
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,820
King.

713
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,480
What are you doing right now?

714
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,430
Have you not heard the rumor?

715
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,490
The whole Hanyang is saying
Consort Hong is a twin...

716
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,770
I have heard.

717
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:57,090
But why are you
defending Consort Hong?

718
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,090
You should be interrogating her!

719
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,900
When the time comes,

720
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,140
I will reveal the truth myself.

721
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,130
So do not ever lay a hand
Consort Hong again.

722
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,150
Do you understand?

723
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,870
Does that mean that

724
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,900
you know something about this?

725
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,000
I will take Consort Hong with me.

726
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,820
King!

727
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,170
I will get you a house to hide.

728
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,640
Han Mo will take you there

729
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,110
and to bring your mother
there soon too.

730
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,940
Leave now.

731
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,910
If you stay here,

732
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:59,110
you will keep going
through hardships like this.

733
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,030
I...

734
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,850
will not run away, Your Majesty.

735
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,360
No matter what the reason was,

736
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,220
I deceived a lot of people

737
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,010
and insulted the royals
and the ministry.

738
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:12,830
I will not...

739
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,180
be able to avoid the fact
that I have sinned.

740
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,330
What are you talking about?

741
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,390
I have been picturing this

742
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,800
over and over again.

743
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,800
A day like this

744
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,520
and a moment like this.

745
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,300
I expected this since the moment
I participated in the selection.

746
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,600
Therefore,

747
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,300
I was always anxious
and afraid as well.

748
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,400
That is why I am telling
you to leave.

749
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,900
I will take care of the rest.
Just focus on your wellbeing...

750
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,130
I cannot place everything
on you, Your Majesty.

751
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,530
His Excellency Hong Ki Ho
will face hardship too.

752
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,490
I caused this from the beginning.

753
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,100
The fact that I was not able to
reveal who I was just now

754
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,650
was more shameful
than being stripped.

755
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:02,040
I will reveal who I am
in front of everyone

756
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:05,370
and get punished.

757
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,090
But,

758
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,280
please allow me to investigate
the framing of my father.

759
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,020
Do you not know them?

760
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,420
Do you think anyone will
be interested in that?

761
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,560
They will try to get you killed
using your confession instead.

762
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,110
If that is what is expected,

763
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,850
I will prepare for it.

764
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,600
What did you just say?

765
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,670
I am worried about my mother,

766
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,900
but if that is what I deserve,

767
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,760
I will have to accept it.

768
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,410
How about me then?

769
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,550
How about me, who has
to give that order?

770
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,660
How could you be so cruel to me?

771
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,570
How could you be so harsh?

772
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:42,880
If so...

773
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,300
are you telling me to make you

774
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,850
hide me away and lie to

775
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,160
the entire country?

776
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,920
Should I ask you to save me

777
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,230
and fool everyone else?

778
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,550
To you,

779
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,970
who is the king of this country?

780
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:11,070
I hate you so much...

781
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,230
at this very moment.

782
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,570
What should I do with this situation?

783
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,020
It turns out Consort Hong is

784
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:36,920
the dead queen's twin sister.

785
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,600
Why did she have to
be a twin? Why?

786
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,120
And that prophecy too.

787
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,710
How much more...

788
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,220
does she have to suffer?

789
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,980
Don't you agree?

790
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,000
Are you not shocked?

791
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,670
How could you be so calm?

792
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,920
I just feel bad for those two.

793
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,700
How come things are always
so harsh to just those two?

794
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,200
Your Majesty.

795
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,700
The royal relatives and the scholars are
protesting in front of the palace.

796
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,080
What?

797
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,040
Your Majesty!

798
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,300
An awful rumor that the
queen and Consort Hong

799
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:36,700
are twin sisters are
spreading in the market!

800
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,960
Please reveal the truth

801
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,590
regarding Consort Hong,

802
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,640
Your Majesty!

803
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,480
Please reveal the truth,
Your Majesty!

804
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,870
Your Majesty.

805
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,580
Please reveal the truth regarding

806
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,980
the rumor surrounding
Consort Hong, Your Majesty.

807
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:06,180
Please reveal the truth,
Your Majesty!

808
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,600
What are you planning
to do with her?

809
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,300
What am I planning
to do with her?

810
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,070
Pardon?

811
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,700
I'll take her and keep
her by my side.

812
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,210
In front of me...

813
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:37,220
I'll make her watch the King die.

814
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,750
You should've seen how

815
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,010
pale the King's face turned!

816
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,150
The Heavens are
helping us like this.

817
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,000
"You must try your best and
let the Heavens decide."

818
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Or should I say,
wherever I go, there is a way?

819
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,190
That's right!

820
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,090
By the way, Hyungnim...

821
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,100
where do you think that
rumor came from anyway?

822
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,240
I know.

823
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,600
That means someone already
knew about Consort Hong.

824
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,380
Why does that matter so much?

825
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,200
Right now, it's important
to pressure the King

826
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,400
so he can't do anything else.

827
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,300
You have to go after the prey
at once, not to lose it.

828
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,700
Yes.

829
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,600
The ministers' letters to the King
have been prepared, correct?

830
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,230
Your Majesty.

831
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,910
You are receiving countless letters.

832
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,650
Your Majesty, it's Han Mo.

833
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:56,930
Your Majesty.

834
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:00,090
The number of
protestors is increasing.

835
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,280
Just to be safe,

836
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,680
I will combine forces with Five Guards
Directorate to strengthen security.

837
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,100
They will try to get you killed
using your confession instead.

838
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,320
How about me then?

839
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,970
How about me, who has
to give that order?

840
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,740
I hate you so much...

841
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,910
at this very moment.

842
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,890
One!

843
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:51,220
- One!
- Two!

844
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,650
Two!

845
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:53,750
Three!

846
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,950
One!

847
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:57,420
Two!

848
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,520
Ready!

849
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,960
Ready!

850
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,060
One!

851
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,380
One!

852
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,040
I will send letters to the members
who are scattered around the country.

853
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,540
I will notify the army as well.

854
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,040
But in order to invade the palace,

855
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,010
we will need someone to
open the gate for us.

856
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:16,800
We will find someone.

857
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,150
Because of the rumor and protest,

858
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:21,520
the security at the palace
must be getting tighter.

859
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,600
Then, isn't it even more difficult
to get into the palace?

860
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,750
Doesn't the palace summon soldiers
from Five Guards Directorate

861
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,690
to supplement at times like this?

862
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,400
Yes, that's correct.

863
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,520
We'll disguise our men into
Five Guards Directorate' soldiers

864
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,690
and let them inside the palace.

865
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,000
Will that be possible?

866
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,970
It's not impossible, either.

867
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:48,400
To the royal guards, the Five Guards
Directorate's soldiers are

868
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,560
all basically strangers.

869
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,230
So it will be easier to
enter than usual.

870
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,780
But before that,

871
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,100
we'll have to acquire
an entrance pass.

872
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,780
We will also have to plant our men to
Five Guards Directorate Headquarters.

873
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:06,510
There is a general I know at the
Five Guards Directorate Headquarters.

874
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:11,730
If this rumor is true,

875
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:17,000
please punish Consort Hong,
Your Majesty!

876
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,100
Please punish her, Your Majesty!

877
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:28,110
For deceiving the royals
and the ministry,

878
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,220
please punish Consort Hong,
Your Majesty!

879
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,810
Punish her, Your Majesty!

880
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,750
I am here to deliver the message

881
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,440
on behalf of the ministers.

882
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,250
We can no longer

883
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,780
delay the investigation.

884
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,900
The deadline we decided on is

885
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,500
two days later by noon.

886
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,090
Please find out everything about

887
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,840
Consort Hong before that.

888
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,570
If...

889
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,810
you do not do that,

890
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:06,440
this Royal Council Hall will
become completely empty.

891
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,840
All the ministers...

892
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,200
decided to refuse to be
present as a whole.

893
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:16,200
You will not be able to govern the
country without the ministers.

894
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,940
Please reveal the truth

895
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:23,670
and strengthen the
dignity of the royals.

896
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,300
He's the one that Jo Heung Gyeon
was talking about.

897
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,900
Follow him.

898
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,170
We will take him with us quietly.

899
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:52,080
Yes, sir.

900
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,480
Left State Minister.

901
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,400
Sorry for treating you rudely.

902
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,400
I heard you had disappeared.

903
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,500
But what is this...

904
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,960
You will have to help me a bit.

905
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,090
With what, exactly?

906
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:44,940
If you can help us,

907
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,600
we will compensate you accordingly.

908
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,880
But if you say no,

909
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,850
not only you but also your family

910
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,690
will be in danger.

911
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:57,030
Pardon?

912
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,840
All right.

913
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,900
Aigoo.

914
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,610
Who are you?

915
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,610
I am here with the King's order.

916
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,310
I will have to see the criminal.

917
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,100
Did you just say, "the King's order?"

918
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:36,950
Aigoo.

919
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,320
Are you telling me...

920
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,500
to reveal that the Kim family
was behind everything?

921
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,870
That never happened. Please leave.

922
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,650
If you confess,

923
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:01,830
His Majesty will take
care of your family.

924
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,800
Didn't you hear me say
you should leave?

925
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,850
Well...

926
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:11,000
Do you know how your family
is doing in Hanyang?

927
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,900
Do you know how the
Kim family is treating them?

928
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,160
I saw with my own eyes
before I came here.

929
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,920
They were left completely
high and dry right now.

930
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,610
Stop lying.

931
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:27,350
How dare you try to
come between us?

932
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,090
Excuse me, sir.

933
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,860
While you were staying here,

934
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,350
have you received a single letter
from Kim Man Chan?

935
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,740
Or has he sent anyone
here at least once?

936
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,800
No, right?

937
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,240
Right now,

938
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,310
he has no interest in
you whatsoever.

939
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:45,560
There's no way His Excellency
Kim Man Chan would be like that.

940
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,180
He knows what I had done
for the Kim family.

941
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:52,420
I'm sorry to tell you this,

942
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,000
but you have been ditched. Ditched.

943
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,760
Ditched like an old pair of shoes.

944
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,400
You...

945
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,690
How dare you blabber your mouth?

946
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,810
Have you heard anything
from Wal yet?

947
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:11,850
He should be here by now.

948
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:17,450
It's probably not easy to
persuade Kwon Ik Soo.

949
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:20,110
He's been the Kim family's
henchman his whole life.

950
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:23,830
He would not testify so easily.

951
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,130
Your Majesty.

952
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,180
Consort Hong is here.

953
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:45,810
I wanted to deliver the medicine
through Chief Eunuch Hwang.

954
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,730
Have you...

955
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:04,960
changed your mind at all?

956
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,550
No.

957
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:11,470
My decision remains the same.

958
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:17,410
All the ministers will be
here tomorrow at noon.

959
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:19,600
Let us reveal...

960
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,820
the truth there and then.

961
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,200
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

962
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,090
I will drink the medicine in a bit.

963
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,500
You may leave now.

964
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,130
I would...

965
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:46,350
like to thank you for
everything, Your Majesty.

966
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,900
The moment...

967
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,790
you called me Eun Bo,

968
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:57,750
I was happy.

969
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:00,470
Because you called me
by that name,

970
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:02,330
I finally had...

971
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:05,090
the desire to reclaim my name.

972
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:14,210
That brief moment will
be more memorable

973
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:16,550
than any other moment

974
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:19,460
of my life thus far.

975
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,600
Under the name that
you have called me,

976
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,000
I will take my leave.

977
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,000
That will be...

978
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,460
enough for me.

979
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,430
So...

980
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:42,140
please do not suffer...

981
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:45,090
for too long because of me.

982
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,690
Aigoo.

983
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:32,150
How about we drink some makgeolli
since the night is cold?

984
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,400
Sounds good!

985
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,500
Once we start working in the palace
tomorrow, we couldn't drink for a while.

986
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,100
- Let's go!
- Let's go this way.

987
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,300
By the way, is the rumor true?

988
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,060
That twin sister.

989
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,810
What's going to happen?

990
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,500
Who are you?

991
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:04,690
These are the soldiers selected
to guard the palace.

992
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:06,190
Sir!

993
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:07,610
Get them!

994
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,190
Guard them securely.

995
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,450
Yes.

996
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,670
I locked up the soldiers
in the storage room.

997
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,090
It's a poisoned needle.

998
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:48,950
The royal gatekeepers usually
work in a group of nine.

999
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:53,460
We have to get rid of them quietly
and to open the palace gate,

1000
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,880
it'd be good to use
a poisoned needle.

1001
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,960
I will make them hide
it in their sleeve.

1002
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:01,760
Sounds good.

1003
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,970
We're done preparing
for everything now.

1004
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,100
Tomorrow is the day the King is
supposed to reveal the truth.

1005
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,440
Soon, the King will order
Consort Hong's title to be taken away

1006
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,920
and that's the day

1007
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,500
we'll achieve our mission.

1008
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,980
Please punish...

1009
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:26,520
Consort Hong, Your Majesty!

1010
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:31,160
Punish her, Your Majesty!

1011
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,710
Please punish...

1012
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:40,660
Consort Hong, Your Majesty!

1013
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:44,900
Punish her, Your Majesty!

1014
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:50,300
Your Majesty.

1015
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:53,780
It's almost time to
meet with the ministers.

1016
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,190
Gather them in the Grand Palace.

1017
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:01,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

1018
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:22,520
I told you that you'd
regret it, didn't I?

1019
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,300
It would've been nice if
you joined me sooner.

1020
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,100
Don't put on any fancy
accessories today.

1021
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:44,730
Yes, My Lady.

1022
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:54,500
You have worked so hard,
assisting me by my side.

1023
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,200
Thank you.

1024
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,000
Don't mention it.

1025
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,920
I didn't do anything.

1026
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,680
But...

1027
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,230
why are you speaking as
if this is our last time?

1028
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,170
Today, I will give you...

1029
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:47,110
the answer you have been

1030
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:49,200
expecting for so long.

1031
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:54,690
Let her in.

1032
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:19,720
Consort Hong,

1033
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,570
reveal the truth yourself.

1034
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:34,100
Forgive me.

1035
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:37,210
Just like the rumors
outside the palace say,

1036
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:41,140
I am not His Excellency
Hong Ki Ho's daughter.

1037
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,740
I am...

1038
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:55,810
the late His Excellency
Kang Yi Soo's daughter

1039
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:58,330
and the former queen,
Kang's twin sister...

1040
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:01,080
Kang Eun Bo.

1041
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:26,580
[ Queen: Love and War ]

1042
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:29,470
You must not see the King again.

1043
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:32,270
I do not want you two
to reencounter again.

1044
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:34,480
Your Majesty,
Consort Hong disappeared.

1045
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,140
I'm planning to take her with me.

1046
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,190
If you're using me to
threaten His Majesty,

1047
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,660
please kill me instead.

1048
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,330
I will give you another option.

1049
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:43,290
Wouldn't you like to
work with me?

1050
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:45,460
- Your Majesty!
- It is a coup.

1051
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,200
Capture the leader of
the traitors, Lee Jae Hwa.

1052
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,400
- It is an order.
- Listen up, insurgents!

1053
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,900
Tonight, we will kill the King.
