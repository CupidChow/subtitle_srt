1
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,900
[ Queen: Love and War ]

2
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,010
Well...

3
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,290
where is my mother?

4
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,620
[ Episode 11 ]
She's in good health right now.

5
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,650
You'll be able to see her
soon. Don't worry.

6
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,010
But...

7
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,050
there's something you must do first.

8
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,140
Something I must do?

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,940
Feed this to the King.

10
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,920
What's this?

11
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,340
It's poison.

12
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,790
Kill the King with your own hands.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,490
The poison will not spread
immediately. You will have time.

14
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,270
Starting tomorrow night,
I will send a litter near

15
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,880
the side gate of the palace
at seven o'clock every night.

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,190
Get on it discreetly after
you accomplish the mission.

17
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,860
What are you talking
about right now?

18
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,670
You are telling me to poison
His Majesty with my own hands?

19
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,910
Why would I?

20
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,550
No, I will never do that!

21
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,720
You will have to.

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,730
Your mother's life depends on it.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,900
- Sir!
- Do you think that is everything?

24
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,200
The owner of Buyong Agency, your colleague,
Hong Ki Ho, and his family.

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,500
All of their lives depend on it.

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,610
If you refuse to follow the order,

27
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,750
I will reveal that you are the
dead queen's twin sister.

28
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,910
If so,

29
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,830
everyone who participated
in your lie will die.

30
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,240
Are you...

31
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,410
threatening me right now?

32
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,240
Don't even try to take
the poison yourself.

33
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,870
That won't fix anything.

34
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,620
Is this the greater cause you
and the Prince spoke of?

35
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,310
Starting the new world
using such a dirty method?

36
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,310
Greater causes call for sacrifices.

37
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,940
If my secret is revealed,

38
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,630
neither the Prince nor
you will remain unharmed.

39
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,610
This is about taking over the throne.

40
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,800
Do you think we are not
ready to take such a risk?

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,180
So if you want to save everyone...

42
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,050
kill the King.

43
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,840
Remember.

44
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,860
You have three days.

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,250
My mother...

46
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,670
I need to know if my mother
is indeed safe first.

47
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,700
Please tell me where she is.

48
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,600
You should get going for now.

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,010
The King's concubine shouldn't
be outside of the palace for too long.

50
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,210
I will reconnect with you.

51
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,540
My Lady!

52
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,340
Are you okay?

53
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,480
You look so pale...

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,360
Did something happen?

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,400
Jeolla had a severe
drought this year.

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,210
The people in the region will
have a tough time this winter.

57
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,040
I will send them a letter saying
to reduce their tributary food.

58
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,020
Send it through the Royal Secretariat.

59
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,900
What is the time?

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,650
It has not even been 30 minutes
since the last time you inquired.

62
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,750
Consort Hong has not
returned yet either.

63
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,130
Did I ask you that?

64
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,510
Just answer the questions I ask.

65
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,090
Report to me as soon as
Consort Hong returns to the palace.

66
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,310
You already told me that too.

68
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,570
I successfully gave her the poison.

69
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,850
But...

70
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,030
she wanted to see her mother first.

71
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,870
If you let her,

72
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,220
she will demand
her mother's release.

73
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,810
Wouldn't it be better to calm her
down by telling her how she is?

74
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,660
If we tell her that she is safe,

75
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,690
it might motivate her to proceed.

76
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,280
All right.

77
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,730
You may do that.

78
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,140
But our fate depends
on this as well.

79
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,800
- We'll have to be careful.
- Yes.

80
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,190
Sir.

81
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,290
You must remember what
I told you a long time ago.

82
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,060
- If this plan fails...
- It won't fail.

83
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,590
We lost Kang Yi Soo

84
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,750
and Hong Ki Ho turned
his back on us.

85
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,360
I will walk toward

86
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,290
the new world with you,
Your Excellency.

87
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,640
I will make sure to prove
that they're wrong

88
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,980
and we're right.

89
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,980
My Lady.

90
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,640
His Majesty told me
to bring you to him.

91
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,370
Do you mean now?

92
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,420
Yes, immediately. Right now.

93
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,890
His Majesty told me to find
out when you are returning.

94
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,950
He kept pushing me out
to come and check.

95
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,790
I almost froze to death.

96
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,540
Please come.

97
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,480
Did you have a pleasant
visit with your mother?

98
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,560
Yes.

99
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,190
But...

100
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,530
you look pale.

101
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,770
Why are you trembling so much?

102
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,100
It must be from staying
out for too long.

103
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,800
Are you feeling ill?

104
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,110
Let's go back inside.

105
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,750
No, Your Majesty. I'm fine.

106
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,130
Are you sure you are all right?

107
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,480
I am really all right.

108
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,530
Did you not summon me
to say something?

109
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,360
I just wanted to show
you this place.

110
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,350
This is...

111
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,500
This has been my favorite place
since I was the crown prince.

112
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,610
Whenever I did not want to study

113
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,390
or had worries, I used to come here.

114
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,260
Oftentimes...

115
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,540
I used to think of you here as well.

116
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,440
I always wanted to come here
with you at some point.

117
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,850
I finally get to do that now.

118
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,090
I want to show you the places

119
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,080
where I was born and raised in

120
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,990
with all of my wonderful memories.

121
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,750
Slowly, one by one.

122
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,110
Kill the King.

123
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,490
Why do you look troubled?

124
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,390
Why are you always
so sweet to me?

125
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,380
I lied and deceived you.

126
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,980
What do you mean, deceive me?

127
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,340
What are you talking
about all of a sudden?

128
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,530
Do you feel guilty about
saying you are Hong Yeon?

129
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,750
You do not have to worry about
that. It is all in the past.

130
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,070
That is not all.

131
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,840
What do you mean by that?

132
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,650
It is nothing.

133
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,430
I apologize, Your Majesty.

134
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,600
I would like to go back
to my chamber.

135
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,910
Then, go back and get some rest.

136
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

137
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,140
Where are you coming from?

138
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,910
- The thing is...
- Did you see His Majesty?

139
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,530
Yes, Your Highness.

140
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,410
Do you take me lightly,
Consort Hong?

141
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,450
I told you to behave properly.

142
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,330
I definitely warned you.

143
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,010
It is not like that...

144
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,530
I am worried I might
disturb His Majesty

145
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,980
for he is busy
governing the country,

146
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,500
even I cannot see him easily
although I am the queen.

147
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,890
Forgive me.

148
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,480
You should know your place.

149
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,420
It will not end just with
a warning next time.

150
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,330
The King is only
seeing Consort Hong

151
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,260
- neglecting the queen?
- Yes.

152
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,910
He did that on the first
night of the wedding.

153
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,420
There are many eyes and
ears around, as you know.

154
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,120
I understand what you mean.

155
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,110
I did not welcome the
queen wholeheartedly either,

156
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,520
but the queen needs
to be respected

157
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,660
to maintain the order
within the inner court.

158
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,450
I am worried that awful rumors
might spread inside and

159
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,630
outside the palace.

160
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,890
What is King thinking?

161
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,430
He took in the queen,

162
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,010
yet he is ignoring her like that.

163
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,720
Sometimes I feel a bit strange

164
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,190
when I see Consort Hong.

165
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,150
Sometimes she seems
like a different person.

166
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,510
Please do not think
too much of it.

167
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,730
It is probably because she got
emotional after seeing her mother today.

168
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,990
What happened to the clue
I asked Wal to look into?

169
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,640
I do not like how lazy he is,

170
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,040
but he must have found
something as a former informant.

171
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,870
I will send Officer Han along.

172
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,150
I need to find the evidence
as soon as possible.

173
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,620
That way, everything
will get back to normal.

174
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,140
You said you saw a man
in a straw hat last time, right?

175
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,760
You just need to sit
there and tell him

176
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,610
how his eyes and mouth looked.

177
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,900
This hyungnim is a fantastic artist.

178
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,900
You can't tell if it's a
picture or a real person.

179
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,110
Help me out.

180
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,130
Aigoo, I'm busy
preparing for the day.

181
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,990
Give me the washcloth!
Let me do it.

182
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,640
I'll do it. You just sit here
and describe it to him.

183
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,780
Hyungnim will do
all the work, I said.

184
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,600
Sit down, sit down.

185
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,160
- Okay, fine. Scrub hard!
- Yes, yes...

186
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,210
Please watch this, okay?

187
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,170
Get started.

188
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,560
Go ahead, ma'am...

189
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,910
He had slanted eyes...

190
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,520
and the eyebrows were thick

191
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,840
and dark like that.

192
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,700
Aigoo!

193
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,510
Give me! You did a lousy job.

194
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,930
What are you talking about?

195
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,670
Even flies might slip on it.

196
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,930
Are you done describing?

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,100
He did draw it similarly.

198
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,640
Aigoo, Hyungnim.

199
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,110
May I have a look?

200
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,230
Oh, let's see.

201
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,900
The spy at the Royal Investigation
Bureau contacted me.

202
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,610
He said the owner of the Buyong
Agency visited Kim's barracks.

203
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,960
Just as I expected.

204
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,850
The King is retracing
your steps using him.

205
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,290
We can no longer let
him run amok.

206
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,920
Kill him discreetly.

207
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,220
Yes, sir.

208
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,680
Did you know that the queen's
family gets military rights?

209
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,240
I'll start an army.

210
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,080
And you will be the person in charge.

211
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,550
Me, sir?

212
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,780
You must know why

213
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,090
I let you in the Kim family
as a hunter back then.

214
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:28,940
It was to train you as the
bravest henchman of mine.

215
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,020
Make the entire army
an elite force like you.

216
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,930
If Young Ji bears a child
for the Lee family,

217
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,780
I can have Joseon in
the palm of my hands.

218
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,720
For that to happen,

219
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,090
we should prepare in
advance, don't you think?

220
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,900
- The queen is hopeless already.
- Pardon?

221
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,800
What do you mean...

222
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,380
His Majesty is refusing a conjugal visit
arranged by the Ministry of Royal Affairs.

223
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,790
One should look at the sky
to reach for the stars.

224
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,080
The queen isn't the problem.
It's the other one.

225
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,080
The rumor that His Majesty
only cares about Consort Hong

226
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,980
reached even the
Palace of Ministers.

227
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,360
That is why it's a serious problem.

228
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,990
He is allowed to visit

229
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,400
the concubine's villa
whenever he wants to without

230
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,990
the Ministry of Royal Affairs
getting involved.

231
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,740
Geez...

232
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,060
She's a concubine,
just like Consort Kim.

233
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,700
But how come Consort Kim's villa
is left unvisited like a cold room?

234
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,400
- Cousin.
- What do you mean, cold room?

235
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,520
How dare you say that to
Consort Kim, Nephew?

236
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,030
I was just worried, that's all.

237
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,080
- What?
- Enough is enough!

238
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,020
How dare you argue
in front of me?

239
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,910
How come whenever you gather...

240
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,280
If there's a way to
prevent conception,

241
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,000
there would be no problem whether
they share a bedroom or not.

242
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,800
We just need to prevent her
from having a child.

243
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,100
Both the queen and Consort Hong.

244
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,440
Don't even try to take
the poison yourself.

245
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,680
That won't fix anything.

246
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,130
I got it from Wal.

247
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,160
It is an artist's rendering of
the man named Gae Pyeong.

248
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,180
This is that man's face?

249
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,880
He does not look as
intimidating as expected.

250
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,470
I imagined him to look
like a cow thief.

251
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,870
Go to Wal and give him an
order when the day breaks.

252
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,250
Tell him to spy on Jo Heung Gyeon's
people and find his trace.

253
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

254
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,720
Your Majesty.

255
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,360
You are getting one
step closer at a time.

256
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,540
Perhaps you should share this
good news with Consort Hong.

257
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,810
I will prepare your
visit to her chamber.

258
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,430
No.

259
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,290
Leave her alone for tonight.

260
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

261
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,320
The greater cause?

262
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,860
You were a scary person.

263
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,680
What are you doing out here?

264
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,650
The wind is cold.

265
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,920
Is the letter for that woman ready?

266
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,110
Yes.

267
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,980
I'll deliver it myself. Give it to me.

268
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:04,440
I heard His Majesty never
visits the Queen's Palace.

269
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,140
He is too busy with
affairs of state...

270
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,700
You do not need to be
proud in front of your father.

271
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,230
You should get closer to
His Majesty at times like this.

272
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,510
Take good care of him

273
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,040
and stay on his side
no matter what.

274
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,850
If all you do is sitting and
waiting in the Queen's Palace,

275
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,420
you won't draw
His Majesty's attention.

276
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,030
You should visit him first.

277
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,510
You understand what
I'm saying, don't you?

278
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,620
How would I dare to approach him...

279
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,730
Did you desire to become
the queen just to be

280
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,460
humiliated over such a thing?

281
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,790
No.

282
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,140
I should go to the North Gate?

283
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm not sure why, but

284
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,960
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong
said I'd find out

285
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,440
once I go there with you.

286
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,730
What a coincidence.

287
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,800
Your Excellency...

288
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,790
How come you are in the palace?

289
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,960
Step aside for a moment.

290
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,700
You must have been
waiting for this news.

291
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,960
It's a letter your mother wrote.

292
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,000
"I'm doing well physically
and mentally thanks to

293
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,600
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong.
Don't worry.

294
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,940
I feel like I'm dreaming
every day since I found you.

295
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,340
I'll wait for the day when I get
to meet my dear daughter."

296
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,090
That's what it says.

297
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,660
What are you doing right now?

298
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,210
Do you really have to do this?

299
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,130
Were you always like this?

300
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,070
There are two days left now.

301
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,540
You don't have time to hesitate.

302
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,980
We have our people in
the palace as well.

303
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,470
You are always
connected with us.

304
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,620
Don't do anything risky.

305
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,000
What brings you to
the palace, Prince?

306
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,170
Well, I wanted to say hello
to the new queen.

307
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,280
But I heard princes are not
allowed in the Queen's Palace.

308
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,700
So I'm on my way out now.

309
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,800
I see.

310
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,300
Isn't that Consort Hong over there?

311
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,970
I'm not sure.

312
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,640
Anyway, I'd like to congratulate
you even though it's late.

313
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,670
Everyone is talking in the market.

314
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,610
That you have the power now since
your daughter became the queen.

315
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,200
That's just a chatter
of the ignorant people.

316
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,490
I'm just assisting
Her Royal Highness

317
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,400
so she could bear
an heir to the throne.

318
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,210
Why are you laughing?

319
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:42,720
I just remembered when you
visited me to serve me last time.

320
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,530
We're here to take you with us,
Your Majesty.

321
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,030
You called me...

322
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,040
"Your Majesty!"

323
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,150
back then, didn't you?

324
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,270
Isn't that funny?

325
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:12,800
We're both standing here acting
as if we forgot all about it.

326
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,170
I'll get going now.

327
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,290
His Excellency Jo Heung Gyeon?

328
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,400
So you're telling me to see
if this guy is around him.

329
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,410
That was his order.

330
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,470
- Why?
- What?

331
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,810
Why is he suddenly watching
His Excellency Jo Heung Gyeon?

332
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,440
You say "why" to the king's order?

333
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,700
- Shut up and do what you're told to...
- Well...

334
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,230
I didn't say I won't do it.

335
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,850
I will. I will do it, but...

336
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,380
I need a reason to be able to do it.

337
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,190
Is His Excellency Jo Heung Gyeon
really the culprit?

338
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,630
If so...

339
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,850
is the queen's father...

340
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,000
- Shut up and do what you're told.
- Yes.

341
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,900
Why is he wearing a straw
hat during the day?

342
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,400
S***...

343
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,310
Your Majesty.

344
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,280
You seem upset today.

345
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,650
Did you have another
dream by chance?

346
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,900
Why are you always sweet to me?

347
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,280
I lied to you and fooled you.

348
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,690
I'm scared of water.

349
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,510
I almost drowned once
when I was a child.

350
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,530
But you were on a boat
with me last time.

351
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,900
If I became different than I was,

352
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,660
if I became someone else...

353
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,370
what would you do?

354
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,020
Well, yes.

355
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,330
Those lanterns were pretty.

356
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,540
Don't you think I've changed?

357
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,220
If so, do you like me

358
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,550
better now better than
when I was more womanly?

359
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,420
When I was the crown prince,
I met you as a child.

360
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,010
My apologies.

361
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,870
I don't really...

362
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,640
I thought you forgot everything
about our childhood memories.

363
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,580
I told you that, didn't I?

364
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,430
That I forgot about it all.

365
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,420
Thinking about it now, something
has been off all along.

366
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,550
What is?

367
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,560
I will go to Consort Hong's
chamber tonight.

368
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,820
Let her know in advance.

369
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,360
Tonight, did you say?

370
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,120
Yes, His Majesty
wanted you to know.

371
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,910
You should get ready first.

372
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,300
I will go to the royal kitchen
and request dishes for tonight.

373
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,890
His Majesty is going
to Consort Hong's chamber?

374
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,870
Yes, Your Highness.

375
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,430
How could it be?

376
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,050
He hasn't even come to
the Queen's Palace yet.

377
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,180
Your Highness.

378
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,320
Father was right.

379
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,900
Sitting and waiting here
does not change anything.

380
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,740
Your Majesty.

381
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,020
Her Majesty, the Queen is here.

382
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,470
Your Majesty, it is getting late.

383
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,190
Where are you headed to?

384
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,990
What are you doing here
so late at night then?

385
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,340
And you showed up so suddenly.

386
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,550
I have something to
tell you urgently...

387
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,550
I will listen to that later.

388
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,600
Please don't go.

389
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,220
You cannot go to Consort Hong.

390
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,620
You know better than anyone.

391
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,250
The entire palace will talk.

392
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,220
How could you avoid me

393
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,870
and visit the concubine instead?

394
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,100
Your Majesty.

395
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,390
I...

396
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,910
am begging you.

397
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:02,120
Please let me be with you tonight.

398
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,280
Queen.

399
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

400
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,800
Did you forget what I said
on the wedding night?

401
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,300
I said you are not a woman to me.

402
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,180
Do not ever do this again.

403
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,350
Tell everyone to go away.

404
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,440
Your Majesty.

405
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,500
You cannot make all the palace
servants go away by law.

406
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:04,630
If so, we'll be far away.

407
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,530
It has a pleasant scent.

408
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,610
What kind of tea is it?

409
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,970
It's jujube tea.

410
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,850
I heard jujube is good
at healing wounds.

411
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,650
Come to think of it,

412
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,780
is your wound on your chest okay?

413
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,980
Yes.

414
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,250
It healed well.

415
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,290
You're mistaken for a second.

416
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:28,820
You did not get shot on the chest,

417
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,160
but on the stomach.

418
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,260
Why are you trembling so much?

419
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,290
We're in a warm room this time.

420
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,140
You...

421
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,590
You're not Eun Ki.

422
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,250
Who are you?

423
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,020
Who are you?
Tell me who you are!

424
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,550
Why did you make...

425
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,450
a fool out of me by
pretending to be Eun Ki?

426
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,620
And how do you know
about our childhood?

427
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,110
Tell me!

428
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,670
What's in the teacup?

429
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,330
Consort Hong is not allowed to
leave the villa as of now.

430
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,370
Do not allow anyone
to come and go.

431
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,820
Watch everything
she consumes and says.

432
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,970
You will have to report
to me about everything.

433
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,280
- Do you understand?
- Your Majesty...

434
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,340
My Lady.

435
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,920
There should be a green bottle
in Consort Hong's chamber.

436
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,110
Find it and retrieve it.

437
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,840
And find out

438
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,190
what is in the bottle discreetly.

439
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

440
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,380
Your Majesty.

441
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,940
What is going on, may I ask?

442
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,470
I want to be alone.

443
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,490
You should go away too.

444
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,200
- Your Majesty...
- Go away!

445
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

446
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,020
What do you mean, Consort Hong
is under house arrest?

447
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,620
What are you talking about?

448
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,470
I heard that His Majesty

449
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,040
banned everyone from entering
Consort Hong's chamber.

450
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,010
What is the reason?

451
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,850
The thing is, nobody knows.

452
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,910
And the palace ladies in that villa
can't take a step outside.

453
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,200
What in the world...

454
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,450
A poison from pufferfish was
found inside that bottle.

455
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,920
A poison?

456
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,060
Did you hear anything from
Consort Hong's villa?

457
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,650
According to her palace ladies,

458
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,430
she hasn't said anything
since last night.

459
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,290
Bring Hong Ki Ho and Wal here.

460
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:43,070
Your Majesty, Great Royal
Dowager Queen is here.

461
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,860
Let her in.

462
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,100
King.

463
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,530
What in the world is going on?

464
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,680
You placed Consort Hong
under house arrest?

465
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,410
For what reason?

466
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,640
There are awful rumors
in the palace already.

467
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,360
And now a house arrest?

468
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,910
Tell me the reason.

469
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,750
I had something to
tell you anyway.

470
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,610
I will make sure people do not
spread stories of the house arrest.

471
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,990
Please help me with that as well.

472
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,870
King!

473
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,480
Forgive me, but I have
nothing else to tell you.

474
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,410
I need to focus on state affairs.
Could you please leave?

475
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,900
That straw hat...

476
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,600
I've seen it somewhere.

477
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,360
Where did I see that?

478
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,280
Seriously...

479
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,710
Right!

480
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,700
I saw him right around here.

481
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,280
Was he leaving the
Royal Investigation Bureau?

482
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,460
Hey, someone wants
to see you outside.

483
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,430
- Who does?
- How would I know?

484
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,070
They're waiting on the side street.

485
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,460
I was using my brain for once.

486
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,110
And someone has to interrupt me.

487
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,100
What?

488
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,520
They made me come here.

489
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,000
But no one's here. Huh?

490
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,870
Who are you?

491
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,910
What's going on?

492
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,390
Who are you?

493
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,770
- Move.
- Capture him.

494
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,270
Wait, wait.

495
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,470
What are you doing right now?

496
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,420
You should capture the
one who ran away.

497
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,340
- He's the King's security guard!
- What?

498
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,110
My apologies.

499
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,940
I almost died just now, didn't I?

500
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,570
I need to catch him
and find out who he is.

501
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,380
How could you let
him go like that?

502
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,650
He had a scar on the
back of his neck.

503
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,000
A scar on the back of his neck?

504
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,720
- Let's go for now.
- Where are we going?

505
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,590
His Majesty wants to see you.

506
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:45,710
Consort Hong put
poison in my teacup.

507
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,210
Did you make her do that?

508
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,930
At last...

509
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,570
I asked you if you
made her do that.

510
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,010
No, Your Majesty.

511
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,090
If so, tell me what you know.

512
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,030
Forgive me,

513
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,020
but I have nothing to tell you.

514
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,100
But there's one thing.

515
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,150
I wasn't lying when I said
Consort Hong is a victim of the

516
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,540
political power struggle.

517
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,890
What happened is...

518
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,740
definitely not what she intended.

519
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,990
Please try to understand

520
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,850
her true intention.

521
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,580
Do you still not understand?

522
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,280
Not just you, but
your real daughter

523
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,730
and your entire family might
get beheaded for treason.

524
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:34,110
It would be better if
you tell me the truth.

525
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,680
My apologies, sir.

526
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,610
I'll find another chance
and take care of it.

527
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,660
That's not like you.

528
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,870
By chance, did you reveal
your face to them?

529
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,640
No, I was wearing a mask.

530
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,650
You'd better not make
any more mistakes.

531
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,750
Yes, sir!

532
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,760
Aigoo.

533
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,850
Aigoo, why this place again?

534
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:08,150
That cell with a bed was nice...

535
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,040
Aigoo, Your Majesty!

536
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:16,830
Your Majesty, I almost died today.

537
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,710
So let me tell you what happened...

538
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,690
Well, when you want to
see me next time,

539
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,470
could you choose a
different spot than this?

540
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:28,110
This place is where I...

541
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,980
Your Majesty!

542
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,500
Your Majesty, why
are you doing this?

543
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,380
I almost died just now.

544
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,090
How dare you...

545
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,100
How dare you mock
me in this place?

546
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,200
You said you found the queen
who woke up in the forest

547
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,500
and became friends
with her. It was all a lie!

548
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,060
What are the true identities
of you and that woman?

549
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,210
I... I don't know.

550
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,460
You don't know?

551
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,940
It's not that I don't know.

552
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,950
She's like my sister,

553
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:14,290
a friend, a business partner...

554
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,410
who's a trouble maker and...

555
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,570
She's just a pitiful person.

556
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,410
That's all I know.

557
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:25,060
I didn't have to know anymore,
and I didn't want to either.

558
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,630
I deserve to be killed
by you, but...

559
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:32,450
I can't tell you anything
more than that.

560
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,000
Place Hong Ki Ho
under house arrest

561
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,770
and lock him up in
here for a while.

562
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

563
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,230
How could it be so frustrating?

564
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,330
Consort Hong definitely

565
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,660
made King extremely upset.

566
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,160
But what could she have done?

567
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,210
I told my servants to look into it

568
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,370
and even His Majesty's
servants have no idea

569
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,860
why Consort Hong was
placed under house arrest.

570
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,650
I heard Officer Han visited
the royal physician.

571
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,860
I do not know the circumstances,

572
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:42,050
but I heard he brought a medicine
bottle and inquired what's inside of it.

573
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,370
A medicine bottle?

574
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,800
Isn't that strange?

575
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,020
He doesn't allow anyone to speak
about the house arrest.

576
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,240
Sir.

577
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,100
Today is the last day we
chose as the deadline.

578
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,520
If Eun Bo doesn't come
out by seven o'clock,

579
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,670
our plan will fail.

580
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:04,400
Let's wait until seven o'clock.

581
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,390
My Lady.

582
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,790
Please have just a bite.

583
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,990
You might pass out at this rate.

584
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:32,060
His Majesty is here!

585
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,400
The thing is...

586
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,210
She couldn't eat anything...

587
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,980
Wal and Hong Ki Ho.

588
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:07,110
The two of them had
great faith in you.

589
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,910
Neither of them would
say anything about you.

590
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,940
Have a seat.

591
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,160
This is the last chance
I am giving you.

592
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,380
Tell the truth with
your own mouth.

593
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,780
Are you planning not
to say anything?

594
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,950
I...

595
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,570
am not...

596
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,550
Kang Eun Ki.

597
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,410
Kang Eun Ki is...

598
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,960
my sister's name.

599
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,930
It would be more accurate
to call her your twin sister.

600
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,520
Did you know?

601
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,160
Thinking about it that way
answered all of my questions.

602
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,350
The fact that you were
chasing the assassin,

603
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,860
the fact that you met with me
as the owner of Buyong Agency,

604
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,210
and remembering everything about our
childhood. All of those things...

605
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,170
The little girl I met
ten years ago...

606
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,420
was probably not Eun Ki, but you.

607
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,250
Yes.

608
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,670
For what purpose did
you try to poison me?

609
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:37,910
I cannot seem to find
the answer to it.

610
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:40,150
Please kill me.

611
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:41,810
Please kill me and...

612
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:44,880
let others live.

613
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,770
It's all my fault.

614
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,120
I'm the one who fooled you

615
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,730
and planned to assassinate you.

616
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,950
It was all me.

617
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:57,280
I'm willing to die.

618
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,360
So, please...

619
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,490
They're innocent people.

620
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:03,150
Everything is my fault...

621
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,900
Tell me what your purpose was.

622
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,070
If I don't assassinate you,

623
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,790
he said he'd reveal my identity

624
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:23,010
and kill everyone around me.

625
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,840
I couldn't let that happen
to Mother, Wal,

626
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,890
and Hong Ki Ho's
family because of me.

627
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:29,980
Who did?

628
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,680
And for what reason did
he threaten you like that?

629
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:39,620
There are people who
are tempting the throne.

630
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,320
What do you mean,
tempting the throne?

631
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,520
Whom are you talking about?

632
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,800
She didn't show up.

633
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,450
It's a failure then.

634
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,340
Find out if everything is
okay in the palace.

635
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,260
It's His Excellency Baek Ja Yong

636
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,540
and the prince, Lee Jae Hwa.

637
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,920
Did you say Baek Ja Yong just now?

638
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,390
And the Prince?

639
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:28,280
You mean your father's
friend Baek Ja Yong?

640
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,060
Are you sure it's
Lee Jae Hwa, the prince?

641
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,940
Yes.

642
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,400
Baek Ja Yong...

643
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,500
tried to assassinate me?

644
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,930
Baek Ja Yong and the
Prince are traitors?

645
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,050
Please let my mother live.

646
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:49,980
Please let Wal and the
innocent people live.

647
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,010
Please let them live.

648
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,540
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty, please...

649
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,580
Revoke Consort Hong's house arrest
and watch her surroundings.

650
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,980
Baek Ja Yong and the
Prince might contact her.

651
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,530
Han Mo, leave the palace immediately
and watch where they go.

652
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,440
They conspired against me.

653
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,040
You must find out their moves
and arrest them immediately!

654
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

655
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:41,330
So the woman did not come to us.

656
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:43,810
We will know the details
when we hear from her,

657
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,480
but I heard things are
quiet in the palace.

658
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,300
If my hunch is correct,

659
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,210
Eun Bo didn't act
according to the plan.

660
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,540
She probably can't tell
on us to the King.

661
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,020
That means she'll have to
tell him all of her secrets.

662
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:01,390
But don't go back to your
residence just in case.

663
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:06,230
I'll prepare an escape route in the
headquarters and a boat as well.

664
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,680
Let's go ahead and
prepare our next plan.

665
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,270
You mean right away?

666
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:13,110
If she gave up on her
own by chance,

667
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:17,240
she'll be able to
execute our next plan.

668
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,190
Whether we threaten
her or persuade her,

669
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,910
we just need to get
her out of the palace.

670
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,850
If we do, we can hold her hostage

671
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:28,910
and lure the King outside too.

672
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,280
Although the first plan
went to ruin,

673
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,090
but things have already started.

674
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,700
We can't delay any longer.

675
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:40,560
I'll take this opportunity and
kill the King no matter what.

676
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,580
Your Highness,
it's Court Lady Jung.

677
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,780
Come in.

678
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:05,580
I heard Consort Hong's house
arrest has been revoked.

679
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,640
Was it the King's order?

680
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,830
And we still do not know
the reason for the arrest?

681
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,300
No, Your Highness.

682
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,780
Grandmother.

683
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,610
Could you let me handle this?

684
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:23,930
Is it not the inner court’s
jurisdiction to find out what

685
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:27,810
Consort Hong did to His Majesty
to be placed under house arrest

686
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:32,750
and make sure something like
that never happens again?

687
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:37,990
The queen definitely must strengthen
law and order in the palace.

688
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,830
However...

689
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,780
the King is very upset right now.

690
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,090
So let's wait and see for now.

691
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,280
Yes.

692
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,410
How are things
inside the palace?

693
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:57,650
I heard there isn't much going on.

694
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,170
Give this to Consort Hong's
palace lady by tonight.

695
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,540
I cannot seem to find either
the Prince and Baek Ja Yong.

696
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,240
Neither of them returned
to their residences.

697
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,420
How about around Consort Hong?
Have you noticed anything?

698
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,610
No, not yet.

699
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,250
Watch closely.

700
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,400
Geez, it's not too bad in here now.

701
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,960
Anyway, what in the
world is going on?

702
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,110
I shouldn't be strapped
down here like this.

703
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,660
If he had a scar on the
back of his neck,

704
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:44,080
he must be that bastard Gae Pyeong,
Gae Dong, Gae Shik, or whatever.

705
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,960
I should've caught him
then and there!

706
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,780
Why did Officer Kim have
to stop us like that...

707
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,590
Hold on, how come...

708
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,800
Right at that moment...

709
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:03,900
Someone wants to
see you outside.

710
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,940
What's going on?

711
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,760
By chance...

712
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,820
is he the spy at the Bureau?

713
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,700
Excuse me, excuse me!

714
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,100
Is anyone out there?

715
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,500
I think I just found out
something really important!

716
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,500
Excuse me!

717
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,040
Excuse me!

718
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,890
What took you so long?

719
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:44,090
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong
wants you to have this.

720
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,370
How come I do not see Yeo Wool?

721
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:07,810
She left an hour ago and
hasn't come back yet.

722
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,760
- Go look for her.
- Yes.

723
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,490
If you want to save your mother,

724
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:24,670
come outside the palace
at noon discreetly tomorrow.

725
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:27,620
A pathfinder will be waiting
at the end of Yookjo Street.

726
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,670
That man will lead
the way for you.

727
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:32,160
Your Majesty, what should I do?

728
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,110
You can follow that
man over there.

729
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:46,840
It's a trap!

730
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,060
Attack!

731
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,010
Run.

732
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:57,310
Hurry!

733
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:27,760
We arrested His Excellency
Baek Ja Yong and put him in jail,

734
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,660
but the Prince wasn't there.

735
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,670
Tell the soldiers to locate
the Prince immediately.

736
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:34,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

737
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,880
What should I do with the
palace lady named Yeo Wool?

738
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,390
Take her back to Consort Hong's villa.

739
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:42,500
Yes.

740
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,180
What made you think of
sending Office Han in a litter?

741
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:54,720
Baek Ja Yong and the Prince
were already keeping a low profile.

742
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,330
If we lose the chance, they
would've disappeared forever.

743
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:02,080
And if so, Kang Yi Soo's wife, their
hostage, might not have survived.

744
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,450
We had to capture him while
he approached with his guard down.

745
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:07,050
Your Majesty.

746
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,850
I still cannot believe this.

747
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:12,310
How could an upright
man like Baek Ja Yong...

748
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,180
And the Prince, who
looked so innocent...

749
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,820
It seems like it's impossible
to know people.

750
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,470
What happened?

751
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,070
I was worried because
I couldn't find you.

752
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,430
Why did Officer Han
bring you here?

753
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,270
My Lady!

754
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:47,240
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong got
arrested because of me.

755
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,620
- What?
- It's my fault.

756
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,410
But I had no other choice.

757
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:54,530
His Majesty said he would

758
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:57,650
forgive me if I did that.

759
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,690
Your Excellency!

760
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,060
Your Excellency!

761
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,680
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong
got arrested?

762
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,210
The royal guards
followed the litter.

763
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,150
What are you saying?

764
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:17,000
How did the King know?

765
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,060
By chance...

766
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,740
did that woman...

767
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,580
What should we do now, sir?

768
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,480
We'll evacuate this place for now.

769
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,780
Prepare the guns.

770
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:31,630
You should stay here and keep an eye
on His Excellency Baek Ja Yong's status.

771
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:32,840
Yes!

772
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,870
What brings you to the
Queen's Palace?

773
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:57,840
I thought I should let you know
about this, no matter what.

774
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,730
It's the reason why
Consort Hong was arrested.

775
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:05,610
It seems like she used some
kind of drug on His Majesty.

776
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:08,960
What do you mean, drug?
How could it be...

777
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,710
What drug did Consort Hong use?

778
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:15,190
Even the royal physician who examined it under
His Majesty's order will not speak.

779
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,170
I do not know what
happened exactly,

780
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:18,940
but it is evident, don't you think?

781
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,980
She used a drug while
sharing a bedroom?

782
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:26,150
You must bring Consort Hong here
and question her immediately.

783
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,580
You said the royal
physician investigated it.

784
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,480
Are you sure about that?

785
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,550
It is not your fault.

786
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:37,610
I would've done the
same if I were you.

787
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,750
But he was my master
who took care of me.

788
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,250
And I betrayed him.

789
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:47,210
I feel so bad toward you
too, My Lady.

790
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:51,740
I didn't know he was plotting
something so serious.

791
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,440
He committed treason...

792
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,700
If so...

793
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:59,060
what would happen to His Excellency
Baek Ja Yong now?

794
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,810
And what would happen to you?

795
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,530
My Lady.

796
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,850
Someone came from
the Queen's Palace.

797
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:16,870
I heard you are the one

798
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:20,510
who gave Consort Hong
this poison to kill me.

799
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:26,260
Did you do this to make
the Prince the new king?

800
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:29,670
I am not sure what
you are talking about.

801
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:34,060
I am the only one who
planned to assassinate you.

802
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:37,090
Since I wanted a world that
is owned by the people,

803
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:38,220
I gave Consort Hong...

804
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:40,600
I mean,

805
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,300
Kang Yi Soo's daughter that poison.

806
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,310
Did you place her in the selection

807
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,710
to commit treason
from the beginning?

808
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,530
- Because you needed military rights?
- That's correct.

809
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,330
And you came up with this plan

810
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:54,260
because she failed
to be selected?

811
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,650
Were Kang Yi Soo...

812
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,810
and Hong Ki Ho
among you as well?

813
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:01,520
Did she agree to do this?

814
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,750
They were with me at first,
but they all turned away.

815
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,480
Considering that you
are alive and well,

816
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,590
she must've done
the same as well.

817
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,630
Where are Kang Yi Soo's wife
and the Prince right now?

818
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,540
Kang Yi Soo's wife is at
Chunggye Temple right now.

819
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,280
I do not know where the Prince is.

820
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,990
For what reason did you
come all the way here?

821
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:27,900
I...

822
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,700
always had faith in you.

823
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:35,520
You were one of the few servants who
care about the people in this chaotic situation.

824
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,820
I knew you distrusted me,

825
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,970
but I thought you would
eventually be on my side.

826
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:46,120
That would have never happened.

827
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:50,110
Is it because the Prince
is your master?

828
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:53,320
It is because I thought
it is impossible to

829
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,720
start a new world with
you from the beginning.

830
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,970
I do not want to give
you any more excuses.

831
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:00,450
Please kill me now.

832
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,660
What are you so proud of?

833
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,630
You committed high treason
by trying to assassinate me!

834
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:08,190
That is why I'm asking you
to hurry and kill me.

835
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:11,130
You deserve to be
beheaded immediately,

836
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:14,890
but considering the countless
people you saved,

837
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:16,930
I will order you to commit suicide.

838
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,060
I want you to

839
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,730
pay for your sin

840
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,690
with your own hands.

841
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,760
Your Highness.

842
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,240
Consort Hong is here.

843
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,910
How dare you use a drug
to tempt His Majesty?

844
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,670
How could you be so vulgar?

845
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:49,900
What were you planning to do

846
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,130
after giving His Majesty
an aphrodisiac?

847
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:55,190
I never used an aphrodisiac.

848
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:56,340
Then...

849
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:59,860
what was the drug the royal physician
examined under His Majesty's order?

850
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,950
What was it if it wasn't
an aphrodisiac?

851
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,400
Forgive me for saying this,

852
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,970
but please ask
His Majesty yourself.

853
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:09,060
His Majesty ordered
me not to talk about it.

854
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,340
What?

855
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:13,110
So...

856
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,430
you will keep your mouth shut?

857
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:19,570
His Majesty will reveal the
truth to everyone soon.

858
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:22,990
I will receive

859
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:25,060
any punishment I deserve then.

860
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,940
What does that mean?

861
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,280
What wrong have you committed?

862
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,830
Forgive me.

863
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:33,460
I have nothing else to tell you.

864
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,080
Get out.

865
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:52,880
Follow Consort Hong.

866
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,510
I find her too strange.

867
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:58,110
Report to me right away
if she does something.

868
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:00,390
Yes, Your Highness.

869
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:13,740
Could you send a message
to Chief Eunuch Hwang?

870
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,530
Your Majesty,
it's Chief Eunuch Hwang.

871
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:26,530
Go to Chunggye Temple and
bring Kang Yi Soo's wife.

872
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:27,650
Yes.

873
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:37,670
Your Majesty, Consort Hong

874
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:41,590
is requesting to see you
for one last time.

875
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,270
Baek Ja Yong got arrested.

876
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:14,840
Did you hear?

877
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,400
Yes.

878
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:21,950
He was my father's friend.

879
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:24,090
No matter what his intention was,

880
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,310
he helped me when
I had no place to go.

881
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:32,990
It's a shame that I
reported him myself.

882
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:35,770
What is the reason
you wanted to see me?

883
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:38,160
I have something
I'd like to tell you.

884
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,770
Your Majesty.

885
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,730
Please do not feel tormented

886
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,890
at all when you punish me.

887
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:49,820
I have nothing to say,
even if you order me to die.

888
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:53,540
Please do not care for me.

889
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:55,140
How presumptuous.

890
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:57,610
My apologies.

891
01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:01,010
Why is it so easy for you?

892
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:03,300
"Punish me."

893
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:07,590
How could you cajole me
so easily like that?

894
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:08,720
Teach me.

895
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,000
How could it be so
simple like that?

896
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,490
It is not like that.

897
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,880
You are the one I fell for.

898
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,460
But I revealed my heart to Eun Ki.

899
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,950
I missed Eun Ki after she died
thinking of you as a child.

900
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:22,820
Who are you?

901
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:25,220
Who was I in love with?

902
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:28,260
This is what you did to me.
Do you realize?

903
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,200
I am sorry.

904
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,200
I am so sorry.

905
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,200
What am I to you?

906
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:39,130
Did you even love me?

907
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:43,770
I loved you.

908
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,160
I still love you.

909
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,560
You are lying.

910
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,020
How could someone like
that try to poison me?

911
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:54,700
I put poison in my teacup too.

912
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,520
I wanted to die with you

913
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,470
if we cannot live together.

914
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,310
Although you...

915
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:09,880
probably do not believe
me anymore.

916
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:24,470
Why will you not tell
me to believe you?

917
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:27,180
Beg me to believe you just once.

918
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,050
How could I do that?

919
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:31,990
That would only make
you suffer more.

920
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:38,310
But what if I still want to
try to believe you?

921
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:40,520
If only that's possible,

922
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,500
I will...

923
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:47,410
only love you for the
rest of my life.

924
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:56,500
♫ In this wind, you and I will
approach each other  ♫

925
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,800
♫ And in that frozen moment, ♫

926
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:04,140
♫ We'll become one
and stay together ♫

927
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:07,870
♫ Just one more step,
one more moment, ♫

928
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:11,070
♫ And one more word ♫

929
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:15,320
♫ If only I could say it ♫

930
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:21,960
♫ Let's not let go of
our hands even if it hurts ♫

931
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:31,400
♫ So this moment can last forever ♫

932
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:39,990
♫ Suddenly you and I are looking
at each other smiling ♫

933
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:42,720
[ Queen: Love and War ]

934
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,650
It'd be dangerous if
your condition persists.

935
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,300
You mean you will not let me have
prophetic dreams anymore?

936
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,900
Eun Bo, I will not let you go.

937
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,850
Why is it always that woman?

938
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:54,760
I wanted to become
Your Majesty's wife.

939
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,410
You will get your position back.

940
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:59,330
Do you know what
your father did to me?

941
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:00,900
And what he did to His Majesty?

942
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,250
I want her to disappear
in front of me.

943
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:06,440
If a woman becomes
His Majesty's weakness...

944
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:10,340
We should wait and see whose
weakness will become vulnerable.
