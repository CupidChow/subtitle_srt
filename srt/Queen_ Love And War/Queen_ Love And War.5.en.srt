00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,110
[ Queen: Love and War ]

2
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,960
This is His Excellency, Hong Ki Ho,
who will lend you his family name.

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,340
From now on, your name is Yeon.

4
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,200
Hong Yeon.

5
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,190
This is the daughter of Hong Ki Ho,
the governor of Gyeonggi.

6
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,440
Eun Ki!

7
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,820
The queen is alive?

8
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,010
The Queen Dowager
wants to see you.

9
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,120
Remember.

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,430
You're your sister Eun Ki
in front of her.

11
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,730
It was the queen.
Didn't you see her?

12
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,450
It was definitely the queen!

13
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,530
You said you wanted to
participate in the selection?

14
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,900
What's your motive?

15
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,770
I want to find the man
who pointed a gun at me

16
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,740
and destroyed everything.

17
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,310
Congratulations!

18
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,570
You're living the good life now.

19
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,250
Because of your grandfather
who was a traitor,

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,680
I heard you had to live in hiding.

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,090
How could you stand there
and just listen to that?

22
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,590
You have to silence people like
that even by tripping them.

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,320
He was right about everything.

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,710
To this day, I'm still hiding.

25
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,220
Everyone hides.

26
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,400
Behind their name, family,
and tall fences.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,300
Thanks to you, I made
up my mind as well.

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,490
Kang Yi Soo's daughter is entering
the first round of the selection.

29
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,240
We'll have to make sure
she's on our side

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,800
before sending her to the king.

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,600
How could she be
still alive and be here?

32
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,670
Find out if there's a daughter of

33
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,600
Hong Ki Ho, the governor of
Gyeonggi among the candidates.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,120
The daughter of the governor
of Gyeonggi is indeed among them.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,710
Here comes His Majesty!

36
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,640
I'll join you too,
Great Royal Dowager Queen.

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,380
Continue.

38
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,990
[ Episode 5 ]
This is the daughter of Hong Ki Ho,
the governor of Gyeonggi.

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,070
Eun Ki...

40
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,500
What in the world...

41
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,040
Eun Ki...

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,690
Please let me go.

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,670
King.

44
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,450
You are alive?

45
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,140
Let go of her, King.

46
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,900
Please consider what
other people think.

47
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,400
That will be the end
of the presentation.

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,530
Everyone, leave.

49
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,350
What are you doing,
Court Lady Jung?

50
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,470
Escort the young ladies
to the waiting room!

51
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,740
Yes.

52
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,500
Please follow me.

53
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,130
King.

54
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,330
Your Majesty.

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,790
What happened?

56
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,510
Since when...

57
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,660
Are you feeling okay?

58
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,120
Are you hurt in any way?

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,070
Please stop for a second, King.

60
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,740
Explain yourself.

61
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,370
Are you truly Eun Ki?

62
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,120
I'm not sure what you mean.

63
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,400
What trouble will you
cause this time?

64
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,040
- Mother.
- Queen.

65
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,640
Why are you here?

66
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,330
You should be dead and
buried underground.

67
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,180
How could you be alive?

68
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,930
What are you doing?

69
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,210
What are you all doing?

70
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,060
Bring Queen Mother to
her chamber right now!

71
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,580
Are you a ghost or a monster?

72
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,510
Please stop, Mother!

73
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,840
Will you...

74
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,900
Will you endanger
the king's life again?

75
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,570
Mother!

76
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,710
- Mother!
- Your Highness!

77
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,820
- Queen!
- Mother!

78
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,860
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

79
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,970
- Your Highness!
- Mother.

80
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,880
- Mother!
- Your Highness!

81
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,050
Mother!

82
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,030
How is she?

83
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,010
She became weak momentarily
due to a huge shock.

84
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,260
She'll be able to wake up soon.

85
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,200
That's a relief, King.

86
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,800
Did you know by chance?

87
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,100
You saw the queen showing up
to the selection today.

88
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm asking whether you
intended her to be there.

89
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,960
How could that be?

90
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,790
I was surprised as well.

91
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,320
Also, she said that
she's not the queen.

92
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,990
It was the queen.

93
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,190
If that young lady were
really the queen,

94
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,690
why do you think she
didn't reach you first?

95
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,700
Eun Ki.

96
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,680
Does she know His Majesty?

97
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,160
I know, right?

98
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,430
What's going on anyway?

99
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,950
Didn't His Majesty...

100
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,990
embrace her?

101
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,810
- So strange.
- Eun Ki?

102
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,660
Who's Eun Ki?

103
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,110
Queen Dowager wants you
to leave the palace.

104
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,950
The selection process
will resume tomorrow.

105
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,290
Don't we deserve to know
what's going on, at least?

106
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,960
The King ordered to keep silent
about what happened today.

107
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,530
I'll get the litters ready.

108
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,310
You may leave the palace now.

109
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,460
Excuse me.

110
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,430
His Majesty wants to see you.

111
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,470
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,590
Forget everything Mother said.

113
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,730
Please look at me.

114
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,770
It's just you and me now.

115
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,500
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

116
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,710
Before coming to the palace,
I was told not to step on the

117
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,980
shadow of the king and not look
at the king's face directly.

118
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:00,060
But I behaved rudely since
I was caught off guard earlier.

119
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,400
- Queen.
- What do you mean, "Queen?"

120
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,160
How could you say something
so unimaginable?

121
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,070
I'm just a woman who's
participating in the selection.

122
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,130
Why are you doing this, Eun Ki?

123
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,630
My apologies, but I'm Yeon
from the Hong family.

124
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,720
Raise your head.

125
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,300
It's an order.

126
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,930
Do not step away.

127
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,660
It's an order.

128
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,720
There's no way I'm
mistaken about you.

129
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,380
But I'm not the woman you
think I am, Your Majesty.

130
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,790
That's a lie.

131
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,550
It's the truth.

132
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,560
Are you punishing me?

133
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,900
Are you punishing me like this

134
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,540
because I couldn't protect you?

135
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,980
Your Majesty.

136
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,550
Please do not put me in a
difficult position anymore.

137
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,000
I beg you.

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,070
Please let me go.

139
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,480
Please help me.

140
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,430
Try to make it to the last stage
of the selection on your own.

141
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,380
I'll decide whether
I'll help you or not then.

142
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,120
And...

143
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,970
even if you run into the King,

144
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,460
do not try to reveal your identity.

145
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,160
If you indeed came back to life,

146
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,230
do you think he'd let you
remain as a candidate?

147
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,780
Your plan to catch the
culprit yourself

148
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,110
- would go to waste.
- Yes, ma'am.

149
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,250
I'll follow your order.

150
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,560
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,250
Your Majesty!

152
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,090
Your Majesty!

153
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,740
You can't step out of
the palace like this.

154
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,420
You know that, Your Majesty.

155
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,730
Han Mo.

156
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

157
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,860
Protect that girl.

158
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,460
So she won't be put into
danger or disappear.

159
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,290
Tighten the security
at the Hwigyeongjae.

160
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,830
Yes.

161
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,080
By the way, Your Highness...

162
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,220
Why are you telling His Majesty
that she's Hong Yeon?

163
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,800
King would probably try to get
her reinstated immediately.

164
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,980
The queen's family is
a family of a traitor.

165
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,960
We haven't even caught the culprit.

166
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,690
I can't let the palace to be
in disturbance again.

167
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,860
I ran into the King
during the selection.

168
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,330
You mean the King was there?

169
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,110
And did you deal with it well?

170
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,300
I said I'm Hong Yeon according
to the Queen Dowager's order.

171
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,830
But he didn't seem to believe me.

172
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,180
You did well.

173
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,920
You can't win this battle without
the Queen Dowager's help.

174
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,200
You need to follow her orders
and turn her into your ally.

175
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,420
Yes.

176
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,160
So are you firm in your resolve?

177
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,860
I read the Theory of Enlightenment.

178
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,010
If that's the path Father chose,

179
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,800
I'll follow his footsteps.

180
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,700
However...

181
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,880
I need to find the culprit
who killed my sister first.

182
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,700
The revenge on the
King comes afterward.

183
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,710
You mean she's really
the deceased queen?

184
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,300
I even passed out.
Isn't that enough to tell?

185
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,210
We need to come up with a solution.

186
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,810
She connivingly faked her identity
and entered the selection.

187
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,800
She will seduce the King again.

188
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,320
I confirmed with the coroner.

189
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,160
He saw a cold corpse
without a doubt.

190
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,940
The soldiers who dumped the
Queen's body outside the palace

191
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,520
testified the same way.

192
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,680
Seriously...

193
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,240
This must be the end of the world.

194
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,240
How could the dead
keep coming back to life?

195
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,880
What if Kang Yi Soo
comes back to life too?

196
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,040
Hey!

197
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,150
Don't say stuff like that
in this situation.

198
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,810
You're scaring me.

199
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,680
Nothing serious would happen yet.

200
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,370
You should look into it further
and deal with it afterward.

201
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,680
I'm worried about the
Queen Mother's nagging.

202
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,520
She is so scared out of her wits.

203
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,560
It Iooks like you have not

204
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,900
heard the news yet, Left State Minister.

205
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,520
Father.

206
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,410
There's a woman who
has the Queen's face!

207
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,110
His Majesty saw her too.

208
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,960
Is that why you're
trembling so much?

209
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,570
If so,

210
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,280
would you like to go back
home with me then?

211
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,700
Do you want to move
back to the annex

212
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,600
and hide your love for him
for the rest of your life?

213
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,960
No, I don't want to.

214
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,950
If so...

215
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,420
stop trembling, Sweetheart.

216
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,350
If the Queen really came back to life,

217
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,630
I'll find the evidence and
get her out of your sight.

218
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,690
She is the daughter of a traitor.

219
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,170
Not only would she get
disqualified from the selection,

220
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,170
but she'd be killed on the spot.

221
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,020
I'll look into the
Hong family thoroughly.

222
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,870
You have to be strong.

223
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,100
You just need to do as I say.

224
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,860
During the early selection,

225
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,350
just smile innocently no matter
whom you're competing with.

226
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,840
So that no one would
think of you as a threat.

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,700
That's what you have to do.

228
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,500
Do you understand?

229
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,780
Go inside.

230
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,180
Father.

231
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,860
That's the woman.

232
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,730
Let's go.

233
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,900
She has the dead queen's face?

234
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,250
I've only heard about
how huge the palace is.

235
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,720
If I didn't have beef jerky,

236
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,780
I would've fainted while walking.

237
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,440
There's no way I could live here.

238
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,610
I was a bit tempted
when I saw him today.

239
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,600
Didn't you see his face today?
He's totally handsome.

240
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,100
He's my type.

241
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,850
We got to see his handsome
face, thanks to you.

242
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,000
Should I thank you for that?

243
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,500
By the way,

244
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,840
who is Eun Ki anyway?

245
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,330
Am I the only one who's curious?

246
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,280
Oh, yes!

247
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,880
Come to think of it,
I've heard that name before.

248
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,350
She is the tragic queen
who died unexpectedly.

249
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,520
Am I wrong?

250
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,740
Thank you for telling me.

251
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,830
I was curious about that too.

252
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,230
But this is such a pity.

253
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,480
You went against the
King's order of silence.

254
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,830
I think you'd receive a penalty.

255
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,630
Lady Kim.

256
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,630
You're receiving a penalty.

257
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,220
She's the daughter of a traitor.

258
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,040
Not only would she get
disqualified from the selection,

259
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,990
but she'd be killed on the spot.

260
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,430
Why do you keep looking?

261
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,200
During the early selection,

262
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,900
just smile innocently no matter
who you're competing with.

263
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,470
Well, it's nothing.

264
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,230
Your Majesty.

265
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,060
It's getting late.

266
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,100
You should go to bed now.

267
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,230
How strange.

268
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,670
What I dreamt about
happened in reality.

269
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,020
That can happen sometimes.

270
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,350
Do not worry about it so much.

271
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,900
Your Majesty, it's Han Mo.

272
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,330
Come in.

273
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,380
The soldiers are guarding
the guest house securely.

274
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,660
- How about her?
- She's safe.

275
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,650
Your Majesty.

276
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,580
What are you worried
about so much?

277
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,960
I cannot possibly forget that face.

278
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,630
As is her voice.

279
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,840
But her eyes...

280
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,270
Her eyes felt somewhat different.

281
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,780
Your Highness.

282
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,540
She endangered my son's life.
Your grandson's life.

283
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,770
She's an evil and wicked thing.

284
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,100
She deserves to be driven out!

285
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,650
Yes, Sister.

286
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,190
I mean, Your Highness.

287
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,120
I agree with her too.

288
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,080
If she is indeed the queen
who came back to life,

289
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,840
she's the daughter of the traitor!

290
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,630
That must be the
Left State Minister's opinion, not yours.

291
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,250
Stop fussing over it.

292
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,130
She's not the dead queen.

293
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,320
Even if that were true,

294
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,430
I have a bad feeling about it.

295
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,100
It's a bad sign!

296
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,820
The first round of selection
already started.

297
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,820
We cannot damage our dignity
as the royals anymore.

298
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,230
But Your Highness...

299
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,360
If she is bad luck
as the Queen said,

300
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,560
she'd get eliminated
during the first round.

301
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,320
This selection will...

302
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,970
be unique in its methods.

303
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,270
This selection will...

304
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,490
be consisted of Gwansang,
Shimsang, Haengsang.

305
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,490
There will be three parts in total.

306
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,550
Gwansang is about the face,
Shimsang is about the heart,

307
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,220
and Haengsang is about the attitude.

308
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,610
That would be the criteria.

309
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,370
Before we examine your faces,

310
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,860
we will check if you're
wearing any makeup.

311
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,720
If you broke the rule

312
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,470
and wore rouge on your lips,

313
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,900
- you will receive a penalty.
- Your Majesty.

314
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,370
Pull yourself together, King.

315
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,140
Do not be confused.

316
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,670
Pulling myself together
will not put an end to this.

317
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,600
Whether she's the queen or not...

318
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,590
everyone will manipulate her
in front of me from now on.

319
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,670
That would include
you too, Grandmother.

320
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,580
Do not try to take advantage
of her, no matter what.

321
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,530
I will be keeping my eye on you.

322
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,820
And...

323
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,790
if that woman turns out
to be the queen,

324
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,720
I will protect her no
matter what it takes...

325
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,430
this time.

326
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,260
What is it about?

327
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,640
It's nothing important.
I'll get going.

328
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,900
- So that man woke up?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

329
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,990
Your Majesty, I'll send a notorious
torturer along, so he confesses.

330
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,200
- I'll visit him myself.
- Pardon?

331
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,300
You want to do this yourself?

332
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,980
Yes.

333
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,300
Get ready.

334
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,530
Right now?

335
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,590
Never mind.

336
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,690
It would be better if you
went after the sunset.

337
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,100
I'll say that I'm leaving to
inspect public offices.

338
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,090
- Han Mo, only you come with me.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

339
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,170
I will put you on an important duty.

340
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,110
Don't be so pouty.

341
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,920
Did you say "an important duty?"

342
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,390
Keep an eye on that woman.

343
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

344
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,420
Your Majesty, by the way,
the thing is...

345
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,010
Am I spying on her or guarding her?

346
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,420
- It's both.
- Both?

347
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

348
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,160
How did it go?

349
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,670
I don't know what that
old woman is plotting.

350
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,320
I managed to make
myself a judge, at least.

351
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,540
I planted one of my court ladies
as a judge as well.

352
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,020
Well done!

353
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,820
What should I do then?

354
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,040
Things would get too loud
if you get involved.

355
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,410
Song Yi and I will take care of this.

356
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,420
So just step aside.

357
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,360
Pass.

358
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,200
Pass.

359
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,680
A penalty for Lady Hong.

360
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,280
Hold on a second.

361
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,170
I'm not wearing rouge.

362
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,440
It definitely smudged.

363
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,450
Please check one more time.

364
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,040
Please check again.

365
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,910
What's going on?

366
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,650
I double-checked, but...

367
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,940
Lady Hong will receive
an extra penalty.

368
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,830
One's attitude toward the
process and the result

369
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,690
is also a part of the evaluation.

370
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,840
Hurry up with the rest.

371
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,160
I'll do it.

372
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,970
Pass.

373
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:24,400
A lot of you didn't pass
the makeup test.

374
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,520
Please remove
everything on your face.

375
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,150
What's wrong?

376
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,310
I have smelled wolfsbane before.

377
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,490
Wolfsbane?

378
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,800
It's poisonous.

379
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,700
It itches your skin
and turns it red too.

380
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,450
Lady Hong!

381
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,340
Could you lend me your
towel if you're done?

382
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,130
The one I already used?

383
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,000
But your hands are...

384
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It'd be disadvantageous for
me if I make a fuss now.

385
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,260
Do you recognize me?

386
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,240
He has not fully recovered yet.

387
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,870
He cannot talk normally.

388
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,560
Your Majesty.

389
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,880
Many people died because of you.

390
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,500
They were guarding me
and were at your gunpoint.

391
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,390
They were my men.

392
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,700
Everyone who died that day

393
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,700
were my men whom I cared about.

394
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,720
The only way for me
to send them off

395
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,310
is to punish the one
who's behind you.

396
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,880
So you'd better open your mouth!

397
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,800
Tell me whom you're
working for.

398
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,710
And you'll have to...

399
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,490
You'll have to be punished for
your crime no matter what.

400
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,760
Your Majesty.

401
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,740
Have you noticed
anyone looking for him?

402
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,770
No, not yet.

403
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,700
Move to a different shelter at night

404
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,360
and find out who he is first.

405
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

406
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,900
See you later.

407
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,510
Look who's back.

408
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,450
Any news about the owner
of the Buyong Agency yet?

409
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,110
We don't know either.

410
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,360
Whether they're dead or alive.

411
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,050
By the way...

412
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,370
Who are you? Why do you
keep looking for them?

413
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,730
I'll be back.

414
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,090
Let me know if you
hear about them.

415
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,180
I already talked to the
face reader about this.

416
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,160
Give it to her when you get a chance.

417
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,640
Yes, Your Highness.

418
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,370
[ Gwansang: Face Reading ]

419
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,150
We'll start the face reading
evaluation now.

420
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:35,670
Since all three parts of
your face are weak,

421
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,570
your spirit is weak and timid.

422
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,090
This type of face isn't
the face of a queen.

423
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,360
You're destined to acquire
what's not yours.

424
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,990
What does that mean?

425
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,010
Please refrain from
asking questions.

426
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,890
He's not a shaman.

427
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,040
Your forehead is prominent,
and eyelashes are long.

428
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,290
Your father will determine
your destiny.

429
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,050
Your stance resembles a mountain,

430
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,580
but you lack yang energy,
which is essential to a queen.

431
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,260
Your lips are unusually red

432
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,920
and your lick them often.

433
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,540
I can sense that your
desires have been repressed.

434
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,880
You have an exceptional face.

435
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,350
You look just like a phoenix.

436
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,650
Your pupils are strong

437
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,490
and your eyebrows are smooth.

438
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,600
Your ears resemble fans

439
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,760
and your lips are plump.

440
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,930
You definitely have
the face of a queen.

441
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,260
- The king saw her face?
- Yes.

442
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,940
Apparently, nothing happened
thanks to the Queen Dowager.

443
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,760
The Queen Dowager's plotting
against her grandson

444
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,540
turns out to be beneficial to us.

445
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,960
Tell her to be careful, so they
don't find out who she is.

446
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,730
Yes, sir.

447
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,000
She finally decided to be on our side.

448
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,420
Is that so?

449
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,210
I'm curious...

450
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,450
to see what kind of woman she is.

451
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,530
Well...

452
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,310
here's another one who
has a queen's face...

453
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,600
What are you talking about?

454
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,020
Which one has a
queen's face anyway?

455
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,910
The thing is...

456
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,830
The thing is...

457
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,840
This young lady has
a queen's face.

458
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,290
How impressive.

459
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,210
You have a queen's face.

460
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,620
That means you made the first place
in the Gwansang test.

461
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,730
- Don't you think?
- You're right.

462
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,140
Congratulations.

463
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,820
You're so loud!

464
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,130
Be quiet.

465
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,000
Are you the only people
around here?

466
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,600
I'm sorry.

467
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,200
You didn't like how loud we were.

468
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,520
By the way, are you frustrated
about things in general?

469
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,410
Is that why you're
frustrated and repressed?

470
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,590
That is a barracks that
serves the Kim family.

471
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,870
If it's a barracks,

472
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,830
there must be a ledger
of the hunters.

473
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,530
Find out his name and address.

474
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,910
And find everything
that can be evidence.

475
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

476
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,350
Aigoo, sir. You came.

477
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,060
You act like this is your house.

478
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,050
Welcome.

479
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:59,730
It's all thanks to your generosity, sir.

480
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,410
It's making me tear up...

481
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,210
- I saw you stretching.
- Did you?

482
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,800
You should've said so then.

483
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,760
Something smells smoky.

484
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,540
- Do I smell gunpowder?
- Hey!

485
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,030
You're usually a happy man.

486
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,120
But you look kind of upset today.

487
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,120
Did something happen
while you were out?

488
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,960
Did someone trip you or...

489
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,620
slap you or something...

490
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,810
The rent.

491
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,670
- Give it to me now.
- Pardon?

492
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,410
Where can I see her?

493
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,520
Lady Hong Yeon.

494
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,380
Who?

495
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,180
Right!

496
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,790
So she's over yonder...

497
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,400
- What are you doing?
- Across the river...

498
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,310
- Let's go right now.
- Hold on!

00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,450
My stomach. My stomach
hurts all of a sudden.

500
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,070
I had a seaweed salad for lunch...

501
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,000
I think it came out a bit...

502
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,260
I'm sorry, but I need to
use the outhouse...

503
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,100
I know I'm crafty,

504
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,280
but how can I get someone
who's in the palace?

505
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,160
I'll run away for now!

Everyone hides.

507

Behind their name, family,
and tall fences.

It's Wal!

- Do you know how much I missed you?
- Look who's here!

514
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,480
Everyone says the owner
of the Buyong Agency disappeared.

515

But you were alive and well!

516
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,240
Someone came here
looking for you.

517
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,300
Me?

518
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,910
Go away somewhere.

519
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,740
- You only like Cheo Yong.
- Go away!

520

Who was looking for me?

521
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,310
What do you mean?
It was your client.

522

I find clients for you all the time.

523
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,080
I'm not sure, but I think he
could be a pretty big client.

524
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,220
A client? I thought it was...

525
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,130
You said, "big?"

526
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,790
How big?

527
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,180
The thing is...

528
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,450
No, no, no! No. It's okay.

529
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:49,880
Buyong Agency is
closed for a while.

530

Anyway,

531

do Kim's men frequent this
watering hole these days too?

532
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,490
You said you're closed.

533
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,040
What information
do you need now?

534
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,560
Here comes another one.

535
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,010
He's Kim's man.

536

Hey, Cheo Yong.

Why don't you go find
out whether there's

something going on at
Kim's house and the barracks.

539

- Right now?
- Right now, right now.

540

But we didn't get to catch up.

00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,650
- Hurry up.
- What's wrong with you?

544
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,900
Are you the same
playboy I used to know?

545

You used to drool whenever
you see a woman's skirt...

That's why my name is Wal.

547
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,460
How could you say
something so vulgar?

548
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,720
- Leave right now!
- That's why...

549
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,810
When did I drool?

550
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,890
- Let's go, Wal!
- Seriously...

551
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,700
Why did you want to
see me privately?

552
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,620
What will you do with
that dragon's scale?

553
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,690
The dragon's scale?

554
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,810
The scale that grows the opposite
direction on the dragon's neck.

Why are you asking me about that?

558
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,200
When you took the book
I handed to you,

559

we've been on the
same boat ever since.

560

At least, that's what I thought.

Will you take this?

The young lady from the Kim family
will become the queen anyway.

We'll have to see about that.

But first,

you'll have to share
information with me.

That woman who looks
like the queen.

What are you planning
to do with her?

571
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,820
The Queen Mother...

572
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,410
will take care of her.

[ Shimsang: State of the Heart ]

576
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,020
Let me ask a question.

577
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,080
Let's say there's
a precious treasure here.

578
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,210
Who would you give it to?

579
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,830
I will give it to His Majesty
as a Jinsang.

580
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,400
- To His Majesty?
- Yes.

581
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,490
"Jin" of Jinsang means
"forward" and "upward."

582
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,700
But it also means "energize."

583
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,380
I'd like to energize His Majesty since
he works hard for the people.

584
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,070
What a flawless response.

585
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,910
I would like to...

586
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,510
Relax and speak.

587
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,020
I think I'd give it to my parents.

588
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,150
If I see my parents happy,

589
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,540
I think I would be happy as well.

590
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,440
You're the young lady from
the Hong family, correct?

591
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,510
How about you?

592
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,360
- I would sell it.
- What did you say?

593
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,710
If I give the treasure to one person,

594
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,530
it would just remain a treasure
for just that person.

595
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,190
But if I get money for the treasure

596
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,370
and provide food and clothes
to a hundred people,

597
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,650
that would become a treasure
to a hundred people.

598
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,050
By "a hundred people," you mean...

599
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,860
I mean, the people who
are hungry and naked.

600
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,570
All right.

601
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,310
How about you, Lady Jo?

602
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,740
Since the owner might claim it later,

603
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,860
I would just leave it where it is.

604
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,450
What does that mean?

605
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,560
You did not say the treasure
belongs to me.

606
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,450
If the owner claims it later,

607
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,790
it might be a problem.

608
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,680
That's a good point.

609
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,160
Yes, I never said that I'm
giving you the treasure.

610
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,660
But giving it to His Majesty
means loyalty toward the king

611
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,340
and giving it to parents
means filial piety.

612
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:48,490
But...

613
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:52,290
deciding to sell it as
you said means

614
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,270
you're greedy since you're giving
yourself credit using the people.

615

I understand what your
heart stands for now.

Yes, Your Majesty.

Both Kim and Jo family

She said she would catch
the culprit herself.

628
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,710
But if she gives up over
something like this,

629
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,430
how could I be able to use her?

630
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,440

00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,540
and you might be put into danger.

638
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,280
So if you're Eun Ki...

639

00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,760
I'll protect you.

643
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,360
Why do you say you'll protect me?

644
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:56,150
I already told you that I couldn't
answer your question.

by continuing to do this.

650
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,290

Do you know how my day was?

652
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,980
I was happy thinking it's you, and
I felt devastated thinking it wasn't you.

653
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,620
I felt guilty thinking it's you

654
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,910
and felt miserable thinking
it's not you, but...

655
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,600
I was happy...

656
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,100
thinking it might be you.

657
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,010
But you're saying you're not her.

658
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:40,170
You can't possibly be her?

659
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:43,410
I'm not.

660
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:49,500
♫ I miss you every day ♫

661
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,600
♫ My deseprate... ♫

662
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,290
You can leave now.

663
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,250
Chief Eunuch Hwang.

664
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:02,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

665
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,110
Escort her.

666
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:12,050
♫ If only you and I could ♫

667
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:17,410
♫ get close to each other and stay ♫

668
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:22,370
♫ in that moment as one ♫

669
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:25,900
She keeps denying like that,
but why can't I believe her?

670
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,470
She looks too much like her.
She looks just like her.

671
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,440
Am I the only one who
thinks she's the queen?

672
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,880
Your Majesty.

673
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,640
Please calm down first.

674
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,310
Since she's so determined...

675
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:41,290
If she's really the queen,

676
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:44,040
she wouldn't behave that way.

677
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:50,520
♫ Please stop the time ♫

678
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,120
- Search!
- Yes, sir.

679
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,890
Open it.

680
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,850
You came, Officer Han.

681
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,660
We'll move him to a shelter.
Get ready to go.

682
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:03,940
His name was Young Koon.

683
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,380
We found this in his lodging.

684
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,140
That's the gun that was used
for the assassination.

685
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,570
Those coins were probably
a reward for it.

686
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,420
Was it just this one?

687
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,480
How about the rest?

688
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,710
We couldn't find any more there.

689
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,990
But we couldn't relocate
Young Koon, Your Majesty.

690
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:33,550
We saw a shadow in front
of the physician's quarter.

691
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:35,330
Are you sure?

692
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:36,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

693
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:42,550
Keep him at the physician's
quarter for now.

694
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,460
I was happy thinking it's you and felt
devastated thinking it isn't you.

695
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,220
I felt guilty thinking it's you and felt
miserable thinking it's not you.

696
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,530
But...

697
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,840
I was happy

698
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,960
thinking it might be you.

699
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,630
Was the King...

700
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,430
deeply in love with my sister?

701
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,300
Eun Ki.

702
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,540
No.

703
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,120
Eun Ki.

704
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,300
No!

705
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,470
This is the third test,
the Haengsang test.

706
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:50,540
Every pouch has pocket money
from the royal family.

707
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:54,220
The amount varies from
100 nyang to one nyang.

708
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,640
It all varies, but

709
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,770
all of it should be used for the people.

710
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,680
Two days later at noon,

711
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,800
we'll gather the people in
front of the guest house.

712
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,040
Please prove that

713
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,150
you have the generosity
and benevolence

714
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,040
as the candidate to
become the queen.

715
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,690
Whether you were truthful or not

716
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,810
will be determined
by the people's votes.

717
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,860
We'll start with the one who
has the highest score so far.

718
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:24,720
Lady Kim may choose
the pouch first.

719
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,800
[ 100 nyang ]

720
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:52,670
Next is Lady Jo.

721
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,320
[ 10 nyang ]

722
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,690
Next is Lady Park.

723
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,580
Next is Lady Lee.

724
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,000
Next is Lady Ha.

725
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,630
Next is Lady Bang.

726
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,650
Next is Lady Hong.

727
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:04,010
Your Majesty, you don't look so well.

728
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:07,000
Did you have trouble
sleeping last night?

729
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,360
I had a dream again.

730
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,100
A horrible dream.

731
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,970
Your Majesty, you know
I'm a eunuch, right?

732
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:20,190
But I dreamt that I had a child.

733
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,470
My belly started growing big

734
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,360
and when you saw me like that,

735
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,530
you praised me a lot unlike usual

736
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,990
and you even named my child.

737
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:33,510
That name was "Silly Dream."

738
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,900
So you mean...

739
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,570
my dream is a silly one?

740
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,360
You're mistaken.

741
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,360
Dreams usually are bizarre.
I was trying to tell you not to worry.

742
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,110
So I made a little joke.
Wasn't it funny...

743
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:58,780
I'll tell the royal physician to make
tonic that'd help you sleep.

744
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,360
Hurry up and leave.

745
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

746
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,770
My robe got caught.

747
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,750
[ One nyang ]

748
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,170
You have two days.

749
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:23,140
Prepare everything in two days.

750
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:32,630
You're free to leave the
house during the day.

751
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,200
Welcome, my lady.

752
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:08,900
I'll have this and this too.

753
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,290
My lady.

754
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:13,090
What will you do with
all this food?

755
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:15,050
I have a plan.

756
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:21,220
It seems like Lady Kim is
planning to have a party.

757
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,280
What would I do
with just 10 nyang?

758
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,450
Food isn't the only thing
that fulfills people.

759
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:30,110
What else then?

760
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:52,210
You only have one nyang left?

761
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,960
What did you buy?

762
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,830
All I got is one nyang.

763
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,940
I see...

764
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,550
How about you?
What did you prepare?

765
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,310
I...

766
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:10,110
I don't have much.

767
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,400
Aren't you tired?
I should get some sleep.

768
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,470
Your Majesty.

769
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:49,710
Officer Han checked several times.

770
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:52,010
Nothing happened to her.

771
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:53,920
Please stop worrying.

772
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,260
Yes.

773
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,460
It was just a dream.

774
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,120
It has to be.

775
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,120
My lady.

776
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,010
It's time now.

777
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:13,620
According to other servants,
other ladies already

778
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:17,880
prepared cotton clothes and
hired a prominent acupuncturist.

779
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,030
Welcome.

780
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:32,200
What's the cheapest
paper you have?

781
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,380
This is it. How much
would you like?

782
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,770
Give me one nyang worth.

783
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:36,980
One nyang.

784
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,350
When it's past noon,

785
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:51,620
there will be jars with numbers
on them in front of this door.

786
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,490
Today, you'll be

787
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:57,550
choosing a young lady who was
the most giving to the people

788
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:01,860
and put a card inside the jar
that has the same number

789
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,880
as the number that's
written on her clothes.

790
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,340
Do you understand?

791
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,560
Yes.

792
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,170
Go ahead then.

793
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,490
Come this way.

794
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,150
I have a lot of food.

795
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,460
I'm No. 6.

796
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,040
Keep yourself warm.

797
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:37,000
Seriously, come on!
Stop fighting!

798
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,920
All of you will be treated, okay?

799
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,240
Where are they?

800
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:51,630
My lady, here they come!

801
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,810
Let's go.

802
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,170
- Just a moment, my lady.
- Okay.

803
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,850
They're giving away food!
Let's go check it out!

804
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:48,790
- We need to hurry!
- That's right!

805
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,720
- Can we go too?
- It's a party!

806
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,190
I'm sure we'll get something.

807
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,100
What's going on?

808
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,670
The thing is...

809
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,810
The candidates for the selections

810
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,180
are having a party for the people.

811
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,130
- What are you doing? Let's go!
- Yes, let's.

812
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:06,960
A party?

813
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,620
What are you doing, my lady?

814
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,040
This is Shinmoongo.

815
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,500
Shinmoongo?

816
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,710
You mean the drum you hit
when you have a complaint?

817
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:29,490
Yes.

818
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,800
I'll write down what people always

819
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,930
wanted to say and send
it to the palace.

820
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,620
I see.

821
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,500
Instead of a complaint,

822
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,040
can I say that I want to eat
stuff like this every day?

823
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,060
Have a seat over there.

824
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,550
So you mean you were
framed as a thief

825
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:50,320
and got kicked out by your master?

826
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,610
Yes.

827
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:05,700
Let's go.

828
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:29,300
They're having the last mission of the
selection outside the palace right now.

829
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,320
Outside the palace?

830
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,820
How could the selection happen outside
the palace when it's against the law?

831
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:36,910
I don't know the details,

832
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:41,120
but the candidates are having a party
for the people in front of the guest house.

833
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,500
What?

834
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:47,530
- Find out more details.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

835
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:29,490
It really does speak badly
about my family.

836
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,380
How dare you?

837
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:39,470
But making a fuss about it now won't
be good for either of us.

838
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:41,540
Lead the way.

839
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:45,010
My lady.

840
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,970
Don't worry.

841
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:58,160
My lady?

842
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,290
As you can see, I have a hand too.

843
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:13,770
How dare you...

844
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:17,070
Do you want to see who's stronger?

845
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:20,720
You'll lose.

846
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:26,570
That's why you shouldn't
have gotten in my way.

847
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:28,140
I'm annoyed with that girl
from Jo family too,

848
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,330
but you're no competition for me.

849
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:33,340
Keep quiet and go back to the
countryside you come from.

850
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,940
Behave yourself.

851
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:40,990
Put her somewhere until
the selection ends.

852
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:43,560
Tie up her servant too.

853
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,270
Yes, my lady.

854
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:05,900
You can't come in here.

855
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,260
This is a part of the palace.
Please go back.

856
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,430
Well, didn't a young lady
come this way?

857
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:14,940
- I'm sure she went in there.
- I said, go back!

858
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,100
That's the end of the mission.

859
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,100
Please gather at the front
yard of the guest house, ladies.

860
01:06:57,170 --> 01:06:58,420
All right.

861
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:02,010
Please put the cards
in the jars now.

862
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,680
Why is my lady taking
so long anyway?

863
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:34,760
How come I don't see Lady Hong?

864
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:42,910
Look for her.

865
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:46,350
If I don't see her before the
announcement, Lady Hong will be...

866
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:48,020
eliminated.

867
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,100
Your Majesty, it's Chief Eunuch Hwang!

868
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:17,210
Your Majesty, Lady Hong
has disappeared!

869
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:19,100
What are you talking about?

870
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,300
She disappeared?

871
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:44,630
[ Queen: Love and War ]

872
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:47,310
Look everywhere around the
guest house! You must find her!

873
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,700
Did my dream turn out
to be true again?

874
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,970
Lady Hong will be eliminated
since she broke the rule...

875
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,640
Court Lady! Court Lady!

876
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,070
I think My Lady is in trouble.

877
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:00,700
You're a servant to
a candidate of the selection?

878
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,440
Why don't we strengthen power in the
court with you in the center?

879
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,320
We need to take the King's life.

880
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,770
That girl is tempting the King again!

881
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,030
If something scandalous
happens during the selection,

882
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:12,080
I will not select the queen.
