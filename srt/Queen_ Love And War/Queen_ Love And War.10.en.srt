1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,100
[ Queen: Love and War ]

2
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
[ Announcement: Governor Hong Ki Ho's
daughter has been selected as the queen ]

3
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,790
What are you doing right now?

4
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,900
Lady Hong cannot
become the queen.

5
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,290
She is already selected
as the queen.

6
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,200
- That cannot be.
- King!

7
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,640
Please ask everyone to
leave, Grandmother.

8
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,730
King.

9
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,300
Let's have the ladies leave
and talk among us...

10
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,000
Everyone, please leave the room.

11
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,470
- Court Lady Jung.
- Yes, Your Highness.

12
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,000
Please leave now, Queen Mother.

13
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,260
What?

14
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,050
His Majesty did?

15
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,130
Did something happen?

16
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,920
Why is it taking so long
to deliver the result?

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,980
Make Lady Jo the queen.

18
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,830
Why is it Lady Jo all of a sudden?

19
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,790
Did you not hear that we
already chose Lady Hong?

20
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,600
It cannot be Lady Hong.

21
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,670
How so?

22
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,580
She faked her identity.

23
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,560
What do you mean,
"faked her identity?"

24
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,200
You know better than
anyone, Grandmother.

25
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,060
You're the one who allowed the

26
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,200
resurrected queen to
participate in the selection.

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
What in the world are
you talking about?

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Should I summon the priestess?

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,160
Before the selection started,

30
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,270
I saw the queen entering the
palace with the priestess.

31
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,000
You deceived me from that
point on, Grandmother.

32
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,750
We need to reinstate
her as the queen

33
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,700
so the culprit of the assassination
shows his face again.

34
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,570
I am not suggesting her
to be our sacrifice.

35
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,970
If you and I catch the
culprit together,

36
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,830
we can protect the queen.

37
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,320
That is not protecting but using.

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,490
King.

39
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,360
You have no idea...

40
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,830
what it is that I truly want
to protect, Grandmother.

41
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,300
What is the reason
you are doing this?

42
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,560
By chance,

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,900
did that Jo Heung Gyeon
do something?

44
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,120
Please let us live.

45
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,210
Please send us back.

46
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,700
Please...

47
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,780
I'll bring another bowl.

48
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,180
We can never accept
Jo Heung Gyeon's daughter.

49
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,560
How did he threaten you exactly?

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,160
What did he say he would do if
we do not select his daughter?

51
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,360
If you will not change your mind,

52
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,600
I have no choice but to
reveal what you did.

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,750
What did you just say?

54
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,190
You are the eldest of the royals
who should set an example.

55
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,500
I'm sure you do not want to dishonor
yourself for switching the identity

56
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,360
of a candidate for a selection.

57
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,890
King!

58
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,380
The Queen Dowager is here.

59
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,460
I will announce the result
of the final round of selection.

60
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,110
The candidate who is
chosen to be the queen

61
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,200
is the daughter of Jo Heung Gyeon,
the left state minister.

62
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,110
It is Young Ji.

63
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,990
Lady Kim and Lady Hong,

64
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,610
please take a deep bow
to the new queen.

65
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,300
Your Highness, how did it go?

66
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,600
Jo Heung Gyeon's
daughter was selected.

67
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,290
Pardon?

68
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,230
Did you say
Jo Heung Gyeon's daughter?

69
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,600
If so...

70
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,320
- how about my Song Yi?
- Why bother asking?

71
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,480
She got disqualified.

72
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,440
Geez...

73
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,600
I knew this would happen.

74
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,570
You should've taken
extra care for her.

75
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,530
Are you blaming me for this?

76
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,170
Do you know what that cheeky
Song Yi said during the

77
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,130
evaluation of the final round?

78
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,410
She said she would
abandon her family.

79
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,370
How could I defend
a girl like that?

80
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,960
Song Yi said that?

81
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,050
That little...

82
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,860
The water has
already been spilled.

83
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,900
I do not want to see any of you.
Please get out of here!

84
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,040
Aigoo...

85
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,990
Your Majesty.

86
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,430
You have to leave now.

87
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,260
The Royal Secretariat has been waiting
to announce the result of the selection.

88
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,570
Han Mo.

89
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,530
You must bring back
Kang Yi Soo's wife safely.

90
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

91
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,720
You may leave the palace now.

92
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,530
My lady!

93
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,100
How dare you hold
your head up high

94
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,780
and walk by putting dirt
on an aristocrat's skirt?

95
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,450
Where's the dirt?

96
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,950
You servant b****...

97
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,300
What are you doing?

98
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,520
Don't take it out on
an innocent person.

99
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,500
Although no one is watching,
we are still in the palace.

100
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,600
You should know that much
if you are an aristocrat.

101
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,200
Don't act superior.

102
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,400
You have been rejected
just like me too.

103
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,040
Let's go!

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
Are you okay?

105
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,510
How about you? Are you okay?

106
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,510
My lady.

107
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,070
You were disqualified, right?

108
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,030
Say something to your
new daughter-in-law.

109
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,200
I have a mouth, but no words.

110
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,730
You should say something instead.

111
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,160
I have much room to grow.
Please teach me well.

112
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,960
I will do my best gladly.

113
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,240
Do not think of this lightly.

114
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,280
The women here spend every day

115
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,720
enduring shame and pain.

116
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,080
You are not in a position to be glad.

117
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,120
Please stay alert.

118
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,410
I will keep that in mind.

119
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,060
You will have to live
in a separate villa.

120
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,740
It would be better to keep it short.

121
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,890
By law, the villa has to
be outside the palace.

122
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,680
I am thinking of using Hwigyeongjae,

123
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,070
where the candidates used to stay in.

124
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,220
Yes, Your Highness.

125
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,870
Congratulations, Your Excellency!

126
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,420
You are the father-in-law to the king.

127
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,850
Congratulations!

128
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,470
I was worried because
you seemed so relaxed.

129
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,180
I guess it was just meant to be.

130
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,730
The left state minister is above
chief state minister now.

131
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,410
It won't be so far-fetching to
say the left state minister

132
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,860
is above the king anymore.

133
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,870
Please do not forget me
when that happens.

134
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,450
We are in the palace.

135
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,460
Please watch your words.

136
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,930
This is Officer Han.

137
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,360
What brings you here, Officer Han?

138
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,720
His Majesty must have
something to discuss with me.

139
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,820
I was expecting you.

140
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,300
Did the Queen Dowager betray us?

141
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,560
I heard the King changed the result.

142
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,910
The King did?

143
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,400
That makes no sense.

144
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,220
I've witnessed him defending
that woman in front of me.

145
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,440
How could he choose Jo Heung Gyeon's
daughter all of a sudden?

146
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,720
Anyway, our plan has been ruined.

147
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,500
Your Excellency.

148
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,260
We won't be able to carry out
our plan without military rights.

149
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,890
We need to find

150
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,450
a different plan somehow.

151
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,000
Your Excellency.

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,620
His Excellency Hong Ki Ho
sent a letter urgently.

153
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,500
- Hong Ki Ho did?
- Yes.

154
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,880
What is it?

155
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,800
Hong Yi Soo's wife and Hong Yeon
disappeared from the temple.

156
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,710
Here are the palace ladies
who will be assisting you.

157
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,170
You may keep your servant
as your palace lady.

158
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,070
Byeol!

159
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,020
Congratulations, my lady!

160
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,600
I mean, Your Highness!

161
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,660
They are probably alive.

162
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,730
If they meant to kill them, they
would've done so at the temple.

163
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,800
Who do you think took them?

164
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,040
Should we tell Eun Bo about this?

165
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,920
Don't tell her.

166
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,460
If you say her mother disappeared
while under our care,

167
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,350
she would no longer trust you.

168
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,100
Send someone out and
look for them thoroughly.

169
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,050
Your Excellency.

170
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,960
Are you considering accepting
Eun Bo as our member?

171
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,080
She's the daughter of Kang Yi Soo,
the author of the Theory of Enlightenment.

172
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,670
That is good enough of a reason.

173
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,950
That would be the perfect way
to cheer up the members

174
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,960
who are tired of waiting.

175
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,520
Is that really the only reason?

176
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,520
Don't worry.

177
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,630
I'm rescuing you
upholding the King's order.

178
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,730
The King's order?

179
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,600
- My lady!
- Are you okay?

180
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,790
Let's get out of here first.

181
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,250
Careful.

182
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,960
I took them to a safe place for now.

183
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,270
However, Your Majesty...

184
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,770
when I arrived at the warehouse,

185
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,240
the real Lady Hong
was held captive there.

186
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,060
You mean Hong Yeon?

187
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,160
We need to send her
back to her family.

188
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,500
Summon Hong Ki Ho,
the governor of Gyeonggi.

189
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

190
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,430
By the way,

191
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,600
did your dream not get
actualized this time?

192
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,190
I think I changed my dream.

193
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,040
I do not know how this would

194
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,420
change the future either.

195
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,150
Your Majesty...

196
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,610
What should I do with
Kang Yi Soo's wife?

197
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,990
She can't be with the Queen...

198
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,540
She can't be with Eun Ki.

199
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,760
They might be put
into danger again.

200
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,400
I think...

201
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,250
we should let Baek Ja Yong
take care of her.

202
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,470
He and Kang Yi Soo
used to be friends.

203
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,040
You mean Kang Yi Soo's wife
is in His Majesty's care?

204
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,510
Yes, it's due to a situation
that couldn't be avoided.

205
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,640
His Majesty wants to know if
you could take care of her.

206
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,660
Please tell him that I will.

207
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,890
I do not know how to thank you

208
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,750
for saving my daughter.

209
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,190
Have you been taking care of
Kang Yi Soo's wife as well?

210
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,460
Yes.

211
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,130
Although it is too late,

212
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,790
may I ask you why you helped her?

213
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,260
I did not really want to at first.

214
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,600
However...

215
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,400
I thought she was the
victim and the

216
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,720
witness of this chaotic situation...

217
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,310
Please forgive me.

218
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,050
I am aware that you have
people's trust within Gyeonggi

219
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,250
since I have heard a lot about it.

220
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,480
Although I have not known
you for a long time,

221
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,750
considering how you do not
hesitate to speak frankly,

222
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,170
I feel even more reassured.

223
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,270
Could you become the
new minister of justice?

224
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,620
I am asking you to
become one of my men.

225
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,170
Forgive me for saying this,

226
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,690
but could you give me
time to consider?

227
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,350
A man who is hesitant
to get promoted...

228
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,220
Please do not make
me wait too long.

229
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

230
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,420
Why does the house feel
so empty today?

231
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,340
You're home, Uncle.

232
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,500
Why bother coming
out to greet him?

233
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,850
You're upsetting him.

234
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,240
Go inside!

235
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,400
Geez...

236
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,960
Look at you now.

237
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,260
You acted all high and mighty.

238
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,730
What are you standing there for?

239
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,760
Wash your dear brother's feet.

240
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,290
Bring water to wash them.

241
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,330
What did you say?

242
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,510
What?

243
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,800
Are you upset?

244
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,120
What will you do then?

245
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
You weren't even selected.

246
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,300
Right.

247
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,590
Get nice and hot water,
not cold water.

248
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,700
Aigoo, look at you.

249
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,700
You look like you're about to die.

250
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,200
Hey.

251
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,790
Hey!

252
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,900
You think you'll die for not
becoming the queen?

253
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,580
Pull yourself together!

254
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,950
This doesn't suit you at all.
What's going on?

255
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,330
It all went to waste.

256
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,650
I can neither find the
culprit nor take revenge!

257
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,180
Why are you fussy with me?

258
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,820
Did I disqualify you?

259
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,690
Maybe I'm being punished.

260
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,150
I fooled so many people
for my revenge

261
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,550
and tempted to be in
such a high position.

262
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,750
Why are you suddenly...

263
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,150
being self-reflective?
It's not like you.

264
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,240
Hey.

265
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,190
What did the King say?

266
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,680
No word from him?

267
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,560
What would he say?

268
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,660
Well...

269
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,090
But still, how could
he remain silent?

270
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,960
Seriously...

271
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,850
Everything the Prince
said was correct.

272
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,710
What are you talking
about? The Prince?

273
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,140
So the Prince told me that...

274
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,460
the King ditches people when
he no longer needs them.

275
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,590
You've been ditched.

276
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,580
You've just been ditched!

277
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,460
It's not like that!

278
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,350
Who came? The Prince?

279
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,300
How did he know I was here?

280
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,270
I didn't tell him.

281
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,350
It wasn't me!

282
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,300
Geez...

283
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,100
Tell him just to leave.

284
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,740
Hey, but still...

285
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,520
You can't tell him to leave like that.

286
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,470
I was disqualified, but I still
made it to the final round.

287
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,940
Please explain that
I can't see him privately.

288
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,960
Yes.

289
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,900
If you get disqualified
during the final round,

290
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,720
must you live alone forever?
Until you wither and die?

291
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,940
Can't you see other men?

292
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,510
She told you not to visit her.

293
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,590
Tell her that I will be back.

294
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,030
Give her these.

295
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,900
Hey!

296
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,600
What are those fragile
things in your hands?

297
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,100
They're for my lady.

298
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,140
Hey.

299
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,700
I asked you what they are.
Not who they're for.

300
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,640
I should've hooked her up
with the Prince instead.

301
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,660
The Prince's wife.
How nice would that be?

302
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,740
It's way better than
being single forever.

303
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,430
Maybe she really did get ditched.

304
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,040
It better not be true.

305
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,240
I don't care if he's the
king or not. I'll just...

306
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,160
kick his butt...

307
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,580
I did not say anything.

308
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,300
You're told to expedite the investigation
process regarding the clue.

309
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,880
In this situation?

310
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,930
Well...

311
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,640
You know the situation.

312
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,550
Why would I be all
chipper and willing to

313
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,130
go after the clue?

314
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,000
What did you just say?

315
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,680
I said I will hurry up
and go after the clue.

316
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,360
Take care.

317
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,940
I should hurry up now...

318
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,200
Where should I go first?

319
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,070
How scary and petty.

320
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,470
Geez.

321
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,160
Aigoo, you were out here.

322
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,830
Where were you all this time?

323
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,790
Well, I was here and there...

324
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,010
Why?

325
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,370
Was Captain looking for me?

326
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,590
He had a fit earlier because
you played hooky again.

327
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,930
Geez, what a piece of work.

328
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,610
Let's go inside before
he has another fit.

329
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,880
It's not easy to learn the royal
etiquette, Your Highness.

330
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,290
Your Highness, it's Court Lady Lee.

331
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,830
Come in.

332
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,200
[ Sohak ]

333
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,880
This is the "Sohak" which you will
study with your father tomorrow.

334
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,290
You must be tired after
the etiquette practice,

335
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,220
but please read in advance.

336
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,110
All right. Will do.

337
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,740
Your Majesty.

338
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,030
I just received news
from the queen's villa.

339
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,140
The new queen is

340
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,720
absorbed into learning the

341
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,300
etiquette and Sohak every day.

342
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,590
Please award her hard work
with a special meal, at least.

343
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,660
Do what you think is best.

344
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,880
The Minister of Rites from the Royal
Wedding Bureau will see you tomorrow.

345
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,070
They will be sent to the
new queen's residence

346
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,130
and discuss the royal marriage
certificate and wedding gifts.

347
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,220
They do not have to
discuss it with me.

348
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,070
Just tell them to do
what is necessary.

349
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,450
Your Majesty.

350
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,790
How about you let her become
the royal noble consort?

351
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,880
Young ladies who were disqualified

352
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,890
during the final round
often live in the palace.

353
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,880
I heard that lady...

354
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,540
has not left the house lately.

355
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,030
My apologies, Your Majesty.

356
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,700
I found out about her
without your permission.

357
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,480
Although she may be pretending
as if she is okay, like you.

358
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,430
She was disqualified
without knowing why.

359
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,550
She must be devastated.

360
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,770
I am...

361
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,610
planning to keep my mouth
shut no matter where you go

362
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,020
at least for tonight.

363
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,390
My lady!

364
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,210
My lady, please come out.

365
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,380
You cannot come here.

366
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,470
You are about to be wedded.

367
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,850
I...

368
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,130
selected Lady Jo as the queen.

369
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,530
What did you just say?

370
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,180
I disqualified you...

371
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,680
and chose her instead.

372
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,320
That's all the more reason
you should not have come.

373
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,270
I could not help myself anymore!

374
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,730
Are you mocking me right now?

375
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,650
You are the one who
chose another woman.

376
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,140
You just told me so yourself.

377
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,050
I would like you to leave now.

378
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,520
It was to save you.

379
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,930
I do not mind if you blame me, but

380
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,990
please do not turn away
from me like this.

381
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,900
What do you mean by that?

382
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,800
I asked you what you meant.

383
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,520
Your mother was kidnapped.

384
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,030
Kidnapped? My mother?

385
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,060
By whom?

386
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,780
Per your last order,

387
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,300
I found out through the spy
at the Royal Investigation Bureau.

388
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,500
He said the owner of Buyong
Agency became an officer.

389
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,370
An officer?

390
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,590
That must have been
the King's order.

391
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,000
I have a bad feeling about it.

392
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,600
Could he still be
investigating that case?

393
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,740
If so, we should get rid of him...

394
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,970
Leave him be for now.

395
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,670
It might be a trap.

396
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,660
He might've placed him
at the Bureau

397
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,780
and is waiting for us to
come and kill him.

398
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,430
By the way,

399
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,280
the King said something strange.

400
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,100
Only you, Young Ji, and
I were aware of the plan

401
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,000
to reveal that Lady Hong
is an imposter.

402
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,970
But how could he have
known about that?

403
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,260
As soon as Young Ji bears an heir,

404
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,550
let us eliminate the King.

405
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,340
You'll soon be given a
huge responsibility as well.

406
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,610
So stop frequenting taverns.

407
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,740
Yes, sir.

408
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,090
Jo Heung Gyeon is...

409
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,860
He knew that you are Eun Ki.

410
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,280
He held the real Hong Yeon
captive as well.

411
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,860
How about my mother?

412
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,630
Is that young lady okay?

413
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,610
Both of them are safe.

414
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,330
Do not worry.

415
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,360
That is why...

416
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,040
you accepted Lady Jo
as the queen?

417
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,400
And someone evil like that
will be your father-in-law?

418
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,600
I had no other choice
but to save you.

419
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,040
But still...

420
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,080
how could you be so foolish?

421
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,230
You are the first person to

422
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,970
call me foolish in my entire life.

423
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,800
How could you laugh right now?

424
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,410
I know.

425
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,020
I did not know I could laugh.

426
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,700
It's getting late.

427
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,600
You should go back to the palace.

428
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,300
Please leave now.

429
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,980
You should not be here right now.

430
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,240
I cannot leave like this.

431
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,650
Your Majesty!

432
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,900
How is the lady doing?

433
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,520
Well...

434
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,690
She's in a sorry situation.

435
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
She must be devastated.

436
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,200
Furthermore, I heard that the
King is the one who selected

437
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,400
the left state minister's daughter.

438
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,340
Is that really true?

439
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,630
Why did he tell me to
find the culprit then?

440
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,300
The culprit?

441
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,070
Yes, the culprit...

442
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,390
I've been looking for the one
who was behind the assassination

443
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,180
during the procession recently.

444
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,420
Has His Majesty been
looking for that culprit?

445
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,800
Well, anyway...

446
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,780
What you said is true!

447
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,620
She definitely got ditched.

448
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,540
Seriously...

449
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,050
Is it okay for you to
be out for so long?

450
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,390
You should go back.

451
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,930
Would you like to borrow a fishing
boat and cross the river?

452
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,700
I'm scared of water.

453
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,640
I almost drowned once
when I was a child.

454
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,550
But you were on a boat
with me last time.

455
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,750
Will you ride the boat?

456
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,640
If not, why don't you get some
fresh fish I got this morning?

457
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,500
I can start a fire for you
to grill them too.

458
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,610
Are you not hungry?

459
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,640
You did not have dinner either.

460
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,790
We will take some.

461
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,660
Here.

462
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,070
Try some.

463
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,100
Have you eaten this way before?

464
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,250
My father liked fishing.

465
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,420
I used to tag along as a child.

466
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,520
It is tasty.

467
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,150
Please have some, Officer Han.

468
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,500
- No, thank you. I...
- Take it.

469
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,450
You have not eaten either.

470
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,600
His Excellency Kang Yi Soo
told me once.

471
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,330
Rather than reading
alone stuck in the room,

472
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,470
he prefers to chat with people

473
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,310
and fish with them a lot more.

474
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,840
He probably wrote the
Theory of Enlightenment

475
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,610
for those people as well.

476
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,940
Do you know about that book?

477
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,700
Yet you still tried to save my father?

478
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,500
I did not agree with
everything in the book,

479
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,460
but it was virtuous and sincere

480
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,520
just like his character.

481
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,300
It's okay. I'll do it.

482
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,310
You do not even know where it is.

483
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,510
It is done.

484
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,020
What is it?

485
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,390
You wiped it off, right?

486
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,800
Your Majesty!

487
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,340
You are pretty.

488
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,400
A blanket.

489
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,700
A blanket.

490
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,510
Yes, I will go get one.

491
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,410
Your Majesty.

492
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,490
By chance, do you think
I have changed from before?

493
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,650
What do you mean by that?

494
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,410
Answer me.

495
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,600
Don't you think I've changed?

496
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Come to think of it,

497
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,940
you did change.

498
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,400
I thought you just became womanly,

499
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,560
but lately, it feels like
you're your younger self too.

500
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,460
You got shot and went through
such a painful experience.

501
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,280
How could you still be the same?

502
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,670
If so, do you like me better now

503
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,350
better than when
I was more womanly?

504
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,490
What a silly thing to say.

505
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,050
You are the same person
you have always been.

506
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,120
Is something wrong?

507
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,050
Not at all.

508
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,870
You should go back now.

509
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:44,160
Ask the King to have a concubine?

510
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,880
Not only does he not visit me,
he does not even treat me as his mother.

511
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,160
At this rate,

512
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,280
I might end up falling
behind the Queen Dowager.

513
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,010
Whether we like her or not,

514
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,500
we should make Song Yi
his concubine for our future plans.

515
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,820
I understand what you mean.

516
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,970
Isn't this the Kim family's barracks?

517
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,600
I've been thinking about this.

518
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Even though she was ditched,

519
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,340
I should still do what
I'm supposed to do.

520
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,890
Who else would do this but me?

521
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,830
What are you talking about?

522
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,970
Let's just leave it at that.

523
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,440
I've been informed that

524
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,120
a hunter at this barracks hunted
a falcon which is banned by law.

525
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,850
Let's go inside.

526
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,800
Let's hurry up and go inside!

527
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,550
Lead the way.

528
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,940
Falcon hunting?

529
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,090
That never happened. Leave now.

530
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,900
Hey, hey, hey. Mister.

531
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,430
Huh? "Leave now?"

532
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,410
Did you say, "leave now?"

533
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,270
How dare you talk to us that way?

534
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,810
Don't you know where you are?

535
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,120
The Chief State Minister
Kim's family...

536
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,170
How about you?

537
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,200
Do you know who I am?

538
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,200
I'm not just an officer. I'm an
officer from the prestigious

539
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,910
Royal Investigation Bureau.

540
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,900
The hunters standing behind you.

541
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,770
I'll have to investigate all of them.

542
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,810
You'd better get ready.

543
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,510
- How dare you...
- What did you say?

544
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,900
- Investigate whom?
- What are you doing?

545
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
- Are you okay?
- This is like...

546
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,390
I should just...

547
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,950
- Aigoo...
- What is the fuss?

548
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,470
Young Master.

549
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,440
Sir.

550
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,680
I once got you the
latest lewd prints

551
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,180
through Cho Hyang, who
works at the watering hole.

552
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,940
- Lewd prints?
- Yes.

553
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,370
Right...

554
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,440
That fidgety fellow.

555
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,300
Yes, I'm that fidgety fellow.

556
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,100
Aigoo.

557
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:09,120
Things have been so dreary
around the house lately.

558
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,480
I can't even go near
the watering hole.

559
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,910
It's so nice to drink like this.

560
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,070
Sir,

561
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,330
please forgive me for the
mistake I made today.

562
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,860
I don't know who made
a false report.

563
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,590
But if I catch him, I'll...

564
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,030
I'll teach him a thing or two!

565
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,590
Seriously...

566
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,900
- Of course!
- Yes.

567
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,000
The Kim family is not dead yet.

568
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,360
Of course not!
Your eyes are wide open.

569
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,290
How could you be dead?

570
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,310
I took a glance earlier

571
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,640
and the hunters had tattoos
on the back of their necks.

572
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,180
What are they?

573
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,650
Right here?

574
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,500
That means that they're hunters
who work for the Kim family.

575
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,900
Wow, that's so cool.

576
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,980
But you can never get rid of it.

577
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,130
That's right.

578
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,000
- It will be there even after you retire.
- I see.

579
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,960
Has anyone removed it?

580
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,290
Yes, sir.

581
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,980
There have been two so far.

582
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,680
Two of them?

583
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,450
This is such a nice barracks.

584
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,480
They probably regret so much
that they left on their own.

585
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,280
It makes me wonder
all of a sudden.

586
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,850
How are those two
doing these days?

587
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,960
I'm suddenly curious about that.

588
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,460
I know.

589
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,950
What are they up to?

590
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,210
Well...

591
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,950
One of them moved to China

592
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,040
and the other one is...

593
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,860
I'm not sure.

594
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,250
I did hear that he frequents
the tavern around here.

595
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,600
Which one was that? The one
who was a good shooter?

596
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,610
His name was Gae...

597
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,810
Was it Gae Myung or Gae Chil?

598
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,570
Well, yes...

599
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:48,950
So... You said, "a tavern?"

600
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,390
You can drop me off here.

601
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,910
I can go on my own from here.

602
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,120
Eun Ki.

603
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

604
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,790
Could you stay with me
even as my concubine?

605
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,660
I do not want to leave you alone.

606
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:37,700
I have no choice but
to follow your order.

607
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,810
Where have you been
without your litter or servant?

608
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,880
I told you not to visit me.

609
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,730
I said I'd come back.

610
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,780
Did she not tell you?

611
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,490
Why do you keep doing this?

612
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,900
I'll tell you now since
I can no longer ignore it.

613
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,710
Please do not care for me.

614
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,510
Since I made it to the final round,

615
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,990
I'll either live alone or
become his concubine.

616
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,450
I'm the King's woman now.

617
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:16,590
Do you wish to become
his concubine?

618
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,420
I can help you.

619
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,390
I'll persuade Queen Mother

620
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,330
and His Majesty, so you don't have
to live as the King's woman.

621
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,200
Please don't.

622
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,500
What is it that you want then?

623
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,200
I'll do everything for you.

624
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,900
I'm still a prince, as you know.

625
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,960
Please don't ruin the situation

626
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,600
because of personal feelings.

627
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,320
Both of you and His Majesty will be

628
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,100
in a bind because of me.

629
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,550
Which one are you concerned about?

630
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,640
Is it me or His Majesty?

631
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,360
My lady!

632
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,570
My lady!

633
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,620
My lady, my lady!

634
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,690
Please help me.

635
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,980
Please help me.

636
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,400
My mother is sick.

637
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,540
You are...

638
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,950
This is Shinmoongo.

639
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,710
Instead of a complaint,

640
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,390
can I say that I want to eat
stuff like this every day?

641
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,580
I asked around to get here.

642
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,940
Please help us.

643
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,360
We have no money for a physician,
but my mother is sick.

644
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,940
She might end up dying.

645
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,450
Where is she?

646
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,430
Please leave.

647
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,600
I hope I won't be seeing you again.

648
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,420
Let's go.

649
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,490
Mother! Mother!

650
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,100
Mother!

651
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,970
Look, are you okay?

652
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,560
Where does it hurt?

653
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,780
Stomach...

654
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,290
Get a physician first.

655
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,490
Yes.

656
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,760
It'd be faster to take
her to the physician.

657
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,800
Thank you.

658
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,820
Don't worry. She's asleep.

659
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,440
It's okay now.

660
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,400
By the way, what did she eat?

661
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,560
An aristocrat family in the area

662
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,290
hands out stale food to
people sometimes.

663
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:33,400
People get stomach aches
eating that food.

664
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,600
That's why I told her
not to eat it, but...

665
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,320
I've eaten stale food
like that before.

666
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,440
Those high and mighty people
probably never even considered

667
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,300
that you can get sick
from eating that food.

668
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,290
All they can eat for a day
is a spoonful of rice

669
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,550
and they can die because
they can't afford a physician.

670
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:58,090
They probably never have
seen poor people

671
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,040
to know that they exist.

672
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,560
I should change her out
of her sweaty clothes.

673
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,620
Please go outside with
the child for a moment.

674
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,790
Let's go.

675
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,500
Do you know how to read?

676
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,140
Learn.

677
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,230
What would be the point?

678
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,500
I'm a low-class citizen.

679
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,800
I learned to read when
I was about your age.

680
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,400
The fact that you and your mother
eat stale food from hunger.

681
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,030
And the fact that you
can't afford a physician.

682
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,520
You'll learn that it's wrong.

683
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,730
You'll also learn that
you're the true owner

684
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,770
of this country as well.

685
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,910
Your mother woke up.

686
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:00,770
Go inside.

687
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,100
Really?

688
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,680
She needs to sleep here tonight.

689
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,320
Let's get going.

690
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,870
How do you know that sentence?

691
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,610
What do you mean?

692
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,510
"The people are the
owners of this country."

693
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,780
Didn't you read that from a book?

694
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,670
By chance,

695
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:26,240
do you know a book titled
"Theory of Enlightenment?"

696
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,000
Have you read it too?

697
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,700
It's a good book.

698
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,100
Do you really know the
Theory of Enlightenment?

699
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,470
Yes.

700
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,030
I know who wrote it.

701
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,110
He's your father.

702
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,750
He died after being
manipulated by the King.

703
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,710
Didn't you want to take revenge for
His Excellency Kang Yi Soo?

704
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,670
Isn't that your goal?

705
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,190
How...

706
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,850
How do you know that?

707
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,190
Who are you?

708
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,640
Kang Yi Soo, Baek Ja Yong,
Hong Ki Ho.

709
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,400
They all wish to change
the world alongside me.

710
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:07,200
We have a greater cause in mind.

711
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,150
The one your father...

712
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,060
wanted to put as the new king...

713
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,140
is me.

714
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,430
Do you remember
what I said earlier?

715
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,190
That I'll give you what you want?

716
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,330
If you want to take
revenge for your family,

717
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,860
I can...

718
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,930
find the culprit for you.

719
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,830
If so...

720
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:40,270
the reason why you placed
me in the selection

721
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:43,720
was for your own goal too?

722
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,270
It was for the greater cause.

723
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:50,530
The greater cause?

724
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,210
You were a scary person.

725
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:28,140
Sir, it's Eun Bo.

726
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,670
Come in.

727
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,060
Are you really planning to

728
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,700
steal the throne and
seat the Prince there?

729
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,020
How did you know?

730
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:00,020
Was that really what
my father wanted?

731
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,220
It's not true, is it?

732
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,950
My father wouldn't...

733
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,620
follow someone who uses people

734
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,840
for their own good.

735
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,510
He chose His Majesty.

736
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,100
Maybe he did in his last moment,

737
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,070
but your father definitely wrote
the Theory of Enlightenment.

738
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:22,020
A world where people
can change the king.

739
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,280
That was the future
we dreamed of together.

740
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,750
But he eventually changed.

741
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,270
And you hid that from
me intentionally.

742
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,650
He was enticed by the
King momentarily.

743
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:35,180
Don't jump to a conclusion like that.

744
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,820
Even if emotions swayed him,

745
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,100
he made that decision on his own.

746
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,930
What is the reason for your anger?

747
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,340
Is it for not telling you
about your father

748
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,370
or because of our plan
to take down the king?

749
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,960
From the beginning,

750
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:59,030
you weren't interested in catching
my sister's assassin at all.

751
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:05,700
I finally realized that
we have different goals.

752
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,520
Please do not control me any longer.

753
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,450
The two disqualified young
ladies from the selection

754
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,830
will enter the palace
as my concubines.

755
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,500
Please be sure to prepare for that.

756
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,430
You will induct the queen and
the concubines at the same time?

757
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:39,780
Your Majesty.

758
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,470
An induction ceremony is
a national event!

759
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

760
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:48,350
The new queen will be introduced
as the mother of the country.

761
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:52,400
How could you induct
concubines on the same day?

762
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,040
It's not like such precedence
did not take place.

763
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,990
Some of the previous kings

764
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,850
inducted the queen
and the concubines

765
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,440
on the same day as well.

766
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,780
Of course, you'll need concubines.

767
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,560
However...

768
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,910
perhaps you should give it
a little time, Your Majesty.

769
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,150
Do I need your approval

770
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:18,690
when inducting concubines too?

771
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,260
I already made up my mind.

772
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,000
Now I am telling you

773
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:27,460
to follow my order.

774
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:41,360
I can't take it anymore.

775
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,340
I should tell him that

776
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,870
I'm her twin before it's too late

777
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,360
and get punished for

778
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,880
deceiving His Majesty.

779
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,540
If you reveal yourself now,

780
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,130
not only your mother

781
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:03,310
but everyone tied to you
can be put in danger.

782
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,800
Would you be able to endure that?

783
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,660
Did you reveal your
identity to Eun Bo?

784
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,620
It just happened that way.

785
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,200
She started changing.

786
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,140
The royals will accept
the young ladies at the

787
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,290
final round as concubines.

788
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,200
Did you say "concubines?"

789
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,430
She's choosing the King after all.

790
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,280
He's inducting concubines today?

791
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,880
Why are you telling me this now?

792
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,940
Don't be agitated, Your Highness.

793
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:27,300
You are His Majesty's wife and
the mother of this nation.

794
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,940
That is being announced
to the world today.

795
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,100
There's no reason to
worry about concubines.

796
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,400
- But...
- Your Highness.

797
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,510
Do you know why I'm
still keeping a low profile?

798
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,740
Our day has not come yet.

799
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,800
Give birth to a prince.

800
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:55,500
That's the only way to
steal His Majesty's heart.

801
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,590
Do you understand?

802
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:03,230
I understand.

803
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,300
Song Yi.

804
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,720
What are you doing?

805
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,800
I think Uncle has something to say.

806
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,090
Yes, yes.

807
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:18,860
Yes.

808
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,900
Neither of us is satisfied
with you being a concubine.

809
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,810
But let bygones be bygones

810
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:29,360
and give birth to a boy
before the queen.

811
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:32,320
They say a royal woman

812
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,600
without a son is like
candlelight before the wind

813
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,120
even if she's the queen.

814
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,740
And even if she is a concubine,
if she has a son,

815
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,700
she has control over the palace.

816
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,920
This is why I'm letting
you in the palace.

817
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,580
Don't worry. I'll succeed.

818
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,560
She always boasts, but she fails.

819
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,750
Could you...

820
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,610
please succeed this time?

821
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,950
You have to address me
formally from now on, Brother.

822
00:53:58,950 --> 00:53:59,840
What?

823
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,900
Don't you think, Uncle?

824
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,230
She's right.

825
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,350
Let's get going now.

826
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:10,030
You should enter the
palace now, My Lady.

827
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,430
My Lady.

828
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,820
It's time for you to enter the palace.

829
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,680
The litter from the palace
has been waiting outside.

830
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,990
Song Yi from the Kim family and
Yeon from the Hong family.

831
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:26,930
You are being inducted as the
Royal Noble Consort Rank Two.

832
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,760
Ladies Consortship Sukeui,
please take a bow.

833
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:03,180
Congratulations, My Lady.

834
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,100
His Majesty the King is here.

835
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:44,590
Your Majesty.

836
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:48,110
Please share the nuptial
drinks with Her Highness.

837
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,750
You can leave now.

838
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,060
Your Majesty.

839
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,040
I do not need you. Please leave.

840
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,100
How does it feel to fulfill
your father's dream finally?

841
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,770
Your Majesty.

842
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:14,800
I did not fulfill my father's dream.

843
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,130
I fulfilled my own.

844
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:19,010
I will live as your woman

845
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,260
for the rest of my life.

846
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,850
I remember how you
looked as a child.

847
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,060
You used to fall and
cry all the time.

848
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,340
You were like my little sister.

849
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:35,020
You called me "kiddo" then.

850
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:38,810
That's when I first fell
for you, Your Majesty.

851
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,860
At the time,

852
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,910
I already held someone
else in my heart.

853
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,250
Do not try to live as my woman.

854
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,850
I never allowed you to do that.

855
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:53,580
We are just married
according to tradition.

856
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,100
There will never be love

857
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,560
between you and me.

858
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,890
This is my first night as the queen.

859
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:10,680
How could you make
such a cruel promise?

860
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,050
There was a woman

861
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,160
who got shot on the
first day as the queen.

862
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:20,770
How could this be
crueler than that?

863
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,010
Have a good night.

864
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:54,120
The night air is cold, My Lady.

865
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,520
His Majesty is probably at
the queen's chamber, right?

866
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,680
Your Majesty!

867
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,950
What brings you here...

868
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:17,970
You came all the way
here to greet me.

869
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:19,210
How could I not come?

870
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:20,230
Pardon?

871
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,040
When did I...

872
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,210
I was just here to get fresh air.

873
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,890
The breeze is nice.

874
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:31,270
How can you come here tonight?

875
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:33,580
I have been yelled at by
Chief Eunuch Hwang.

876
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,750
Please do not add to that.

877
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,300
You will feel trapped
in the palace often.

878
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,130
When the spring comes
around Buddha's birthday,

879
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:46,260
let's go on an outing like last time.

880
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,800
I still think about that
lantern to this day.

881
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,810
The lantern?

882
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:53,350
Do you not remember?

883
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:56,000
We floated lanterns
on the river together.

884
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,580
Right, yes!

885
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,930
Those lanterns were pretty.

886
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,380
Pretty?

887
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,400
What's wrong?

888
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,690
It is nothing.

889
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,080
I should get going now.

890
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,370
Rest now.

891
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:29,830
I will choose a day and return soon.

892
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,370
On that night,

893
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,850
wait inside your chamber.

894
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,770
Our plan is starting to fall apart.

895
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:54,690
Eun Bo won't act as
we expected, either.

896
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:56,800
She's only focused on taking
revenge for her sister,

897
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,200
she can't accept the greater cause.

898
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,850
Shouldn't we give her more time?

899
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:06,550
Will giving her more time

900
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:09,050
make her be on our side?

901
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,390
The situation will change quickly.

902
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:14,770
Jo Heung Gyeon will acquire
military rights as promised

903
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:18,530
and they will become stronger and
more aggressive every day.

904
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:22,890
It will become more and more
difficult for us to revolt.

905
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:26,680
And even if Eun Bo doesn't reveal
our identities to the King,

906
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,010
we will get revealed in no time.

907
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:31,300
What should we do,
Your Excellency?

908
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:35,250
What if I met with Eun Bo first?

909
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,910
No matter what we might do,

910
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:40,200
we should figure out
what she thinks first.

911
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,970
Did you have a comfortable
night, Your Highness?

912
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,330
How about you two?

913
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:56,290
I had a peaceful night alone,

914
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:58,740
but I'm not sure
about Consort Hong.

915
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,840
What do you mean?

916
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,190
According to the servants,

917
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:04,910
His Majesty enjoyed
a walk with Consort Hong.

918
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:11,100
He stopped by for a moment,
but he went back to his bedchamber.

919
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,240
Consort Kim.

920
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,600
Be careful what you choose to say.

921
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,730
Although we participated
in the selection together,

922
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:22,130
the situation has changed,
as you can see.

923
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:24,800
You will have to behave properly.

924
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,240
I will keep that in mind.

925
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:31,860
Try to be more mindful
from now on.

926
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,280
His Majesty might have stopped by,

927
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:38,980
your duty is to help me as the
queen to assist His Majesty.

928
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:41,080
Yes, Your Highness.

929
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:48,730
Excuse me.

930
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,500
Have you seen a man with a burnt mark
on the back of his neck?

931
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,500
- No, I haven't.
- Think about it carefully.

932
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,900
Aigoo, why won't you believe me?

933
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,200
What do you mean, I won't?

934
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:58,140
Ma'am, ma'am.

935
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,700
Have you seen a man with a burnt
mark on the back of his neck...

936
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,800
- No, I haven't!
- Ma'am!

937
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,470
The man who wore
the bamboo hat?

938
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,700
- Yes.
- He left a few days ago.

939
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,900
He left? Have you seen his face?

940
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:17,360
Are you really planning
to go separate ways?

941
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,740
I am sorry to tell you since I entered
the palace as Hong Yeon,

942
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,250
but I cannot agree with that plan.

943
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,440
It was not my father's will, either.

944
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,090
Have you made up your mind then?

945
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,200
Yes.

946
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,490
His Majesty told me...

947
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:36,450
that he asked His Excellency Baek
to take care of Mother.

948
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:40,130
Where is she right now?

949
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,110
I will take care of her now.

950
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,550
She wants her mother back?

951
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:48,030
Then we'll lose our last option.

952
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,790
Our last option?

953
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:52,110
Once you told me that...

954
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:54,930
you'll use her hand to
stab the King's heart.

955
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:56,970
I think it's time to
carry out our plan

956
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:59,210
by holding Kang Yi Soo's
wife hostage.

957
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,830
You mean you'll make
Eun Bo assassinate him?

958
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:05,850
We cannot ignore our morals.

959
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:08,210
You and Kang Yi Soo were friends.

960
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:10,470
How could you ask your
friend's daughter to do...

961
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:12,200
I cannot accept it.

962
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,150
Do you have another solution then?

963
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,390
You don't, do you?

964
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:17,070
Will you give up on the
plan like this?

965
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,590
It's necessary for us to
take the proper steps.

966
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:22,760
If we only focus on
our goal and nothing else,

967
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:26,760
what would be the point
of having a new world?

968
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,630
We need to wait for
the right moment.

969
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,300
We can't just keep waiting.
We have no energy.

970
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,600
Can't you see it yourself?
Everyone is getting tired.

971
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,900
That's not all. How about
the enlisted troops?

972
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,910
How about the sorry state of their
training due to a lack of guns?

973
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:43,590
We can't wait any longer.

974
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,300
- It's time to take drastic measures.
- Your Excellency.

975
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,960
We shall then.

976
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,870
I heard the King is still
looking for the assassin.

977
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:54,200
When he does, that woman

978
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,840
will live for the King from now on.

979
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,730
If we don't act now, we'll
lose our chance forever.

980
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:08,550
If so...

981
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,160
I'll step down at this point.

982
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,360
Look!

983
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,810
This is not the greater
cause I dreamed of.

984
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:41,920
You're in a fit condition
for the consummation.

985
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:43,250
I will let the chief eunuch know.

986
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,120
My Lady, it's Yeo Wool.

987
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,300
I will get going then.

988
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,700
My Lady.

989
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,580
His Excellency Baek asked
me to give this to you.

990
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,640
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong?

991
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:21,550
I will let you see your mother.

992
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:26,300
Come to the temple in
Naksan at 1 o'clock alone.

993
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,580
You are asking for
permission to step outside?

994
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,390
Where are you planning to go?

995
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:36,490
The thing is...

996
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,850
I would like to see my mother.

997
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:40,230
I understand.

998
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,700
- I will get you a guard...
- No.

999
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:45,600
That would draw too much attention.
I will step out quietly.

1000
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:47,970
Be back safely then.

1001
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,300
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- By the way,

1002
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:54,150
it looks like the chief royal physician sent
a word to Chief Eunuch Hwang.

1003
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,330
Pardon?

1004
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,030
That was just for the pulse...

1005
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:02,660
She said everyone entering the
palace needs to get checked.

1006
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,640
You are teasing me, aren't you?

1007
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:18,020
It's poison from pufferfish.

1008
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:22,910
He will slowly run out of breath

1009
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:25,160
and die with paralysis.

1010
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:52,850
Yeo Wool, you should wait here.

1011
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:16,760
You look better now.

1012
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,330
Are there any difficulties
living as a concubine?

1013
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:20,540
No.

1014
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:22,360
It's not too bad.

1015
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:25,630
Sir.

1016
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:29,860
I'd still like to thank you
for taking care of

1017
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:31,950
my mother and me.

1018
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:35,190
You're acting as if we'll
never see each other again.

1019
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:36,530
There's no need to thank me.

1020
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:39,120
As you know, I was
your father's friend.

1021
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,550
Well...

1022
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:45,960
where is my mother?

1023
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,260
She's in good health right now.

1024
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:51,170
You'll be able to see her
soon. Don't worry.

1025
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,630
But...

1026
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,400
there's something you must do first.

1027
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,980
Something I must do?

1028
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,600
Feed this to the King.

1029
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:08,280
What's this?

1030
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,680
It's poison.

1031
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,600
Kill the King with your own hands.

1032
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,600
[ Queen: Love and War ]

1033
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,900
The King is only seeing Consort Hong
neglecting the queen?

1034
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:43,020
What would be the problem?

1035
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,340
We just need to prevent her
from getting pregnant.

1036
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:46,900
No, I will never do that!

1037
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,900
You will have to.

1038
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,470
Your mother's life depends on it.

1039
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:51,130
Must you be this way?

1040
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,800
You won't have time to hesitate.

1041
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,600
Sometimes when I see you,
you feel like a different person.

1042
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:57,860
You're not Eun Ki.

1043
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,660
Who are you?
Tell me who you are!

1044
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,800
Tell me!

1045
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,300
I loved you. I still love you.

1046
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:06,450
I will only love you for
the rest of my life.
