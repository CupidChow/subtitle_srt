1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,200
[ Queen: Love and War ]

2
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,130
You said...

3
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,460
I look just like the dead queen, right?

4
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,240
[ Episode 4 ]
But how could I become
the queen with this face?

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,510
Of course, it won't be easy.

6
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,430
But there are consequences
for risking your life.

7
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,460
That means you might
have to die for it.

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,600
I want to destroy the
person who did that to

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,970
my sister, father, and mother.

10
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,650
Would I really be able to do that?

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,920
What if I said you could?
Will you do it?

12
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,450
Yes. I'll do it.

13
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,510
I'll become the queen.

14
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,710
There's someone you need
to meet with first.

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,110
This is His Excellency, Hong Ki Ho,
who will lend you his family name.

16
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,090
He knew your father
when he was alive too.

17
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,320
Although I'm about his age,
I learned a lot from him.

18
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,550
Are you ready for this?

19
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,370
Yes.

20
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,440
From now on, your name is Yeon.

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,050
Hong Yeon.

22
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,480
This is the daughter of Hong Ki Ho,
the governor of Gyeonggi.

23
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,200
Eun Ki!

24
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,550
Your Majesty.

25
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,900
Are you okay?

26
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,880
I'll call the doctor.

27
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,520
It's okay.

28
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
I just had a dream, that's all.

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,310
When was the day I was supposed to
meet with the owner of Buyong Agency?

30
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,160
It's tomorrow at 9 p.m.

31
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,950
I'll become the queen.

32
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,800
Eun Bo, are you there?

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,040
Huh? Hey!

34
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,530
Hey, Eun Bo!

35
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,430
Hey, are you there?

36
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,780
Eun Bo!

37
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,850
Are you there? Huh? Hey!

38
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,240
Is this Wal?

39
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,020
What are you doing?

40
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,760
Get your butt over here right now!

41
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,360
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

42
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,310
Today is the day you're
supposed to meet with the king.

43
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,890
Did you forget?

44
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,600
Well, I was aware.

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,850
If you know, come here now.

46
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,970
Come here and catch me.

47
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,290
- Okay...
- Hurry!

48
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,830
What will you do? You can't
ask for another chance.

49
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,690
I'm thinking of telling
him the truth.

50
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,980
About who the gunman is.

51
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,290
What?

52
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,770
I want to see how he'd react.

53
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,230
You were right.

54
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,010
I should get help from
God if I have no power.

55
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,710
Hey, hey. I just said
whatever I thought of then.

56
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,380
You shouldn't have taken
that so seriously.

57
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,880
If the king isn't the culprit,
he might be helpful to us.

58
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,660
But what if he is?

59
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,500
We'll find out that he's
the actual culprit then.

60
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,360
Here comes the king.

61
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,820
So how did it go?

62
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,490
The gunman is a hunter.

63
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,780
A hunter?

64
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,880
You mean just a regular hunter?

65
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,990
Yes.

66
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,210
If so...

67
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,500
He technically belongs
to the Kim family.

68
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,270
Kim Man Chan...

69
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,200
Is that information correct?

70
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,110
Yes.

71
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,380
How about his
personal information?

72
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,640
I regret to inform you, but
I couldn't find out any further.

73
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,040
You already know that

74
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,690
the Kim family security is as
tight as the palace.

75
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,670
What will you do now?

76
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,230
What I meant is that you can
order me to do more things.

77
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,150
You tend to jump the gun.

78
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,370
My apologies.

79
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,530
Let me ask you one thing.

80
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,200
Why don't you show your face?

81
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,060
Why do you ask me that?

82
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,900
People say that the owner of
the Buyong Agency is a man.

83
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,560
A man or a woman,
an informant's duty

84
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,900
is to sell information to clients.

85
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
And will you be hiding
the whole time?

86
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,260
I thought you knew

87
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,090
that it's a rule not to
ask about one another.

88
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,570
I don't know what
you're curious about,

89
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,060
but the only thing I can tell you is
that the gunman is a hunter.

90
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,950
That's the only fact.

91
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,500
Do you really think the
Chief State Minister is the culprit?

92
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,210
So, the next step is...

93
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,380
Hey.

94
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,620
Yes.

95
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,840
Yes...

96
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,640
We should watch what he does.

97
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,090
Are you crazy?

98
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,640
Are you suggesting
spying on the king?

99
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,010
No, I meant the leader
of the hunters. You fool.

100
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,230
The leader...

101
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,190
I'm sure he'd do something.

102
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,190
It seemed like it wasn't
about the gunman,

103
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,430
but more about who's behind him.

104
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,040
What is she saying?

105
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,970
Hey.

106
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,350
We have a bigger
problem than that.

107
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
It's about my dwelling.

108
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,670
Geez...

109
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,110
Did you sigh?

110
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,210
So you found a
permanent home, huh?

111
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,210
Hey, because of you,

112
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,670
I lost everything including money, home,
my reputation as the owner

113
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,450
of Buyong Agency and all
of my regulars. But...

114
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,810
you're sighing?

115
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,500
You're sighing? I...

116
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,700
I've been generous since you've
been going through a lot.

117
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,170
But in return, you...

118
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,930
Go to a bar or something.

119
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,640
Thank you, my lady.

120
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,310
Could you give me a little more...

121
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,080
No.

122
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,130
Yes.

123
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,230
I feel bad that you're in
this mess because of me.

124
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,590
If you want to leave...

125
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,560
Watch your hand.

126
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,590
Seriously...

127
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,600
It's just a pretty penny.

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,440
Anyway, what will you do...

129
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,340
while I'm at the hunters' quarters?

130
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,580
I have something else to do.

131
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,470
You know...

132
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,470
what do you think it'd be like
if I became the queen?

133
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,650
You're becoming the queen?

134
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,730
Aigoo, the queen?

135
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,000
What kind of lunatic would
make you the queen...

136
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,330
How about if I became the king?

137
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,020
Seriously...

138
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,150
Let's go inside.
I'll cook you some fish.

139
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,440
Queen, my foot...

140
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,270
Did you want to see me because
you made up your mind?

141
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,250
Show me your cards first.

142
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,760
I'm thinking of presenting
a young woman for the selection.

143
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,780
I'd like you to take care of her.

144
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,030
It'd be advantageous for you too.

145
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,000
If you want to maintain the
Queen Dowager's trust,

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,320
tell her that young woman will

147
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,670
find the culprit of that tragic event.

148
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,730
I'm not following you.

149
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,490
How could some young woman

150
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,800
be useful in finding the culprit?

151
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,500
The assistant shaman who
disappeared from the

152
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,050
Royal Shaman Temple is
currently under my care.

153
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,970
What if I told you that

154
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,210
she's the twin sister
of the dead queen?

155
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,090
I'll make her the stand-in
for the queen.

156
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,620
If you made up your mind,

157
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,100
tell the Queen Dowager
that the queen is alive.

158
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,500
Your Majesty.

159
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,210
Is Kim Man Chan really
capable of such a thing?

160
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,850
The moment I heard the
gunman is a hunter,

161
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,650
can you guess what
I thought of immediately?

162
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,300
"Why Kim Man Chan?

163
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,590
There's no way.

164
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,070
Have I been misunderstanding him?"

165
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,310
Your Majesty.

166
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,070
I heard you were out in training.

167
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,230
Did you find it?

168
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,670
It's not the same gun, but

169
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,970
considering the bullet
found in your body,

170
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,870
it's as close as it gets.

171
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,110
How does this work?

172
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,620
Push the part called, "gunlock"

173
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,760
and fire by pulling the trigger.

174
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,730
Since you're right-handed,

175
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,690
step your left foot
forward to balance

176
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,290
and then fire.

177
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,280
[ Queen Dowager Min ]

178
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,280
What are you talking
about right now?

179
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,180
It was just like how
His Majesty resurrected.

180
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,610
Something miraculous

181
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,980
also happened to the queen.

182
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,150
The queen is alive?

183
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,570
Is that really for a fact?

184
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,560
Yes.

185
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,440
I'm certain.

186
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,520
How could it be...

187
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,540
How did you learn about that?

188
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,320
I followed the spirit's lead.

189
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,120
But Your Highness...

190
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,340
meeting with the queen

191
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,990
made me think of a solution
for finding the culprit.

192
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,700
A solution for finding the culprit?

193
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,510
Tell me right now.

194
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,760
That incident was

195
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,150
probably caused by someone
who was resentful of the selection.

196
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,550
But...

197
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,460
what would happen if the queen

198
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,820
came back to life in
front of their eyes?

199
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,750
We could provoke the culprit

200
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,390
and make them reveal themselves.

201
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,400
I need to see her myself.

202
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,720
Did you want to see me?

203
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,690
The Queen Dowager
wants to see you.

204
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,220
She wants to see me?

205
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,550
Yes, it'd be tonight.

206
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,990
Remember.

207
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,490
You're your sister
Eun Ki in front of her.

208
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,980
Hello.

209
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,160
I didn't think we'd meet
again like this.

210
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,340
It'd be better not to stand out.

211
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,370
Let's have you change first.

212
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,630
Your Majesty!

213
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,290
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

214
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,940
Your Majesty!

215
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,230
Your Majesty!

216
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,670
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

217
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,320
It was the queen.

218
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,810
Didn't you see her?

219
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,090
The one behind the shaman
was definitely the queen!

220
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,520
Your Majesty.

221
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,810
Your Majesty.

222
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,890
It's windy tonight.

223
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,030
Please go into your bedchamber.

224
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,600
I'll go get the shaman
and bring her to you.

225
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,660
No.

226
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,600
Let's go back inside.

227
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,670
Your Highness,
I brought her with me.

228
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,200
Let her in.

229
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,300
Shaman told me briefly
about the plan.

230
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,300
I'm still confused even
after seeing you like this.

231
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,950
You said you wanted to
participate in the selection?

232
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,930
Yes.

233
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,560
What's your motive?

234
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,490
You could've lived a quiet
and ordinary life.

235
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,220
You must've had a reason
for deciding to participate.

236
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,740
I couldn't just live quietly.

237
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,270
If I don't participate
in the selection...

238
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,400
Forgive me for saying this,
Your Highness, but...

239
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,110
could you...

240
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,330
reinstate me as the queen?

241
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,960
Don't you know that your
family was destroyed?

242
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,430
The king's order cannot change.

243
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,440
I'm sorry to tell you,

244
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,440
but the king can't take back
his word, and that is the law.

245
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,920
That's why I'm trying to
find my own way.

246
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,360
I want to find the man
who pointed a gun at me

247
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,750
and destroyed everything.

248
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,600
Please help me, Your Highness.

249
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,900
By the way...

250
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:38,010
I didn't know you had the guts to
look me in the eye like this.

251
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,940
After coming back from death...

252
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,630
I'm not afraid of anything.

253
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,280
Your Majesty.

254
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,310
Your Majesty!

255
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,600
Your Majesty!

256
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,660
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

257
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,620
There's no need to
look so horrified.

258
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,490
I'm fine.

259
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,770
I was possessed by
something briefly.

260
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,960
- Your Majesty.
- I know.

261
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,600
It was just a foolish delusion.

262
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,890
Your Majesty.

263
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,930
It's time for you to...

264
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,400
let her go now.

265
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,920
Chief Eunuch Hwang.

266
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

267
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,530
She keeps lingering around me.

268
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,530
In my dreams,

269
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,870
in front of my eyes,

270
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,190
and in my memories.

271
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,700
She keeps showing up
and stays with me.

272
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,490
Get home safe then.

273
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,200
If I have to pretend to be my sister,

274
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,460
does it mean that the culprit who
killed my sister is in the palace?

275
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,460
I'm not suspicious of
the Queen Dowager.

276
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,820
How about the king?

277
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,840
I've been thinking about it,
but I don't think he killed her.

278
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,780
It seemed like he was
looking for the culprit.

279
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,200
But...

280
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,150
he indeed killed your father.

281
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,120
What was the reason anyway?

282
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,560
Theory of Enlightenment.

283
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,980
It's because of the book
your father wrote.

284
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,760
Theory of Enlightenment?

285
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,110
It's a book that talks about the
world being ruled by the citizens.

286
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,570
The king considered
that as rebellious

287
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,150
and gave him the capital sentence.

288
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,820
Was it just because of a book?

289
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,320
That's what happens when
people have different ideals.

290
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,310
The king never approved
ideals like that.

291
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,660
And your father risked
his life for it.

292
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,630
A lot of people still share his idea.

293
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,440
You'd also have things
to do in the future.

294
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,620
What would I have to do?

295
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,570
You'll find out eventually.

296
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,170
A lot of things will happen
when the selection starts.

297
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,400
We'll accept the bridal
applications starting now!

298
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Excuse me.

299
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,380
Excuse me...

300
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,080
Geez!

301
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,600
I'm sorry.

302
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,230
I'm not ready for it yet.

303
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,230
Okay, I'll then...

304
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,390
Please...

305
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,020
make sure she gets disqualified.

306
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,520
Disqualified!

307
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,700
Fourteen of them were
selected so far.

308
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,300
Seven of them are from Hanyang,

309
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,810
and seven of them from
outside of Hanyang.

310
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,590
[ Hong Yeon, Father: Ki Ho,
Governor of Gyeonggi ]

311
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,550
Include her.

312
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,230
You mean the daughter of Hong Ki Ho,
the governor of Gyeonggi?

313
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,590
I was told to have you in the
palace for the first phase.

314
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,880
There's a lodging
called "Hwigyeongjae"

315
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,640
which is provided for the
candidates by the royal family.

316
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,310
You'll move there in a few days.

317
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,850
How is my mother doing?

318
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,660
She's at a safe place.
Don't worry.

319
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,020
There's a long way to go.

320
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,920
You'd better prepare yourself.

321
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,670
Your Excellency,
I brought them with me.

322
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,520
Here's the teacher who will
help you with the selection

323
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,120
and the servant who will
assist you from now on.

324
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,280
My name is Yeo Wool, my lady.

325
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,800
Aigoo, you're unbelievable.

326
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,270
How do you practice etiquette
that your legs are so swollen?

327
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,040
Why do you keep
looking at that anyway?

328
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,240
People might think
it's a love letter.

329
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,080
It's just a letter telling you
to come to the palace

330
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,470
for the selection.

331
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,920
It's the same thing as
a love letter to me.

332
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,870
Do you know how long
it has been since I saw him?

333
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,760
It says I just need to
wait five more days.

334
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,010
You still need to
become the queen.

335
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,020
If you fail like you did last time...

336
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,480
I was too foolish last time.

337
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,390
But this time,

338
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:34,040
Father definitely promised me
that I'd become the queen.

339
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,220
I'll only count on Father
from now on.

340
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,430
If he tells me to die,
I'll even play dead.

341
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,680
Whoa!

342
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,800
Oh, His Excellency.

343
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,100
Welcome, His Excellency.

344
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,890
[ Chief State Minister Kim Man Chan ]
How could you...

345
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,610
all visit me so shamelessly?

346
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,570
A lot of people could see you.

347
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,100
Song Myeol, set their
appointments then.

348
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,220
Yes, sir.

349
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,520
Have a safe trip, Uncle.

350
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,650
Yes.

351
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,420
Get out of the way, everyone!

352
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,570
Step aside!

353
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,660
We'll be awaiting.

354
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,790
His Excellency...

355
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,500
Thank you, His Excellency!

356
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,800
Aigoo, my lady. You were out here.

357
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,580
I brought the fabrics you
requested before.

358
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,060
Aigoo, it feels so festive
in this house.

359
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,390
It's obvious who'd become
the queen in this selection.

360
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,190
That's why they're already
making a fuss like that.

361
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,180
Aigoo, he's supposed to be a prince,

362
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,320
but all he does is
napping in broad daylight.

363
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,700
Aigoo, seriously...

364
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,660
I'm very envious, sir.

365
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,260
You must be very hungry
after a long nap.

366
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,230
Should I bring you
lunch right now, sir?

367
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,710
But why...

368
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,580
why are you here?

369
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,100
Why are you so surprised?

370
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,820
You told me to visit you anytime.

371
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,790
Should I butcher a chicken?

372
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,420
Pardon?

373
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,350
You want me to leave?

374
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,800
I didn't know you were so miserly.

375
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,550
You said you work for the lady.

376
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,620
So why would you be
staying at my house?

377
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,430
Well...

378
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,540
I...

379
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,500
To be honest...

380
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,970
I actually have a reason that
you can't hear without crying.

381
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,000
Aigoo.

382
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,720
Let's hear it and see if I cry.

383
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,440
I might not look like it,
but I used to be a merchant.

384
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,600
- Pardon?
- Merchants never work

385
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,200
without getting paid.

386
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,000
But you live in a mansion
as big as a whale.

387
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,100
Are you telling me to
give you money?

388
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,360
I'm telling you not to
pay me, but leave.

389
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,430
Well, how about a...

390
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,240
lady instead of money?

391
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,170
- What did you say?
- Well...

392
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:20,990
I know there's a lady
you're keen on.

393
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,820
Could I be of help with that?

394
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,400
What did you want to see me for?

395
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,670
By the way, why are
you dressed like that...

396
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,490
Well...

397
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,810
What are you doing here, sir?

398
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,240
Where's Wal...

399
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,120
That man practically
barged into my house.

400
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,340
Pardon?

401
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,930
You've got to be kidding...

402
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,420
I'll take care of it.

403
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,340
But first...

404
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,450
come with me for a second.

405
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,700
Since it's so scenic over here,

406
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,230
apparently only important
people can be here.

407
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,770
This is my first time here.

408
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,330
It's as nice as I heard.

409
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,460
How come they don't allow
everyone in such a nice place?

410
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,560
Well...

411
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,540
I thought you were angry.

412
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,220
I pretended to be.

413
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,240
I knew you wouldn't have
come if I just invited you.

414
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,610
But it's such a nice place.

415
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,260
I see...

416
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,240
Hello!

417
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,120
Aren't you a prince?

418
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,110
Who are you?

419
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,900
Don't you know who I am?

420
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,010
Geez.

421
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,720
I'm Kim Hong Sik.

422
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,740
I'm the Chief State Minister's only son.

423
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,530
But I just became...

424
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,970
The head of the Inspection Bureau.

425
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:22,940
That's right.

426
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,770
The head of the Inspection Bureau.

427
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,410
I see.

428
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,020
Is that so?

429
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,140
Huh?

430
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,040
Are you on a date with a woman?

431
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,620
Congratulations!

432
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,140
You're living the good life now.

433
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,970
Because of your grandfather
who was a traitor,

434
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,860
I heard you always had to

435
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,630
go on outings discreetly.

436
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,620
Well...

437
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,030
enjoy yourself!

438
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,260
Since it's been open to
people like me exclusively,

439
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,410
you probably never had
a chance to come here.

440
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,040
Well then...

441
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,490
Let's go.

442
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,370
Be quiet!

443
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,270
Geez!

444
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,780
This stupid cobblestone bridge!

445
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,960
What are you doing? Help me up!

446
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,600
You tripped him, didn't you?

447
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,290
How could you stand there
and just listen to that?

448
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,380
You have to silence people like
that even by tripping them.

449
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,300
My grandfather was
apparently the king's brother.

450
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,760
And he was accused
as a traitor and died.

451
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,090
Because of that, my father
ran away with my mother

452
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:06,110
and I was born in the
countryside somewhere.

453
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,060
He was right about everything.

454
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,100
I've been hiding the
entire time growing up.

455
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,170
Sometimes the royal forces
were looking for me

456
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,470
and sometimes it was my father.

457
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,710
Get out of the way!

458
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,660
What are you hiding for?

459
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,500
Come out! Come out!

460
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,600
Useless bastard. D*** it!

461
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,120
I have such bad luck
because my family is like this!

462
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,990
Geez!

463
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,830
Stop it!

464
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,310
I thought I finally escaped
that wooden bin,

465
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,750
but all I did was escaping that bin.

466
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,490
Until this day,

467
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,870
I'm still hiding.

468
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,420
Is that so bad?

469
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,430
Everyone hides.

470
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:12,120
Behind their name, family,
and tall fences.

471
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,320
They hide themselves.

472
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,430
Because everyone is too weak

473
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:22,200
and pathetic to fight as themselves.

474
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:27,190
But I try to trip people, at least.

475
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,650
You should do the
same from now on.

476
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,780
Thanks to you, I made
up my mind as well.

477
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,460
You asked me what my name was.

478
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:46,180
I'm Yeon from the Hong family.

479
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,360
Please kick Wal out.

480
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,770
He never listens to me.

481
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,070
You have to be harsh with him.

482
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,830
I'm planning not to.

483
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,400
Because he gave me something
more valuable than money.

484
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,790
Well...

485
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,190
I'll be on my own from this point on.

486
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,220
It's still bright out. I suppose we
shouldn't be walking together.

487
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,120
Take care then.

488
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,220
We'll see each other again,
thanks to that Wal.

489
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,720
Couldn't you just kick him out?

490
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,590
Please.

491
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,730
Why don't you come over
and kick him out then?

492
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,780
I'll be waiting.

493
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,030
Well then...

494
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,700
Stop.

495
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,700
Have you been well, Prince?

496
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,830
You're the left state minister, right?

497
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,360
Long time, no see.

498
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,570
The Queen Dowager ordered me
to bring the new king.

499
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:28,470
I said, "the new king" just now!

500
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,630
I was disappointed that we
had to part ways that day.

501
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,040
Who's the person you were
just with, by the way?

502
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,840
She seemed like a young lady
from an aristocrat family.

503
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,050
Yes, but I don't know yet.

504
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:53,000
Left State Minister, you've been
frequenting my chamber lately.

505
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,480
I ran into the prince on
my way to the palace.

506
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,880
I stopped by to tell you
how he's doing.

507
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,690
He's definitely very
different from His Majesty,

508
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,130
who's been living in the palace.

509
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,860
It looks like he gets along with

510
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,340
everyone since he's free-spirited.

511
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,340
I'm afraid he might attract
pests in the near future.

512
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,300
What do you mean?

513
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:22,300
It's just my silly concern.

514
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,320
I'll take care of him well since
I'm the one who brought him here.

515
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,990
I'll make sure he plays
the part as a prince.

516
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,970
What matters the most now is

517
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:41,890
the firm and stable
authority of the king.

518
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,980
So you want me to hand over the
queen's position in return?

519
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,180
It's my token of gratitude.

520
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,400
Don't feel pressured,
and please accept it.

521
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,370
I've wanted to do this
for a long time.

522
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,330
For the aristocratic ladies to
participate in all the selections

523
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,860
is quite a lot of work.

524
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,510
And since you'll be taking
care of one of my relatives,

525
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:24,000
I feel even more obligated.

526
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,210
Please take good care of her.

527
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:37,140
The Queen Mother also
brought a nice present.

528
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,220
Tell the royal kitchen to
prepare a drinking table

529
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,710
and invite the Chief State Minister.

530
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,340
Your Majesty, what will you do?

531
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,120
Kim Man Chan is simple and vain.

532
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,260
All you need to do is
to flatter him a bit,

533
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,040
and he'll try hard to prove himself.

534
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,620
And?

535
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,820
I'll find the gunman myself.

536
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,840
I remember what he looked like.

537
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,340
You mean you'll meet with
that bastard yourself?

538
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,050
You can't, Your Majesty!

539
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,350
Why do you keep
endangering yourself?

540
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,910
It won't be dangerous.

541
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,020
At least, he can't kill me

542
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,400
before the selection ends.

543
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,700
I can't believe Your Majesty wanted
to drink with me alone like this.

544
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,450
I'm incredibly flattered.

545
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,240
It looks like the selection
will commence soon.

546
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,440
Pardon?

547
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,320
Oh, yes!

548
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,330
Our family submitted
an application as well.

549
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,370
I heard that...

550
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:09,550
your hunters are very competent.

551
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,100
Are you talking about
the mountain hunters?

552
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,480
Yes.

553
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,760
They call them the
mountain hunters.

554
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,340
My grandmother has been
working hard for the selection.

555
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:26,840
I'd like to give her a tiger skin as a gift
and fulfill my duty as a grandson.

556
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,230
May I ask you to hunt
that tiger for me?

557
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,620
Are you telling me to...

558
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:38,620
present a gift to the Queen Dowager
with my own hands?

559
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,950
Yes, I have no reason to refuse!

560
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,740
I'll do that, Your Majesty.

561
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,610
I heard some of them are
as tall as a totem pole.

562
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,070
That's impossible.

563
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,570
They're not that tall.

564
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,330
Some of them are Mongolian

565
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,790
and they're bigger than most.

566
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
I see.

567
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,800
And where do they usually hunt?

568
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,270
At Inwang Mountain!

569
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:03,620
Tigers show up often
because it's very wooded.

570
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,380
Inwang Mountain?

571
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,520
Would you like to join us
for an outing?

572
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,330
- Shall I?
- Yes.

573
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,770
Oh, right.

574
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,270
We're in the middle
of the selection.

575
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,480
Well...

576
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,510
I can't be so mobile in
situations like this.

577
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:22,230
Unfortunately, I'll have to
ask you to take charge.

578
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,030
Yes, please do.

579
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,830
Go ahead and enjoy.

580
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,530
Yes.

581
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,500
It looks like you're in
a good mood, Uncle.

582
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,900
Do I seem that way?

583
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,430
Why don't you guess then?

584
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:06,260
The king asked me to prepare
a gift for the Queen Dowager.

585
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,040
Why do you think that is?

586
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,760
That means he'd be on
our side for the selection!

587
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,730
That's right!

588
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,320
You should go to the
hunters' quarters.

589
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,070
Gather the hunters
at Inwang Mountain

590
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,070
and we shall have fun together.

591
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,450
Yes, sir.

592
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,550
Is everything okay?

593
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,010
The king is nowhere to be seen

594
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,400
and the mountain hunters

595
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,030
are ordered to go
tiger hunting lately.

596
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,050
Hunting?

597
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,110
Seriously...

598
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:09,260
I have nothing to do these
days. I'm so bored.

599
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,390
Aigoo, aigoo. I'm so bored.

600
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,070
So did you do something
like that out of boredom?

601
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,600
- What?
- I'm talking about the prince.

602
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,360
Why did you go into his house,
and why are you using me?

603
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,890
What are you plotting exactly?

604
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,990
What do you mean, "plotting?"

605
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:28,550
I'm doing all this for you.

606
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,150
He's the prince. The prince!

607
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,320
The more you look at him...

608
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,820
the less believable it is, but...

609
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,130
he's still royalty. Royalty!

610
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,030
Just wait and see.

611
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:41,070
He'll definitely become useful!

612
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,430
Forget it.

613
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:45,110
I'll be participating in the selection.

614
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,500
I was even invited to the palace
for the first round of selection.

615
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,330
Who was?

616
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:55,930
I was.

617
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,080
I'll become the queen.

618
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,540
How will you...

619
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,900
Are you crazy?

620
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,840
Are you crazy?
You lost it, didn't you?

621
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,650
Are you insane?

622
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,740
Seriously! Who's been fooling you?

623
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,040
Is it the owner of that house...
What's his name...

624
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,640
Was it Baek Ja Yong or
Chung Ja Yong? That bastard...

625
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,740
Watch your mouth!

626
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,030
It was my decision, and
he's my father's friend!

627
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,460
My lady, this is Yeo Wool.

628
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,820
We're running late.

629
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,980
I'll be there soon.

630
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:33,530
I'll be moving into the lodging today
provided by the royal family.

631
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,870
Leaving the lodging would
be difficult for me.

632
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:45,120
I'll send you messages
through this girl.

633
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,660
I'm Yeol Wool.

634
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:54,390
Can I say this one thing
for the last time?

635
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,640
You're crazy.

636
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,690
He's trying to cheer me up.

637
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,200
Well...

638
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,400
[ Hwigyeongjae ]

639
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,130
Everyone has arrived.

640
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:53,520
You can't go on outings so often
while staying in Hwigyeongjae,

641
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,170
but you're allowed to
have visitors freely.

642
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,350
Please keep that in
mind, young ladies.

643
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,900
Now, we'll do the lottery and

644
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,900
two people who picked the
same color will share a room.

645
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:50,320
I'll ask you a question
for the last time.

646
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,020
Help her.

647
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,310
I'm all right.

648
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:32,440
Byul, you need to
stop by home quickly.

649
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,500
I need to tell Father.

650
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,610
How could she be
alive and be here?

651
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,120
It looks like we're sharing a room.

652
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,630
I'm Hong Yeon, the daughter
of the governor of Gyeonggi.

653
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,420
My lady is the daughter
of the Left State Minister...

654
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,150
My lady!

655
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,110
My lady!

656
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,120
If she's the daughter
of the Left State Minister,

657
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,120
she must've made the top three...

658
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,390
If so, she must know my sister.

659
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,850
My lady, you need to
come out for a second.

660
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,280
His Excellency sent me.

661
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,390
He told me to tell you that
I got a copy of the book.

662
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,200
He told me to read it
whenever I visit you

663
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,630
and return it to me
when you're done.

664
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,330
[ Theory of Enlightenment ]

665
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,730
She already checked before she left.

666
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,700
What does she want
me to check now?

667
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,370
By the way, why isn't anyone here?

668
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,380
My goodness!

669
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,750
My lady!

670
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,390
My lady! My lady!

671
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:24,440
My lady, what should I do?

672
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,590
Someone did this to your clothes...

673
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,600
My goodness.

674
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,770
It looks like you planned to wear
them to enter the palace tomorrow.

675
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:39,150
I wonder how that happened.

676
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,850
That's why...

677
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,420
you should've been careful.

678
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,250
Was it you?

679
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,770
Did you...

680
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:48,020
do this yourself?

681
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,510
Hey!

682
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:52,690
My lady!

683
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,580
How could you destroy
someone's skirt like this?

684
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,800
Please throw this out when
you're dumping your lady's clothes.

685
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,690
You!

686
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,600
You! Hey!

687
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,810
What should I do?

688
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,410
My goodness...

689
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,890
Did you do that?

690
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,640
I apologize if I'm mistaken.

691
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,510
What if you're not mistaken?

692
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,400
Then I should tell the court lady.

693
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,360
Punishment would differ if it
were a mistake or intentional.

694
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:32,050
I wouldn't be so nosy without
any evidence if I were you.

695
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,100
And I wouldn't dare to stand in the
way of Kim Song Yi like this either.

696
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,150
Are you from the Kim family?

697
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,100
Now you know.

698
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:44,530
So shut up and move.

699
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:47,010
They say birds of
a feather flock together.

700
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:52,320
It looks like you took after
the man of your family a lot.

701
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,720
What?

702
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,120
Would you really wear this?

703
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,290
You'd be wearing ragged clothes.

704
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,310
What should I do then?

705
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:10,700
We're visiting the palace tomorrow.

706
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,400
I can't go naked.

707
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,180
Stop crying, my lady.

708
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:17,840
By the way, what should
we do with the stitches?

709
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,870
It looks ugly.

710
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:24,710
What if you embroidered over it?

711
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,150
Something like flowers
or butterflies?

712
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,520
I'll help with the embroidery too!

713
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,900
She's such a meanie, isn't she?

714
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,000
- That woman from the Kim family.
- Well...

715
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,690
If you find this acceptable,

716
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,420
I'll help too.

717
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:49,600
Circle...

718
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,920
That's right.

719
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,240
You must be hungry.

720
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,420
Why don't you have some snacks?

721
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:09,370
Thank you.

722
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:10,800
Thank you.

723
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,470
Here.

724
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:13,940
Thank you, my lady.

725
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,310
Aigoo! So tasty.

726
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,700
That's so pretty.

727
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,300
Wow.

728
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:36,840
Your Majesty.

729
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,960
But you told the Chief State Minister
that you wouldn't join him for hunting.

730
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,610
I said that intentionally.

731
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,000
Pardon?

732
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,140
If he were the culprit, he wouldn't
let me see the gunman.

733
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:51,020
But what if I weren't there?

734
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,250
What would happen?

735
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,450
He must be an excellent
gunman if he was chosen

736
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:55,870
for the assassination mission.

737
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:58,820
He'd put someone like him
for an important hunt like this.

738
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:02,140
So...

739
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,680
I'll have to ambush them.

740
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,470
Let's go.

741
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:21,530
Great Royal Dowager Queen is here.

742
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:25,910
What are you doing right now?

743
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:28,350
I'm here because I was
shocked to hear the news.

744
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,170
How could you go hunting when
the selection is about to start?

745
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,590
Grandmother.

746
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:36,700
There's something
I really want to hunt today.

747
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,590
I'll come back safely.

748
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,490
So please step aside.

749
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:09,900
His Excellency Kim Man Chan
will be hunting today.

750
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,510
Therefore, no one is
allowed to enter.

751
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:13,200
- Please leave.
- Hey!

752
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,270
Get out of the way immediately.

753
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:17,650
It's His Majesty.

754
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,070
We deserve to die!

755
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,030
Your Majesty.

756
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,270
Your Majesty.

757
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,450
You didn't notify us.

758
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,000
What brings you here
all of a sudden?

759
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,260
I kept thinking about
what you said.

760
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,490
I thought I'd get some fresh air.

761
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,560
Oh, I see.

762
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,980
Are these the hunters...

763
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:06,320
you can't stop bragging about?

764
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

765
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,030
Would you like to see
how good they are?

766
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,620
I'd love to.

767
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:15,520
Don't be nervous because I'm here.

768
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,730
Feel free to show off
your skills as usual.

769
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:19,630
Yes, Your Majesty!

770
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,900
Ready!

771
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,430
Fire!

772
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,940
Fire!

773
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,640
Wow.

774
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,200
Fire!

775
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,260
He's left-handed, but he's putting
his left foot forward to balance.

776
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,490
That scar.

777
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,730
I couldn't tell what it was
because he was wearing a mask.

778
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:09,960
But it was definitely that scar.

779
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:15,480
Truly impressive.

780
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,080
If so...

781
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,060
shall we start hunting?

782
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,400
Yes.

783
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,770
All right!

784
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:27,350
Let's start hunting now!

785
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,090
- Spread out!
- Yes!

786
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,740
Let us go.

787
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,900
Darn...

788
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,310
Catch him!

789
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:30,590
Geez...

790
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,870
We need to arrest him!

791
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:33,100
- Chase him!
- Yes!

792
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,130
Your Majesty.

793
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:51,110
They caught a tiger
on the Southeast side.

794
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,210
Let's turn around and go!

795
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,550
Let's do that.

796
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:56,230
Giddy up!

797
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,140
Geez...

798
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,360
Look, Your Majesty.

799
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,460
We caught the king of tigers.

800
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,550
It's probably at least 2 meters long.

801
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:03,990
You did good work.

802
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,890
Let's call it a day then.

803
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:06,870
Yes.

804
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:09,320
I'll skin it and bring it to you.

805
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,340
By the way, I haven't seen

806
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,690
the security guard around you.

807
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,090
His Excellency.

808
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,980
I think one of our
hunters is missing too.

809
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,140
I'm afraid it'd get dark soon.

810
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,590
What an idiot.

811
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:26,670
Who is it?

812
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,580
I guess he was too
absorbed into hunting.

813
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,180
I'll leave the search party behind.

814
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,450
You should stay here
and look for those two.

815
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:33,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

816
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,890
Yes, that sounds good.

817
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,560
What are you all doing?

818
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,650
The sun is setting!

819
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,250
Hurry up and get ready
to go back!

820
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,440
Yes!

821
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:49,540
Let's go.

822
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,760
Kang Yi Soo's daughter is entering
the first round of the selection, sir.

823
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,520
Did you make sure to
relay our message?

824
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,680
Yes.

825
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,420
She's still not quite determined,

826
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,040
but she'd be willing to do
it if it's for her father.

827
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,550
I want you to persuade her.

828
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,050
We'll have to make sure
she's on our side

829
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,210
before sending her to the king.

830
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:28,390
Your Majesty.

831
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,460
Han Mo!

832
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,310
My apologies, Your Majesty.

833
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:33,800
He ended up...

834
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,120
How about you?

835
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,280
Are you okay?

836
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

837
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,340
Did the man...

838
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,750
die?

839
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,340
No, Your Majesty.

840
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,280
Where is he?

841
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:02,180
We moved him here since he lost
consciousness in the mountain.

842
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,700
What condition is he in?

843
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,460
He's not well since
he's still unconscious.

844
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:07,870
We should wait and see.

845
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,480
You need to save him.

846
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,450
No matter what it takes.

847
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:19,140
Someone might notice us
if we stay here too long.

848
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:22,890
Get ready to hide him away as
soon as his condition improves.

849
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:24,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

850
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,270
I knew it wasn't Kim Man Chan.

851
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:32,970
His gunman went missing,
but he's way too quiet.

852
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:35,640
The culprit wouldn't
behave that way.

853
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,840
If so...

854
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,200
Let's keep an eye on him for now.

855
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,810
Get out of the way!

856
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,850
Get out of the way!

857
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,700
Get out of the way!

858
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,400
Get out of the way!

859
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,920
Everyone is here, right?

860
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:15,620
Please follow me.

861
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:38,110
She's the daughter of Hong Ki Ho,
the governor of Gyeonggi.

862
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,470
Find out if there's a
daughter of Hong Ki Ho,

863
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:47,120
the governor of Gyeonggi
among the candidates.

864
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

865
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:55,320
My goodness!

866
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,110
Where did you get
such beautiful silk?

867
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:01,130
The more you look at it,
the more beautiful it is!

868
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:15,630
You'll be presenting yourselves
in Joongyidang soon.

869
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:17,870
Please prepare yourselves.

870
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,500
Excuse me.

871
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,840
Will His Majesty be there too?

872
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:28,540
His Majesty won't be there.

873
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:44,500
I thought His Majesty would be
here this time too, Mother.

874
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:49,610
The last selection
was an exception.

875
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:51,820
That's true.

876
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:56,320
I heard we have young ladies
from all over the country this time.

877
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,610
Get started.

878
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:28,380
We'll start the presentation.

879
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,600
The daughter of Jo Heung Gyeon,
the Left State Minister

880
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,360
may start the bowing
presentation first.

881
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,850
Instead of discarding
the torn skirt,

882
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,630
you made it special and pretty.

883
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:00,580
Yes.

884
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:03,050
I'm flattered by your lavishment,
Your Highness.

885
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,470
- Did you look into it?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

886
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:20,870
The daughter of the governor
of Gyeonggi is indeed among them.

887
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:23,040
So it was true.

888
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,870
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

889
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:31,120
Close it.

890
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,530
Your Majesty, where are you going?

891
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:36,840
Please tell me if
you're going somewhere...

892
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,290
Your Majesty.

893
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:47,490
Here comes His Majesty!

894
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,610
King.

895
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:01,290
I'll join you too,
Great Royal Dowager Queen.

896
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,070
King.

897
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,310
What's going on all of a sudden?

898
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:15,540
It's not a big deal.

899
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:18,280
I'm just participating in
the selection for my spouse.

900
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,020
Don't trouble yourself.

901
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:22,690
It's not like it never
happened before.

902
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:24,400
Continue.

903
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:31,960
We'll resume then.

904
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,560
This is the daughter of
Kim Young Chan, the chief scholar.

905
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:56,840
This is the daughter of Hong Ki Ho,
the governor of Gyeonggi.

906
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:59,200
[ Queen: Love and War ]

907
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,560
Have you made up your mind?

908
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,640
I need to find the culprit
who killed my sister first.

909
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,950
The revenge on the
king will come next.

910
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:06,540
We need to find a solution.

911
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:10,060
She lied about who she is and
participated in the selection.

912
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,800
She'll seduce His Majesty again.

913
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,490
What will you do with
that woman?

914
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:17,060
You know she's his
weakness. That woman.

915
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,850
Pull yourself together, Your Majesty.

916
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:20,200
Don't be confused.

917
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,600
Everyone will manipulate
her in front of me now.

918
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,790
I'll protect her this time
no matter what.
