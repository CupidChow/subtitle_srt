They're being taken to the

They probably won't be okay.

Would I be able to meet with them?

to save his father's life?

172
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,820
I don't think there's
a law that prevents

173
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,030
a slave from saving his father's life.

174
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,740
But you should apologize.

175
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,340
To yourself for making
yourself a thief

176
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,200
and to this young master as well.

177
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,990
Please forgive me.

178
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,010
Please forgive me.

179
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,400
Please don't...

180
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,930
Please don't kill me.

181
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,810
Please forgive me.

182
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,930
What have you done?

183
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,980
Didn't you hear his sorry situation?

184
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,250
I heard as well.

185
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,910
However, my Joseon is
a nation of strict law.

186
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,470
It's a crime to steal.

187
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,640
When the law is lawful and
when the citizens are civil,

188
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,130
the country stabilizes, and the
king exercises power rightly.

189
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,160
That's how my teacher taught me.

190
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,140
I don't know what you're talking about,

191
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,990
but chase him down if you want and

192
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,170
and take him to the precinct.

193
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,130
Who are you anyway?

194
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,710
Are you an accomplice or a decoy?

195
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,830
I'm neither.

196
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,280
I don't believe you.

197
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,860
Take me to the person
who can prove my identity.

198
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,060
If that's impossible,

199
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,880
we can go to the
precinct together too.

200
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,300
What did you say?

201
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,060
Not to mention current cultural
influences from America,

202
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,920
ignoring the advancement
of the administration

203
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,710
is a huge problem for Joseon.

204
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,760
Young people like us should fight
against the cabinet members

205
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,900
who are only concerned about their
interest with the country in crisis!

206
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,980
But the cultural
revolution we long for

207
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,720
shouldn't stop at being just a
theory or self-justification.

208
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,690
As the Four Great Sages
taught us, real learning

209
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,720
becomes complete
when it actually becomes

210
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,460
useful to people. Don't you agree?

211
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,130
I agree! I agree.

212
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,660
If so, are we all in agreement
that we need to lead

213
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,620
the change of Joseon
as Confucian scholars?

214
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,790
- Yes!
- Yes.

215
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,230
I don't think my father
came here today.

216
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,560
What?

217
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,050
You mean your father mingles with
those Confucian scholars?

218
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,090
You lie about something
you'd get found out

219
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,710
and even lie about your father,

220
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,790
you should be punished for
transgressing human relations!

221
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,410
Let's go to the precinct right now.

222
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,370
What?

223
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,510
I'm telling the truth!

224
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,660
My father is their teacher.

225
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,890
If so, tell me his name.

226
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,850
Who's your father?

227
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,590
His name is Kang Yi Soo.
He's a teacher at Sungkyunkwan.

228
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,800
Are you happy?

229
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,710
Teacher Kang Yi Soo?

230
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,410
I'll punish you if you lie to me.

231
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,730
Are you sure you
responded truthfully?

232
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,900
What right do you have
to do this anyway?

233
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,030
Have you heard, "I rule everything
above and below the sky."

234
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,600
I'm bound to become the
king of this country.

235
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,000
So I have the right.

236
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,070
You mean you're the
crown prince or something?

237
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,590
That's correct.

238
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,510
Yes, yes. How important you are.

239
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,590
But thankfully, you're pointing to the ground
and sky since you have two hands.

240
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,330
Please become the salt
of the earth to the people

241
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,150
just like how Buddha was.

242
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,890
Is that enough for you?

243
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,470
Who's punishing whom?

244
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,160
You're just an impostor.

245
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,010
Fine, let's go to the precinct.

246
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,220
- What did you say?
- My lady.

247
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,190
I heard that if I come here,

248
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,820
I'd be able to find out
what this is for.

249
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,720
Is that true?

250
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:59,070
Do you truly believe that Joseon would
change by modern development?

251
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,900
It's not my belief, but it's my hope.

252
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,110
Our children would be living
and learning in Joseon.

253
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,720
And I hope it won't be
the same as it is now.

254
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,400
But the oppression is
becoming harsher.

255
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,450
Both the Kim family and
Jo Heung Gyeon are running rampant.

256
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,200
At this rate...

257
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,630
they'd blame everything to you

258
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,020
as the teacher of the
Confucian scholars.

259
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,300
[ Grandma, how are you?
This is Han Dong... ]

260
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,510
This is called an "eyeglass."

261
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:45,490
You usually use them as
a pair and look through them,

262
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,710
but he was only able to
get one of them.

263
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,880
That's what it says.

264
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,140
You mean Han Dong said that?

265
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,050
Yes, your grandson.

266
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,790
He said he's worried that
you sew with poor vision.

267
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,450
Aigoo...

268
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,740
Aigoo...

269
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,320
Aigoo, please don't sleep
where it's cold.

270
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,200
Please eat well and be healthy.

271
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,450
Aigoo, aigoo...

272
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,590
Han Dong...

273
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,500
May I help you respond to him
by what you just said?

274
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,830
Excuse me?

275
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,800
Yes, yes...

276
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,800
Please don't worry...

277
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,100
about me and...

278
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,720
About me and...

279
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,760
Please...

280
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,100
listen to what your
owner says and...

281
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,910
- Please...
- Yes.

282
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,380
I don't think there's a law that prevents
a slave from saving his father's life.

283
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,590
But you should apologize.

284
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,870
To yourself for making
yourself a thief

285
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,540
and to this young master as well.

286
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,830
Looks like you have an urgent matter.

287
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,150
How about you write down your
name here before you go?

288
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,700
If my father comes back,

289
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,000
I'll ask him to prove my identity since
you wanted that so much.

290
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,900
I'm saying this since you
keep looking at the sun.

291
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,200
- What's your name?
- Forget it.

292
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,100
A scholar must be
responsible for his doubt

293
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,100
and since I'm a man as well...

294
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,470
Do you have an embarrassing
name by chance?

295
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,560
What did you say?

296
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,810
Chil Bok? Yang Deuk?

297
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,620
Dol Swoe? Gae Ddong?

298
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,050
Is it one of these?

299
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,240
Is it worse than those?

300
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,210
Kyung.

301
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,850
It's Lee Kyung.

302
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,900
Lee...

303
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,690
Which character is it?

304
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,790
It's Kyung, that means "bright."

305
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,300
Kyung...

306
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,100
That's not the one,
although it means the same.

307
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,850
That's not it either.

308
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,240
I guess...

309
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,290
it's not meant to be easily
used by common people.

310
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,700
[ Lee Kyung ]

311
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,400
[ Lee Kyung ]

312
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,780
Did you say you wish
for a great king?

313
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,470
Fine.

314
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,760
I'll make sure to be that.

315
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,790
But tell me instead.

316
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,000
- What's your name?
- I told you.

317
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,500
- My father is...
- No.

318
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,780
Your name.

319
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,260
I'm curious to know your name.

320
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,510
- I'm Kang...
- We're palace guards!

321
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,100
Arrest everyone right now!

322
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,990
Yes!

323
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,800
Get up, everyone! We must run!

324
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,900
Run away!

325
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,960
Run away right now!

326
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,990
This way!

327
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,150
Run!

328
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,710
Run away!

329
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,200
Run!

330
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,720
Run!

331
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,970
Let's go.

332
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,920
Who are they?

333
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,390
Catch them!

334
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,090
That boy who was running away.

335
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,220
We need to catch him.

336
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,750
I guess he could be injured
as long as he's on the run.

337
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,940
Pardon?

338
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,450
Yes, sir!

339
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,360
So the Crown Prince was here?

340
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,160
That'd be the excuse.

341
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,500
The excuse to entangle
the Crown Prince.

342
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,650
Over there!

343
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,400
- Chase after them!
- Stop!

344
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,090
Run, run, run!

345
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,020
They're not here!

346
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,210
Look everywhere!

347
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,600
Blood!

348
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,510
Does it hurt a lot?

349
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,900
Let's spread out and look.

350
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,410
Your Highness!

351
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,520
Your Highness!

352
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,070
This is no good.

353
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,850
I'll go get a doctor.

354
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,690
I saw a doctor at the
end of the street.

355
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,360
You can...

356
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,400
go back on your own.

357
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,720
I know you've been afraid.

358
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,040
I wish I could.

359
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,380
Even if I hurry up and go back,

360
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,030
Mother will whip me with
a stick at least a hundred times.

361
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,400
But I can't just leave someone

362
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,170
who needs my help.

363
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,080
My day was ruined because
I got involved with you.

364
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,450
If so...

365
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,220
I'll help you anytime you
ask for my help.

366
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,050
I promise under the
sun, moon, and stars.

367
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,260
Fine.

368
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,890
Be careful. Please.

369
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,420
What is it?

370
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,860
I have no money.

371
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,800
Not a single penny.

372
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,980
What can you do?

373
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,570
Give this to the doctor for now.

374
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,930
Your Highness!

375
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,000
This is Chief Eunuch Hwang!

376
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,530
Where are you?

377
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,900
Your Highness!

378
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,460
This is Chief Eunuch Hwang!

379
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,950
Where are you?

380
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,500
Your Highness!

381
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,160
Chief Eunuch Hwang!

382
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,380
I'm right here!

383
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,030
Over here! Over here...

384
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,180
Chief Eunuch Hwang!

385
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,730
Your Highness?

386
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,240
Your Highness!

387
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,310
Chief Eunuch Hwang!

388
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,900
What happened?

389
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,880
My heart almost
dropped to the floor!

390
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,100
I'm sorry. Were you worried?

391
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,150
Of course!

392
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,520
I almost lost my head.

393
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,800
You mean you were
worried about yourself?

394
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,490
You're mistaken, Your Highness.

395
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,350
Your Highness! Did you get hurt?

396
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,860
Are you okay?

397
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,040
I can feel the pain too!

398
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,910
Please let me have a look! Ah, yes.

399
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,900
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

400
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,350
- Hold on...
- Your Highness, we need to go back.

401
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,230
Hold on a second.

402
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,620
I just need a second!

403
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,090
She'll come back soon.

404
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,360
Your Highness.

405
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,870
Her Majesty the Queen is
worried sick waiting for you.

406
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,450
It's past your time to
return to the palace.

407
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,720
I'll send someone out
when we go back.

408
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,960
I'll make sure to tell him to
relay the message to the lady.

409
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,550
So, please...

410
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,180
allow me to carry you.

411
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,890
Your Highness?

412
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,190
Your Highness!

413
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,660
Hold tightly.

414
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,230
I'll be moving fast.

415
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,620
Your Majesty, it's Han Mo.

416
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,320
Enter.

417
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,190
What happened?

418
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,920
I regret to say this, but

419
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,430
even after looking everywhere,

420
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,880
we still couldn't find
Her Majesty the Queen's body.

421
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,980
Find her.

422
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,920
She's my queen,
no matter what they say.

423
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,450
You need to find her.

424
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

425
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,610
She committed high treason?

426
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,060
Who came up with this plot anyway?

427
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,480
The thing is...

428
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,710
I heard it was decided
at Queen Dowager's palace.

429
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,320
What?

430
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,590
I'm thirsty.

431
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,990
Aigoo...

432
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,950
I got my childhood memories back.

433
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,900
Well...

434
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,260
Is that a good thing
in this situation?

435
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,620
Well, I suppose...

436
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,960
It's already been three years
since we first met!

437
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,300
You walked into the Buyong
Agency's office yourself then.

438
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,030
You did that!

439
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,090
Because I thought

440
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,600
I'd find my family someday
if I become an informant.

441
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,900
That's what I thought then.

442
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,610
Your family. Yes. Back then...

443
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,520
So that's when...

444
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,070
That's when I started
finding you annoying!

445
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,460
You talked like an aristocrat
even though you were a shaman.

446
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,100
You talked to be so rudely!

447
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,890
I couldn't believe how
ridiculous you were!

448
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,100
But then...

449
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,500
you really turned out
to be an aristocrat.

450
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,380
So you'd better stop
talking to me casually.

451
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,520
Yes, yes, my lady.

452
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,670
Hey.

453
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,270
By the way, what will you do now?

454
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,510
I need to find him.

455
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,750
The culprit who killed my sister.

456
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,470
A clear piece of evidence.

457
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,850
Yes.

458
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,290
We have Mr. Wang.

459
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,920
This is ridiculous.

460
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,710
She was the queen of the country.
The queen was assassinated!

461
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,130
But how could you blame
her for that?

462
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,410
King.

463
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,830
Did you say there was false
information in the application?

464
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,620
And you want to destroy that family?

465
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,940
No.

466
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,760
I'll order them to release
them immediately!

467
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,160
You're the one who's telling
a lie, Grandmother!

468
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,500
Don't you understand at all?

469
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,410
Don't you know why
I had to do that?

470
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,980
The country would've been
in huge disarray otherwise.

471
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,740
And a lot more people
would've been hurt.

472
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,870
You have to avoid the rain
shower first, Your Majesty.

473
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,280
Kang Yi Soo is also a citizen of mine.

474
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,330
No country works
around one person.

475
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,660
If you give them up one
by one like that,

476
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,460
who would be loyal to this royal
family and the administration?

477
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,180
That's why...

478
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,960
I want you to recover
your health quickly.

479
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,040
Please become strong and turn
everything back to normal then.

480
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,170
Now isn't the right time.

481
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,030
Promise that you won't bother
Kang Yi Soo anymore.

482
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,030
I'll...

483
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
find an answer that's
different from yours.

484
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,420
Your Highness, it's Court Lady Jung.

485
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,120
Enter.

486
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,910
The imprisoned gunman was

487
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,600
apparently found dead.

488
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,530
Please let me handle this and

489
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,940
only focus on recovering your health.

490
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,960
I'm begging you, King!

491
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,590
The cause of death seems to be
a poisoned needle, Your Highness.

492
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,870
A poisoned needle?

493
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,800
A poisoned needle was used within
the Royal Investigation Bureau?

494
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,280
That means a spy is
working with them here!

495
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,510
How could the Royal Investigation
Bureau be so lax!

496
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,120
I deserve to die, Your Highness.

497
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,030
The soldiers who were on watch
got distracted for a second.

498
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,620
Bring the soldiers
immediately, interrogate them

499
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,200
and make sure to find out
who it was! No matter what!

500
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,270
Yes, Your Highness!

501
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,470
Your Excellency!

502
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,800
Your Excellency.

503
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,140
What is it?

504
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,220
I was reported that three bodies were
found in the Central Canal.

505
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,610
Aigoo.

506
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,690
Aigoo, my goodness.

507
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,760
Hey.

508
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,750
Isn't that...

509
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,830
a gun wound?

510
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,570
Mr. Wang!

511
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,890
Mr. Wang is in danger!

512
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,070
Mr. Wang.

513
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,830
Mr. Wang!

514
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,270
Mr. Wang, are you there?

515
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,270
- Mr. Wang!
- Move.

516
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,320
- Hey, hey...
- Let go!

517
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,030
Hey, hey! Hold on!

518
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,800
Unbelievable...

519
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,150
Geez...

520
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,870
I said not to go in!

521
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,990
S***!

522
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,800
- He's cutting his tails off.
- What?

523
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,940
Since the king woke up.

524
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,060
Killing the king means the beginning
of the new government, but

525
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,620
failing to do so means treason.

526
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,140
Maybe...

527
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,440
this is a warning saying,
"Don't come after me."

528
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,970
Something like, "If you keep looking
for me, I'll kill everyone?"

529
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,300
Three bodies that were found
in the canal were gunmen

530
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,590
and even killed the gun
merchant he dealt with.

531
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,820
You, I, and...

532
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,660
Buyoung Agency probably
became the target.

533
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,050
Go to the back door.

534
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,930
I'll lure him.

535
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,020
Don't you know?

536
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,670
My name is Wal because
I'm fast like a dog.

537
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,600
Don't be nervous.
You might lose your head.

538
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,090
S***!

539
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,500
My lady, are you okay?

540
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,070
My lady!

541
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,260
Since the wound isn't deep,

542
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,740
she'd wake up when
she gets her energy back.

543
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,820
Wow.

544
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,600
I've never seen such
a pretty woman in my life.

545
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,760
She's pretty even when she's ill.

546
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,400
How did a woman get
stabbed anyway?

547
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,240
I wonder.

548
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,230
I don't know what happened,

549
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,700
but...

550
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,300
she's very pretty.

551
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,710
Step back.

552
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,600
- So did you look into it?
- Yes.

553
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,790
I just identified the bodies
found in the Central Canal.

554
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,020
All of them were beggars
from Supyo Bridge and

555
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,400
they were killed by the same bullets
that were used on Your Majesty.

556
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,160
We don't know if there
are one or dozens

557
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,700
of traitors in the Royal
Investigation Bureau.

558
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,060
Tell the Ministry of War to
trace this bullet discreetly.

559
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

560
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,600
How's Chief Scholar doing?

561
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,490
Eun Ki.

562
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,890
There's no way.

563
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,220
Or is it...

564
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,170
Eun Bo?

565
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,140
Oh, my!

566
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,670
I'm not a bad person!

567
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,380
Last night, on the street,

568
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,510
you and I were like...

569
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,080
Aigoo, you woke up.

570
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,960
You were so sick.

571
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,230
Aren't you hungry?

572
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,030
Have some of this porridge.

573
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,650
Oh, yeah!

574
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,320
Have some of this first.

575
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,740
Nothing beats this for wounds.

576
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,800
Why are you crying?
Are you in pain?

577
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,200
Does it hurt a lot?

578
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,400
- Call the doctor...
- I...

579
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:54,770
Pardon?

580
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
I'm hungry.

581
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,500
I shouldn't be hungry
at times like this.

582
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,300
I'm hungry!

583
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,300
You can eat all of it.

584
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,030
Eat all of it and eat some more!

585
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,570
You can keep eating and eating.

586
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,700
It's my fault. But everyone...

587
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,500
If only I didn't sell
Mr. Wang's information...

588
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,180
Aigoo! How nice!

589
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,860
Yes!

590
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,310
Great job!

591
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,000
- Your Excellency!
- Yes, yes, yes!

592
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,760
Twirl, twirl, twirl!

593
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,520
That's right!

594
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,330
Aigoo, look at you!

595
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,390
How fun!

596
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,520
Be quiet for a second!

597
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,520
Hyungnim!

598
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,680
Did you see?

599
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,980
Did you hear?

600
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:58,300
The king who became a paper
tiger stuck in the palace!

601
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,980
Come on now.

602
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,880
Even so, he still owns the throne.

603
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,930
Although he's completely useless.

604
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,940
Raise your glass!

605
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,980
Yes, yes, yes!

606
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,210
It was Eun Ki.

607
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,300
For some reason, it was so vivid.

608
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,340
Even in my dream, I held onto her.

609
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,030
Have you found Eun Ki's body yet?

610
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,250
We searched everywhere, but...

611
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,620
My apologies.

612
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:19,830
We must catch the culprit
in order to save Chief Scholar.

613
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,770
The gunman already died.

614
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,720
And if we lose the remaining culprit,
there's no other way.

615
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,480
But I can't even trust the
Royal Investigation Bureau.

616
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,920
Can you think of any way?

617
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,470
There's a place called
Buyoung Agency.

618
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,740
Your Majesty.

619
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,320
They supposedly provide any
information clients request.

620
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,500
- Information?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

621
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,400
He's an informant at the market.

622
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,100
I've also heard that he's the best

623
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,820
in the whole Unjongga.

624
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,200
- If you give me an order, I'll...
- Prepare for an outing.

625
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,490
I'll go there myself.

626
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,600
Yourself, Your Majesty?
You can't, Your Majesty.

627
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,900
It's way too dangerous.

628
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,870
You can't even fight,
and all you do is nagging.

629
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,330
I'll leave you in the palace.

630
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,550
How could you say
that, Your Majesty?

631
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,030
Let's go.

632
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,320
I feel hurt, Your Majesty.

633
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,330
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

634
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,310
Where are you headed to?

635
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,040
I'll make sure to return this favor.

636
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,630
Well...

637
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:21,170
Can't you tell me what
your name is, at least?

638
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:22,430
Well...

639
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm...

640
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,700
Lee Jae Hwa.

641
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,400
Thank you so much.

642
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,400
Why don't you...

643
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,900
return the favor now?

644
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,610
I know neither your
name nor your surname.

645
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,110
How would I know if you'd
ever return the favor?

646
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,600
Check it out, check it out!

647
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,130
Come and see!

648
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,400
Goodbye.

649
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,400
Are you sure you don't know
your way around Hanyang?

650
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,170
Yes, I didn't until two days ago.

651
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,190
They have a seafood shop now!

652
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:39,030
Fresh squid and saury!

653
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,650
Have a look.

654
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,810
Wow.

655
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,630
You caught sauries
that are three years old.

656
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,730
What are you saying?

657
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:49,100
They turned adults this year.

658
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,400
They're obviously old
enough to get married.

659
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,400
Stop lying!

660
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,390
You can't even cover the
half of this pretty little face.

661
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:02,180
Nobody would eat this in
Jemulpo, even if it's free.

662
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,750
If it's good fish,

663
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,500
its eyes have to be as clear
as this lady's eyes

664
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,650
and its colors should be
as pretty as her skin

665
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:17,540
and its mouth needs to
be as red as her lips...

666
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,680
So will you buy it or not?

667
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,090
I'll take one.

668
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,690
It's two nyang.

669
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,880
Consider yourself lucky!

670
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,310
I happened to be in a good mood.

671
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,980
Shall we then?

672
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,500
Why won't you ask me questions?

673
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,180
I'm a mysterious woman who
was being chased while wounded.

674
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,450
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

675
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,830
Do you have a place to go?

676
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,150
Not just a place to crash in,

677
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:06,600
but somewhere safe and...

678
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,330
a place where someone's
waiting for you.

679
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,150
I'll lure him.

680
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,930
Go to the back door.

681
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,030
I have to be somewhere.

682
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,990
Is it you, Wal?

683
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,870
Who are you?

684
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,660
I'm here to commission a case.

685
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,170
Hold on.

686
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,210
Talk to me from there.

687
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,880
We're not supposed to reveal
our identities as a rule.

688
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,820
The gunmen who were at the
Chinyoung parade died one by one.

689
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,390
One of them died in prison

690
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:47,500
and three were found
dead in the canal.

691
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,580
Someone killed all those people.

692
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:52,770
He might be the leader
of the gunmen.

693
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,060
I want you to find him discreetly.

694
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,800
The dead bodies happen to be
beggars from Supyo Bridge.

695
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,900
But the Bureau investigated
Supyo Bridge and found nothing.

696
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,790
Supyo Bridge?

697
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,560
One more thing.

698
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,320
It'd be best if you kept
your mouth shut.

699
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,640
Otherwise, you'd be holding the fee
in your mouth for the afterlife.

700
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,190
I'll come back in three days.

701
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,050
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

702
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,840
Her voice...

703
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,670
No.

704
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,700
Never mind. There's no way.

705
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,890
This is a message from
Buyoung Agency.

706
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:47,040
There's an abandoned
shaman house in Namsangol.

707
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,820
Meet me there at 9 p.m.
in three days.

708
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,000
It's too dangerous to
meet at Buyoung Agency.

709
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,800
The king is looking for the gunman.

710
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,730
How did you learn about that?

711
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:11,220
He commissioned a case at
Buyoung Agency. He came himself.

712
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,860
If so...

713
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,380
Yes.

714
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,420
I'm the one who's behind
Buyoung Agency.

715
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,010
People say the owner is a man.

716
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,940
Who's that man then?

717
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,170
Well, he's my business partner.

718
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,510
He'll be back soon.

719
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:31,780
Well...

720
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,840
The king is probably looking
for the culprit, right?

721
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,640
It seems that way.

722
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,600
That's a relief.

723
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,410
Can you handle it?
It's not an easy task.

724
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,840
I must. For my sister.

725
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,900
Most importantly, this is the only
way to save my parents.

726
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,850
Do you have a plan?

727
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:54,730
There's a gang that manages
Supyo Bridge secretly in Namoon.

728
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:56,820
I'm thinking of planting a spy there.

729
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,290
I'll find out something since
it happened in their area.

730
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,900
He says he doesn't have any money!

731
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,500
- Did you find out anything?
- No.

732
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,500
I don't know anything.

733
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,820
Here you go.

734
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,890
I heard from the Queen Mother.

735
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,890
Kang's punishment is mere exile?

736
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,230
Exile?

737
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,770
We already dealt with him during
the selection process, Father.

738
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:52,700
He'll act as the king's righthand man
and disturb the court someday.

739
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,600
Yeah.

740
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,800
- He should be eliminated for good.
- That's right.

741
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:57,810
He was the king's
father-in-law briefly.

742
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,750
There is no way the King will
allow a death sentence.

743

We confiscated this book while arresting
the insurgents a few days ago.

747
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:15,220
They refer to this as their
"Book of enlightenment."

748

We dare request you to change
your mind, Your Majesty.

How could we make such
a request without the evidence?

755
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,490
Let her in.

I used to be a maid at the royal villa.

can frequent the royal villa

and teach the queen
the Lesser Learning

760
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,570
means that he is doing his duty

761
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,060
as a patriot by giving his
daughter to the royal family.

762
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,590

Go ahead and report!

765
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:29,140
Whenever Your Majesty's
father-in-law was there,

766
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:33,460
I could overhear sacrilegious talk.

767
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:36,060

and change her worldview

770
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,580
and furthermore...

771
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,850
he told her to let the
people own this country.

772

nothing but the truth?

a lie to you, My King!

His Majesty's well-being has been disturbed

829
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,490
thanks to Kang Yi Soo's sacrifice.

830
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:03,050
Kang Yi Soo's execution
will be decided upon soon.

831
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,880
When I was the crown prince,

832
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,230
I lost you because of their trickery.

833
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:16,190
That was my painful failure.

834
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:18,140
But it'd be different this time.

835
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,250
Chief Eunuch Hwang.

836
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:25,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

837
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:27,490
Summon Inspector General
Baek Ja Yong

838
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,770
and dismiss everyone.

839
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:53,800
[ Theory of Enlightenment ]

840
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:01,350
Is it true

841
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:04,150
that Chief Scholar wrote this book?

842
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:05,760
He's being slandered, Your Majesty!

843
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,890
The queen's father
trying to enlighten her?

844
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:10,000
If such sacrilegious happened
in the royal villa,

845
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,900
things would've gotten
stirred up immediately.

846
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,170
Please interrogate the maid
who made the false confession

847
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:16,960
and punish the ones
who plotted this!

848
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,290
I asked you...

849
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,140
if Kang Yi Soo is the

850
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:26,390
author of that book.

851
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:36,490
Is it really true that he had

852
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,340
those ideals in Joseon?

853
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:43,910
The world ruled by the people.

854
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,830
The world where people
can change the king...

855
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,500
He certainly deserves
to be executed.

856
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,390
But...

857
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:58,960
I'll let him live.

858
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,480
That's why you'll have to help me.

859
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:20,130
Your Majesty.

860
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:24,010
Why don't you bring the maid back
in and interrogate her?

861
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:27,270
In my opinion, His Excellency Kang Yi Soo
isn't that kind of a person.

862
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:29,050
And considering
Your Majesty's character,

863
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:32,290
you would've tried to find
out the truth vigorously.

864
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:35,480
If I trace back her false confession,

865
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:39,280
I'll end up finding that
Mother was involved.

866
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,600
You mean Queen Mother?

867
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,240
So...

868
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,940
this is the answer I came up with.

869
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,220
Father!

870
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:56,400
Father.

871
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,660
His Majesty had a private
meeting with Baek Ja Yong.

872
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,380
It was very secretive.

873
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,520
Baek Ja Yong?

874
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,590
Well...

875
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:07,030
We finally got rid of Kang Yi Soo,
and now it's Baek Ja Yong?

876
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:08,320
Even so,

877
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,410
his execution has been
decided already.

878
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:12,340
He can't change his mind, can he?

879
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,220
- Don't you think, Nephew?
- Well...

880
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,590
Of course not.

881
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:19,960
What did you plan with
your servant, Your Majesty?

882
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,590
Have him followed.

883
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,360
Have him monitor
Baek Ja Yong's every single move.

884
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,790
I found Eun Bo.
You should meet with her.

885
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:52,930
The king is trying to free you tonight.
Please come out safely.

886
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:55,400
I'm begging you as your friend.

887
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,010
Are you going somewhere?

888
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:17,160
I'm heading out due to
an urgent matter.

889
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,230
As long as this works out...

890
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,010
I'll tell you some other time.

891
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:22,290
Yes.

892
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:23,790
By the way...

893
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,470
What's the matter?

894
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:26,550
Well...

895
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:29,910
The king didn't show
up to our meeting.

896
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:31,810
I knew he wouldn't.

897
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:34,870
He probably doesn't have
time for that right now.

898
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,100
- Pardon?
- Wait here for now.

899
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,200
I have to be somewhere urgently.

900
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,530
Fire!

901
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,010
Fire!

902
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,820
Fire!

903
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,880
Hurry up!

904
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,760
There's someone in here!

905
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,980
Come out.

906
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,480
Hurry!

907
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,400
There's someone in here!

908
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:24,430
Fire!

909
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:27,600
Fire!

910
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,270
Fire!

911
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:36,090
Let's go.

912
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,470
Look here.

913
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:56,630
Please be careful.

914
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,800
So, where is Eun Bo?

915
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,100
Let's go for now.
I'll let you meet her.

916
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:16,270
Who are you?

917
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:38,410
You two are best friends, indeed.

918
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:42,810
You've acted so superior.

919
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:46,710
But apparently, even Kang Yi Soo
is afraid of being executed.

920
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:48,290
Escape the prison, huh?

921
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,090
They will be interrogated.

922
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:53,270
Take them away.

923
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:55,450
- Take them away!
- Yes!

924
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,400
Your Majesty.

925
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,420
It's Han Mo.

926
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,760
Enter.

927
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,250
What's the matter?

928
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:10,240
His Excellency Kang Yi Soo
was arrested.

929
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,420
What?

930
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:30,700
You mean there's no one
behind this escape?

931
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,300
If so...

932
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,800
why don't you do the talking then?

933
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,650
The one who ordered
you to assist his escape

934
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:44,900
was truly...

935
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:47,670
Dae Sun Il?

936
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:56,920
Come on.

937
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,660
Can't you hear His Excellency?

938
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,820
Confess right now!

939
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,660
What is it that you want to hear?

940
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,730
I just want to hear the truth.

941
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:26,360
The one who broke the law
and plotted this with you...

942
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,780
I want his name.

943
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,700
- There's no such a person!
- No?

944
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,880
The answer will be the same,
no matter how many times you ask.

945
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:38,400
Then let's follow the law and
behead the prisoner who escaped

946
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:40,920
and you'll report to me afterward.

947
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:48,340
First of all,

948
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,420
I'll have to kill you first.

949
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:02,570
Here comes His Majesty!

950
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,930
Halt!

951
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,450
It was me.

952
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:27,720
I...

953
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:31,230
was behind this prison break.

954
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,300
[ Queen: Love and War ]

955
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,300
Why did you? Why?

956
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:02,050
You shouldn't be talking
to me like this, King.

957
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:04,180
They committed the crime!

958
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,590
I think this might be the way
to calm people down.

959
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:08,990
Another selection?

960
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:11,310
It hasn't been that long
since the queen passed!

961
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:14,980
The world changed because of the
twins that were born in 1895.

962
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,650
I heard it was the king's order.

963
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:18,720
The king ordered them to kill Father!

964
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,910
What if the resurrected queen
participates in the selection?

965
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:25,040
I'm planning to make her
pretend to be the late queen.
