1
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,070
[ Queen: Love and War ]

2
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,900
It was me.

3
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,540
I...

4
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,790
was behind this prison break.

5
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,440
Your Majesty!

6
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,780
No, I did all of this on my own.

7
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,910
Punish me for everything!

8
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,990
Cut my head off!

9
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,130
Free these people now.

10
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,760
Your Majesty.

11
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,010
Why do you defend these
shameless criminals?

12
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,120
According to the law,
breaking out of prison is

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,450
high treason and requires
and immediate execution.

14
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,770
I already told you that I
caused the prison break.

15
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,690
- Your Majesty.
- If you want to punish someone,

16
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,760
you'll have to behead me first...

17
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,760
if you can.

18
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,830
For this incident,

19
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,410
Inspector General Baek Ja Yong
will get removed

20
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,920
from the position, and that'd be it.

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,290
Instead,

22
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,140
I'll grant one of your wishes.

23
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,100
Don't argue about it anymore.

24
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,030
One of my wishes?

25
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,550
I'll have to...

26
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,080
think about that carefully.

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,280
But Your Majesty, you'll have to

28
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,120
punish Kang Yi Soo by
beheading, at least.

29
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,470
Seriously...

30
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,440
Hyungnim.

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,470
You're too compassionate of a man.

32
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,450
You should've insisted
on it a bit more. So...

33
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,190
His Majesty gets on
his knees in fear.

34
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,140
This was our opportunity!

35
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,400
Don't you think, Nephew?

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,390
- I think you're right, Uncle.
- Yes!

37
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,910
We should step aside at this point.

38
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,020
Otherwise, Queen Mother
might be put into danger

39
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,680
for hiring the court lady.

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,920
That's what I'm trying to say.

41
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,230
So stop making a fuss

42
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,010
and think carefully about

43
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,510
what we'll demand from the king.

44
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,760
Are you satisfied being the
manager of the Inspection Bureau?

45
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,650
Pardon?

46
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,160
King, you're not completely well.

47
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,930
- What brings you to the...
- Why did you do that?

48
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,450
Why did you?

49
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,720
King.

50
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,910
Do you know what I just did?

51
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,100
I protected you, Mother.

52
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,800
What are you talking
about right now?

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,100
Did you think I wouldn't know that

54
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,900
you who made the court lady lie?

55
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,390
Who told you that?

56
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,930
What did you hear
and from whom?

57
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,970
Why are you saying this to me?

58
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,640
Is there evidence or anything?

59
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,480
Don't think I'm letting this go

60
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,020
because there's no evidence.

61
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,560
Don't let anyone in!

62
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,400
You shouldn't be doing
this to me, King.

63
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,060
They're the ones who
committed the crime!

64
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,160
You should've gotten rid of

65
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,090
that evil bunch from
the very beginning!

66
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,220
What happened?
Did you look into it?

67
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,680
According to the gatekeeper,

68
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,040
His Excellency left the
palace last night

69
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,200
and hasn't come back since.

70
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,230
His Excellency, Baek Ja Yong
has been acquitted.

71
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,400
You may come out.

72
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,160
Please take good care of her.

73
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,170
Your Majesty.

74
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,220
What brings you all the way here?

75
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,960
I wanted to keep my promise.

76
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,100
That I'd never let you get hurt again.

77
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,260
I really wanted to keep that promise.

78
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,030
Your Majesty.

79
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,910
I wanted to keep you by
my side for a long time.

80
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,060
I wanted to move forward
together, but...

81
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,510
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,780
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,280
I'm the one who wrote that book.

84
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,890
So...

85
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,110
I should be killed as a criminal.

86
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,020
That's not why.

87
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,400
Even if you had those ideas, I...

88
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,720
I still wanted to keep
you by my side.

89
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,360
I know.

90
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,510
But...

91
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,160
you must step over
beyond my death.

92
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,350
And...

93
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,720
I beg you.

94
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,360
Please...

95
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,480
rule a country that is
for the people.

96
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,830
Don't do this.

97
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,800
Your Majesty,

98
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,850
you have hope.

99
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,500
- Don't say that to me.
- I'm...

100
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,480
willing to die for you, Your Majesty.

101
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,290
Stop!

102
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,350
I couldn't even protect
you as the king.

103
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,500
Just blame and curse me.

104
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,240
Please!

105
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,110
Please...

106
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,180
become a great king who starts

107
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,930
Joseon's new future.

108
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,740
I, Kang Yi Soo...

109
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,500
will bow to you for the last time.

110
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,050
Pardon?

111
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,530
What's...

112
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,040
happening to my father again?

113
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,060
He'll be executed soon.

114
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,940
It will be at noon.

115
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,740
Kang Yi Soo committed high treason
for deceiving the royal family

116
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,290
with the false bridal application
and even breaking out of prison.

117
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,710
It is the king's order to
punish him by the law.

118
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,390
Proceed with the execution.

119
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,290
No!

120
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,700
My lady!

121
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,420
Did you hear the rumor?

122
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,240
The king apparently died
and came back to life.

123
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,380
Could it be true?

124
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,730
Nah! That means he's not human!

125
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,620
How could someone die
and come back to life?

126
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,290
Have you heard such a thing?

127
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,870
No, right?

128
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,780
But it's apparently true!

129
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,390
He's a goblin!

130
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,640
A goblin?

131
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,850
How dare you say that!

132
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,270
He's not a goblin.

133
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,830
He's an angel!

134
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,770
He's the king sent by the Heavens.

135
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,710
What kind of angel kills
his father-in-law?

136
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,960
He's a goblin!

137
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,790
I'm saying he's an angel!

138
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,590
A goblin?

139
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,130
Goblin? What are you saying?

140
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,720
Lots of bad rumors are
rampant in the marketplace.

141
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,480
His Majesty is doing okay, right?

142
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,940
He is, right?

143
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,590
Father!

144
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,320
Please allow me to enter
the palace with you.

145
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,810
Please?

146
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,290
Please take me with you.

147
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,760
I want to see His Majesty.

148
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,090
Please?

149
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,980
Young Ji.

150
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,130
Yes.

151
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,730
Do you know what this is?

152
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,640
[ Gyotaejeon: the queen's bedroom
inside Gyeongbokgung Palace ]

153
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,510
It's the queen's palace.

154
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,510
I want to bring you to the
center of the main palace

155
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,660
as Her Majesty, the Queen.

156
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
The queen?

157
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,400
You didn't eat.

158
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,290
Eat.

159
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,450
Eat it.

160
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,580
Eat it! You have to eat...

161
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,570
Do you want to croak?

162
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,130
How many days has it been?

163
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,250
You don't eat nor sleep!

164
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,930
Eat this right now...

165
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,830
Whatever. Whatever.

166
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,350
Do as you wish.

167
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,260
Geez, what a determined b****...

168
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,650
Geez!

169
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,920
Kyung.

170
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,490
It's Lee Kyung.

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,050
A lot of time has passed.

336
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,950
We need to hurry and leave.

337
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,070
Then...

338
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,400
I'll get off the ship, look further,
and follow right behind you.

339
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,740
You can get going
with my wife first.

340
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,030
Yes, sir!

341
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,780
Eun Bo!

342
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,700
Eun Bo!

343
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,260
Raise the sail!

344
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,570
I think it was that ship.

345
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,110
Let's go back now, Your Highness.

346
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,270
She already left.

347
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,040
You can't prepare for the future

348
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,130
if you let bygones be bygones.

349
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,750
I appreciate your concern,

350
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,820
but I'm planning not
to forget anything.

351
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,000
Chief Eunuch Hwang.

352
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

353
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:10,560
I need to return Left State Minister
the favor for the antlers.

354
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,380
What do you think would be good?

355
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,590
For returning the favor,
Your Majesty?

356
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,070
I think...

357
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,570
Right, how about the
taffies from Ulleungdo?

358
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,050
They're very delicious.

359
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,900
Try some.

360
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,940
I thought it might be the Kim family.

361
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,150
If the leader of the gunmen who killed
my sister were a hunter...

362
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,280
The Kim family manages hunters.

363
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,750
Things were bad with
Kim Man Chan back then too.

364
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,130
It's really true that the King

365
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,700
did that to Father, right?

366
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,390
Yes.

367
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,170
By chance...

368
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:08,740
did the King kill my sister too?

369
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,760
If so...

370
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,330
why did he commission
Buyong Agency to catch the gunman?

371
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,910
For what reason?

372
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,830
I mean...

373
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,230
What kind of person is
the king anyway?

374
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,820
He might've wanted to find him
and get rid of any evidence.

375
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,190
If the King was behind it.

376
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,410
I don't trust the king.

377
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,950
I can't trust him any longer.

378
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,780
The King killed your father.

379
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,000
But...

380
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,480
don't do anything without confirmation.

381
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,330
Don't be so sure about anyone.

382
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,110
Do you understand?

383
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,840
Chief Eunuch Hwang.

384
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

385
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,730
Kim Man Chan and
Jo Heung Gyeon.

386
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,570
Who do you think is the
culprit between them?

387
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,580
I think it's both...

388
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,590
Who do you think it was,
Your Majesty?

389
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,080
I already chose one.

390
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,920
But that's just my belief.

391
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,160
I need to meet with the
owner of the Buyong Agency.

392
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,320
Han Mo, why don't you go there?

393
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

394
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,720
What?

395
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,980
- What is it?
- Be quiet!

396
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,890
Someone came to the shaman house.

397
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,790
Didn't you say only the
King knows where it is?

398
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,150
Here.

399
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,460
It's a message saying he'll be
there at 9 p.m. tomorrow.

400
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,540
What will you do?

401
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,880
Will you avoid him?

402
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,630
I'm sorry.

403
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,830
I couldn't be here on our appointed
day due to an urgent matter.

404
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,850
Did you find any lead?

405
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,510
- Were you not able to?
- Why are you looking for him?

406
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,550
He's a criminal being
chased by the royal palace.

407
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,190
Why do you want to
find him personally?

408
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,650
Will you hand him over
to the jurisdiction?

409
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,740
Or are you trying to kill him?

410
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,560
You want me to answer
that question now?

411
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,400
- If you can.
- How presumptuous.

412
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,760
I'm not asking you who you are,
yet you want to know my goal?

413
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,500
- You broke your promise first.
- I already apologized.

414
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,520
I waited for you to keep your word.

415
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,050
Twice.

416
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,300
But I got this letter a long time ago.

417
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,510
Why haven't I heard from you yet?

418
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,840
Twice?

419
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,710
What do you mean?

420
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,640
I asked you what you meant.

421
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,750
Don't do anything
without confirmation.

422
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,800
Answer me!

423
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,140
I meant you can't break your promise

424
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,770
since this is risky for me too.

425
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,250
I'm sorry if I upset you.

426
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,370
Is it correct that you're
looking for one person?

427
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,970
Did you find something?

428
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,290
No.

429
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,170
I was just confirming.

430
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,520
Please give me another chance.

431
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,950
I'm in your care.

432
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,360
This is more important
than anything to me.

433
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,270
Why didn't you kill him?

434
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,140
Did you leave that there?

435
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,820
Did you hold back or get scared?

436
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,420
It's neither.

437
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,910
I just need to find out...

438
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,480
if the culprit is indeed the king

439
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,360
or someone else.

440
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,210
The thugs told me last time

441
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,090
that there's an address
book for hunters.

442
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,800
So do you have the
right information?

443
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,630
Are you sure he's a hunter?

444
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,160
It wasn't just that information.

445
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,800
Don't you remember
what Mr. Wang said?

446
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,330
He said it's someone who is
used to using a matchlock.

447
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,230
The ones who were after us
didn't seem ordinary either.

448
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,340
That's true.

449
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,480
The hunters around here

450
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,990
apparently let themselves
known to the brokers.

451
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,520
But the security is tight
at their agency.

452
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,810
It won't be easy to find
that address book.

453
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,100
Find an officer at the
Police Bureau who takes bribes.

454
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,600
An officer?

455
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,140
What are you plotting now?

456
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,710
I told you that I need to know.

457
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,970
For his achievement in arresting
the prisoner who escaped,

458
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,590
I appoint Kim Hong Sik, the
manager of the Inspection Bureau

459
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,930
as the head of the Inspection Bureau.

460
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,230
The Kim family got another
person in power.

461
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,390
They must be making
a fuss about it.

462
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,200
[ Great Royal Dowager Queen Min ]

463
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,050
What brings you here, by the way?

464
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:51,580
I regret to inform you,

465
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,170
but there's a horrible
rumor in the marketplace.

466
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,100
A rumor?

467
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,640
It's apparently a horrible rumor

468
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,440
regarding His Majesty.

469
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,410
What do you mean, a horrible rumor?

470
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,200
They call him a goblin
and a fox with nine tails.

471
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,860
My apologies.

472
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,380
The royal weddings calm citizens
through beautiful ceremonies.

473
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,440
That's what they're known for.

474
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,440
I think it'd be a useful way to control
the confusion among the people.

475
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,820
You mean the king's wedding?

476
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,150
Yes, Your Highness.

477
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,410
Maybe you should choose
between the two young ladies

478
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,790
who didn't make the selection
and make her the queen.

479
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,620
Two young ladies.

480
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,140
The Chief State Minister's
niece and your daughter, correct?

481
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,280
Yes.

482
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,140
Those two would be the ones.

483
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,660
He thinks his daughter
would be in advantage

484
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,320
since he thinks I'm
watchful of the Kim family.

485
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,670
Your Highness.

486
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,370
Did you look into it?

487
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,500
Yes.

488
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,800
I think he was right about the rumors.

489
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,940
Call the shaman priestess.

490
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,560
I communicated with the
spirit as you ordered.

491
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,030
Since the wedding has
already been cursed,

492
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,290
it'd be a good idea to make
a whole new selection.

493
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,160
Are you sure?

494
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,480
Your Highness.

495
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,880
How could we make a selection
with a priestess' order?

496
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,820
She couldn't even predict the
tragedy His Majesty experienced.

497
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,760
It'd make more sense to
punish her instead.

498
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,260
We're talking about the royal wedding.

499
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,380
You should discuss it with the
ministers who deal with politics.

500
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,870
You should summon the
Chief State Minister.

501
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,780
I still have control over matters
concerning the ladies of the royal family.

502
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,590
You don't need to let it be known

503
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:16,390
that your surname is
Kim, Queen Mother.

504
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,100
It's not like that...

505
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,330
It was also the Royal Shaman
Temple that resurrected the king.

506
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,440
Please pray with a devotion
that it will not be cursed.

507
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,190
Queen Mother isn't entirely wrong.

508
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,740
There shouldn't be another
mistake second time around.

509
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,210
Yes, Your Highness.

510
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,320
For how long do you think the
Queen Dowager will defend you?

511
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,070
You and the Royal Shaman Temple
will fall apart like autumn leaves.

512
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,420
So wait until...

513
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,360
that finally happens.

514
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,210
Your Highness.

515
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,800
I'm just...

516
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,380
here to relay the
messages of the spirit.

517
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,600
Do you really think

518
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,400
His Majesty would be happy to
hear those messages?

519
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,170
I don't want to!

520
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,440
King.

521
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,890
Another selection?

522
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,890
It hasn't been that long
since the queen passed!

523
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,600
You should suppress
your personal feelings.

524
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,100
This selection will be necessary to

525
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,600
calm people down.

526
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,980
Did you call them personal feelings?

527
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,060
I haven't even found the
trace of the culprit!

528
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,360
Someone else's life may be
at stake like the queen and me!

529
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,900
We have to make sure
that doesn't happen.

530
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,150
If they have guns,
we can have guns too.

531
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,370
If they have gunmen,

532
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:05,050
we can have something a lot greater.

533
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,370
I'll no longer meddle after
this selection is over.

534
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,540
So please select a queen
and calm people down.

535
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,740
King, you're the father
of this entire nation.

536
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,010
King, you're the father
of this entire nation.

537
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:44,560
Please become the salt
of the earth to the people

538
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,260
just like how Buddha was.

539
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,790
Bring me all the entry records
regarding Supyo Bridge.

540
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

541
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,870
Go in and look for Officer Jang.

542
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,590
He's always sitting
around the gambling house.

543
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,730
You'll recognize him easily.

544
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,920
Be careful.

545
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,350
Mind your own business.

546
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,200
How ungrateful...

547
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,200
I heard the rumor.

548
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,400
That you generously
do favors for people.

549
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,820
I can't let the rumors spread.

550
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,660
So what will you ask me to do?

551
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,540
Please accompany
me to a burglary.

552
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,800
What?

553
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,500
We're here for an inspection!

554
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,710
Kneel right now.

555
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,850
Kneel right now!

556
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,390
What are you doing?

557
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,620
Huh?

558
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,550
What are you doing?

559
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,370
What's this about?

560
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,830
Is this everyone?

561
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,440
What's going on, Officer?

562
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,060
You don't know what this place is.

563
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,620
What's this place?

564
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,410
Do you really not know?

565
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,160
This is the Chief State
Minister's residence.

566
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,980
What's this fuss about?

567
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,050
What do you want?

568
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,050
[ Address book for hunters ]

569
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,120
An inspection?

570
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,840
Don't you know?

571
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,470
This is Kim's residence, where
you can't even mess with a servant.

572
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,400
Even the king is afraid of us.

573
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,070
I'm lenient only once.

574
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:03,300
His Excellency can't stand it
when people touch his things.

575
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,060
Next time, he'll hang you in the
backyard of the Police Bureau

576
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,060
and beat you like dogs.

577
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,140
Beat it if you heard me.

578
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,100
You can leave now.

579
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,980
What a nice pear.

580
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,420
Do you want one?

581
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,810
If I knew this was Kim's house,

582
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,310
I wouldn't have done this
for a pretty penny.

583
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,500
How dare you try to
rob Kim's house?

584
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,560
I should beat you to
death, you punk.

585
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,360
- Beat him up!
- Yes, sir.

586
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,240
Hurry up!

587
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,090
Catch him!

588
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,290
Are you okay?

589
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,290
By the way...

590
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,200
Well, the thing is...

591
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,150
Ouch! What's wrong with me?

592
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:11,300
I think I sprained my leg!

593
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,830
- Are you okay?
- I'm not okay!

594
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,450
You'd better return the favor.

595
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,120
- Ouch...
- Pardon?

596
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,520
Could you take me to my house?

597
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,580
- Ouch!
- Let's go.

598
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:35,400
Ouch...

599
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,890
Thank you so much...

600
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,110
I'm sorry that you got injured.

601
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,500
Will you leave looking like that?

602
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,730
This is Kim's residence where you
can't even mess with a servant.

603
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:19,570
Even the king is afraid of us.

604
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,720
Could you give me different clothes?

605
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,420
Hold on a second!

606
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,900
I thought he hurt himself.

607
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,310
Come have a seat here.

608
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:30,780
Was it those bastards from earlier?

609
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,310
May I ask you why...

610
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,080
you're always...

611
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,870
in danger whenever I see you?

612
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:51,060
No, please don't ask.

613
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,690
I appreciate your help.
If you want to be compensated,

614
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:56,950
please let me know.

615
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,620
- I'll walk you home...
- No.

616
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,110
I'll go on my own.

617
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,780
Those clothes...

618
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,510
Those clothes are...

619
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,860
my servant lady's favorite.

620
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:13,370
She only wears them when
the street market opens.

621
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,030
So...

622
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:18,430
I need you to return them.

623
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:19,680
Please.

624
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,350
I will.

625
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,790
And she walks away just like that.

626
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,040
Why does she look so lovely...

627
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,530
I'm establishing the
Royal Wedding Bureau.

628
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,150
Your Majesty,

629
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,170
why don't you choose
among the two young women

630
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,540
who didn't make the last selection?

631
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,870
The whole world already knows
that the wedding was cursed.

632
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,500
It'd make sense to
start a new selection.

633
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,040
What do you think, Your Majesty?

634
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,760
Who would submit an application

635
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,760
after what happened last time?

636
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,170
Your Majesty.

637
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:15,540
- If so...
- I'm also afraid.

638
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,300
If I bring in a queen and
keep her by my side,

639
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,280
I'm afraid they'd point
a gun at me again.

640
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,160
I'm afraid they'd show up
at my bedchamber with guns.

641
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:29,190
I can't sleep because I'm so anxious.

642
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,500
Ministers, please protect me.

643
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,350
Of course, we will.

644
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,420
We'll do our best

645
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,170
to fulfill our duty, Your Majesty.

646
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:45,550
- Do you mean it?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

647
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,710
Please don't worry, Your Majesty.

648
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,400
Please don't worry, Your Majesty.

649
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:57,700
If so...

650
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,560
I'm going to need...

651
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,920
soldiers to protect me
in emergency situations.

652
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,500
I'll recruit low-class citizens
and slaves on the streets.

653
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,720
I want the royal bureau to
train, educate them

654
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,980
and make them my security guards.

655
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,690
Low-class citizens and slaves?

656
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,450
That's not all.

657
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,890
To become security
guards for the king,

658
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:32,110
they should be given
the authority to use

659
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,380
all kinds of guns and
modern weapons.

660
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,960
Your Majesty!

661
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,260
It is utterly unreasonable!

662
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,400
Security guards consisted
of lowly citizens?

663
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,990
Have them provide
security for Your Majesty?

664
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,280
This is unheard of!

665
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,520
Has a king ever at gunpoint

666
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:50,230
in the history of this country?

667
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:56,060
You're right, Your Majesty.

668
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,820
I'm also very worried

669
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,730
for the same reason as Your Majesty.

670
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:04,240
Even if we announce the selection,

671
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,820
no one will want to
present their daughters

672
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,740
and be disloyal to His Majesty.

673
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,280
That's what I'm afraid of.

674
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,190
If so...

675
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,140
how about this?

676
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,300
I'll give the future queen's
family the military rights.

677
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,090
I see that no one is opposed to it.

678
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,450
Rush the procedure for establishing

679
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,060
a new royal bureau.

680
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:44,000
The Great Royal Dowager
Queen is here.

681
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,950
You'll give the new queen's
family the military rights?

682
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,190
There will be a war.

683
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:54,690
Yes.

684
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,580
And those people would harm
each other in that war.

685
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:01,460
If so, I'll lead my army and
walk through corpses

686
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,620
to tie up the ones with guns.

687
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,530
Sir.

688
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,700
Come in.

689
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,640
Well...

690
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,690
I'd like to know how Mother's doing.

691
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:30,610
All right, I'll look into it.

692
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,650
- Is he here?
- Not yet.

693
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:12,980
I heard you were getting new guns.

694
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,460
This one's pretty nice.

695
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,380
You came, sir.

696
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,660
You almost took over
the throne very easily.

697
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,040
I lost the opportunity easily
since I got it so easily.

698
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,900
Because of that...

699
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,580
we lost His Excellency
Kang Yi Soo as well.

700
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,300
By the way...

701
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,170
I heard he left a daughter behind.

702
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:43,660
Yes, she's under my care.

703
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,090
Since she lost her father,

704
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,670
she must be blaming
the king by now.

705
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,380
Keep an eye on her.

706
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,440
I'm sure she'd come in handy.

707
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,000
Do you mean the girl?

708
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,860
His Excellency.

709
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,750
There's a new notice in the market.

710
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,900
[ Bongdanryung: an order to submit
applications for the queen selection ]

711
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,460
[ Geumhonryung: an order prohibiting marriage ]
What does this all mean?

712
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,600
So it says...

713
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,130
there will be a selection
for the queen,

714
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,590
and the aristocrat should
submit bridal applications.

715
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,500
What?

716
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,290
Does it mean the king is remarrying?

717
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,500
Father!

718
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,240
I don't want to, Father!

719
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,300
- I don't want to die.
- What?

720
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,600
The king will give the queen's
family the military rights.

721
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,100
You might not die.

722
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,530
Saying I might not die

723
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:40,400
also means I might die!

724
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,700
I mean, seriously!

725
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,900
Why don't you just become a monk?

726
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,380
Father!

727
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,760
You're so lovely and
bring good fortune.

728
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,860
I'm sure you'd become the queen!

729
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:57,220
If you become the queen,

730
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,320
you and I won't live out our lives.

731
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,530
I'll manage to handle it!

732
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,310
It'd be fun to look at the palace

733
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,940
and visit Hanyang as well.

734
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,420
I'll make sure to come back safely.

735
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,200
Please don't worry!

736
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,220
But I can't help but worry!

737
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,780
I shouldn't have given birth
to such a pretty girl.

738
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,720
Geez...

739
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,990
You remember her, right?

740
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:49,960
She's my daughter, Hyungnim.

741
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,010
Since the last selection,

742
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:57,620
wasn't there a discussion of her marriage
with the Right State Minister's family?

743
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,770
Well, the thing is...

744
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:02,460
I broke the engagement
because I wasn't satisfied.

745
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,970
I realized that the power of Kim family
allowed my foolish and naive cousin

746
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:09,790
to make it to the last
round of the selection.

747
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,000
Therefore, since I'm
clever and cunning,

748
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,300
I could easily become the queen
with Kim family background.

749
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,010
Please choose me.

750
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,710
That's what you need to do.

751
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,380
Did you say your name is Song Yi?

752
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,380
Yes, Uncle.

753
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:38,620
I really want to become the
King's woman this time.

754
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,040
Father.

755
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,210
Please make that happen.

756
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:00,700
Our current military strength plus
the military rights for the queen

757
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,020
would mean a huge
opportunity for us.

758
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:06,190
But we don't have
a young lady to nominate.

759
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:10,780
As you know, my daughter is
under treatment due to her illness.

760
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,300
There is one. Kang Yi Soo's daughter.

761
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,640
The dead queen's twin sister.

762
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,740
Pardon?

763
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,580
What do you mean, a twin sister?

764
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,810
[ Lee Bong Woo, Kim Il Hae, Song Ki Beom,
Kim Il Son, Shin Il Beom, Heo Man Gyeon ]

765
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:27,930
Is this all you got from the
address book for hunters?

766
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:30,730
You only memorized a few names.

767
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,610
What will you do with that?

768
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,260
I need to take anything I can get.

769
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,860
Forget it!

770
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,660
The ones without any
power and connection

771
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,530
always end up getting caught!

772
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:42,800
Just take this opportunity
and give up on everything!

773
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,760
You must have something in
possession to take revenge!

774
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,980
What? What are you
looking at? What?

775
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,450
You almost died trying to look
at that address book!

776
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,270
- Seriously!
- What?

777
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,240
This thing right here. I remember...

778
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,680
The owner of this stuff
who saved your life twice.

779
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,420
What does he do anyway?

780
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,570
I'm asking, what does he do?

781
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,280
How is her twin alive?

782
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,780
There was a prophecy.

783
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,420
[ Eulminyeon Bangassangchul
Hangyeokse ]

784
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:14,090
The world will change because of the
aristocrat-born twins that were born in 1895.

785
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:17,220
They cracked down on
all the aristocrat families.

786
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,340
But how...

787
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,610
Avoiding the crackdown,

788
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,730
Kang Yi Soo managed
to hide that girl.

789
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,170
That makes no sense.

790
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,000
It's impossible if she's a twin.

791
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,720
How will we fool the royal family

792
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,440
and how about those
who saw the queen's face?

793
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,200
That's too reckless.

794
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,900
I understand that it's reckless.

795
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,500
Will you still do it?

796
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,610
There's no guarantee that
she'll become the queen.

797
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:49,040
I'm thinking of making Eun Bo
pretend to be the dead queen.

798
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,690
- Pardon?
- What if the queen who revived

799
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,480
applied to the selection
using a different name?

800
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,010
There's no way the culprit
wouldn't notice it

801
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,390
even if she's a different person.

802
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,180
He'd be in shock.

803
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,890
And he'd go after her
trying to kill her.

804
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:05,670
The Queen Dowager wants to find
the culprit more than anyone.

805
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:07,730
I'm thinking of persuading her

806
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:10,600
to make her the queen and catch
the culprit coming after her.

807
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,120
His Excellency.

808
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,480
It's way too dangerous.

809
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,570
How will you persuade her
to do such a thing?

810
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,610
By chance...

811
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:30,030
is the owner of these clothes
the owner of this house?

812
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,910
Wow.

813
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,950
Can't believe there's a house that

814
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:38,430
Buyong Agency hasn't
learned about in Hanyang yet.

815
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:40,620
- Is anyone there?
- Is this a new house?

816
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:45,840
Aigoo, aren't you that young lady?

817
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,110
- Yes.
- Wow.

818
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:49,540
Hello, pretty lady.

819

Pretty lady?

820
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,440
Who's the owner of this house?

821
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,050
What do you mean, who owns it?

822
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,500
It's that prince who
almost became the new king.

823
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,700
King?

824
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,350
Prince...

825
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,240
Please go in. Please go in.

826
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:13,240
She's coming.

827
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,720
She's not coming.

828
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,100
She's coming.

829
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,650
She's not coming.

830
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:29,450
Why does he do that with
flowers every day?

831
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:32,250
His Excellency!

832
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,800
- Please go in.
- Yes.

833
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,500
My lady!

834
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:44,340
This always ended up with
"she's not coming."

835
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,730
I knew I shouldn't believe
in such a thing.

836
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:50,380
I'm keeping my promise.

837
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:56,010
By the way, who's he...

838
01:00:58,110 --> 01:00:59,740
Well...

839
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:03,860
I heard my lady owes
you a huge favor.

840
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:07,260
My lady?

841
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,710
If so...

842
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:12,050
She's the lady whom I work for.

843
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:14,820
Isn't that true, my lady?

844
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,580
"My lady..."

845
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,540
Were you an aristocratic lady?

846
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:20,980
From which family?

847
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:23,050
The thing is...

848
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,340
The thing is...

849
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:32,070
The prince almost became the king

850
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:35,390
and the dead queen's sister?

851
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:47,340
My lady owes you so much.

852
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,300
Aigoo, not at all.

853
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,700
Feel free to come by any time.

854
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,100
Any time, you said?

855
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,800
Pardon? Yes, of course.

856
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,230
We'll be on our way then.

857
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:04,940
Yes, let's make sure to meet again.

858
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,860
Yes, I'll see you again, sir.

859
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:18,470
What did you do? "My lady?"

860
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,380
By the way...

861
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:23,210
are you comfortable at
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong?

862
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:23,910
What?

863
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:27,130
I don't even have a small
room to stretch my legs in.

864
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:30,100
But I was wondering if you're
comfortable there.

865
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,930
I think I'll go there often
since he told me to.

866
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:41,040
Or maybe I'll stay there permanently.

867
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,450
- Are you crazy?
- Come on!

868
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:45,750
I haven't finished talking yet.

869
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,730
I'm not saying that for myself, but...

870
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,340
Stop kidding me.
Don't you think I know you?

871
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,330
You run like a dog
when you see food...

872
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,270
That's right!

873
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:54,730
That's right! That's why
my name is Wal. But...

874
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:58,190
it's stupid not to pursue
it, you stupid.

875
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:01,930
If you want to chase the culprit
without any power or connection,

876
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,500
take advantage of someone...

877
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:06,390
You should get help from someone.

878
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:07,970
He's apparently a prince!

879
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:09,990
Although he doesn't look like one.

880
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:16,160
Hey, why are you acting as
if you have any conscience?

881
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,860
Must you taste it to tell
whether it's poop or chocolate?

882
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:21,400
You should be taking
advantage of God if necessary.

883
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,000
Geez!

884
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,600
Let's go, my lady.

885
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,300
- Stop that.
- Be quiet!

886
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,700
Let's go, my lady.

887
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:35,790
What did you want to talk
to me so urgently about,

888
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,570
His Excellency?

889
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:40,100
I don't believe in talent.

890
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:42,700
But I believe in manpower.

891
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:46,160
You need to keep the
Queen Dowager's trust.

892
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,520
If she doesn't favor you anymore,

893
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,230
she'll learn about the fate of the
Royal Shaman Temple.

894
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:01,570
What are you talking
about right now?

895
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:04,760
It looks like we can help
each other out.

896
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,800
Participate in the selection as the daughter
of Hong Ki Ho, the governor of Gyeonggi.

897
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:19,480
I'm telling you to become the queen.

898
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,720
What are you talking
about right now?

899
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:27,290
You said you'd take revenge for
your father and sister.

900
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:29,190
I said I'll kill the culprit.

901
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:31,630
I never said I'd become the queen.

902
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:33,650
I'll pretend that I didn't hear it.

903
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:35,910
You need power.

904
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:38,280
So that you can take revenge on

905
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,780
the king, the Kim family, or anyone.

906
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,990
What is it that you can do now?

907
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:46,020
Is there anything?

908
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,550
I still don't want to.

909
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,040
I won't!

910
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,790
Did you say you'd kill him?

911
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,410
Would that be the end of it?

912
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,610
Don't even bother if
that's all there is.

913
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:56,780
Get to a position where
you can fight them.

914
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:59,750
Get to the highest position
you can and destroy them.

915
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,100
Make everyone beg for
your forgiveness.

916
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:07,080
Think about your mother.

917
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,610
She's still within Hanyang.

918
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:15,060
I think she became a servant.

919
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:40,070
Mother...

920
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:48,870
Mother.

921
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:01,070
Geez!

922
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:04,580
You can't even carry a water jug!

923
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:07,640
What are you standing
there for? Clean up!

924
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:13,390
Mother...

925
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:23,280
Clean up before you
get us into trouble!

926
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:57,540
I'm telling you to become the queen.

927
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:59,880
Get to a position where
you can fight them.

928
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,880
Get to the highest position
you can and destroy them.

929
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,440
Make everyone beg for
your forgiveness.

930
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:25,920
Your Majesty, it's cold out here.

931
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,780
Please go inside.

932
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:42,900
You said...

933
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:46,440
I look just like the
dead queen, right?

934
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,420
But how could I become
the queen with this face?

935
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:52,880
Of course, it won't be easy.

936
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,800
But there are consequences
for risking your life.

937
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,380
That means you might
have to die for it.

938
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,580
I want to destroy the
person who did that to

939
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,840
my sister, father, and mother.

940
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,190
Would I really be able to do that?

941
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,840
What if I said you could?

942
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,530
Will you do it?

943
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:21,500
Yes.

944
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,290
I'll do it.

945
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,760
I'll become the queen.

946
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:56,560
♫ Please don't cry in sadness ♫

947
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,110
[ Queen: Love and War ]

948
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,730
The gunman is a hunter.

949
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:01,640
If so...

950
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,310
He technically belongs
to the Kim family.

951
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:04,990
Hunting with the selection
around the corner?

952
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:07,180
There's something I want to hunt.

953
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,900
The queen is alive?

954
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,660
It was the queen!
Didn't you see her?

955
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,020
She was definitely the queen!

956
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,470
Did you say you'll
participate in the selection?

957
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:16,240
I want to find the man
who pointed a gun at me

958
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,390
and destroyed everything.

959
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:18,910
I need to tell Father.

960
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:21,040
How could she be
alive and be here?

961
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,660
I made up my mind thanks to you.

962
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:27,000
Make sure she stands with us
and send her to the king.
