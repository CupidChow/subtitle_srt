1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,070
[ Queen: Love and War ]

2
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,430
No!

3
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,700
Shoot him!

4
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,640
Capture him!

5
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,640
Yeo Wool.

6
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,870
Yeo Wool, stay with me!

7
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,380
I'm glad you're okay, My Lady.

8
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,200
Stop talking.

9
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,500
- It's hurting you more.
- My Lady.

10
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,140
I'm so sorry and...

11
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,280
grateful for everything.

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,050
No!

13
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,010
Yeo Wool! Yeo Wool!

14
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,970
Yeo Wool.

15
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,430
Yeo Wool...

16
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,480
Yeo Wool!

17
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,440
My Lady, are you all right?

18
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,780
Take him away.

19
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,220
Son of a b****.

20
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,780
Since he got arrested,

21
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,760
everything will get revealed soon.

22
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,770
That palace lady

23
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,210
was a girl named Yeo Wool.

24
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,510
Everything will get revealed including

25
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,870
who was behind the killing of Yeo Wool

26
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,840
and who planned all of this.

27
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,300
Why are you telling me this?

28
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,060
I wanted you to know.

29
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,230
That the culprit will
definitely get caught.

30
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,680
Your Highness, you must
go back to the palace.

31
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,240
- Escort her.
- Yes.

32
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,270
Escort Her Royal Highness.

33
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,520
We'll prepare a litter and
a cart to move the body.

34
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,800
Please wait here for a moment.

35
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,730
Byeol.

36
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,150
Bring Father to me as soon
as we enter the palace.

37
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,570
From what I heard,

38
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,350
the ministers leave the palace
earlier since it's winter.

39
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,650
He must've gone home by now.

40
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,760
What?

41
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,250
No.

42
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,360
I need to see Father.

43
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,190
Stop the litter for a second.

44
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,210
Stop for a second!

45
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,460
What's the matter, Your Highness?

46
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,970
I have travel sickness.

47
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,410
What's the matter now?

48
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,540
I don't feel well from the shock.

49
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,350
My parents' residence is close
from here. Take me there for now.

50
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,740
That cannot be done, Your Highness.

51
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,920
I am saying I need to take a rest!

52
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,530
But there was an incident.

53
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,700
You must return to the palace.

54
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,100
Are you ignoring what
I said right now?

55
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,570
I, the Queen, need to go to
my parents' residence now!

56
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,900
Change the direction immediately!

57
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,840
Your Majesty.

58
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,460
Her Highness the Queen
changed the direction

59
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,220
and went to her parents' residence.

60
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,200
What should I do?

61
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,430
You should head over there.

62
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,690
Your Majesty.

63
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,690
I will escort her to her chamber.

64
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,520
Thank you.

65
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,740
Please come with me.

66
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,670
Do you know what you have ruined?

67
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,770
Father.

68
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,620
The world was about
to become mine.

69
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,050
If only the prince were born,

70
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,670
this whole Joseon was
about to be under my feet!

71
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,770
You should've protected the
Queen's Palace quietly until then!

72
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,090
I told you to only focus
on producing the prince!

73
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,350
Why...

74
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,180
Why did you do
something so reckless?

75
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,770
How about you then?

76
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,700
Why did you try to kill His Majesty?

77
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,600
If only you didn't do such a thing,

78
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,060
I wouldn't have gone this far...

79
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,790
Are you saying you did
a good thing then?

80
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,000
If only you didn't
behave so recklessly,

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,990
it would've gone unnoticed!

82
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,110
If so...

83
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,720
If so, what should I do, Father?

84
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,950
What should I do now, Father?

85
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,430
Say that it is to protect
the Queen and

86
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,590
send soldiers to
Jo Heung Gyeon's residence now.

87
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,410
Pardon?

88
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,420
They will arrest the Queen
and Jo Heung Gyeon

89
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,530
when Gae Pyeong confesses
whom he works for.

90
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

91
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,180
Make Hong Ki Ho
interrogate Gae Pyeong.

92
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,660
We must reveal the truth.

93
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,590
Stop!

94
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,650
What a stubborn bastard.

95
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,580
I asked you why you tried to
assassinate Consort Hong.

96
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,550
Who made you do it?

97
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,330
Do you think things would get covered
up if you keep your mouth shut?

98
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,140
The rifle you were holding,

99
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,840
and the poisonous needle found
from the officer you colluded with.

100
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,410
That is the evidence that the person

101
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,970
behind this is the same person who
planned the assassination.

102
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,520
This case will not end with you.

103
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,960
So you'd better confess
every single thing.

104
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,590
- Guard!
- Yes.

105
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,640
Bring the officer who
colluded with this criminal!

106
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,620
Yes.

107
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,480
I need to know what is going on first.

108
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,030
Disguise yourself and visit the
officer named Kim Yong Ho

109
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,030
and find out what happened
to Gae Pyeong discreetly.

110
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,220
Yes, sir.

111
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,500
His Excellency! His Excellency!

112
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,310
What's going on?

113
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,400
The royal guards are surrounding
the house outside right now

114
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,450
in order to protect Her Highness!

115
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,650
What?

116
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,680
Have the Queen return
to the palace right now.

117
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,340
I heard there was an incident.

118
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,090
It is dangerous to leave
her at her residence.

119
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,620
King!

120
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,540
Grandmother.

121
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,680
Jo Heung Gyeon is

122
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,820
the one who was
behind the assassination.

123
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,660
What are you talking about?

124
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,100
The culprit who got
arrested from this incident

125
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,130
is one of Jo Heung Gyeon's men.

126
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,750
And the Queen planned to get
rid of Consort Hong using him.

127
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,850
Is that...

128
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,210
really true?

129
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,380
Was it...

130
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,800
really Jo Heung Gyeon?

131
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,780
Does that mean...

132
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,840
we brought in that
horrible criminal's daughter

133
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,070
as the queen in the palace?

134
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,410
Grandmother.

135
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,650
Is anyone out there?

136
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,170
Your Highness!

137
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,410
Are you all right, Your Highness?

138
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,960
How could it be...

139
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,360
Your Excellency!

140
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,650
I do not know anything...

141
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,070
I just did what I was told.

142
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,330
I'm telling the truth.

143
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,420
- Tie him up!
- Yes!

144
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,990
Please let me live!

145
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,840
Please let me live, Your Excellency!

146
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,910
Please let me...

147
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,470
I'm a servant of this house.

148
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,030
I'm coming back from
an errand for His Excellency.

149
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,910
What did you just say?

150
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,030
Even the officer already
got arrested?

151
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,510
Yes, they found out that he's a spy.

152
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,700
He's being interrogated right now.

153
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,410
How could everything...

154
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,800
How could everything get revealed

155
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,200
all at once like this?

156
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,530
It's all over.

157
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,290
What do you mean, over?

158
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,870
What is?

159
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,100
Gae Peyong said he'll never confess.

160
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,640
He said he'd rather bite
his tongue and die.

161
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,040
Gae Pyeong isn't the problem.

162
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,110
The spy at the Royal
Investigation Bureau got caught.

163
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,620
It's only a matter of time until
he mentions my name

164
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,220
after being tortured.

165
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,050
What do you mean,
the spy got caught?

166
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,630
Was there a spy?

167
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,310
- Pack the things you need.
- Father!

168
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,020
We must leave this
house immediately.

169
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,000
What are you talking about?

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,400
The royal guards are
surrounding the house outside.

171
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,510
What will you do?

172
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,120
We need to use Byeol.

173
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,370
The only person who can leave
the house without looking suspicious

174
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,410
is probably her.

175
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,230
There still is no update from
the interrogation area.

176
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,740
What is it?

177
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,200
Consort Hong has not
been moving at all.

178
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,900
I called her several times,
but she would not answer.

179
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,070
I think she is in a serious shock.

180
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,150
My Lady!

181
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,570
His Majesty is here.

182
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,090
You may put it there and leave.

183
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,190
She said she is sorry

184
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,220
and grateful before she died.

185
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,840
But I have not

186
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,460
done anything for her.

187
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,240
She returned the favor
to her old master

188
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,460
Baek Ja Yong and to you
since she felt guilty.

189
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,240
Why...

190
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,720
Why did Yeo Wool have to die?

191
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,600
She was just a young girl.

192
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,650
She was sweet and innocent.

193
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,950
She had many more days ahead

194
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,400
than the number of days
she had lived.

195
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,320
It is all right.

196
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,480
What is it?

197
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,110
Her Highness the Queen
is feeling ill.

198
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,360
I think I should visit a physician.

199
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,680
- Accompany her.
- Yes.

200
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,000
Tell me whom you
work for right now!

201
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,820
I will tell you.

202
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,870
I will tell you everything.

203
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,130
Stop.

204
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,330
Tell me.

205
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,360
So the thing is...

206
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,780
Shut up!

207
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,840
If I told you, could you...

208
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,680
could you let me live?

209
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,300
- You bastard!
- Stop!

210
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,820
Gag him right now!

211
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,730
Yes!

212
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,020
Let go. Let go!

213
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,040
Let go!

214
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,490
Where's the training officer?

215
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,750
His Excellency Jo Heung Gyeon
urgently sent a message.

216
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,540
I'll reduce the sentence
if you confess.

217
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,840
Tell me whom you work for.

218
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,800
You must keep that promise.

219
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,730
Whom do you work for?

220
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,410
It's the...

221
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,920
The left state minister,

222
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,000
Jo Heung Gyeon.

223
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,910
His Majesty ordered us

224
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,360
to capture the culprit as soon
as we get the confession.

225
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,580
Capture the criminal,
Jo Heung Gyeon, immediately!

226
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Yes!

227
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,040
Bring out the criminal,
Jo Heung Gyeon!

228
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,330
Yes!

229
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,560
You bastards!

230
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,450
What are you doing right now?

231
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,030
We were told to bring
Jo Heung Gyeon

232
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,770
to the Royal Investigation
Bureau for attempting to

233
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,490
assassinate His Majesty.

234
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,710
What are you doing?

235
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,020
- Arrest the criminal immediately!
- Yes!

236
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,440
Father.

237
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,210
Protect Her Highness
and His Excellency!

238
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,250
Yes!

239
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,280
Geez!

240
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,340
Let's go.

241
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,630
They're running away!
They're running away!

242
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,790
The culprit is running away.

243
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,430
Don't lose him!

244
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,600
Let's hurry up.

245
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,950
Hop on.

246
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,310
Your Highness, hurry up and hop on.

247
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,240
What are you doing? Hurry up!

248
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,760
Your Highness, hurry!

249
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,920
Come on!

250
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,330
We must arrest him.

251
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,950
I will dethrone the queen
as soon as the day breaks.

252
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,400
Release the composite sketches of them
and conduct a nationwide search.

253
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

254
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,430
Sir, are you in there?

255
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,260
What are you doing here?

256
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,210
Are you here to be
my drinking buddy?

257
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,650
Okay.

258
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,640
I ran out of alcohol.
Let's go out together and...

259
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,670
I said, let's go. Why...

260
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,710
Hanyang is in chaos right now.

261
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,440
Jo Heung Gyeon's family is
being chased for treason.

262
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,650
What are you talking about?

263
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,690
My Lady.

264
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,740
The tea is getting cold.

265
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,740
It's supposed to be very
calming. Please try some.

266
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,880
I'm not interested.

267
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,430
Please take it back.

268
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,600
Pardon?

269
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,750
Yes.

270
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,520
His Excellency Baek Ja Yong...

271
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,020
ended up committing suicide.

272
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,140
I'm so sorry and...

273
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,580
Yeo Wool, stay with me!

274
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,390
I'm grateful for everything.

275
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,020
Unni!

276
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,200
No!

277
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,400
I'm just happy that I found you.

278
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,800
If you're put into danger too,

279
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,580
I won't be able to live.

280
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,840
The traitors took over
the Queen's Palace

281
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,970
and acted proudly for
being the Queen's father?

282
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,760
How does that make sense?

283
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,280
Please calm down, Your Highness.

284
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,500
- The traitors will get caught soon.
- By the way,

285
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,400
since the Queen's Palace is empty,
will there be another selection?

286
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,500
He probably won't order
another selection.

287
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Now that we're in this situation,

288
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,680
I think he'll probably try to put
Consort Hong in that spot.

289
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,280
What do you mean, Consort Hong?

290
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,800
That cannot be.

291
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,830
We must stop that from
happening no matter what.

292
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,600
Yes, we will stop that somehow.

293
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,060
My apologies.

294
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,300
I think she's very upset since
the palace lady she cherished died.

295
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,450
Consort Hong stopped
eating anything.

296
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,010
So?

297
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,450
You still couldn't feed
her the motherwort?

298
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,650
No, My Lady.

299
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,530
Forget about that for now.

300
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,610
Take over that palace lady named
Yeo Wool's role from now on.

301
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,460
Pardon?

302
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,750
She will probably start looking
for a new palace lady.

303
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,550
I'm telling you to be
friendly and attentive.

304
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,690
Start doing all the chores
for Consort Hong.

305
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,290
And...

306
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,300
report to me every little detail.

307
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,880
Understand?

308
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,150
Yes, My Lady.

309
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,290
I need to have the upper
hand no matter what.

310
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,450
I heard your contribution was
significant in finding the culprit.

311
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,980
Not at all.

312
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,170
I did not do anything.

313
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,090
I will discuss getting you
reinstated with the King.

314
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,090
It was my mistake to

315
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:13,100
blame your family for everything

316
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,070
because of Jo Heung Gyeon's plot.

317
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,770
If it is not too late,

318
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,970
you should reclaim your position
as the Queen, not Consort Hong.

319
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,540
His Majesty is here!

320
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,000
Your Majesty,
do not get close to him.

321
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,050
Where is Jo Heung Gyeon
right now?

322
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,310
You must have an idea.

323
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,950
You want to be loyal to
Jo Heung Gyeon until the end?

324
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,260
Loyal?

325
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,030
You! How dare you
behave that way...

326
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,900
When a seven-year-old
gets injured,

327
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,770
his mother usually treats him.

328
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,910
I didn't have a mother,

329
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,510
but in that house,

330
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,760
there was a little girl who
treated me with little hands.

331
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,710
The reason why I served that
family my whole life

332
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,080
wasn't because of loyalty.

333
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,850
If so...

334
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,360
was it because of love?

335
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,220
I'm not willing to

336
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,990
answer any further questions.

337
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,280
Gag the criminal again!

338
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,270
We'll have to leave Joseon

339
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,190
as soon as a boat is ready,

340
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,190
Find a place we can
hide in the meantime.

341
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,470
Yes.

342
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,400
Your Highness, are you all right?

343
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,450
Byeol.

344
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,850
I have a favor to ask.

345
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,070
Yes, you can ask me anything.

346
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,970
I will do anything.

347
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,440
In the house,

348
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,700
inside the drawer box in my room,

349
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,220
there's something
I didn't get a chance to pack.

350
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,240
The soldiers probably
didn't collect it.

351
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,230
Could you bring it to me?

352
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,540
What is it?

353
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,460
A keepsake from my mother.

354
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,120
A silver pocket knife.

355
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,750
Stop the interrogation.

356
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,230
He will never say where
Jo Heung Gyeon is.

357
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,130
There is no point anymore.

358
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,990
If so, how would you like
to punish the criminals?

359
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,250
You should also

360
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,480
punish the ministers who
colluded with Jo Heung Gyeon,

361
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,680
not just those two criminals.

362
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,470
Traitor, Gae Pyeong,
killed countless people.

363
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,410
I order him to be beheaded.

364
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,930
And the officer who colluded with
him will be put into jail.

365
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,560
Min Young Wan,
the chancellor of the Bureau,

366
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,900
and Park In Seo, the minister of rites, will be
removed from their positions and exiled.

367
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,300
The chancellor of the Royal
Investigation Bureau

368
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,010
is the Queen Dowager's relative.

369
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Would that be all right?

370
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,880
I will not make an exception
because he is a family member.

371
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

372
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,070
Your Highness.

373
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,170
I mean, Noonim.

374
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,540
Please...

375
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,540
Please help me just once.

376
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:23,260
I am the only relative you have.

377
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,350
You colluded with a traitor.
How am I supposed to help you?

378
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:28,500
With what reason would I help you?

379
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,470
How could you say, "colluded?"

380
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,320
I did not know either.

381
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,700
How would I have known that
Jo Heung Gyeon did such a thing?

382
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,560
I was just...

383
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,650
keeping him close since I wanted to

384
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,710
revive my defenseless family.

385
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,020
Noonim.

386
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,720
Please, please let me live.

387
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,190
Please?

388
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,230
Just receive the punishment for now.

389
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,700
While you are reflecting on yourself,
I will look for a chance to

390
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,460
talk to the King about it.

391
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,800
Gae Pyeong,
who committed high treason

392
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,730
will be beheaded!

393
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,310
- Execute.
- Yes!

394
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,880
When did you get here?

395
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,460
You're back for good, right?

396
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,990
Don't you dare disappear
without telling me again.

397
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,600
There is no need to worry
about me because of my relative.

398
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,430
More importantly,

399
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,730
we cannot leave the
Queen's Palace empty like this.

400
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:16,630
Let us find a way to get
Consort Hong reinstated.

401
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,460
Although it feels a bit rushed,

402
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,490
but the country is in disarray over this
and what happened to the prince.

403
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,710
Since Jo Heung Gyeon started this,

404
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,860
we should get the Queen reinstated

405
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,570
in the effort of restoring justice.

406
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,160
My Lady.

407
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,010
You haven't left the
chamber in days.

408
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,950
Don't you feel stuffy?

409
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,400
You should get some fresh air.

410
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,790
Chief Eunuch Hwang stopped
by several times today as well.

411
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,670
He said His Majesty worries about

412
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,170
how you are doing a lot.

413
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,450
The moonlight is pretty tonight.

414
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,260
Let's go take a walk,
at least, My Lady.

415
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,280
Do you know where

416
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,740
His Majesty is by chance?

417
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,160
Your Majesty.

418
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,630
What are you worried
about so much?

419
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,150
The Queen Dowager
approved it too.

420
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,750
You just need to reinstate
Consort Hong now.

421
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,110
Is it because you could
not find a way

422
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,730
to clear His Excellency
Kang Yi Soo's name?

423
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,660
Your Majesty, Consort Hong is here.

424
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,440
Why did you come out
when it is cold outside?

425
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,730
It is because I heard you were here.

426
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,930
The Queen Dowager mentioned
my reinstatement, did she not?

427
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,400
Is that why you are worrisome?

428
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,010
That must be why you
came back to this place.

429
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:12,230
If you get reinstated as the queen,

430
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,680
you will have to live as
Eun Ki instead of

431
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,590
yourself for the rest of your life.

432
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,900
How would I dare to

433
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,650
ask you to live that way?

434
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,840
Your Majesty.

435
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,600
I...

436
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,130
came all the way here

437
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,760
to find the culprit
who killed my sister.

438
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,860
Although I found the culprit

439
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,000
and still haven't made him pay for it,

440
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,800
but the truth has been revealed.

441
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,920
And the criminals will
be captured soon.

442
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,900
But I still have not cleared
your father's name.

443
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,230
But I am still

444
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,060
worried about my mother.

445
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,100
We lived separately for the last
ten years, not knowing if we're alive.

446
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,140
Stop.

447
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,050
Do not say it.

448
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,540
I want to leave the palace and

449
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,090
live quietly with my mother.

450
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:12,870
As myself, Eun Bo.

451
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,790
I realized when I lost Yeo Wool.

452
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,990
I do not want people getting hurt
because of me anymore.

453
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,870
I do not want anyone
to die anymore.

454
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,990
I am in fear every single day.

455
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,680
I'm afraid that the fact that

456
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,960
I am neither Hong Yeon nor
Kang Eun Ki will be revealed.

457
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,000
I feel burdened for fooling everyone.

458
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,700
Please hang in there just for a bit.

459
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,250
I will find a way for us to
be happy, no matter what.

460
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,500
- I will protect you.
- How?

461
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,000
No matter what it takes.

462
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,550
If people find out that
I am Eun Ki's twin sister,

463
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,290
the people that are the
most precious to me

464
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:59,690
will get hurt again because
I deceived everyone.

465
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,300
I mean, my mother and you,
Your Majesty.

466
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,160
For me to leave this place

467
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,170
is the only way to

468
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,920
protect both you and me.

469
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,250
Sir.

470
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,300
Where are you headed to?

471
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,060
- I'll go back to Hanyang.
- Pardon?

472
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,680
Jo Heung Gyeon became
a fugitive like me.

473
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,420
I must meet with him.

474
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,480
I need to find where he is first.

475
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:48,000
Let's try a different route.

476
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,300
I am planning to leave
Consort Hong be for a while.

477
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,830
If so...

478
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,470
are you suggesting leaving the
Queen's Palace empty like that?

479
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,840
I thought her reinstatement was
what both of you wished for.

480
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:08,070
We can always find a way to
clear Kang Yi Soo's name...

481
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,620
Forgive me, Grandmother.

482
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,890
I just need time to figure things out.

483
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,300
Please give me some time.

484
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,110
Han Mo.

485
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,590
Go to the Royal Investigation
Bureau and bring Wal to me.

486
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,080
Yes.

487
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,800
But for what reason
do you wish to see him?

488
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,530
I am thinking of making
Wal work in the palace.

489
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,800
It looks like the house
has been shut down, sir.

490
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,470
Find out whether there
are any rumors about

491
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,950
Jo Heung Gyeon's whereabouts
at watering holes nearby.

492
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,690
I'll search inside the house
and the surrounding area.

493
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,190
Yes.

494
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,780
You want me to work in the palace?

495
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,630
If I become a security
guard in the palace,

496
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,790
doesn't it mean that
I'm becoming successful?

497
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,040
He wants to award you
for playing a major role

498
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,810
in tracking down the culprit.

499
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,880
I'll take him with me then.

500
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,630
- Pardon? Yes, sir.
- I can't believe it...

501
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,740
Aigoo!

502
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,340
I'm sorry.

503
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,660
I wanted to check if
I'm dreaming or not.

504
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,050
Wow, they say every cloud
has a silver lining.

505
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:40,050
Can't believe this Wal is
finally entering the palace.

506
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,900
Congratulations.

507
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,510
That's nice, but...

508
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,620
you'd better put this away first.

509
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,330
Perhaps you should stop
addressing me informally.

510
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,520
"Stop addressing me informally?"

511
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,770
Look, Gi Chil.

512
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,630
Have a nice life.

513
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,730
Stop kicking your juniors
on their legs and stuff.

514
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,820
By the way, don't the
royal security guards

515
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,840
get paid quite handsomely?

516
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,950
How much is the salary?

517
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,700
It must be much higher
than mine right now.

518
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,130
Well...

519
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,470
His Majesty sent you this.

520
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:20,860
He told me to wait
until you finish it.

521
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,780
Chief Eunuch Hwang.

522
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,790
How is His Majesty doing?

523
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,920
He is all right.

524
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,240
He must be tormented right now.

525
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,340
Do me a favor.

526
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,150
Please take good care
of His Majesty.

527
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,470
What is the matter?

528
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:47,650
I think I have been mistaken
all this time.

529
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,400
I thought only His Majesty
was caring for you,

530
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,850
but now I realize that

531
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:58,340
you care for each other
the same way.

532
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,790
I will follow your order, My Lady.

533
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,860
Officer Han, am I really
living here from now on?

534
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,810
Being a royal security guard is the most
prestigious position assisting His Majesty.

535
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,000
And he gave you that chance.

536
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,450
So be thankful.

537
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,820
What are you talking about?

538
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,190
This man is His Majesty's
security guard?

539
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,610
Is that true?

540
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,340
- Yes.
- How could it be?

541
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,340
Does that mean that I'll...

542
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,640
have to see this face every day?

543
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,260
You are being quite rude right now.

544
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,190
Do you think I'm happy about that?

545
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,640
You're making me feel
down all of a sudden.

546
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,270
Please shut that mouth. I beg you.

547
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,640
My goodness...

548
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,560
You have been working very hard.

549
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,860
Let me know if there is
anything you want.

550
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,390
If so...

551
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,960
instead of making me
join the palace,

552
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,590
perhaps you could give me
a bit more money...

553
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,030
Please ignore that.

554
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,000
You don't have to. Of course not.

555
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,850
Do you hate to join the
palace that much?

556
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,550
At first,

557
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,770
I was so happy thinking,
"How could this happen to me?"

558
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:22,710
But I felt suffocated the moment
I entered the palace.

559
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,850
Rather than working for the palace
or the Royal Investigation Bureau,

560
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:30,790
living like a vagabond suits me better.

561
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,980
I heard you were like siblings.

562
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,990
You are alike each other.

563
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,940
Pardon?

564
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,750
Consort Hong lost her
cherished palace lady

565
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,660
and she is very upset.

566
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,520
I thought having you
around might cheer her up.

567
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,140
That is why I asked you
to come temporarily.

568
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:53,890
Please consider it as a favor
to me and check on her often.

569
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,300
- Yes.
- And...

570
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,470
you may leave the palace with her

571
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,270
when she leaves.

572
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,120
What do you mean, "leave?"

573
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,440
What do you mean by that?

574
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,470
Sir.

575
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:21,400
I didn't hear any rumor regarding
Jo Heung Gyeon's whereabouts.

576
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,220
Perhaps he already ran
far away from Hanyang.

577
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,480
I couldn't find anything inside
or near the house either.

578
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:34,450
Let's find a place to stay
for the night first.

579
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,620
Yes.

580
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,950
You may leave.

581
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,370
I will let you go.

582
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,830
But before you do,

583
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,160
please give me some time.

584
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,470
Let us stay together like this

585
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:29,020
for just a little bit longer.

586
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,360
When the moment of truth comes,

587
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,190
I will let you go then.

588
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,000
I will reinstate your family

589
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,670
and let you have your name back.

590
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,050
And then you can leave as yourself.

591
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,830
Does that not sound good?

592
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,540
Your Majesty.

593
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,750
To be honest...

594
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,950
I did not want to leave as well.

595
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,130
I changed my mind

596
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:35,590
several times a day,
over and over again.

597
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,690
But...

598
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,300
I realized now.

599
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,690
That no matter where I am,

600
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:47,650
you will always be by my side.

601
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:52,160
That if I always long for you,

602
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,660
that means we are together.

603
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,060
I want to be your woman.

604
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,280
I love you.

605
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,500
Forever.

606
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,440
How come you're out here
alone without Byeol?

607
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,100
The boat will be ready
in a few days.

608
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,150
I received a letter from the
ambassador of China once.

609
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,360
We just need to bring that to China.

610
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,830
It will be a long journey.

611
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,420
Take a rest while you can.

612
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,820
I do not want to go.

613
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,420
We already lost everything here.

614
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,450
I will not go.

615
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,630
You will not go?

616
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,660
Will you die or something?

617
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,450
I do not see why not.

618
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,870
It is your fault, Father.

619
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:34,550
Your greed ruined and killed me.

620
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,290
Do you think we came
all the way here

621
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,410
just because of my greed?

622
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:45,840
When I heard the King
was resurrected,

623
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,370
the first thing I thought
of was your face.

624
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,020
If I didn't...

625
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,510
want to fulfill your love
for His Majesty,

626
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:58,000
I would've made the Prince
the king no matter what!

627
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,360
Should I take a deep bow to you

628
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,430
to thank you for it?

629
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:04,410
Forget about your foolish affection.

630
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:07,390
The King used you, and that's all.

631
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,970
The King took you in as the queen

632
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,860
in order to save Consort Hong
from the beginning.

633
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,520
What do you mean?

634
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,230
I asked you what you mean!

635
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,970
I will come back soon.

636
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,210
My Lady, are you that happy?

637
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:57,810
Wal!

638
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:01,620
I've known you for a long time,
but I've never seen you making that face.

639
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,740
What are you doing here...

640
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,190
And what are you wearing?

641
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:06,760
Well, the thing is...

642
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,510
His Majesty gave me
a special promotion

643
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:12,010
as a royal security guard.

644
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:14,050
He wanted me to see you often too.

645
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,290
His Majesty did?

646
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:17,960
But that face means...

647
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,980
Are you happy to see me, or is it
because you like His Majesty?

648
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:23,450
You came to the palace
to tease me, right?

649
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,480
Right.

650
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,640
Thank you so much for
working hard to find the culprit.

651
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,390
Don't mention it, My Lady.

652
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,770
I will get going.

653
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,390
The left state minister,
the minister of rites,

654
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,020
and the chancellor of the Bureau.

655
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,980
We will have to hire new
people to fill those positions.

656
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,500
Who do you think will be good?

657
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,010
Your Majesty.

658
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:01,830
What do you think of

659
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:04,580
Jung Ki Ik, the deputy
right minister?

660
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,040
He gives rice away
whenever there's famine

661
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,680
and let people borrow
farmland free of charge.

662
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,990
Therefore, people trust
him immensely.

663
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,150
His Excellency Jung Ki Ik?

664
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,800
His Excellency Hong Ki Ho

665
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,630
made recommendations
for the left state minister?

666
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:21,460
Not only that he became
the minister of justice,

667
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,420
but now he's also gathering
his power alongside the King!

668
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,780
Can we just leave Hong Ki Ho be?

669
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,990
Consort Hong might actually
become the Queen at this rate!

670
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:34,410
That's why I'm telling you to
come up with a solution to stop it!

671
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:39,700
You know what Kwon Ik Soo heard
from Jo Heung Gyeon once?

672
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,130
Kwon Ik Soo?

673
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,310
You mean the fact that Consort Hong

674
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,970
is actually the dead queen?

675
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:48,870
As long as we can prove that,

676
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:51,810
we can say Consort Hong is
a traitor's daughter

677
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,790
and kick her out of the palace.

678
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:58,070
But there's no way that'd be easy.

679
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,330
So are you suggesting that we

680
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,660
sit and watch Consort Hong taking
over the Queen's Palace?

681
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,570
We can't do that.

682
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,690
Seriously...

683
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:12,610
We can't just shoot guns and kill
her as Jo Heung Gyeon did.

684
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:14,080
Guns?

685
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,300
- Did you say, "guns?"
- Pardon?

686
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,270
Yes, that's it!

687
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:20,600
If Consort Hong is the Queen,

688
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,370
she must have a scar from
the assassination attempt.

689
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:29,210
You mean the gunshot wound?

690
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:32,660
But how will we prove that?

691
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,190
We can't make her strip
in the middle of the palace.

692
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,090
You fool...

693
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:41,330
The palace ladies
can see her naked!

694
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,100
That's it.

695
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,630
Have you...

696
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,760
assisted her when
Consort Hong bathed

697
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,340
or changed her clothes?

698
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:54,300
No, Yeo Wool used to do that.

699
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,010
So I couldn't even go near her.

700
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,030
And someone else is
in charge of that now.

701
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:00,020
You must do that from now on.

702
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,460
While assisting her,

703
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,150
you must find a scar on her body.

704
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,990
A scar?

705
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,800
What kind of scar do you mean?

706
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,580
We're not the King's guards.
Don't worry.

707
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,320
Who are you?

708
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,530
Why? Why did you follow me?

709
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:43,480
I know that you were the
Queen's palace lady.

710
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,850
Where is His Excellency
Jo Heung Gyeon right now?

711
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,800
You should be with Yeon right now.

712
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,260
What brings you here?

713
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,430
My apologies.

714
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,870
I asked my lady

715
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:08,350
and she let me use her litter.

716
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:13,170
I came here because I needed
to ask you something.

717
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,550
I heard His Majesty

718
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:19,290
already knows the fact
that Eun Bo is

719
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:22,130
Eun Ki's twin sister.

720
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,440
Does he...

721
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,520
not know about...

722
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,230
the prophecy yet?

723
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:46,080
"The world will change because of the
aristocrat-born twins that were born in 1895."

724
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,880
Is that the one you're talking about?

725
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,410
Yes.

726
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,760
Eun Bo doesn't know yet.

727
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,100
But the fact that she's in the palace

728
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,700
is sucking my blood dry.

729
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,450
By chance...

730
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:04,820
if they find out she is a twin...

731
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:16,610
Who are you?

732
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:21,510
Tell Jo Heung Gyeon that
Lee Jae Hwa is here.

733
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,570
Are you planning to go into exile?

734
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:29,810
Let's hear why you came to
see me all the way here first.

735
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:31,490
You asked me

736
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:34,510
if I'd like to become the king once.

737
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,210
Do you remember?

738
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,580
I am here to ask
a question this time.

739
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,880
Would you...

740
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,190
like to make me the new
king of this country?

741
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:48,820
If we combine the
rest of our armies,

742
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,620
we will be able to revolt.

743
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,000
Wouldn't that be better than
running to a foreign country?

744
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:59,800
The whole country is looking
for us obsessively right now.

745
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,050
Is there a way to avoid

746
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,050
the tight security?

747
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:06,130
There is.

748
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:12,010
Do as he says, Father.

749
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:14,130
Take everything away from them.

750
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:16,550
Just like how they took
everything from us.

751
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:17,950
Do the same.

752
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,330
My Lady.

753
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:39,210
From now on, I will do my best

754
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,960
to assist you instead of Yeo Wool.

755
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,420
Thank you.

756
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:47,730
While assisting her,

757
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,490
you must find a scar on her body.

758
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,190
Your Majesty.

759
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,520
Where are we going, by the way?

760
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,790
You will find out
once you get there.

761
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,800
Why are these musicians here?

762
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,490
I said I want to share a lot
of things with you.

763
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:16,730
I just wanted to sit side
by side with you

764
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:18,860
and listen to music together.

765
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,140
You may begin.

766
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:18,590
Did you enjoy it that much?

767
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,910
You did not even look at me
during the performance.

768
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:24,610
Should I have been
only looking at you

769
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,470
while the musicians were playing?

770
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,610
Is it not enough to just
listen to gayageum?

771
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:30,940
You are joking, are you not?

772
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:43,850
I was happy just looking
at you during the performance.

773
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
But are you all right, Your Majesty?

774
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:01,360
You have been looking
a bit pale from earlier.

775
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,400
I just slept poorly last night.

776
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,020
If so, you should go and rest.

777
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,750
Is your father still thinking about it?

778
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,500
He will decide soon.

779
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,430
It was unexpected.

780
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:29,860
During the induction ceremony,

781
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:32,000
I could see you from afar.

782
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,700
You were smiling very
happily by the King's side.

783
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:37,370
Are you testing me

784
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:41,070
since you're worried
that my affection

785
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:43,550
might ruin your plan?

786
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,600
Your Highness!

787
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,620
I heard regular married
couples cut off the tie

788
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,820
on their tops when they split up.

789
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,140
As I decided not to die,

790
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,970
I cut up my heart as well.

791
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:07,390
Because he never even

792
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:10,070
thought of me as his wife.

793
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,810
Are you happy now?

794
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,100
Let's go, Byeol.

795
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,430
Your Majesty.

796
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:43,850
What is the matter?

797
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:46,160
Your Majesty!

798
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,010
Your Majesty!

799
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:48,960
- Call the royal physician right now!
- Yes.

800
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,100
Your Majesty! Are you all right?
Your Majesty!

801
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,130
Please watch him by his side.

802
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:09,490
Where are you headed to?

803
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:11,600
I might get kicked out
of the palace by His Majesty,

804
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,440
but I can't just sit and
watch like this.

805
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,670
You mean Consort Hong
did not have a scar?

806
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:22,220
No, I looked when
she was changing.

807
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,070
But she didn't have a scar.

808
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:30,540
Look again more closely
when you get a chance.

809
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:31,450
Pardon?

810
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,840
- Yes.
- You can leave now.

811
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,480
What is going on?

812
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,160
She does not have a scar?

813
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,900
She couldn't have actually been
Hong Yeon from the start, could she?

814
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:51,490
There's no way the Queen
wouldn't have a gunshot wound.

815
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,540
We could find out if she's
actually Hong Yeon or not

816
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,040
once we meet with Hong Ki Ho.

817
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:00,300
I was thinking of teaching him
a lesson one of these days.

818
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,940
He can really see the
future in his dreams?

819
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:14,810
He started having prophetic
dreams since he got shot.

820
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:16,930
Whenever you were in danger,

821
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,300
he said he saw it happening
in his dream beforehand.

822
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:22,350
That makes no sense.

823
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,980
How could it be...

824
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,490
How could something
like that be possible?

825
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:33,450
How did you find me
here, Your Majesty?

826
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:36,570
The King found the person who
planted poison in your room.

827
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:37,890
I had a dream.

828
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:39,960
You got shot in my dream...

829
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,710
If so...

830
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:44,640
was all of that

831
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,750
because of the prophetic dreams?

832
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,770
If he does not undergo an exorcism,

833
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,240
he will be in danger.

834
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,930
Please persuade
His Majesty, My Lady.

835
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:07,310
Your Majesty, you must rest longer.

836
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:10,230
Are you becoming like
Chief Eunuch Hwang?

837
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,830
What is with the nagging?

838
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:14,080
Thanks to the medicine
made by the physician,

839
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,870
I no longer feel dizzy.

840
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,100
By the way, where is
Chief Eunuch Hwang?

841
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,360
The thing is...

842
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,300
Your Majesty, Consort Hong is here.

843
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,470
Let her in.

844
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,310
What brings you here?

845
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:38,720
Did you miss me already by chance?

846
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,110
Please undergo an exorcism.

847
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:43,510
Chief Eunuch Hwang
must have told you again.

848
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,780
I told you that I do not want you

849
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,250
to be in danger because of me.

850
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,520
When Jo Heung Gyeon is arrested...

851
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,460
What if you are put in
danger before that?

852
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,910
Did you think I would be
happy as long as I am safe

853
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,800
regardless of what happens to you?

854
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,510
It is not like that.

855
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:59,260
Please listen to me.

856
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:02,390
How could you make
me so shameless?

857
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:06,160
How many more loved
ones must I lose?

858
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,680
If something happens to you,

859
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,710
what would I do then?

860
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,030
Please undergo an exorcism.

861
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:17,400
Please?

862
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,360
Your Majesty.

863
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:32,630
Please do not worry.

864
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:35,280
Once I perform an exorcism,

865
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,190
you will no longer have dreams.

866
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:43,540
You must not tell anyone about this.

867
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:45,100
Yes.

868
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,180
Please do not worry.

869
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,790
He is in your care.

870
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:55,350
Yes, My Lady.

871
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,390
I will...

872
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,450
start...

873
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,510
performing the exorcism.

874
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:57,780
His Majesty will be all right.

875
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:47,020
Your Majesty, are you awake?

876
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:48,960
Are you all right?

877
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,600
Do not worry.

878
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,520
I am all right.

879
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,750
That is a relief.

880
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,010
I heard the exorcism went well.

881
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:15,000
She said you will be able to sleep soundly
without dreaming from now on.

882
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,970
Thanks to you, my head is finally clear

883
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,980
and I am in a good mood.

884
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:26,200
Shall we take a stroll?

885
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,590
Right now?

886
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:31,210
I want to walk with you.

887
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:41,530
Let's talk for a moment.

888
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,270
What is the matter?

889
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:48,090
I need to talk to you briefly.

890
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,470
It is a very important matter.

891
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,400
Let's go somewhere else.

892
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,570
It's about Consort Hong.

893
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:12,110
Don't you find it fascinating?

894
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:16,140
How could she look exactly
like the dead queen?

895
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,430
What do you think as her father?

896
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:21,570
What do you want to say exactly?

897
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:24,010
There's a rumor that

898
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:27,400
she doesn't just look alike, but
she's actually the dead queen.

899
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,920
Everyone who likes to gossip says so.

900
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,900
They say the reason why

901
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:36,130
His Majesty is keeping
you close lately

902
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:38,610
is because

903
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:42,660
your daughter is actually
the dead queen.

904
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,480
Consort Hong.

905
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,080
Is she indeed your daughter?

906
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:58,870
I feel like I am dreaming right now.

907
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,530
Being under the sun with you

908
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:05,420
makes me forget about
my power as the king, position,

909
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:08,150
revenge...

910
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,610
and everything.

911
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:15,910
As long as I have you.

912
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:18,510
I feel the same way.

913
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,800
Have you decided?

914
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,270
What is the solution
you have in mind?

915
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,880
I will reveal the truth
about Consort Hong.

916
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,840
By "the truth,"

917
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,500
you mean the fact that
she's the dead queen?

918
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,330
No.

919
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:39,150
She's not the dead queen.

920
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,680
She's her twin sister.

921
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:47,900
If this truth is revealed, neither
Consort Hong nor the royals

922
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,800
will be left unharmed.

923
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:23,820
[ Queen: Love and War ]

924
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:25,980
Bring the record of the prophecy
from 20 years ago.

925
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,900
- The prophecy about the twins.
- They were twins!

926
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:30,050
She was the dead
queen's twin sister!

927
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:30,940
Is that true?

928
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,820
How did you know that,
Your Highness...

929
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,890
Please reveal all the truths
about Consort Hong.

930
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:38,210
There was an ominous prophecy
about her before she was born!

931
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,400
That means this is
an ill-fated relationship!

932
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,330
I love that woman, Grandmother.

933
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,210
I do not believe in a prophecy.

934
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:46,390
I want that woman to
go to hell like me.

935
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,900
I'll take her and keep
her by my side.

936
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:51,300
She'll have to watch the
King dying in front of me.
