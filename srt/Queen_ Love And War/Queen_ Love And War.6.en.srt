1
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,000
[ Queen: Love and War ]

2
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,770
Your Majesty, it is
Chief Eunuch Hwang!

3
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,960
Your Majesty,

4
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,500
Lady Hong has disappeared!

5
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,560
What are you talking about?

6
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,670
She disappeared?

7
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,790
What were the guards
doing anyway?

8
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,980
Hurry up and send soldiers.

9
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,590
Search everywhere
around the guest house!

10
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,770
We must find her!

11
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:22,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

12
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,940
By chance...

13
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,880
did my dream turn
out to be true again?

14
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,750
I need to see the map
of Hanyang City.

15
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,210
Let's go to the library.

16
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,900
It has not been that long yet.

17
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,730
She probably has not gone beyond
a 1-mile radius around the guest house.

18
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,170
If so...

19
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,150
she has to be around
one of the four wells.

20
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,930
Send soldiers to these places

21
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,950
and inspect every cart that goes by.

22
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,010
Your Majesty,

23
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,730
but why the wells?

24
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,810
We do not have any information yet.

25
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,230
Since when did you
question my orders?

26
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,490
My apologies, Your Majesty.

27
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,300
I will follow your order.

28
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,900
What?

29
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,140
Lady Hong disappeared...

30
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,470
Is she creating another problem?

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,350
So...

32
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,760
does it mean she went missing or
she disappeared willfully?

33
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,160
It has not been confirmed yet.

34
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,220
What are they doing at
the guest house right now?

35
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,940
Have you seen Lady No. 8?

36
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,760
No, I haven't. Have you seen her?

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,640
Have you seen Lady No. 8?

38
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,160
I'm not sure.

39
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,140
How come none of these
people have seen her?

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,490
The thing is...

41
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,030
I think they were all
distracted by the performance.

42
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,430
By the way, ma'am.
Now that I think about it,

43
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,820
I have not seen
Lady Hong's servant, either.

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,200
My lady...

45
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,230
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,480
Is it because of the dream?

47
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,780
Is that why you sent
Officer Han to the wells?

48
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,820
What did you see in your dream?

49
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,650
The Queen...

50
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,850
had her hands tied and was gagged.

51
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,070
She was inside a cart.

52
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,010
And that cart passed by a well.

53
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,860
What's this about?

54
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,110
It's manure.

55
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,000
If the Queen really
came back to life,

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,200
I'll find the evidence and
get her out of your sight.

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,480
By chance, was it Father?

58
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,280
No, it can't be...

59
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,950
Ma'am, what should
we do with the votes?

60
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,670
We still have not found Lady Hong.

61
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,180
Let's wait until the sun sets at least.

62
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,820
Help me!

63
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,080
Help me, sir!

64
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,800
- Are you crazy?
- Help me!

65
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,710
S***...

66
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,010
Are you okay?

67
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,070
Hey.

68
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,350
Who are you?

69
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,200
Who are you?

70
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,850
Hold on...

71
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,780
[ Please stop doctors from
providing different medicines ]

72
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,900
[ based on the customer's status ]

73
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,160
You're a servant of
a candidate for the selection?

74
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,090
Yes.

75
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,630
Thank you so much, sir.

76
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,690
Excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

77
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,200
She did not show up
at any of those wells?

78
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,170
No, Your Majesty.

79
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,520
We searched the
surrounding area just in case,

80
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,360
but we could not find her.

81
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,860
My apologies.

82
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,850
How could it be!

83
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,240
Your Majesty.

84
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,500
What is that stain?

85
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,160
I think it is from the well.

86
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,260
Your Majesty.

87
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,870
The ground is usually muddy around
wells since it never gets dry.

88
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,870
It is because the people constantly

89
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,850
take water from them.

90
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,760
The ground is muddy?

91
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,520
But it was dry.

92
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,300
A dried-up well that is never used.

93
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,650
Is there an older map than this?

94
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,360
Are you referring to
the ancient map?

95
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
- Bring it here.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

96
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,230
This was not on the first map.

97
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,590
If the well closed,

98
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,770
it probably was not recorded
on the new map.

99
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,250
It was an abandoned well.

100
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,470
I will go there, Your Majesty.

101
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,250
Bring me my outing attire.

102
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,770
I need to confirm myself.

103
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,850
This won't work.

104
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,030
Discard the cart and
just carry the woman.

105
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,070
Yes.

106
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,000
This is it.

107
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,860
Guard securely until I come back.

108
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,880
Yes.

109
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,360
I think they abandoned it
since the wheel came off.

110
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,900
They probably did not
make it far without the cart.

111
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,970
Split up and search.

112
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,270
Yes, Your Majesty!

113
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,130
Enough is enough.

114
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,920
You're too loud.

115
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,690
Too loud!

116
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,230
Want to die?

117
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,660
Can't you behave?

118
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,970
Song Yi did that to that girl?

119
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,810
Are you sure you took
good care of it?

120
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,800
Yes, I moved her.

121
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,980
One of my men is
watching her right now.

122
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,750
Oh-ho!

123
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,700
That Song Yi is really
something, isn't she?

124
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,770
Make sure to watch her closely.

125
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,880
Do not let her go until
the selection process ends.

126
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,280
Yes, Your Excellency.

127
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,210
Stop!

128
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,350
Step back.

129
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,490
Right now!

130
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,220
Drop the sword.

131
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,340
Shut up and move.

132
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,620
Who are you people?

133
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,100
I'll cut her head off.

134
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,820
Do not be scared,
and just look at me.

135
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,610
It is okay.

136
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,330
I will make sure to save you.

137
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,180
Right now!

138
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,110
Are you okay?

139
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,120
Yes.

140
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,790
By the way, what brings you...

141
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,080
all the way here, Your Majesty?

142
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,320
I need to go back.

143
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,300
I need to go back to the guest house.

144
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,840
What?

145
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,000
I need to go before
the selection ends.

146
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,730
Where am I...

147
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,030
Even after what happened?

148
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,140
You almost died.

149
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,520
It was dangerous.

150
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,700
You are still trembling.

151
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,560
And you want to go back?

152
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,000
What is it that you want anyway?

153
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,300
By fooling me and
fooling everyone else.

154
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,900
Is it to become the queen?

155
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,650
If so, I will reinstate you
as the queen immediately.

156
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,430
I will make sure to do so.

157
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,040
Are you satisfied?

158
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,760
Is that not it?

159
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,260
What is it then?

160
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,480
Why are you putting
yourself in danger anyway?

161
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,210
Tell me! What is it?

162
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,030
It is because of you, Your Majesty!

163
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,090
You made me this way,
Your Majesty.

164
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,360
You ruined everything!

165
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,900
Because you keep...

166
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,200
mistaking me as the late queen.

167
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,970
That's why I was put
into danger like this.

168
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,040
Let's...

169
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,330
Let's say you are really Hong Yeon.

170
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,590
If so, why is Lady Hong Yeon

171
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,530
so obsessed with the selection?

172
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,280
If I get disqualified shamefully,

173
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,460
I'd be disgracing my father and

174
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,250
my family greatly.

175
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,440
But if I become the queen,

176
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,600
that would be the most significant
honor for the Hong family.

177
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,350
Did that answer your question?

178
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,990
It did.

179
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,090
I will no longer...

180
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,110
confuse you.

181
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,380
You may go back.

182
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,700
Han Mo, escort the young
lady to the guest house.

183
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

184
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,140
I'll escort you to the guest house.

185
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,970
I will go on my own.

186
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,600
It's His Majesty's order.

187
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,270
How long do we have to wait for

188
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,560
someone who will
never come back?

189
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,420
It is obvious what
happened considering

190
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,100
she left with her servant.

191
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,510
She ran away.

192
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,970
She might have her reasons.

193
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,770
Don't you think?

194
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,950
Pardon?

195
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,100
Whatever the reason is,

196
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,400
one person delaying the
whole process like this

197
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,680
is unfair.

198
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,600
What should we do, ma'am?

199
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,610
Lady Kim has a good point.

200
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,640
From this point on,

201
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,480
Lady Hong, who broke
the rule of the selection,

202
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,770
will be eliminated.

203
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,510
Remove Lady Hong's jar

204
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,350
and start counting the ballots.

205
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,520
Yes.

206
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,300
Lady No. 1. Five votes.

207
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,930
All I got from those
people is five votes?

208
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,420
Lady No. 2.

209
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,690
Two votes.

210
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,300
Two votes...

211
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,500
Lady No. 3. One vote.

212
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,160
Lady No. 4.

213
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,600
No votes.

214
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,650
Lady No. 5. Five votes.

215
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,570
Really? Five...

216
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,100
Lady No. 6.

217
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,430
Two votes.

218
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,110
Lady No. 7.

219
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,300
Three votes.

220
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,860
Ma'am! Ma'am!

221
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,560
Ma'am!

222
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,040
Ma'am.

223
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,340
I'm the servant of Lady Hong Yeon.

224
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,750
Please help.

225
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,930
I think something terrible
happened to my lady.

226
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,040
Something terrible?

227
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,920
Did you not go out with her?

228
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,470
No.

229
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,220
I almost got kidnapped
myself just now,

230
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,400
but managed to run away.

231
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,850
Kidnapped?

232
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,190
How about your lady then...

233
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,160
I'm not sure.

234
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,790
She hasn't come back
since she went out

235
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,590
with Lady Kim a while ago.

236
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,880
That was the last time I saw her.

237
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,700
Lady Kim, follow me.

238
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,230
The rest of you may
continue counting the ballots.

239
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,360
Yes.

240
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,150
I wanted to talk privately

241
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,050
since many ears were listening.

242
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,180
How come you did
not say anything?

243
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,300
You were the last one
to see Lady Hong.

244
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,540
We just chatted a bit,
and I walked away first.

245
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,730
How would I know that was the
last time for her to be seen?

246
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:45,400
You mean you have
no idea where she is?

247
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Are you suspicious of me?

248
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,860
What did I do anyway?

249
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,780
How could you interrogate me
over what the servant b**** said?

250
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,300
Answer my question.

251
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,080
Now I understand.

252
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,560
You promise to be always fair, but

253
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,910
you discriminate against me
since I'm Queen Mother's relative!

254
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,990
Because you are
Queen Dowager's court lady.

255
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,330
Lady Kim.

256
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,760
If that is not it,

257
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,620
for what reason are you
doing this to me?

258
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,680
I feel I have been wronged.

259
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,590
You're the only one
who could compete

260
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,340
with Lady Kim among us.

261
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,130
They couldn't even
handle a servant b****?

262
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,810
Those idiots.

263
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,750
Hurry, hurry!

264
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,550
Excuse me.

265
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,100
You really haven't seen
Lady Hong Yeon?

266
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,800
I'm talking to you, Lady.

267
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,070
You want me to tell you?

268
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,200
Why you always get
overshadowed by Hong Yeon.

269
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,300
It's because you don't
choose any sides.

270
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,360
Whether you'll be
kind and innocent

271
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,520
or be greedy and win it.

272
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,100
Just pick one.

273
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,060
What?

274
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,190
Do you want to be friends with
those country bumpkins?

275
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,390
Fine then.

276
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,100
I'll tell you where that girl is then.

277
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,030
If I tell you, you probably

278
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,650
will stress out since you could
neither confront nor ignore.

279
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,930
Let me tell you where she is.

280
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,810
Are you stupid or something?

281
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:43,410
How would I know where
the missing lady is?

282
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,700
What did she say?

283
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,630
What did she say, my lady?

284
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,080
Did she see Lady Hong?
Does she know?

285
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,270
Did you hear from the
guest house?

286
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,300
Yes.

287
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,760
It looks like Lady Hong
went missing.

288
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,010
Court Lady Jung is asking you
how to handle the situation.

289
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,890
Also...

290
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,740
the court lady from

291
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,190
His Majesty's bedchamber
said he left the palace.

292
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,270
What?

293
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,000
He did?

294
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,020
Your Majesty.

295
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,850
Was your dream really accurate?

296
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,200
I have had that dream
since I was shot.

297
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,280
I think I acquired the
power to predict the future.

298
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,590
Whoa! How could it be...

299
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,030
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

300
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,650
I didn't mean to.

301
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,410
I suddenly felt afraid of you.

302
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,100
If so, should I let you
leave the palace?

303
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,750
No, Your Majesty.

304
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,340
I will stay here.

305
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,570
Your Majesty.

306
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,200
While you were out,

307
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,840
I got a message from
Young Koon's physician.

308
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,550
He said someone has been
lurking around for days.

309
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,800
Perhaps Officer Han
should catch that person.

310
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,550
If we rashly ambushed
him and lose him,

311
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,000
it would be over.

312
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,210
If so...

313
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,460
Cut the number of soldiers guarding
the physician's quarter in half.

314
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,440
Pardon?

315
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,540
He'll try to rescue Young Koon.

316
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,260
We need to follow him

317
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,580
and find out where he goes to
and whom he meets with.

318
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

319
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,680
Has Great Royal Dowager Queen

320
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,090
mentioned anything?

321
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,860
No, ma'am.

322
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,340
Ma'am! Lady Hong is back!

323
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,670
My lady!

324
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,200
What happened?

325
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,140
I was so worried about you.

326
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,450
Lady Hong.

327
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,950
My apologies for being late.

328
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,900
There was an
unavoidable situation.

329
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,440
You do look kind of shabby.

330
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,290
Were you really
kidnapped or something?

331
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,800
Yes.

332
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,800
Is that true?

333
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,220
Was it true?

334
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,030
Lady Hong, please
come inside first.

335
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,060
What do you mean?

336
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,050
Didn't you say she was eliminated?

337
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,000
How could you let her
inside the guest house?

338
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,260
I put the elimination on hold.

339
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,700
How come?

340
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,260
Lady Hong Yeon won the
third mission in a landslide.

341
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,660
Also...

342
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,860
she came back herself and
claimed to have been kidnapped.

343
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,620
It is our priority to find the truth.

344
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,580
I'll report this situation
to the palace

345
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,530
and all the decisions
will be made there.

346
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,540
Please enter the palace tomorrow

347
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,480
and you'll find out the result
through the announcement.

348
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,990
Huh? Were you in your room?

349
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,520
How come you didn't
even come out?

350
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,540
Your roommate came back.

351
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,720
Are you sure you didn't get hurt?

352
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,810
Right.

353
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,370
You must've been shocked.

354
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,430
Swallow these
pills whole, at least.

355
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,690
It's Chungshimhwan.

356
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,160
Thank you.

357
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,380
My lady.

358
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,640
You should change first.

359
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,240
Yes, that's right.

360
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,150
Just make yourself comfortable.

361
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,000
We'll go to a different room.

362
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,620
Hurry up.

363
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,830
My lady.

364
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,110
I'm so relieved that
you returned safely.

365
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,290
How about you?

366
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,360
Did you get hurt at all?

367
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,440
No.

368
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,550
A gentleman who was
passing by helped me.

369
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,180
By the way, my lady...

370
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,850
What should we do
if you get eliminated?

371
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,070
Some pages got ruined
hence the situation.

372
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,830
So the majority of the people
voted for Lady Hong?

373
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,830
Yes.

374
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,730
She got twice as
many votes as others.

375
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,890
If she was really kidnapped,
she cannot be eliminated.

376
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,380
But that's just what she said.

377
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,370
There is no clear evidence.

378
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,120
If I did this in a slipshod way,

379
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,490
there will be a backlash
from the ministers.

380
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,100
Let him know I'm here.

381
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,560
My apologies, Your Highness.

382
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:56,470
His Majesty said he would
not see anyone today.

383
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,920
I heard the King traveled
in disguise today again.

384
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,770
How are you aiding
His Majesty anyway?

385
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,540
Why do you let him leave
the palace all the time?

386
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,910
My apologies.

387
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,530
If something terrible happens
to him outside the palace,

388
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,320
I'll cut your head off first!

389
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,890
Do not blame an innocent person
just to make me come out.

390
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,320
Chief Eunuch Hwang
followed my order as my servant.

391
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,920
Where did you go?

392
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,100
You already have an idea.

393
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,720
I know you are here to ask me

394
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,700
whether I found the culprit,
not how she is doing.

395
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,810
King.

396
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,990
I will take care of this myself.

397
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,330
Please understand that
and leave, Grandmother.

398
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
[ Dream ]

399
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,850
[ Prophetic dream ]

400
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,130
Read this.

401
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,260
Prophetic dream.

402
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,590
Your Majesty.

403
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,240
After I came back from death,

404
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,650
I see the future in my dreams.

405
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,910
If someone heard that,
they would call me crazy

406
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,660
and try to drag me
out of the throne.

407
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,940
Your Majesty.

408
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,580
What is bothering you?

409
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,330
Who is she if she's
not the Queen?

410
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,100
Who is that girl anyway?

411
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,830
That woman was in
both of my dreams.

412
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,050
Your Majesty.

413
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,780
What will you do about that lady?

414
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,300
I'll let her be Hong Yeon...

415
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,640
if that is...

416
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,010
how the Queen will protect herself.

417
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,690
And I will...

418
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,380
protect that woman.

419
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,200
[ Prophetic dream ]

420
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,160
Why did you want to see me?

421
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,000
You didn't think I'd come back.

422
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,730
What are you talking about?

423
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,890
Do you think there would
be no consequences?

424
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,290
Do you think I have no plans?

425
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,310
Tell Court Lady Jung that
you saw the kidnapper.

426
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,980
Why would I?

427
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,400
Then should I show this to
Court Lady Jung instead?

428
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,930
What is that?

429
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,920
The evidence that the kidnapper
works for the Kim family.

430
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,290
You're lying.

431
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,870
If you really have something,
why didn't you present it earlier?

432
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,650
If I did, I'd be turning the powerful
Kim family into my enemy.

433
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,650
Even the daughter of the governor
of Gyeonggi knows that much.

434
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,120
If you don't believe me,
go ahead and

435
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,130
continue to keep your mouth shut.

436
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:20,730
You'll get to see what the evidence
is at the palace tomorrow.

437
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,000
Think carefully all through the night.

438
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,740
Do not be scared
and just look at me.

439
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,070
It is okay.

440
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,450
I will make sure to save you.

441
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,200
Is that really how he feels?

442
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
With all the risks,
he tried to save me...

443
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,730
I mean, he tried to save my sister.

444
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,800
Was he deeply in love with her?

445
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,170
Did you find a way

446
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,560
not to get eliminated?

447
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,740
I don't know what to do yet.

448
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,990
Why did you come back?

449
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,130
If that happened to other ladies,

450
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,570
they would've run away immediately.

451
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,870
Aren't you afraid?

452
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,790
Something might happen again.

453
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,210
I am afraid.

454
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,720
But...

455
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,870
I can't just run away when
I consider my family.

456
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,180
I'm sure everyone
here is like that.

457
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,100
They are under the
pressure of their family.

458
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,110
Aren't you like that too?

459
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,420
I'm not.

460
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,240
I'm here...

461
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,450
because this is what I want to do.

462
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,340
So no one knows about Hong Yeon?

463
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,160
No, it turns out

464
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,040
she kept a low profile since
she was weak since birth.

465
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,820
She was away for medical
leave for a long time.

466
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,650
So she doesn't know
her neighbors at all.

467
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,770
What's the name of the disease?

468
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,480
It's asthma, apparently.

469
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,600
Asthma?

470
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,300
Get out of the way!

471
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,890
Get out of the way!

472
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,140
How could you be so sloppy?

473
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,720
She came back alive and well.

474
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,310
How did she get the
upper hand over you?

475
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,550
The thing is...

476
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,030
There were king's soldiers when
I went back to the warehouse.

477
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,030
What?

478
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,590
Follow me.

479
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,990
The result of the first round of
selection will be announced shortly.

480
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,470
Please wait for a moment, ladies.

481
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,740
Just one second.

482
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:10,160
I need to tell you
something in private.

483
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,170
Lady Kim saw the kidnapper?

484
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,200
Yes.

485
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,700
She didn't speak up
because she wasn't sure.

486
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,740
Her description of the
kidnapper matched Lady Hong's.

487
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,900
Why is she saying that now?

488
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,860
How pathetic is that?

489
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:36,410
That means Lady Hong has
no reason to be eliminated.

490
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,240
Mother, please think
this through...

491
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,590
It's Lady Kim who saw
him, of all people.

492
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,350
I'll name the ladies who are entering
the second round of selection.

493
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,080
Please come forward and
receive the imperial decree.

494
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,050
Young Ji from the Jo family.

495
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,940
Ye Shil from the Bang family.

496
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,080
Dan Young from the Ha family.

497
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,190
Jong Hee from the Park family.

498
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,460
Song Yi from the Kim family.

499
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,290
Lastly,

500
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,160
Yeon from the Hong family.

501
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,360
Give it to me now.

502
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,450
That evidence or whatever.
Right now.

503
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,740
What's this?

504
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,290
Your servant left a footprint.

505
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,890
A footprint?

506
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,190
You call this evidence?

507
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,210
How dare you fool me!

508
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,420
Try hurting me one more time.

509
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,780
A fool who pretends to be clever
like you can't be my competition.

510
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,560
Let go.

511
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,610
Let go of me!

512
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,460
So you'd better behave.

513
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,310
Hey!

514
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,110
The fact that she suddenly
confessed like that

515
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,200
makes me think Lady Hong
might've made a deal with her.

516
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,660
A deal?

517
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,510
It sounds like she
could be pretty useful.

518
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,970
Since the first round has
ended, the young ladies

519
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,270
will be on a break
starting tomorrow.

520
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,420
Please make sure to
award them generously.

521
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,840
Yes, by the way...

522
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,530
Your Highness.

523
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,830
Would it be really okay to
let go of the kidnap incident?

524
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,160
I will wait and see

525
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,020
what King wants to do.

526
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,800
Your Majesty, there's great news.

527
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,890
That young lady made it
to the second round.

528
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,180
I looked into it

529
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:16,870
and apparently all the
people's votes went to her.

530
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,380
I did not ask you.

531
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,270
You did not.

532
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:25,410
It's because you told me
to find out about her...

533
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,280
in great detail.

534
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,190
That's why I looked into it.

535
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,040
By the way,

536
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,610
how did she get so many
votes from the people?

537
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,240
I am not sure.

538
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,890
I do not know about that...

539
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,090
Go ahead and find out.

540
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,670
But first,

541
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,320
summon Chief State Minister and
Left State Minister to the council hall.

542
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

543
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,730
You summoned us, Your Majesty?

544
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:01,390
I wanted to see you because
I wanted to calm your nerves.

545
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,460
Pardon?

546
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,880
Your daughter and niece are
in the midst of the selection.

547
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,630
You must be so nervous for them.

548
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,660
Also...

549
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,390
I heard a young lady almost got
kidnapped by a stranger.

550
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,600
What are your thoughts?

551
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,390
Don't you think it might
be those who pointed

552
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,530
a gun at me during
the wedding procession?

553
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,280
If that is your thought,

554
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,260
please order the Royal Investigation
Bureau to investigate.

555
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,460
Your Majesty,

556
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,000
there are already many rumors
regarding the selection.

557
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,830
It might cause ugly rumors
inside and outside the palace.

558
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:43,200
Maybe security at the guest house
needs to be strengthened first.

559
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,800
Make the Royal Investigation Bureau
investigate and strengthen security?

560
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,880
Sounds good.

561
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,690
However...

562
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,550
how could you be so carefree?

563
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,290
That young lady could've been

564
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,700
assassinated like the queen.

565
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,070
That could've been your niece

566
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:14,220
and your daughter as well.

567
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,620
How could you not be
concerned at all?

568
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,930
Your Majesty.

569
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:20,800
How could I not be concerned?

570
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,960
I was hiding my
personal emotions

571
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,300
since I value my loyalty
toward Your Majesty.

572
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,770
Loyalty, did you say?

573
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,410
If so...

574
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:36,700
I should reciprocate to your loyalty.

575
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,110
If the young ladies were
put into danger,

576
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:43,160
I will not just sit and watch.

577
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,450
If something scandalous happens
during the selection again,

578
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,190
I will dismiss this selection

579
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,870
and will not select a queen.

580
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,870
What did the King say, Hyungnim?

581
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,310
He said he wouldn't marry if
that girl is put into danger.

582
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:10,990
He threatened us.

583
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:12,380
- What?
- Geez.

584
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,030
That makes no sense.

585
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,670
How could he avoid
royal marriage?

586
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,590
Queen Mother was right.

587
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:21,180
That girl is swaying the King again.

588
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,490
I mean...

589
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:26,290
why is the King so affected
by that face anyway?

590
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,030
Is she really that beautiful?

591
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,900
That's what I'm saying, Nephew.

592
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,640
What is she, Hwang Jin Yi
or Jang Nok Soo?

593
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,680
Uncle, you should teach
your daughter better.

594
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,760
She was cocky telling
everyone to count on her.

595
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,040
And look at it now.

596
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,400
- What did you say?
- Am I wrong about that?

597
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,740
- You're so combative lately...
- Settle down!

598
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,970
Stop it!

599
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,130
Stop!

600
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,990
Don't worry about the
lady from the Kim family.

601
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,650
I have plans in mind.

602
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,490
There's something else
you need to do.

603
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,830
I need to do something?

604
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,960
The situation isn't so good.

605
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,240
It seems like the King
rescued the woman himself.

606
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,530
Reveal the fact that
she's the dead queen

607
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,940
before she becomes
a threat to you

608
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,960
and get her eliminated
from the selection.

609
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,070
In order to do that,

610
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:34,900
we need to know for sure that
she's faking her identity.

611
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:43,220
This is a peanut powder,
and it triggers asthma.

612
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:48,870
The real Hong Yeon apparently
has a chronic illness.

613
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,920
You'd find it useful.

614
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,170
Would you like to give it a try?

615
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:21,800
Yes.

616
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,870
I will try, Father.

617
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,540
She's definitely
Kang Yi Soo's daughter.

618
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,660
She made it to the second round
with the people's support.

619
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,460
She wrote down complaints
for Shinmoongo?

620
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,550
Yes.

621
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,890
[ Shinmoongo: the drum outside the palace
for the people to communicate complaints ]

622
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,070
You're a servant to
a candidate of the selection?

623
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,550
Then that servant was...

624
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,060
What a coincidence.

625
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,890
What's her level of education?

626
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,980
She finished reading the
Theory of Enlightenment.

627
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,670
She's a fast learner.

628
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,810
That's good enough.

629
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,470
But most importantly,

630
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,060
we should increase her
animosity toward the king.

631
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,490
She's still...

632
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,520
more focused on the culprit
who killed his sister.

633
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,230
Right.

634
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,590
By the way, Hyungnim...

635
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,850
Since the owner of
Buyong Agency is back,

636
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,620
does it mean we get
more small jobs?

637
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,600
So greedy.

638
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,100
I guess...

639
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,260
we made pretty good money.

640
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,870
If you become his eyes and
ears and get information,

641
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,570
he gave us money.

642
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,590
We rested enough. Let's go now.

643
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:44,510
Our boss will flip out again.

644
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:47,040
You can go ahead.

645
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,740
I'll smoke another one first.

646
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,120
Okay then.

647
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:59,020
The owner of
Buyong Agency is back?

648
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:03,060
Well, the thing is...

649
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,200
It's your turn to return the favor.

650
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,620
What's this?

651
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:29,540
The client I mentioned
told me to give this to you.

652
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,180
As long as you take the case,
he'd give you twice as much...

653
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,600
No, three times as much as this.

654
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,170
He said to meet him at the straw house
below the Tiger Rock at Inwang Mountain.

655
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:39,210
Be there by eight p.m.

656
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,900
Three times as much?

657
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,200
I said Buyong Agency is
closed for now.

658
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:57,850
Isn't he some kind of a shady guy?

659
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,360
He left so much money with you.

660
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,860
I think you're the shady one.

661
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,900
Did you commit a crime
or something?

662
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,170
Come to think of it, it's strange
that you suddenly disappeared.

663
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,810
I didn't commit any crime.

664
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:14,130
They say you should tap on even the
stone bridge before you step on it.

665
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,800
That's all.

666
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,200
Aigoo...

667
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,300
You'd end up losing a client

668
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,050
while tapping on the stone.

669
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,630
Aigoo...

670
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:30,350
Forget it if you don't want to.

671
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,840
Anyway,

672
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,290
you need to give this back to him.

673
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:35,490
I do?

674
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:36,730
Why would I?

675
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,390
I relayed the message.

676
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:43,170
Even if he reports to the police
for not returning it,

677
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,960
I have nothing to do with it.

678
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:46,550
Hey.

679
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:48,310
Hey, what did you say?

680
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:52,590
Geez. Wow.

681
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,420
Geez...

682
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,340
Where did you say he would be?

683
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,480
The straw house at
Inwang Mountain!

684
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,350
By eight p.m.!

685
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,740
What's all this?

686
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,690
Since this is our last night
at the guest house,

687
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:28,070
I thought we should
celebrate together.

688
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,520
Wow!

689
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,680
How did you read my mind?

690
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,160
What is that?

691
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,470
It's a ginseng drink.

692
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,510
I stole one when I left the house.

693
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,620
You brought alcohol?

694
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:46,220
You really have all kinds of food.

695
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,810
There's still a lot in our room.

696
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:49,930
Beef jerky, dried persimmons...

697
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,900
Okay, okay. Let's sit down first.

698
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,600
All right.

699
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,940
By the way, is this really okay?

700
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,870
We all made it to the second round.

701
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:06,710
We should at least celebrate.

702
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,600
Let's forget our worries.

703
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,390
Okay, fine.

704
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,000
Let's drink!

705
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,170
All right!

706
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:28,070
My parents are probably
in shock right now.

707
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:31,320
For a country bumpkin like me to
make it to the second round?

708
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,940
Don't you think?

709
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,660
I'm worried.

710
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:38,090
I'm from a poor family, and
I'm entering the second round.

711
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,000
I'm worried about burdening them
with the cost of the litter and things.

712
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,650
When I should be helping
out the family.

713
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:50,180
Hey, everyone! Listen to
what I have to say.

714
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,290
Don't brag that you're rich

715
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,790
and don't be sad that you're poor.

716
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:59,120
We should drink and lift the mood.

717
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:00,890
Here we go.

718
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,050
All right.

719
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,000
How nice!

720
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,970
What's that powder on top?

721
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,170
Ew...

722
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:22,510
What's this?

723
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:25,480
Is there any type of food
I don't know in Joseon?

724
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,140
It's this thing called
"peanut." It's from China.

725
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,340
Try some.

726
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,010
It's tasty.

727
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,800
I guess not.

728
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,800
How annoying.

729
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,100
How did you come here?

730
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,700
Can you walk?

731
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,220
Send the message to the palace.

732
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,310
Yes.

733
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,680
This face.

734
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,580
Where do you...

735
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:48,770
get a face like this?

736
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:52,990
Where can I buy one like this?

737
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,710
Are you drunk?

738
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,450
I'm not drunk.

739
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,820
By the way...

740
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,030
You really won't sell it to me?

741
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,270
How much is it?

742
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:08,430
Huh?

743
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,710
How much do you want?

744
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:13,370
Huh?

745
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,680
My goodness...

746
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,870
I didn't think of her this way before.

747
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:19,690
But she's a bum.

748
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:28,000
Who are you?

749
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,260
Why did you come back?

750
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,440
All right.

751
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,810
Your Majesty.

752
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:56,520
Officer Han is chasing Young Koon.

753
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,000
Let's go.

754
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,960
He's a guest who's staying at
a room next to mine at the bar.

755
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,350
Look at him.

756
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:55,920
He has a similar build like mine.

757
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:12,900
So people would think
you and I died together.

758
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,920
Goodbye.

759
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,900
Guard this area.

760
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,040
Yes.

761
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,440
Hide.

762
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,690
Is anyone there?

763
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,100
Hello?

764
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,300
Is anyone there?

765
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,320
Hello?

766
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,990
Are you okay?

767
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:04,350
Ahjussi, wake up!

768
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,010
Who are you?

769
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,090
Arrest this man!

770
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:10,510
- Yes!
- I didn't do it!

771
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,280
Excuse me.

772
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,260
Excuse me.

773
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,460
Hold on, hold on!

774
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,400
I said I didn't do it!

775
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,580
Let go of me!

776
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,790
Hold on!

777
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,800
Let go!

778
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,720
Excuse me!

779
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,370
I really didn't do it!

780
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,760
Why are you doing this to me?

781
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,000
I'm serious!

782
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:52,350
The king...

783
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,210
Your Majesty.

784
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:57,910
He killed both the man at the
physician's quarter and Young Koon.

785
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:58,900
No.

786
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,410
I didn't kill them!

787
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,860
I was set up!

788
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,510
I didn't kill them! I'm serious!

789
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:06,760
Make him confess overnight.

790
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

791
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:09,570
Your Majesty.

792
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:11,430
I didn't do it...

793
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:13,290
Excuse me, sir.

794
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:15,560
Sir, I really didn't do it!

795
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,250
I was just... just...

796
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,320
I was just there!

797
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,260
I didn't kill them! I really didn't!

798
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,020
I need to see Wal.

799
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,220
Let's go to the Prince's house.

800
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,590
Yes, my lady.

801
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:52,000
According to the custom,

802
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,070
I heard they are given a break
before the second round.

803
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:57,150
So I came to Seoul earlier as well.

804
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:58,560
You did the right thing.

805
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,650
Why don't we...

806
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:05,070
grow our power in the court
with you in the center?

807
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:07,180
Isn't it too soon?

808
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,220
We'll get a chance by
the end of the selection.

809
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,820
If that woman becomes
the queen as we wanted,

810
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,820
I won't just take the
army from the king.

811
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,400
What do you mean, Your Excellency?

812
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,920
I'll take his life.

813
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:25,440
I'll give that woman a dagger.

814
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,050
So she could aim his heart.

815
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,100
Your Majesty.

816
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,330
Your Majesty!

817
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:53,720
I didn't kill them.

818
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,430
I didn't do it, Your Majesty.

819
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:57,930
I didn't kill them! I'm truthful.

820
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:00,030
We found out the
cause of their deaths.

821
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,110
It was poison.

822
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,860
You used poisonous
needles, didn't you?

823
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,410
Poisonous needles?

824
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,780
What poison? What are
you talking about?

825
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:10,710
I didn't kill them,
Your Majesty. I really didn't!

826
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:12,860
How long will you deny?

827
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,260
Tell me.

828
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,650
Who's behind you?

829
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:18,320
What do you mean,
who's behind me?

830
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,100
- There are soldiers behind me!
- You!

831
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,690
- Who is it?
- I...

832
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:28,660
I... I'm just...

833
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,630
Where do you live,
and who are you?

834
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:33,440
I'm...

835
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,620
I'm the prince's servant.

836
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,940
What did you say?

837
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,250
Who?

838
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,070
You're that lady, aren't you?

839
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,430
I don't know what to tell you.

840
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:53,080
He's on an outing right now.

841
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,010
I'm not here to see Prince.

842
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,930
Is Wal in there?

843
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,620
I haven't seen that man in days.

844
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,440
Wow, how could you, Lady?

845
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:08,970
How could you come to
my house and not look for me?

846
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:11,190
I'm disappointed.

847
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,190
Are you that gentleman?

848
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:17,770
It's him!

849
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:21,590
When I almost got kidnapped in
front of the guest house,

850
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:24,280
he was there to help me.
It was him, my lady!

851
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,300
"My lady?"

852
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,000
By "my lady," you mean...

853
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:59,320
[ Queen: Love and War ]

854
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,970
I opened up my heart to her.

855
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:03,320
How come everything
I want belongs to the king?

856
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,410
Why?

857
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:06,150
I'll make sure she becomes mine.

858
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:08,310
I never thought of
Prince as a threat.

859
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:10,900
Thinking about it now,
I could've suspected him.

860
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:14,830
If you really want to play
mother-in-law, I should let you.

861
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:17,510
The second round depends
on you, Your Highness.

862
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:20,140
You're the owner of Buyong Agency?
Tell me her name first...

863
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,360
if you want to be free.

864
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,730
- The king?
- Your true identity might get revealed.

865
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:26,800
What if I met with the king?
