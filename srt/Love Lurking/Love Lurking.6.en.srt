00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:38,338
Boss,

4
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,978
aren't we going out for a deal?

5
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:40,778
Why are we here?

6
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:43,338
Let's talk before we leave.

7
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,099
About the ledger,

8
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:48,818
I have wronged you.

9
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:51,739
But I hope
you can help me find the mole.

10
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:52,619
Here.

11
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,418
Drink the wine.

12
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,179
I'll leave the task to you.

13
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:10,259
By the way,

14
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:12,059
I've given Gu Nian

15
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,259
to Kun in your name.

16
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,099
Choose

17
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:23,259
between the deal and her.

18
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:32,259
Just a woman.

19
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,418
I choose the deal.

20
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,059
Gu Nian,

21
00:01:43,818 --> 00:01:45,818
it's time for us
to settle the previous accounts.

22
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:46,818
Let go of me!

23
00:01:53,818 --> 00:01:54,619
Boss,

24
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:56,219
I'm going to the restroom.

25
00:02:07,898 --> 00:02:09,139
Find out what's going on.

26
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:09,378
Yes.

27
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,418
Let go of me!

28
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:21,059
Let go of me!

29
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:28,099
My eyes!

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,504
Where is Gu Nian?

31
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:34,619
Gu Nian?

32
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:36,298
I'm going to kill you!

33
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:46,898
Who are you?

34
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:51,778
That woman ran up the hill.

35
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:52,699
Everyone, be careful.

36
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:53,898
She took Kun's gun.

37
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:02,099
Gu Nian!

38
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:04,659
Don't come over.

39
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:05,858
Or I'll shoot.

40
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:09,378
Put down the gun.

41
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:11,219
What?

42
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,139
Trying to fool me again?

43
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:14,699
Gu Nian, I'm not fooling you.

44
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,059
What happened today was all an accident.

45
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:18,179
I can explain.

46
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,139
Put down the gun first.

47
00:03:21,298 --> 00:03:22,059
Come back.

48
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:24,498
Back to where?

49
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:27,059
Back to the place
where I was imprisoned?

50
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,579
Do you know?

51
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:32,259
I already believed you.

52
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:36,539
Don't come over.

53
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,019
Or I will really shoot.

54
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,059
K, capture her.

55
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,059
Gu Nian, put the gun down.

56
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,298
Don't come over.

57
00:03:58,659 --> 00:03:59,978
I won't go back.

58
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:04,179
Didn't you say
that jumping down will likely kill me?

59
00:04:05,498 --> 00:04:07,219
I'm willing to take the chances.

60
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,059
I bet I can leave here alive.

61
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:15,659
Gu Nian!

62
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:16,818
Don't!

63
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:27,699
Miss?

64
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:29,418
You've finally woken up.

65
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:31,579
Where am I?

66
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:32,778
You're in a hospital.

67
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:34,298
Hospital?

68
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:36,019
Yes.

69
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,378
Someone rescued you from the sea
and brought you here.

70
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:39,579
Oh.

71
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,579
I'll go get the doctor.

72
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:42,579
Doctor, she's awake.

73
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,498
I want to call the police.

74
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:48,099
- Call the police?
- Call the police?

75
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,139
- What happened?
- What happened?

76
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:03,418
Miss Gu,

77
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:05,418
according to the tracker on you,

78
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:06,739
we've arrested all the dealers.

79
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:07,778
To be safe,

80
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,778
we'll send police
to the hospital to protect you.

81
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:14,139
Hold me tight and close your eyes.

82
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:23,978
Don't worry.

83
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:25,579
I won't hurt you.

84
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:51,219
K?

85
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:07,739
Fireworks?

86
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:09,418
Miss Gu.

87
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:11,498
Tonight is New Year's Eve.

88
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:13,019
I wish you a new beginning tomorrow.

89
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:19,778
(Why do I feel so uneasy?)

90
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:34,579
(The nurse?)

91
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:44,778
I'll kill you all

92
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,139
if she escapes.

93
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:47,378
Don't worry, Boss.

94
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:48,418
I've taken care

95
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:49,298
of everything.

96
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:50,059
Gu Nian is here.

97
00:06:58,539 --> 00:06:59,019
She's there.

98
00:06:59,019 --> 00:06:59,458
Hurry!

99
00:06:59,539 --> 00:06:59,978
After her!

100
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:06,818
Hurry!

101
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:13,898
There.

102
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:14,858
That one. Hurry!

103
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:23,818
Boss,

104
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:25,539
checking the footage takes time.

105
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:26,778
We can't find her now.

106
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:27,298
Useless!

107
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:28,739
Guard all exits.

108
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:30,978
I want to kill her to avenge Kun.

109
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:31,778
We must catch her.

110
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:32,139
Okay.

111
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:32,539
Search!

112
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:33,659
Continue searching.

113
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,099
Continue searching.

114
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:36,579
Okay.

115
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:38,659
- Go check here.
- Okay.

116
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:46,458
Officer,

117
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:47,458
someone is after me.

118
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:52,019
Come. I'll take you out.

119
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:52,298
Okay.

120
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:06,699
Hello?

121
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:08,659
Did you find that woman?

122
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,739
I think I've seen you somewhere.

123
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:18,698
Don't let her escape.

124
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:02,418

125
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,698
