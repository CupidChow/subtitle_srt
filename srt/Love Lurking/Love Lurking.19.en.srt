Why didn't you push away?

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,800
I forgot.

15
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,919
You've always been such a bad guy.

16
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,159
(I can't go back to my room.)

17
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,800
(I should just go home.)

18
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,319
I see.

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
I'll be there.

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,800
Brother, have you seen Song Qian?

21
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,319
Didn't I tell you to warn him

22
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,719
to stay away from Gu Nian?

23
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,520
Gu Nian?

24
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,159
They're together again?

25
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,199
Wei Qing,

26
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,280
If you can't handle your own man,

27
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,639
don't blame me for dealing with him.

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,639
No!

29
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,439
Song Qian has helped you a lot.

30
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,719
Remember.

31
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
This is the last time.

32
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:31,960
Come with me.

33
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,879
Why did you bring me to your room?

34
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,639
I'm going back.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,240
You wouldn't still be outside

36
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,479
if you actually wanted to go back.

37
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,879
You can be with anyone you want,

38
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,479
just not with Zhou Shen.

39
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,759
Did you already know

40
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,199
that Zhou Shen is connected
to the Wei Group?

41
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,520
(He is related to my mom
and the dean's death.)

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,400
So he was lying to me all along.

43
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,400
But he's looking for me now.

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,759
What should I do?

45
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,520
Don't worry.

46
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,240
He won't have time for you later.

47
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,639
Why?

48
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,399
I won't let you

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,639
stay in the same room with him.

50
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,240
You'll stay in my room tonight.

51
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,439
And you and Wei Qing?

52
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,600
We don't stay in the same room.

53
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,720
Don't worry.

54
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll stay in another hotel later.

55
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,199
Qian?

56
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,040
Qian?

57
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,800
Qian,

58
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,120
what are you doing?

59
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,079
Why are you here?

60
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,839
Aren't you inviting me in
for a drink of water?

61
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,319
How about

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
we go to your room?

63
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,519
Sure.

64
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,120
Let's go.

65
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,839
(Gu Nian,)

66
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,839
(give me a little more time.)

67
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,160
(I will take care of everything.)

68
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,400
(Wei Group)

69
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,439
Sir,

70
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,240
Wei Group hasn't
delivered the raw materials yet.

71
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,439
We can't start work.

72
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,759
So it really is you.

73
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,360
The chemist.

74
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,319
Leave now.

75
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,560
You seem

76
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,920
not surprised.

77
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,000
When did you figure it out?

78
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,759
(The night Zhao Yan was hit,)

79
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,079
(you suddenly showed up.)

80
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,319
(Shortly after,
Gu Nian's place was searched.)

81
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,040
(But what convinced me was)

82
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,160
(I gave the tracking bracelet from you)

83
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,759
(to Gu Nian in Tai City.)

84
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,639
(But when she returned it to me,)

85
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,399
(Peng Li's chip I secretly put in)

86
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,639
(during our escape was already gone.)

87
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,319
(Only someone close to her
could get the chip)

88
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,319
(without raising her suspicion.)

89
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,160
To see me,

90
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,600
you made quite a stir.

91
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,120
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

92
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:22,959
If you do,

93
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,439
who else can you
make such a good scapegoat?

94
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,240
What do you want?

95
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,199
To make drugs.

96
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,720
Fine.

97
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,120
Stay away from Gu Nian.

98
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:36,839
What?

99
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,240
You can't do it?

100
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,759
Of course I can.

101
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,319
It's just a woman.

102
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,680
(I found a hospital building plan
on Zhou Shen's laptop.)

103
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,839
Strangely, this plan shows
there's a mezzanine.

104
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,759
If the hospital really has a mezzanine,

105
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,040
it explains how Zhao Yan managed

106
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,639
to disappear from the hospital.

107
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,079
(So this elevator card)

108
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,879
(should be the key.)

109
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,600
(What exactly is this place?)

110
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:05,240
(This is a drug factory?)

111
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,639
(My mom and the dean got killed)

112
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,759
(after they found out here?)

113
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,399
Who are you? Stop.

114
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,200
I'm new here.

115
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,559
New here?

116
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,399
Turn around.

117
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,840
Someone broke in.

118
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,960
She ran to the elevator.

119
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,320
After her!

120
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't let her get away.

121
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,120
Nian.

122
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,759
Why are you here?

123
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,279
You said you were unwell.

124
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,720
So I rushed over to your place.

125
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,120
But you weren't at home.

126
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,120
I figured you might be here.

127
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,039
Are you feeling unwell?

128
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,519
You're sweating so much.

129
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,360
I'm much better now.

130
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,840
Then let me take you home.

131
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,679
No need. I have something to do.
I'm leaving.

132
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,039
(I need to get out of here quickly.)

133
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,720
Let go of me! Help!

134
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,960
Let me go!

135
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,679
Don't move.

136
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:58,799
What are you doing?

137
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,440
Mind your position!

138
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,559
Gu Nian already knows
about the hospital's mezzanine.

139
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,440
So

140
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,919
she can't live.

141
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:23,296
Hello.

142
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,639
Can you locate Gu Nian?

143
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,879
The informant found her.

144
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,320
I'll send you the location.

145
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,360
When will the police act?

146
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,200
Support is on the way. Don't be rash.

147
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,720
I can't wait.

148
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,039
She can't be pulled into this.

149
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,039
What's your plan?

150
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,639
Do you want to act alone?

151
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,639
Don't mess around.

152
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,399
Qian, I've been looking for you.

153
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,600
What are you doing here?

154
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,399
Weren't we supposed
to try on wedding dresses together?

155
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,559
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,399
I've been busy.

157
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,080
Where are you going?

158
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,399
You're going to find Gu Nian, right?

159
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,919
No.

160
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:01,519
I need to be away for a few days.

161
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,399
Will you make it back in time
for the wedding next week?

162
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,960
Don't worry. I'll be there.

163
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
What's that noise?

164
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,399
Who are you?

165
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,679
Who exactly are you?

166
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,320
Come with me. I'll get you out.

167
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Where do you think you are going?

168
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:09,720
Let's go.

169
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:11,919
Don't move.

170
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,480
