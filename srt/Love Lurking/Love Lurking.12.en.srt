00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,439
Who's there?

4
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,079
You...

5
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,520
Who are you?

6
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,399
Speak, or I'll call for help.

7
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,119
Mr. Song,

8
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,039
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,000
Get out.

10
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:57,799
Okay.

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,600
Sorry, Mr. Song.

12
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,240
Please carry on.

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,519
Dr. Gu,

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,120
why did you come to the warehouse?

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,840
I was lost.

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,439
You were?

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,560
Do you think I'll buy it?

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,319
Suit yourself.

19
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,799
Did I say you could go?

20
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:30,799
Let me go!

21
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,359
Stop.

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,239
Stop.

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,519
It was you.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,200
The one in the dean's office that night

25
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,159
was you.

26
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,319
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,719
(He's the one who killed the dean.)

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,400
Let go of me!

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,040
Stop.

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,719
(I couldn't have misheard.)

31
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,199
(It was his voice.)

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,199
I've arrived.

33
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,199
Where are you?

34
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,840
What do you want?

35
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,680
I suggest you leave immediately.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,800
My friend called the police.

37
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,039
Stop talking with her.

38
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,000
Take her back first.

I was passing by.

51
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,319
Passing by?

52
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,360
Or was it premeditated?

53
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,240
What?

54
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,120
You suspect I'm with them?

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,840
Song Qian, who exactly are you?

56
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,439
Do you still suspect I'm that K?

57
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,360
I've said it.

58
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,120
I'm not him.

59
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,719
I know in the dean's office that night,

60
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,000
it was you who held me hostage.

61
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,680
I advise you
to confess everything to the police.

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,599
I don't care what

63
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,000
makes you think I killed the dean.

64
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,399
If you have evidence,

65
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,040
just take it to the police.

66
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,879
What are you doing, Song Qian?

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,560
Dr. Gu,

68
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,800
I don't know who you've offended.

69
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,160
But here's my advice.

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,519
Don't dig into some things.

71
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,959
What happened tonight
should be your warning.

72
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,920
No rescuer comes every time

73
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,199
you're in danger.

74
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,800
(Someone of his status
wouldn't do it personally.)

75
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,920
(Then why was he at the scene?)

76
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,920
(But regardless,)

77
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,519
(tonight's attack on me)

78
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,879
(proves someone wants me
to stop investigating.)

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
If Song Qian did kill the dean,

80
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,519
I'd be the eyewitness.

81
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,759
Then why would he rescue me?

82
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,360
Sir,

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,920
her phone only has

84
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,560
a few photos of Wei Group

85
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
and nothing else suspicious.

86
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,000
Destroy the phone.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,720
And keep close watch on Gu Nian.

88
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,040
Yes, Sir.

89
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,120
But if she becomes suspicious of you,

90
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,000
what should I do?

91
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,959
Then eliminate her.

92
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:04,879
Dr. Gu,

93
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,160
look at the mess you've made.

94
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,240
Since yesterday,

95
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,639
drugs from Wei Group
not yet approved for sale

96
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,600
are already being sold on the market.

97
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,199
Impossible.

98
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,040
I personally supervised every shipment.

99
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,600
There couldn't have been leaks.

100
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,959
It's not my problem.

101
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,519
Nurse Lin can vouch for me.

102
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,040
Dr. Gu, I was indeed present then.

103
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,199
But I don't know
if there were any drug leaks.

104
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,639
I just followed the trucks.

105
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,639
I can't take responsibility for this.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,439
You...

107
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,519
Dr. Gu,

108
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,000
you're suspended pending investigation.

109
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,000
Chief, you think I'm reselling drugs?

110
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,240
You've been managing
this project from day one.

111
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,639
Now that there's trouble,

112
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,800
the responsibility is definitely yours.

113
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,399
I won't admit to something I didn't do.

114
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,240
But I will get to the truth.

115
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,600
Chief, please give me three days.

116
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,839
If I can't find anything,

117
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,199
I will resign voluntarily.

118
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:11,439
Hello.

119
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,199
I'd like to confirm

120
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,959
when Mr. Song can meet me.

121
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,800
Dr. Gu, we've informed Mr. Song
on your behalf.

122
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,040
But unfortunately,

123
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,800
Mr. Song said
he can't see you right now.

124
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,199
Qian.

125
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,160
Let's go eat.

126
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,800
Okay.

127
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,439
Don't worry, Miss Wei.

128
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,800
She won't find any evidence.

129
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,519
Soon she'll face disciplinary action
and dismissal from the hospital,

130
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,800
or maybe even jail time.

131
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,519
I accessed the Wei Group
and the hospital's surveillance.

132
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,800
The hospital surveillance footage
has no blind spots.

133
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,399
But Wei Group's footage...

134
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,560
Look.

135
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,040
This drug delivery truck
was in a blind zone.

136
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,160
This completely fails
to prove your innocence.

137
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,759
Wei Group seems fishy.

138
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,319
This matter is serious, Nian.

139
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,399
You might go to jail.

140
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,399
The same method
was used to frame my mother.

141
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,439
It's the same.

142
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,800
No witnesses.

143
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,600
No surveillance.

144
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Is your mother's death

145
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,360
related to the Wei Group?

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And the dean's death
might also be related to the Wei Group.

147
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
I know they were murdered,

148
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,159
but I have no evidence.

149
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,399
One day,

150
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,759
we will uncover the truth.

151
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,679
Look here.

152
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,639
This car never turned off its engine.

153
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,120
Its dashcam must've recorded everything.

154
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
This license plate looks familiar.

155
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,960
Likely Wei Group's top executives'.

156
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,000
But this parking lot requires
official documentation for entry.

157
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,440
How do we get the documentation?

158
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,320
Nian, there's always a solution.

159
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,919
Guess I'll have
to trade on my good looks.

160
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,240
Sir.

161
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,159
Miss, are you okay?

162
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,879
Can you help me up, please?

163
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,759
I sprained my ankle.

164
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,320
Are you okay?

165
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,759
(This license plate...)

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,440
(There.)

167
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,240
Who is it?

168
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,759
Excuse me.

169
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,519
Let me hide here.

170
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,399
Dr. Gu,

171
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,120
this is trespassing.

172
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,519
I can call the police on you.

173
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,679
