(Song Qian, why is it you?)

4
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,640
Song Qian, wake up.

5
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,600
(You can't die.)

6
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,119
(I still have so much to ask you.)

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,399
Wake up quickly.

8
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,000
Song Qian?

9
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,400
Song Qian.

10
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,799
Why did you save me?

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,439
Aren't you with them?

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,439
Speak up.

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
Tell me, why did you save me?

14
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,799
Search! They can't have gone far.

15
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,840
Luckily, it's just a graze.

16
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,079
I'll apply medicine

17
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,400
and bandage it. You'll be fine.

18
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,920
So I escaped another danger.

19
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,159
Don't worry.

20
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,519
With me here,

21
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
you're not going to die.

22
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,560
You owe me a lot of explanations.

23
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,280
The dinner you said is fish?

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,919
Yes.

25
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,120
Look at this place.

26
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,400
What else can we eat?

27
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,199
We might have to stay the night here.

28
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
Then why aren't you catching any?

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,479
I'm injured. I can't catch any.

30
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,639
Okay.

31
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,400
I'll catch mine.

32
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Catch your own meal.

33
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,159
Are you sure I can catch fish here?

34
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,199
What are you laughing at?

35
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,639
Stop laughing.

36
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,639
Stop it.

37
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,240
Don't laugh.

38
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,879
I'm not catching anymore.

39
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,840
Don't laugh.

40
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
They're over there.

41
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,319
Go!

42
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,639
I...

43
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:09,960
Song Qian.

44
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:10,840
Let's go.

45
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,120
Don't worry. I won't let you die.

46
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,720
Is it that important?

47
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,759
You're risking your life.

48
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,639
Yes, it is.

49
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,040
It's more important than my life.

50
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,439
(He's done many non-drug-dealer things.)

51
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,600
(He seems more like...)

52
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,816
(Officer Zhang Han)

53
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,399
(Officer Zhang Han?)

54
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,600
Song Qian,

55
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,439
where are you?

56
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,680
Are you okay?

57
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,079
Officer Zhang Han,

58
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,639
he's at home now.

59
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,399
Are you Gu Nian?

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,120
Officer Zhang Han.

♪What is secretly stirring♪

62
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,360
Are you okay?

63
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,720
I'm fine.

64
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,839
Is he...?

65
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,439
It seems you've guessed.

66
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,680
Three years ago,

67
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,319
(I sent him
to infiltrate the Wei family)

68
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,800
(to get close to Wei Qing)

69
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,688
(to find the chemist.)

70
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,639
(Later, the Wei family)

71
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,199
(sent him to Tai City
to deal with the Peng brothers.)

72
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,240
(He gathered intel
on Tai City's drug network.)

73
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,279
(Although he obtained
their criminal records,)

74
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,480
(he was severely injured.)

75
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,439
(Fortunately,)

76
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,120
(this mission earned him
the Wei family's trust.)

77
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,639
(He entered the inner circle.)

78
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,720
(What I didn't expect was)

79
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,120
(that during that mission,)

80
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,720
(he would meet you.)

81
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,439
I don't know what your relationship is,

82
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,879
but he risked exposure to save you.

83
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,759
This shows he cares about you a lot.

84
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,680
I want to know

85
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,439
why he was at the scene
of the dean's murder.

86
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,319
(Actually, the dean, like your mom,)

87
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,759
(knew about the mezzanine.)

88
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,639
(And they both got the elevator card.)

89
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,199
(Song Qian found out)

90
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,720
(the Wei Group would send Zhao Yan
to kill the dean.)

91
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,120
(So we decided
to have Song Qian rescue him.)

92
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,000
(But unexpectedly,
when the dean was fighting Zhao Yan,)

93
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,959
(he had a heart attack.)

94
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,399
Dean?

95
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
- (Song Qian was a step too late.)
- Dean?

96
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,360
Dean, it's me, Nian.

97
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,399
(Maybe it's fate.)

98
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,800
(I didn't expect you would meet again.)

99
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,759
What about Zhao Yan?

100
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,000
Zhao Yan feared ending up
like the Peng brothers,

101
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,480
(and vanished with the card.)

102
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,680
(But he was hunted by the chemist.)

103
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,399
(Later, the elevator card
ended up with you by mistake,)

104
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,399
which exposed the chemist's identity.

105
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,319
The chemist is Zhou Shen.

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,279
This is the most critical moment
for Song Qian's mission.

107
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,279
We can't afford any risk.

108
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,639
You can't appear in public for now.

109
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,720
His mission is too dangerous.

110
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,079
Miss Gu,

111
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,839
he's not right for you.

112
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,399
I'll send someone for him.

113
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,879
I hope you won't see each other again.

114
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,120
(His mission is too dangerous.)

115
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,959
(Miss Gu, he's not right for you.)

116
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,759
(I hope you won't see each other again.)

117
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,799
Gu Nian,

118
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,679
why are you here?

119
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,639
You're burning.

120
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,080
You have a fever.

121
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,679
I'm fine. You should go.

122
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,840
Why aren't you leaving?

123
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,799
I'm not leaving.

124
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,200
I don't want it to end like in Tai City,

125
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,799
where we ended without saying anything.

126
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,559
Song Qian,

127
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,759
can we just not think about the future

128
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,000
or tomorrow?

129
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,440
Let's just focus on now.

130
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,879
Okay?

131
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,919
Do you truly want me to go?

132
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,679
If I go,

133
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,679
you'll regret it.

134
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,440
Gu Nian,

135
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,919
being with me is dangerous.

136
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,679
I'm afraid I'll lose you.

137
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,679
I'm not afraid.

138
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,440
Because you're here with me.

139
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,720
Stop pushing me away.

140
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,000
