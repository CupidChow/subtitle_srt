5
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,600

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,280
or Song Qian?

7
00:00:55,232 --> 00:00:56,384
What are you talking about?

8
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,759
I pressed it
when I was in danger just now.

The person who knew I was in danger
and would come to save me

10
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,439
would only be K.

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,799

12
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,599
"If you press it..."

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760

00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,400
I have my reasons.

19
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,400
Is it because of the Wei family?

20

81
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,600
Two king rooms, please.

82
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,839
Dr. Gu, what a coincidence!

83
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,199
Are you also here
for the medical seminar?

84
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,199
Sorry, miss,

85
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,199
but we only have
one king room available now.

86
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,000
Qian,

87
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,079
luckily we booked a suite.

88
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,560
Otherwise, we'd be competing
with Dr. Gu.

89
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,120
Senior,

90
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,279
do you mind sharing a room with me?

91
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,680
Not at all.

92
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,680
You're not a couple.

93
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,000
It's improper to share a room.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,079
Qian,

95
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,600
how do you know they're not a couple?

96
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,439
Sharing a room is quite normal.

97
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,959
That's right, Mr. Song.

98
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,680
Aren't you a bit meddlesome?

99
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,560
One king room, please.

100
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,040
Thank you.

103
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,519
I'll take a shower.

104
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,439
Okay.

105
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,879
Hello, Weiwei?

106
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,279
Did you open Zhou Shen's laptop?

107
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,440
I did.

108
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,480
But his office laptop is really clean.

109
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,000
There's no Zhao Yan's record.

110
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,720
Impossible.

(Clinic Prescription)

112
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,679
(The hospital prohibits
prescribing these drugs together.)

113
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,480
(Why would Senior Zhou...?)

114
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,320
(Zhao Yan?)

115
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,840
(He knows Zhao Yan?)

116
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,080
Nian?

117
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,704
Why are you here?

118
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,919
I wanted to invite you for lunch.

119
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,440

Wait a minute.

124
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,759
He has a second laptop.

125
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,720
Nian, be careful.

126
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,039

Nothing.

What do you want?

191
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Why not answer my call?

192
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,879
Why should I?

193
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,039
Don't you want to ask about the wedding?

194
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,080
No.

195
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,399
Mr. Song,

196
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,639
is there anything else?

197
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,919
If not, I'll be leaving.

198
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,039
Besides,

199
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,039
Zhou Shen is waiting for me.

200
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
I'll go back to my room.

201
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,559
Gu Nian,

202
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,919
Zhou Shen isn't the one.

203
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,000
Then who is the one for me?

204
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,320
You?

205
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,360
Do you think I would be
with a drug dealer?

206
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,759
Mr. Song,

207
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,240
please get your facts straight.

208
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,200
You have your fiancée.

209
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,759
And I have my fiancé.

210
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,000
Fiancé?

211
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,720
What fiancé?

212
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,320
I've already accepted his proposal.

213
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,519
Do you know what you're doing?

214
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,519
Of course, I do.

215
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,600
You and Wei Qing
are getting married next week.

216
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,919
Zhou Shen and I
are also getting married soon.

217
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,840
There's nothing between us anymore.

218
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,960
What do you mean by nothing?

219
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,039
You said you loved me.

220
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,039
That was in the past.

221
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,240
Now, whether you're K

222
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,919
or Song Qian,

223
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,799
I won't love you anymore.

224
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,240
Nian.
