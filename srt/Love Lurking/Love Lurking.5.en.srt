It's just the two of us here now.

11
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,120

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,680
entertain you well, K.

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,520
Get lost.

14
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,279
Don't touch me.

15

It's you again.

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,959
I'll take him back to his room.

17
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,000
No need to trouble you.

18
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,480
Kun won't let you leave.

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,240
It's fine.

20
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,719
Let them go.

21
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,359
Don't forget what you promised me.

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,600
You need it.

23
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,359
You should be very clear

24
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,719
about how guarded K is.

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,879
Why are you helping me?

26
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,120
He can't help me get out.

27
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,920
But you can.

28
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,479
Alright.

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,680
I'll give you a chance.

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
But

31
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,439
if you can't get the thing tonight,

32
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:19,879
I'll

33
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:20,879
sell you.

34
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,439
Be careful.

35
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,599
K,

36
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,439
wake up.

37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,920
No.

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,120
Don't move.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,919
Stop moving.

40
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,319
Or I won't be able to control myself.

41
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,319
Don't worry.

42
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,879
I won't hurt you.

43
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Help me to the bathroom.

00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,439
How is it?

45
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,879
Did you get the thing?

46
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,479
(Where's Gu Nian?)

47
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,760
K,

48
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:27,080
Boss wants to see you.

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,840
Boss,

50
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,640
what do you need?

51
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,719
K,

52
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,599
the ledger

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,319
was found in your room.

54
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,679
What ledger?

55
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,800
Stop playing dumb with me.

56
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,679
Gu Nian,

57
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,920
you found

58
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,480
this flash drive in K's room, right?

59
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,159
Yes.

60
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
Gu Nian,

61
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,920
why frame me?

62
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,400
K,

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,040
I've treated you well.

64
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,720
How could you betray me?

65
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,719
Boss,

66
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,800
I didn't betray you.

67
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,079
Boss,

68
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,919
torture him,

69
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,639
and we'll know who sent him.

70
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,400
Maybe

71
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,720
he's a cop.

72
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,639
If I were a cop,

73
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,319
would I leave the ledger in my own room

74
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,040
and wait for you to find it so easily?

75
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,479
Then why

76
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,920
was the flash drive in your room?

77
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
What you say now is useless.

78
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,600
Boss won't trust you anymore.

79
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,439
Kun,

80
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,959
I've found the flash drive for you.

81
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,800
When will you let me go?

82
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,159
Let you go?

83
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,480
Who said you could go?

84
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,000
You lied to me.

85
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,240
You said you'd let me go

86
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,279
if I put the flash drive

87
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,959
in K's room as told.

88
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,240
Nonsense!

89
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,079
I didn't tell you to do it.

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,519
So it was you

91
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,120
who gave her the flash drive

92
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,720
to frame me.

93
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,639
K,

94
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,479
watch your words.

95
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,680
Stop arguing.

96
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,480
The chip inside is missing.

97
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,080
Boss,

98
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,519
how is that possible?

99
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,800
It was you.

100
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,760
Now I get it.

101
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,680
It's definitely you.

102
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,799
And you.

103
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,079
You two set me up.

104
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,320
Gu Nian,

105
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,920
how dare you mess with me!

106
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,160
I'm going to kill you.

107
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,119

108
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,359

109

110
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,319
Gu Nian can't leave.

111
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,480
She messed with me.

112
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,320
I'll discipline

113
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
my person when she errs.

114
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,800
Let go of me!

115
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,360
Let go of me!

116
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,440
Boss,

117
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,720
if we let them go,

118
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,480
we'll never recover the chip.

119
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,560
You think the ledger

120
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,120
can leave the island so easily?

121
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,039
Dr. Gu,

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,079
you acted quite well.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,120
You taught me that.

124
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,680
Kun wants the flash drive tonight.

125
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,480
Since he wants it,

126
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,040
give it to him.

127
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,839

128
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,360
