00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,640
Nian, you're awake.

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,960
How are you?

5
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,679
Do you feel uncomfortable?

6
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,000
What about the arsonists?

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,200
They turned themselves in.

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,759
But the leader said

9
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,640
he just wanted to scare you.

10
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,960
He never expected
the warehouse to catch fire.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,719
Did he tell you who instigated it?

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,439
I can tell you.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,280
You seduced her fiancé.

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,640
(Wei Qing?)

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,079
Nian,

16
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,439
stop investigating.

If I hadn't arrived in time

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,680
to get you out of the warehouse,

19
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,760
you'd have died.

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,319
It was you

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,879
who saved me?

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,040
(Was it my imagination?)

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,840
Nian,

24
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,719
give me a chance.

25
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,760
I want to be with you and protect you.

26
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,640

Please go out first.

43
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,520
Okay.

44
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,520
I know it was Wei Qing
who instructed them.

45
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,960
I recorded it this time.

46
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,120
Listen to it.

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,039
I'll call the police

It's your choice.

Gu Nian,

51
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,319
can you not be so stubborn?

52
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,919
I'll call the police.

53
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,199
If you don't want any trouble,

54
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,039
take me to see Zhao Yan soon.

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,240
Since you're so persistent,

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,919
meet me at this place tonight.

57
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,560
Wait.

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,879
During the warehouse fire,

59
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,400
were you there?

60
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,919
I wasn't.

61
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
Brother, why are you here?

62
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,039
I hope the warehouse thing

63
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,079
won't happen again.

64
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
How could you speak to me
like this for that woman?

65
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,839
If you dare hurt her again,

66
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,240
I'll...

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,879
What?

68
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,839
Will you kill your sister

69
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
because of her?

70
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,079
Don't forget,

71
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,839
you're the one
who got her mother killed.

72
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,439
What do you think will happen
if she ever finds out?

73
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,240
I've won, haven't I?

74
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,920
The people here are dangerous.

75
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,240
I'm not responsible
for anything that happens.

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,360
I don't need you to be.

77
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,600
Sir, this is a private area.

78
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,040
Please go.

79
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,240
A Premium Card?

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,600
Go ahead.

81
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,319
Please come inside.

82
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,399
What did you give him?

83
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,040
The owner here is a know-it-all.

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,920
This card can make him do anything.

85
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,120
Stop playing.

86
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,800
If something happens later,

87
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,759
leave when I say so.

88
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,279
What about you?

89
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,600
Mind your own business.

90
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,160
Who is this?

91
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,319
It's been a long time,

92
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,680
K.

93
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,000
You're mistaken.

94
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,199
I'm not K.

95
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,360
You're not K?

96
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,079
Then why do you have this card?

97
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,680
I've given this card to two people.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,240
If you're not him,

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,480
then who are you?

100
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,639
I'm with the Wei family.

101
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,199
The Wei family?

102
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,439
So you're

103
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,040
the new head of the Wei family.

104
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,839
You really look like K.

105
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,639
I thought he had come back to life.

106
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,639
And you're...

107
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,839
I'm his fiancée.

108
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,240
So you're Miss Wei.

109
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,360
But,

110
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,560
from how I remember Miss Wei,

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,160
you look a bit

112
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,519
different.

113
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,759
What?

114
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,160
Why so serious?

115
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,079
I was just going to say,

116
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,040
Miss Wei seems to have gotten prettier.

117
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,079
Let's talk business.

118
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,519
I'm here for Zhao Yan.

119
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,920
That's strange.

120
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,439
Lately, everyone
has been asking me for Zhao Yan.

121
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Name your price.

122
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,000
With so many people after him,

123
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,160
it's not just about money anymore.

124
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
How about

125
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,839
you trade something precious
to you with me?

126
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,480
For example,

127
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,279
Miss Wei.

128
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,800
Your casino in the southeast

129
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,839
is under my control.

130
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,240
If you don't want
to lose this place too,

131
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,319
I suggest you comply.

132
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,639
Are you sure Zhao Yan is here?

133
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,519
You can just go in
and see for yourselves.

134
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:45,879
Kun?

135
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,720
Gu Nian,

136
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,200
K,

137
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,360
I'm not dead.

138
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,120
You must be upset, right?

139
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,679
I know you're looking for Zhao Yan.

140
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,159
So I spread the rumor that he's here

141
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,559
to lure you out.

142
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,360
Surprised, aren't you?

143
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,320
Let's go.

144
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,320
Get them.

145
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,799
Yes,

146
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,360
Kun.

147
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,639
Kun,

148
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,799
this isn't Tai City.

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,240
If you do anything to us,

150
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,399
the police won't let you off.

151
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,360
I've been living on the edge for years.

152
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,200
I'm not afraid of the police.

153
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,080
Even if I die,

154
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,919
I'll take you two with me.

155
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,320
It's worth it.

156
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,600
Let her go.

157
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
I agree to all your demands.

158
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,120
Let her go?

159
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,159
K,

160
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,120
I want you and her
to join Boss in the grave.

161
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
I'm not K.

162
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,200
You're mistaken.

163
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,320
You aren't?

164
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,799
Go on, keep pretending.

165
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,120
Qian, help!

166
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,159
Qian!

167
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,399
- Move.
- Qian!

168
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,960
Help!

169
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,399
Qian!

170
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,000
None of you
can get out of here alive today.

171
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,159
And you!

172
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,000
We've done so much for the Wei family.

173
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Just because we are no longer useful,

174
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,000
you actually sent him
to get rid of us all.

175
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,200
K,

176
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,639
are you still going
to deny your identity?

177
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,360
I don't know what you mean.

178
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,360
Fine.

179
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,159
Then keep acting.

180
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,279
Miss Wei,

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,159
you probably don't know yet,

182
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,519
but your fiancé and this woman

183
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,000
were quite intimate in Tai City.

184
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,440
He even risked his life

185
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,000
and jumped into the sea to save her.

186
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:55,720
K,

187
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,440
considering we were once brothers,

188
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,039
I'll give you a chance to save them.

189
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,240
I have another gun here.

190
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,440
Let's see who you'll choose.

191
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,159
Your fiancée,

192
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,360
or your old lover?

193
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,799
Pick one to kill.

194
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,000
Then I'll let the other go,

195
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,120
and you can have a happily ever after.

196
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,360
How about it?

197
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,159
If you don't choose,

198
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,559
I'll just kill them both.

199
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,360
Help!

200
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,000
Qian, help!

201
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Make your choice.

202
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,919
If you don't choose now, I'll shoot.

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,559
(Song Qian,)

204
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,919
(stall for time.)

205
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,600
(The sniper is ready.)

206
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,519
Choose.

207
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,240
Qian!

208
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,519
Qian, help!

209
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,759
Go ahead.

210
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,799
Qian, help!

211
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,480
Qian!

212
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,000
Qian!

213
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,919
Qian, help!

214
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,879
Hurry up.

215
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,399
I'm not as patient as you.

216
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,639
Qian.

217
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,159
Help!

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,799
Qian.

219
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,639
Qian.

220
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,240
Help, Qian.

221
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,360
Qian.

222
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,679
Qian.

223
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,279
Why don't you shoot?

224
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,639
Shoot!

225
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,679
I'm telling you to shoot.
