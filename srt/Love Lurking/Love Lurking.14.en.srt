Morning, Mr. Song.

Yesterday at the bar,

68
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,879
you had someone drug me, right?

69
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,279
Do you have any proof?

70
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,480
I was not fully conscious,

71
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,679
but I managed to record a video
of your assistant following me.

72
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,320
If I hand this video over to the police,

73
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,919
won't it cause you some trouble?

74
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,480
Don't forget,
you're at my place right now.

75
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,200
How could I possibly
let you go to the police?

76
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,240
Do you think you can walk out of here?

77
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,799
Before Weiwei and I
went to the bar yesterday,

78
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,360
I told her that if I didn't come home
in over 12 hours, she'd call the police.

79
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,159
Is this a threat?

80
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,360

88
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,480
