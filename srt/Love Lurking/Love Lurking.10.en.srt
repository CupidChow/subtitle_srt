Hello. I'd like to see Mr. Song.

29
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,120
Do you have an appointment?

30
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,400
No.

Let me check for you then.

Please wait a moment.

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,560
Thank you.

00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,520
This is my fifth time coming here.

35
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,479
I want to know when Mr. Song can see me.

36
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,520
I'm sorry. Mr. Song has left the office.

37
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,120
What?

38
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,159
Mr. Song, you promised
to spend tonight with me.

39
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,479
No. You promised to stay with me.

40
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
That depends on your performance.

41
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,080
Sir.

42
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,680
Miss Gu comes looking for you every day.

43
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,879
Won't you see her?

44
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,039
Plenty of people
want to see me every day.

45
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,080
Just send her away.

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,319
If I'm a representative
of Grace Hospital,

47
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,280

Mr. Song.

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,560
Miss Gu.

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,560
I never expected

51
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,680
you'd actually track me down here.

52
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,639
I just want to verify some things
with you.

53
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,759
Are you avoiding me?

54
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,319
I don't even know you.

55
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,919
Why should I meet you?

56
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,680
But you must know my hospital's dean.

57
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,959
He made the last call to you
before his death.

58
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,120
Are you suspecting me?

59
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,120
I just want to know
what the dean told you.

60
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,160
The Wei Group has always collaborated
with hospitals.

61
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,439
It was normal contact.

62
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,360
Anything wrong with that?

63
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,959
Wait.

64
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Mr. Song,
have you ever been to Tai City?

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,160
No.

66
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,120
Six months ago, I was in Tai City

67
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,759
and met some drug dealers.

68
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,439
There was a man among them
who looked exactly like you.

69
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,319
He risked his life to save me.

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,680
I just want to know
if you and he could be...

71
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,000
Could be the same person?

72
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,720
Miss Gu,

73
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,319
are you implying I'm a drug dealer?

74
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,720
Do you realize what you're saying?

75
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,120
That's not what I meant.

76
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,240
Then what did you mean?

77
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,839
Many people try to get close to me.

78
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,720
But using this kind of approach,

79
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,480
you're the first.

80
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,920
I just want to know

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,319
if he's still alive.

82
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,399
Fine.

83
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,040
I have a question.

84
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,920
What exactly
is your relationship with him?

85
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,399
He's

86
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,480
a friend I'm not very close to.

87
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,040
A friend you're not very close to

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,399
is worth all your concern?

89
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,519
Miss Gu,

90
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,040

Third,

100
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,839
I've never saved anyone.

Is that clear enough?

00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,319

I never expected
your hands that save patients

142

Miss Gu, I'm not used
to your hard-to-get act.

143
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,840
Next time, just state
your consultation fee upfront.

144
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,279

147
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,360
Why did you hit me?

148
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,720

has been harassing Qian lately.

00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,919

150
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840

151
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,320

152

153

Fiancee?

154

I've seen plenty of women like you.

155
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,080

156
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,919
You have no manners at all.

157
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,840
My manners prevent me
from hitting people casually.

158
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,679
You should've slapped Mr. Song,

159
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,919
instead of me.

160

It's known as blindness.
