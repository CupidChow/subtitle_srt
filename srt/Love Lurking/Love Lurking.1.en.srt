1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,400
Do you want me

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,800
to take your clothes off

3
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:15,400
or you take them off yourself?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,839
Whatever.

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,359
I'll consider it a dog bite.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Your mouth is tough,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,640
but your body is soft.

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,719
Welcome to Tai City.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,880
Let me go!

10
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,840
Scoundrel!

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,920
Off course.

12
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,640
Recalculating route for you.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,840
Nian?

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,000
The address is wrong.

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,679
- Are you sure the person...
- You've entered Tai City.

16
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,359
Come back.

17
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,399
Don't go near Tai City.

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,439
Sir?

19
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,719
(There is still a pulse.)

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,680
No wounds?

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,280
Isn't this blood his?

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,840
What were you doing?

23
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,000
Let me go.

24
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,479
We found K

25
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,759
and a woman.

26
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:58,240
=Love Lurking=

27
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,744
=Episode 1=

28
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,919
If K refuses to say anything,

29
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,360
just kill him.

30
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,560
Leave me alone.

31
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,319
You smell so good.

32
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,919
This is the pulmonary artery.

33
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,159
Press it if you want to live.

34
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,840
She's there.

35
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,400
Let me go.

36
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,400
Shut up.

37
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,280
Stop moving, or I'll kill you.

38
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,759
Have you found that woman?

39
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,040
No. And you?

40
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
I haven't, either.

41
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,000
Shall we go inside and look?

42
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,720
K's body is still inside.

43
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Don't look for trouble.

44
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,839
Let's look elsewhere first.

45
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,279
Let's go.

46
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,000
You guys look in K's room.

47
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,839
K ran away.

48
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,439
Who exactly are you?

49
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,439
And who are you?

50
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,319
Speak.

51
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,199
I drove by and saved you.

52
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,000
And then they took me here.

53
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,279
You saved me?

54
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,199
Or you tried to kill me?

55
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,560
You were having a traumatic pneumothorax
at that time.

56
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,319
If I hadn't done that, you'd have died.

57
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,600
I remember the way in.

58
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,120
Let me go and I'll take you out.

59
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:38,816
They're drug dealers.

60
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:40,920
Stay with me if you want to live.

61
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,279
Drug dealers?

62
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,639
They are here!

63
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,639
Hurry!

64
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,480
Search!

65
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:08,960
No one here.

66
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,680
No one.

67
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,480
Let's go.

68
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,319
To another room.

69
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:11,639
Okay.

70
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,519
Stay here.

71
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,920
A-Are you okay?

72
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,199
Hurry and go.

73
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,519
Go!

74
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,439
Nobody move.

75
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,879
Put down your guns.

76
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,279
Yes, K.

77
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,560
Impressive,

78
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:45,720
K.

79
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,920
You handled so many people alone.

80
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,680
You're late.

81
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,680
If I hadn't helped handle

82
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,279
the people outside,

83
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,519
do you think

84
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,839
you could still be alive?

85
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,040
If I hadn't deliberately
let them catch me,

86
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,879
could you retrieve that batch?

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,439
Daring to steal our goods?

88
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,360
Idiots.

89
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,079
Get rid of everyone here.

90
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,560
Yes, Kun.

91
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,439
This chick is not bad.

92
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,040
I found your work ID

93
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,519
in the car outside.

94
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,960
Gu Nian?

95
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,720
From the international medical team?

96
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,279
It seems keeping you is trouble.

97
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,759
I planned to keep you for fun.

98
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,960
Kill her.

99
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,360
Wait.

100
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,120
I-I saved you.

101
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,480
You saved the wrong person.

102
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,759
He is a drug dealer.

103
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,000
Since you brought her back,

104
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,320
you do it.

105
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,000
No.

106
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,279
I am a doctor.

107
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,360
Keeping me is useful to you.

108
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No? Then I will do it.
