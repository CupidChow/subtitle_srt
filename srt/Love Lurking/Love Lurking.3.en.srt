00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,159
Stop!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,840
Let go!

5
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,240
Tell me.

6
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,159
How did you know I wasn't here?

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,679
You admit it?

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,079
You were testing me?

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,039
How did you know?

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,399
Say it.

11
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,159
The rain started after we came back.

12
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,799
But there were muddy footprints
in the bathroom.

13
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,000
So

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,319
you must have gone out.

15
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,560
You're the "intruder" they want, right?

16
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,959
How about we make a deal?

17
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,239
If you let me go,

18
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,200
I promise I won't tell anyone about it.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,120
You think since you know about that,

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,519
you can threaten me?

21
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,959
I can kill you right now.

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,079
Go ahead.

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,000
Kill me.

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,519
Are you really not afraid of death?

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,519
I am.

26
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,079
I'm so afraid of death.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,319
So I'm trying to
find a way to live, right?

28
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,680
If they can't find the intruder tonight,

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,199
they'll naturally suspect someone here.

30
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,280
If you kill me now,

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,599
no one can testify for you.

32
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,039
I bet you'll end up like me.

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,360
Either let me go,

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,520
or

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,520
we die together.

36
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,240
I really underestimated you.

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,360
But I hate being threatened.

38
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,360
What are you doing?

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,360
What is this?

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,599
If I press this,

41
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,039
the thing on your ankle
will explode immediately.

42
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Forget about removing it.

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,039
Because only I have the code.

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,360
You're mad.

45
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,840
Everyone here is mad.

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,439
If you dare to say a word,

47
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,159
you will surely die.

48
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,039
Why do this to me?

49
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,039
I just want to go home.

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,759
Useless!

51
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,759
You mean

52
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,719
the ledger was stolen?

53
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,439
If we can't find it,

54
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,919
we will both die.

55
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,120
Kun, I swear.

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,199
My security was airtight.

57
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,800
Not even a fly could get in.

58
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,879
Then tell me,

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,120
how did the intruder get in?

60
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,120
Could it be

61
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,919
that we have a mole here?

62
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,400
K, open the door.

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,759
Tonight, someone was indeed

64
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,240
quite suspicious.

65
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,759
What are you doing?

66
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,800
(No, I can't confront him directly now.)

67
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,839
I want to take a shower.

68
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,040
Everyone here is mad.

69
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,160
If you dare to say a word,

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,680
you will surely die.

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
(Keeping her
will eventually be a problem.)

72
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,600
(Even though he doesn't kill me now,)

73
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,600
(there's no guarantee later he will...)

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,759
Why took so long?

75
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,079
Well...

76
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,920
Can you give me some other clothes?

77
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,639
What are you doing?

78
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,680
Stop.

79
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,759
I'll have someone
bring you some clothes later.

80
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,560
K.

81
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,800
Kun wants to see you.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Got it.

83
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I warn you.

84
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,439
Stay in this room.

85
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,920
Or face the consequences.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,439
(There are so many guards outside.)

87
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,319
(There's no way to escape.)

88
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,439
Take her.

89
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,439
Kun,

90
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,000
why don't we interrogate K directly?

91
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,560
You think I don't want to?

92
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,240
If we do anything to him

93
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,920
but find out nothing,

94
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,560
the boss will be unhappy.

95
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,040
But this woman

96
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,920
can let me know a lot of things.

97
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,000
Kun, you're so wise.

98
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
You don't think

99
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,199
K will come to save you, do you?

100
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,319
I am his person now.

101
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,240
Aren't you afraid

102
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,959
that he'll come after you?

103
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,319
K

104
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,560
would offend me for a mere plaything?

105
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,720
Tell me.

106
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,839
Did K leave the room last night?

107
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,680
(I can't tell him.)

108
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,399
(If I do, I'll die immediately.)

109
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,079
No.

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,680
No.

111
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,040
I knew you wouldn't talk so easily.

112
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,199
So

113
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,879
I've prepared something nice for you

114
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,199
to "entertain" you well.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,959
This is something worse than death.

116
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,959
Wait.

117
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,040
What?

118
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,160
You'll talk now?

119
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,639
We...

120
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,000
We didn't leave the room.

121
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,279
Are you fooling me?

122
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,879
But I can help you.

123
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,319
What?

124
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,639
I can monitor him for you.

125
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,879
With just you?

126
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,519
With just me.

127
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,920
He took me here.

128
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,160
He won't guard against me.

129
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,319

130
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,639
why should I trust you?

131
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,879
Because

132
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,480
I want to live.

133
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,079
You want to live?

134
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,560

K left the room last night,

I'll let you go immediately.
