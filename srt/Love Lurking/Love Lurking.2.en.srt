=Episode 2=

3
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,920
What are you doing, K?

4
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,960
Do you want to let her go?

5
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,000
Are you seeking death?

6
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,759
She's right.

7
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,640
It's indeed useful to keep her.

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,359
Let's enjoy her for a few days
before selling her to the rebels.

9
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,920
It's more beneficial.

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,120
I'm impressed, K.

11
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,000
But I seem to remember

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,560
you don't like women, right?

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,480
How about letting me
have a taste of her first?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,319
She's quite to my taste right now.

15
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,599
Let go of me! Put me down!

16
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,400
Let go of me!

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,280
Keep an eye.

18
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,079
Kun,

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,519
that woman can't escape.

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,040
I didn't mean that woman,

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
but K.

22
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,400
Tonight

23
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,280
he was a bit strange.

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,240
Let go of me, you scoundrel!

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,520
Let go of me!

26
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,520
Instead of tormenting me,

27
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,759
you might as well kill me now.

28
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,120
Want to die?

29
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,240
Where do you think this place is?

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,719
Where you can die because you want to?

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,680
Listen.

32
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,400
If you die,

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,479
guess if I can find
your family and friends.

34
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,680
You beast!

35
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,599
Quite the commotion.

36
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,560
Beast?

37
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,800
Do you know what a beast is like?

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,039
Welcome to Tai City.

39
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,360
Do you want me

40
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,879
to take off your clothes
or you take them off yourself?

41
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,000
Whatever. I'll consider it a dog bite.

42
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Your mouth is tough,

43
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,120
but your body is soft.

44
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,599
Truly exciting.

45
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,039
Keep screaming.

46
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,479
Scream louder.

47
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:41,919
What?

48
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,960
Or do you want me to make it real?

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,639
Stop it.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,319
I'm not interested in you.

51
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
But you have to keep screaming

52
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,639
so that people outside can hear you.

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
It's indeed useful to keep her.

54
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,240
Let's enjoy her for a few days
before selling her to the rebels.

55
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,680
It's more beneficial.

56
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,680
(They are guarding outside.)

57
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,160
(How can I leave?)

58
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,680
(Get Peng Li's ledger,)

59
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,600
(and your task will be complete.)

60
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,759
Kun, what happened?

61
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,279
We have an intruder.

62
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
A full search is needed.

63
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:53,920
K!

64
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,720
K!

65
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,560
Open the door!

66
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,560
K!

67
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,680
Open the door!

68
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,800
Did he go out?

69
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:05,879
No.

70
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,920
We never left.

71
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,040
Kick it open.

72
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,439
- No one here.
- No one here, either.

73
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,199
No one here.

74
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,600
Kun, there's no one.

75
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,399
No?

76
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,360
K.

77
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,920
Why standing there?

78
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,240
Search!

79
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,560
Yes.

80
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,959
Who let you in?

81
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,160
Search the room.

82
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,800
Don't you dare ignore me.

83
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,160
We have an intruder.

84
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,879
All rooms must be searched.

85
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,800
Do you think a third person
could fit in such a small bathroom?

86
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
Still not leaving?

87
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,079
I advise you to search elsewhere.

88
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,839
Or the boss won't like your explanation.

89
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:43,959
Let's go.

90
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,120
If it weren't for me,

91
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,079
you'd have been dead.

92
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,480
What are you doing?

93
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,439
Do you want to die?

94
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,839
Give me your hand.

95
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
What are you doing?

96
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,680
Check the bathroom.

97
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,600
You like biting people, huh?

98
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,559
This is my last warning.

99
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,279
If you run again,

100
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,000
I won't save you.

101
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,519
All that awaits you is death.

102
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,519
Let me go.

103
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,000
So I won't cause you any trouble.

104
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,600
On what grounds should I let you go?

105
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,320
You were not in the bathroom just now.

106
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,240
Do you know what you are saying?

107
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,600
If they knew we were just acting,

108
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,039
what do you think they would think?

109
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,600
Are you threatening me?

110
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,399
If you let me go,

111
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,600
no one can threaten you.

112
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,799
Only the dead

113
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,159
pose no threat to me.
