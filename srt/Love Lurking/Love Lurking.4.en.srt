00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:35,879
I will

4
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,240
take her away now.

5
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,520
Let Boss come to me.

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,599
I've already given you chances.
You don't want it.

7
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,199
Get him!

8
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,319
Hold me tight

9
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,199
and close your eyes.

10
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:02,960
Why standing there?

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,840
All go get him!

12
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,199
K,

13
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,719
you will regret this.

14
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,880
You're awake.

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
Don't worry.

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,879
I had a cleaning lady
change your clothes.

17
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,599
I didn't tell them anything.

18
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,159
Can you untie this for me?

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,040
I don't want to be like a prisoner.

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,800
You...

21
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,879
What are you doing?

22
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,240
This is a tracker.

23
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,520
You lied to me?

24
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,319
Kun won't

25
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,560
give up easily.

26
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,479
If you're in danger,

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,879
just press it.

28
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,719
I'll go to save you.

29
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,439
(A tracker?)

30
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,639
(Then how can I escape?)

31
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,479
Forget about escaping.

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,400
If you don't escape,

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,680
I can keep you safe.

34
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
If you run,

35
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,319
you'll very likely die.

36
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,920
Understand?

37
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,520
What if I'm willing to take my chances?

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,240
No one can escape from this island,

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,199
including myself.

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,919
(It seems I need
to rely on him to leave.)

41
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,080
Not this medicine.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,280
Suddenly so nice to me...

43
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,879
What are you planning?

44
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,719
You saved me.

45
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,840
I'm just repaying you.

46
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,599
That's enough.

47
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,520
I haven't finished.

48
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,680
I don't like being touched.

49
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,680
(He's like a brick wall.)

50
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,439
The wound on your head

51
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,680
can be fatal

52
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,879
if it's not handled properly.

53
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,319
We are in the same boat now.

54
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,759
You should at least trust me.

55
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,639
I won't run away anymore,

56
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800
nor will I reveal anything
about you to anyone.

57
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,120
But I hope

58
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,400
you can protect me.

59
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,720
Don't you fear I'll betray you?

60
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,040
I believe you are different from them.

Yet you trust me?

67
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,760
Well,

68
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,639
I'm not afraid of you.

69
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,119
Why?

70
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,800
At least you haven't hurt me.

71
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,439
Alright, I will give you a chance.

72
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
Tonight we leave the island.

73
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,920
I will hold Kun back for you.

74
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,639
You will help me?

75
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,959
But if you fail to escape,

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,920
I'll definitely deal with you.

77
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,960
Kun,

78
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,759
Boss will be back soon.

79
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,560
Will we be doomed?

80
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,959
The ledger is definitely with K.

81
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,199
He saved that woman.

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,399
That means he feels guilty.

83
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,799
Go.

84
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,600
Find me a woman.

85
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,279
K.

86
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,079
What?

87
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,160
You seem unhappy to see me.

88
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,679
Well,

89
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,079
I was impulsive today.

90
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,040
It's my fault.

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
Dr. Gu,

92
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,600
I apologize to you.

93
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,519
What?

94
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,319
Why be so petty?

95
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,959
We are buddies.

96
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,639
We share good things.

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
Today,

98
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,040
I've brought you a gift.

99
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,360
The most beautiful woman in Tai City,

100
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,240
Wanida.

101
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,919
Tonight,

102
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,759
have fun with K.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,920
K,

104
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,759
I want to learn to play billiards too.

105
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,120
How would you like it?

106
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,959
I want you to teach me personally.

107
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,599
Okay.

108
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,040
Remember, we have plans tonight.

109
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,079
What plans?

110
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,319
Make some room, okay?

111
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,159
Don't get in our way.

112
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,320
Where are you going?

113
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,039
Take this?

114
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,599
Me?

115
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,640
K,

116
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,240
aren't you going to teach me?

117
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,520
Watch carefully.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,840
Put your hand here.

119
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,679
Relax your waist.

120
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,160
And your shoulders.

121
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,560
Then inhale

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,440
and exhale.

123
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,200
Strike.

124
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,919
Did you learn it?

125
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,320
Play by yourself.

126
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,920
Your gift is too much.

127
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,480
Keep it for yourself.

128
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,119
Boss.

129
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,799
Why did you come back early?

130
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,560
Boss.

131
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,759
Is she the woman you fancy?

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,840
You don't want any
of the women given to you.

133
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,000
So you like this type.

134
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I think I've seen you somewhere.

135
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,519
Sorry.

136
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,600
I need to use the restroom.

137
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,759
(The person I have been looking for)

138
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,480
(turns out to be a drug dealer.)

139
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,159
(Why did he kill my mother?)

140
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,039
I heard you two

141
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,240
had a big fight

142
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,639
over this woman.

143
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,639
Boss,

144
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,519
we didn't.

145
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,080
We're still buddies.

146
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,160
K,

147
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,480
have a drink.

148
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,040
Bro,

149
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,279
drink this glass of wine

150
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,320
and forget about today.

151
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,320
Come on.

152
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,040
Come on.

153
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,039
I don't drink the wine
handed over by others.

154
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,840
Did you handle the matter
I entrusted to you?

155
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,600
Yes.

156
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,440
I'll kill you

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
if you err again.

158
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,679
Understood.

159
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,039
(If I stay, he will recognize me
sooner or later.)

160
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,040
Gu Nian,

161
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,720
you don't need to go.

162
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
My men

163
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,480
will take good care of K for you.

164
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,919
What do you mean?

165
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,799
Even if K was on guard,

166
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,320
he wouldn't know
the drug wasn't in the wine

167
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,960
but on the rim of the glass.

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,879
K,

169
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,080
compared to that woman,
I'll make you happier.

170
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,440
I will take good care of you.
