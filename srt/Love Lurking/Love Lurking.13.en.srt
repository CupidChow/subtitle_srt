00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:35,960
Dr. Gu,

4
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,600
this is trespassing.

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,920
I can call the police on you.

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,799
(Gu Nian, you've truly gone mad.)

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,119
Dr. Gu, what are you doing?

8
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,000
He's gone.

9
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,599
Thank you.

10
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,000
You can get out of the car now.

11
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,528
I didn't steal the drugs.

12
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,480
Your dashcam should have
recorded what happened that day.

13
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,359
I need you to help prove it.

14
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,159
Sorry, I can't help you.

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,560
Why?

16
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,560
Why should I help you?

17
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,120
But here's my advice.

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,280
Don't dig into some things.

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,759
What happened tonight
should be your warning.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,599
You set me up?

21
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,840
Dr. Gu,

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,800
I'm warning you one last time.

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,599
If you have evidence,

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
you can go to the police.

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,000
No need to test me.

26
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,879
You won't always win.

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,159
Then I'll wait for your retaliation.

28
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,719
Rest assured, Nian.

29
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,719
I'm looking into it.

30
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,159
I won't let anything happen to you.

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,520
Thank you, Senior.

32
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,319
Sorry.

33
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,520
I hope you find someone who likes you.

34
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,520
Nian,

35
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,840
I know there's someone in your heart.

36
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,159
But I hope you don't reject me.

37
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,960
You should move on from the past, too.

38
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,520
I'm a bit tired today.

39
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,159
I'll go up and rest first.

40
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,599
(If I can't find evidence by tomorrow,)

41
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,000
(I'll have to leave the hospital.)

42
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,680
(I wonder how things are with Weiwei.)

43
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,360
It's her.

44
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,319
Why hasn't Gu Nian been fired yet?

45
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,759
Miss Wei,

46
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,400
do you want me fired so much?

47
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,280
Why are you here?

48
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,759
(Nurse Lin has already confessed)

49
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,240
(that you bribed her)

50
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,080
(to steal the drugs and frame me.)

51
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,920
Nurse Lin recorded your transaction.

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Would you like to hear?

53
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,160
(I want Gu Nian to go to jail for this.)

54
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,600
Miss Wei, you're not just blind

55
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,839
but also mentally ill.

56
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,399
To get back at me,

57
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,240
you made your company lose millions.

58
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,959
Do you really think it's worth it?

59
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,879
If you're targeting me
because of Song Qian,

60
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,319
I can tell you

61
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,480
I have no interest in your fiancé.

62
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,399
If you don't like him,

63
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,800
why keep harassing him?

64
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,959
At first, I thought
he was someone I used to like.

65
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,160
But later I found out he wasn't.

66
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,079
And I've let go of the past

67
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,720
and am ready
to embrace a new relationship.

68
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,399
Our collaboration is over.

69
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,920
I don't think we need to meet again.

70
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,600
I hope you don't

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,079
make me the collateral damage
in the name of so-called love.

72
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,759
Otherwise,

73
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,519
I'll make this public.

Trust me.

Don't worry.

(No, it was sent anonymously.)

86
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,439
(Anonymously?)

87
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,879
(Who exactly was helping me?)

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,839
(Could it be him?)

89
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,199
Sir, as you ordered,

90
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,519
I got the video from your dashcam

91
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,800
and sent it to Li Weiwei.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,720
Gu Nian won't notice anything.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,800
But, Sir,

94
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,480
why are we helping Gu Nian?

95
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,519
I have my own plan.

96
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,399
You don't need to know so much.

97
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,800
By the way, Sir,

98
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,800
we've found Zhao Yan's whereabouts.

99
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,399
Good.

100
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,399
Get the stuff back quickly.

101
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,160
Yes.

102
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,279
I killed that old man for them.

103
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,560
And now they want to silence me.

104
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,759
I, Zhao Yan, won't die so easily.

105
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,560
How is the patient doing?

106
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
It's external injuries.

107
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,279
Sorry.

108
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:20,959
Are you okay?

109
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,759
(It's him.)

110
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,680
How much longer will it take?

111
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,519
Sir, the thing is,

112
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,600
your wounds are severe knife injuries.

113
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,399
Our nurse will give you anesthesia

114
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,480
before treating you.

115
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,399
Please wait a moment.

116
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,560
(His presence that day
seemed no coincidence.)

117
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,279
Officer Zhang Han,

118
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,079
I saw the suspect who might have
killed my mom and the dean.

119
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,680
You called the police?

120
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,160
I'll kill you.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,800
Are you okay?

122
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,080
Come back!

123
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,639
Are you crazy?

124
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,279
Let me go.

125
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,639
Zheng,

126
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,799
secure all the hospital exits.

127
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,120
Capture Zhao Yan.

128
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,639
You do know Zhao Yan.

129
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,919
Is it strange that I know him?

130
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,000
Why do you want to capture him?

131
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,399
Aren't you two in cahoots?

132
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,039
Then why were you attacked by Zhao Yan?

133
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,440
What's your relationship with him?

134
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,120
What?

135
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:22,960
Zhao Yan escaped?

136
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,360
Impossible. I just saw him go down
to the basement level 1.

137
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,759
Why did you protect me?

138
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,960
A lady was in danger.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,279
Wasn't it normal for me to help?

140
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,919
Are you worried about me?

141
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,879
Are you worried about me?

142
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,440
No.

143
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:00,544
(Zheng: Tonight Zhao Yan will go...)

144
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,559
Dr. Gu, I need to go.

145
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,360
(A bar?)

146
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,240
Please sit.

147
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,519
Ladies,

148
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,440
what would you like?

149
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,600
Champagne.

150
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,679
Please wait.

151
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,919
Wait.

152
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Could you tell me which room
Mr. Song Qian has booked?

153
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,360
We're his friends.

154
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,720
We'd like to stop by and say hello.

155
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:43,919
Sorry,

156
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,799
ladies.

157
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,519
Mr. Song hasn't booked a room.

158
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,919
Do you know Zhao Yan then?

159
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,039
Sorry, I'm new here.

160
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,600
I don't know this person.

161
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,279
It's fine. I'll go ask the reception.

162
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,759
Be careful.

163
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,759
Where is he?

164
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,159
Qian,

165
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,559
Zhao Yan was supposed to come
to buy tickets for illegal crossing,

166
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,879
but he somehow got spooked

167
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:14,919
and didn't show up.

168
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,840
Sir, Miss Gu is looking for you.

169
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,799
And she's asking about Zhao Yan.

170
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,559
Do you need me to take care of it?

171
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,759
Do it.

172
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,639
Yes.

173
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,240
Wait a moment, Zheng.

174
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,279
Miss, here's the champagne you ordered.

175
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:47,759
(The champagne)

176
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,120

177
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,399
(It has been drugged.)

178
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,039
Miss,

179
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,399
are you okay?

180
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,679
How about I help you to rest for a bit?

181
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,559
Don't touch me.

182
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,399
Go away.

183
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,240
What's going on?

184
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,039
What's happening?

185
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,000
Is she crazy?
