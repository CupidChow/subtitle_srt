=Episode 21=

3
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:35,967
Don't move!

4
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,487
- Get down!
- Put your hands up!

5
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:40,608
Get down!

6
00:00:57,527 --> 00:00:58,607
What are you looking at?

7
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:00,208
Hurry and pack up.

8
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:01,527
The police are here.

9
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:02,848
How could we have been exposed?

10
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:04,728
Didn't you say that we were well hidden?

11
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:06,208
I'm about to marry Song Qian.

12
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,447
Now you're telling me to run?

13
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,648
Are you kidding me?

14
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:11,527
Song Qian is a cop.

15
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:13,208
You stupid woman!

16
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:16,807
Brother,

17
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:18,728
what did you say?

18
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:20,208
What do you mean he is a cop?

19
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:25,120
Look at the surveillance
in the hospital's mezzanine.

20
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:26,637
Take a look.

21
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:29,728
He personally led the police
on the drug raid.

22
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:30,927
Song Qian

23
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:32,768
is a cop!

24
00:01:34,648 --> 00:01:35,527
Song Qian,

25
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:37,168
how could you lie to me?

26
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,648
I'll make that ingrate pay.

27
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:44,768
I will also get all our goods back.

28
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:45,688
Move.

29
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:47,008
Behave yourself.

30
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:51,168
Mr. Song,

31
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:52,768
look who this is.

32
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,248
Deliver the goods
to the East Street dock.

33
00:01:58,567 --> 00:01:59,808
Or I'll kill her.

34
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,808
Song Qian, don't come!

35
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:01,768
Don't come here!

36
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:03,328
Shut up!

37
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,048
Song Qian,

38
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:06,607
come over here alone.

39
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:07,607
I will kill her

40
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:08,648
if you bring the police.

41
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:15,208
I really regret it.

42
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:18,407
Back then, to make you
stop investigating,

43
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:19,768
I gave you the tracker

44
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,808
that led you to him.

45
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:23,047
But it doesn't matter.

46
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,007
Soon, when Song Qian arrives,

47
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:27,328
I will kill him.

48
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:29,527
Then we'll go abroad.

49
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:30,887
Zhou Shen,

50
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:33,447
can you wake up?

51
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:36,648
I'd rather die than go abroad with you.

52
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:39,248
Then what do you want?

53
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:40,607
You killed my mom.

54
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:42,648
And you still dream of being with me?

55
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:45,728
I didn't mean to kill her.

56
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:48,728
She discovered my secret.

57
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:52,007
Now I've discovered your secret too.

58
00:02:52,248 --> 00:02:53,328
Go ahead and kill me.

59
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:54,447
Like you killed my mom.

60
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:55,728
Kill me!

61
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:57,848
Why do you all have to push me?

62
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,248
But rest assured.

63
00:03:04,248 --> 00:03:06,728
I won't let you die easily.

64
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:12,847
Gu Nian.

65
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:14,808
You wretch!

66
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,407
You ruined my life.

67
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:17,848
I won't let you off easily.

68
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:18,967
Die!

69
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:20,407
Are you crazy?

70
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:22,567
If Gu Nian dies,

71
00:03:22,848 --> 00:03:24,328
who will I use to threaten Song Qian,

72
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:25,447
dear sister?

73
00:03:25,527 --> 00:03:27,047
She stole my man.

74
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,927
Can I not do anything?

75
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,047
At such a time,

76
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:33,808
you're still thinking about that man.

77
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:35,407
Dear sister,

78
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,168
can you wake up?

79
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:43,607
Nian, be good.

80
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,567
Stop making me angry.

81
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:50,527
Do you despise me that much?

82
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:52,967
Boss!

83
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,208
Song Qian is here.

84
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,967
(I didn't expect you to act so fast.)

85
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:03,767
Qian.

86
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:04,887
Song Qian.

87
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:06,728
You know it's a trap.

88
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:07,768
Yet you still came.

89
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:10,608
If I didn't come,

90
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,008
what would you do?

91
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,407
Both of you, shut up!

92
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:25,567
You want your woman, right?

93
00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:27,848
Hand over the goods.

94
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:32,248
Okay.

95
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:38,008
Drop the gun.

96
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:48,568
Together.

97
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:50,168
Okay.

98
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:16,607
Hand over the goods.

99
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:18,248
Release her first.

100
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,648
I'm not negotiating with you.

101
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:24,447
Do you think I'm negotiating with you?

102
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,447
Give them to me first,

103
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:31,007
or I'll kill her immediately.

104
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:36,047
If you don't release her first,

105
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:39,007
I'll throw the drugs into the sea.

106
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:40,576
You dare?

107
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:43,927
Why don't you try it?

108
00:05:46,927 --> 00:05:48,208
Let's exchange simultaneously.

109
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:08,927
I'll count to three.

110
00:06:09,248 --> 00:06:10,328
Exchange simultaneously.

111
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,648
Three.

112
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:17,007
Two.

113
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:20,568
One.

114
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:24,927
Are you okay?

115
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:25,767
I'm fine.

116
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:28,407
Gu Nian, die!

117
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:34,528
Qian?

118
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:43,967
Song Qian?

119
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:45,247
Song Qian!

120
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,328
Bring Gu Nian to me.

121
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:51,808
Boss, there are a lot of police outside.

122
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:54,008
Let's go!

123
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:55,248
Qian!

124
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,088
Don't move!

125
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:57,287
Stop!

126
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:58,848
Stop, Zhou Shen!

127
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,407
You are under arrest.

128
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:01,368
Put your hands up!

129
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:02,367
Get down!

130
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:03,247
Let go of me.

131
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:04,728
I won't let you off with this!

132
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:07,088
Song Qian.

133
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:08,768
Song Qian.

134
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:10,808
Why are you so silly?

135
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:16,128
I'm fine.

136
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:17,600
My heart aches for you.

137
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:18,496
Don't cry.

138
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:20,648
You're crazy.

139
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:22,087
Don't cry.

140
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:23,247
Song Qian?

141
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:25,568
Song Qian?

142
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,128
Song Qian!

143
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,967
It's been three days already.

144
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:58,607
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

145
00:08:12,248 --> 00:08:13,447
Hello, Weiwei?

146
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:25,447
Song Qian?

147
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:29,527
(Song Qian,)

148
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:31,744
(Officer Zhang Han has died.)

149
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:33,664
(It should be retaliatory.)

150
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:36,928
(You'll get a new identity.)

151
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:38,056
(Stay secret.)

152
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:39,432
(Set off now.)

153
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:46,784
(One year later)

154
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,927
Hello, Weiwei?

155
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:50,408
Nian,

156
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:51,848
join me for a blind date tonight.

157
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,808
Stop waiting for that heartbreaker.

158
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:54,528
Okay.

159
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:55,368
I'll get changed.
