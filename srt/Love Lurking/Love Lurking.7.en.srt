3
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:44,880
You're awake.

4
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,719
Rest assured.
They won't find this place.

5
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,439
Your clothes were soaked.

6
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,039
So I changed them.

7
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:03,719
Let me go!

8
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,319
If you want to kill me, do it.

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,680
If I wanted you dead,

10
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,280
I wouldn't save you.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
If you really want to save me,

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
let me go.

13
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,000
You can't leave yet.

14
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,599
Move aside.

15
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,319
Where are you going?

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
Peng Li is searching for you.

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,319
So what?

18
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,599
I'm leaving anyway.

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,120
I don't want to see you.

20
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,599
Do you hate seeing me that much?

21
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,400
Yes. I never want to see you again.

22
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,920
Don't you know what Peng Li is like?

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,359
Stop being so stubborn.

24
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,200
Can't you just trust me? Don't...

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
I trusted him before.
Look where that got me.

26
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,000
If I had rushed to save you,

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,359
Peng Li would've killed you.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
I tried to save you later,

29
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,159
but it was too late.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,799
Gu Nian,

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,719
you shot me

32
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,560
and slapped me.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,000
Haven't you vented enough?

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
Are you done talking?

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,199
Can you let me go now?

36
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,479
If it's inconvenient for you,

37
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,599
give me the phone.

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,080
My senior brother will pick me up.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
What senior brother?

40
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,360
It's none of your business.

41
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,120
I don't have a phone.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Fine.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,080
I'll leave on my own.

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,400
You won't get out of here
without me guiding you.

45
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,080
I'll do it myself.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,719
Don't worry.

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,919
After I send you away,

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,479
we won't meet again.

49
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:31,062
(Police Station)

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,199
We've arrived.

51
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,960
Tell me.

52
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Didn't you say my life
has nothing to do with you?

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,879
Why did you come back for me?

54
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,599
Now that I saved you,

55
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,879
you shouldn't report me anymore.

56
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,120
I advise you to turn yourself in.

57
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,360
Is there anything else?

58
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,680
Take care.

59
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,872
What are you doing?

60
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:36,959
(You and Gu Nian are wanted.)

61
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,319
We're wanted by the police?

62
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,839
Let's go.

63
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,800
Stop!

64
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,319
Don't move, or I'll shoot!

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,079
Why would the police want us?

66
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,439
The cop on the rooftop is dead.

67
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,720
Surveillance caught us at the scene.

68
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,639
Dead?

69
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,279
You killed him?

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,319
If I say I didn't do it,

71
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,600
would you believe me?

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,839
I don't know.

73
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,959
All I know is since I left the island,

74
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,680
I've been either hunted or wanted
all the time.

75
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,959
You can tell the police

76
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,920
that I forced you into everything.

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,800
When did you get hurt?

78
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,480
(Gunshot wound.)

79
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,519
Weren't you leaving?

80
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,639
You can go now.

81
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,519
Just leave me.

82
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,319
Don't worry. I'll leave.

83
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,439
But not now.

84
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,399

that I'm a doctor.
