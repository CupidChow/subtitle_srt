00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,079
What's that sound?

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,280
Someone is here.

5
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,719
Check here.

6
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,200
Outside...

7
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,439
No one here.

8
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,840
No one here either.

9
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,439
Boss, does K really live here?

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,200
(They found this place so quickly.)

11
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,399
If he hadn't gone
to the hospital for that woman,

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,879
I wouldn't have found him.

13
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,560
Boss, no one is inside

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,680
and outside either.

15
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,319
Impossible.

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,400
They're still hiding here.

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,400
Tear the place apart if you have to.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,159
Search again.

19
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,480
Understood.

20
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,719
Take this chip.

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,959
Don't come out no matter what happens.

22
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,359
Don't worry.

23
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,120
I'll be fine.

24
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,480
Give me the chip.

25
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,319
Or I'll kill you.

26
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,960
If you kill me,

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,360
you'll never get the chip back.

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,039
If you don't hand it over now,

29
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,400
you'll die.

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,840
Stop!

31
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,560
It's you.

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,240
Isn't this what you want?

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Let us go.

34
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,520
You can have it.

35
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,080
Gu Nian.

36
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,840
Give me the chip. Now!

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,039
Look for it on your hands and knees.

38
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,360
Where are they?

39
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,039
Are you okay?

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,719
Your wound reopened.

41
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:00,919
I'm fine.

42
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,680
Where's the chip?

43
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,400
Is it that important?

44
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,199
You're risking your life.

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,800
It is.

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,439
It's more important than my life.

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,680
We won't escape together.

48
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,080
Follow this path to get out.

49
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,879
Go now.

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,560
I'll get help to save you.

51
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,639
K, you're the mole.

52
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,840
I'll chop off your hands and feet.

53
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,800
You've been exposed.

54
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,919
We have to abandon you.

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,080
Don't leave me.

56
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,080
You betrayed me.

57
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,280
Just die.

58
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,000
You're awake.

59
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,800
You're running a fever.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,120
Didn't I tell you to leave?

61
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,360
Why did you come back?

62
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,800
Stop.

63
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,199
Trying to leave now.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,959
Isn't it too late?

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm a drug dealer.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,160
Why did you save me?

67
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,240
Answer me.

68
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,920
Because I'm a doctor.

69
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,360
You're lying.

70
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,639
I'm not.

71
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,639

102
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,160
