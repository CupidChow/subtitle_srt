00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,920
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,359
Oh, no!

4
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,520
Boss, are you okay?

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,200
Kill them!

6
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,519
I killed someone.

7
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,519
It's okay now.

8
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,519
Don't be afraid.

9
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,560
It's okay now.

10
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,159
Don't be afraid.

11
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,519
Don't be afraid.

12
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,879
Gu Nian,

13
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,760
get out of here.

14
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,400
Forget everything here.

15
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,159
Start your life over.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,159
Can't we leave together?

17
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,879
No.

18
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,719
Neither of you
can leave here alive today.

19
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,880
(Half a year later)

20
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,479
Nian.

21
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,360
Aside from the nightmares,

22
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,840
your recovery has been good.

23
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,039
But whenever I pick up a scalpel now,

24
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,560
I relive that moment I fired the gun.

25
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,360
It's a residual effect of your PTSD.

26
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,240
Full recovery will take time.

27
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,960
The drug dealers you encountered
six months ago are all dead.

28
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,400
So you don't have to fear anymore.

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,879
Nian,

30
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,120
let's have dinner together tonight.

31
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,280
Probably not.

32
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,000
The dean wants
to talk about my mother with me.

33
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,639
I'm off.

34
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,080
Wait.

35
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,520
You said that medication
caused hallucinations.

36
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,120
I've changed your prescription.

37
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,680
It should work better.

38
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,199
Thanks, Senior.

39
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,199
He is your target tonight.

40
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,479
The dean of Grace Hospital.

41
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,199
The dean isn't taking calls.

42
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,280
Is he in his office?

43
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,240
Alright. I'm heading over now.

44
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,879
Sorry.

45
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,680
Are you okay?

46
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,879
Am I hallucinating again?

47
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,800
Dean, are you inside?

48
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,720
It's Nian.

49
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,439
Help.

50
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,560
Dean, wake up!

51
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:52,439
Stop.

52
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,360
Or I'll kill you.

53
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,279
Dean, I have a document
requiring your signature.

54
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,000
Nian, you're awake.

55
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,680
The dean? Where's the dean?

56
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,480
We tried resuscitating him.

57
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
But he still passed from a heart attack.

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,959
A heart attack?

59
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,959
No. I saw the killer.

60
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,120
The dean was murdered.

61
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,680
Miss Gu,

62
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,240
are you sure
you witnessed someone killed the dean?

63
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,279
I didn't see him commit the murder.

64
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,319
But he was at the scene.

65
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,920
The surveillance?

66
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,439
We checked the footage.

67
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,319
No one was seen entering
or leaving the dean's office.

68
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,199
Miss Gu, if there truly is a killer,

69
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,800
you might be in danger.

70
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,879
Please be careful.

71
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,680
Stop. Or I'll kill you.

72
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,279
(Why did that man
sound so much like him?)

73
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,439
If I had gone
to see the dean earlier that day,

74
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,839
he might not have been killed.

75
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,959
Maybe there was no killer at all.

76
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,680
It could just be hallucinations
from your medication.

77
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,000
Even you don't believe me?

78
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,279
Nian, that's not what I meant.

79
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,800
I heard the dean was murdered.

80
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Could it be that the dean
offended someone powerful

81
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
like former Dean Gu?

82
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,879
Didn't Dean Gu kill herself
over bribery charges?

83
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,240
Who knows?

84
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,600
Her daughter claimed there was a killer.

85
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,959
It seems this time,

86
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,680
Dr. Gu says there's a killer too.

87
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,560
But they say she's hallucinating.

88
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,120
So her testimony isn't credible.

89
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,040
Don't mind what they say.

90
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,680
By the way, I retrieved your phone.

91
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,600
(This isn't my phone.)

92
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,680
Dean?

93
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,000
What's wrong, Dean?

94
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,160
This is the dean's phone.

95
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,399
What did you say?

96
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,279
(They must've returned the wrong phone.)

97
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,120
The dean isn't taking calls.

98
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,319
Alright. I'm heading over now.

99
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,120
(The dean's line was busy
the entire time.)

100
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
(He was indeed on a call
before the accident.)

101
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,000
The dean refused
to collaborate with the Wei Group.

102
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,759
Could he have offended
the Wei family's new head?

103
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,920
What's his name?

104
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,839
Song Qian?

105
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,839
It's Song Qian, I think.

106
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,199
I heard he's ruthless and cruel.

107
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,920
He killed many people.

108
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,360
