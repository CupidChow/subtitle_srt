717
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:10,703
but…

718
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:13,540
This was good

719
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:15,667
What about (Eiji)?

720
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,711
Because of that kiss...

721
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:22,131
Maybe Izumi-chan and Bessho-kun will break up?

722
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,426
Now finally

723
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,762
I can say I like you

724
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:32,559
Don't be kidding... you should just take it apart!

725
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,102
[Slap sound]

726
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:39,691
Which one is kidding me? I feel the same way as me

727
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:42,777
How long are you acting like a good person?

728
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,951
If so, don't kiss me!

729
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:09,596
Ah, I can't really invite you to Ikezawa.

730
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:15,685
That's good too, you too, Aihara too

731
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,479
Lovey-dovey with her!

732
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:22,483
That's not true...

733
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:23,985
picture?

734
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:28,865
(Izumi) Nao!

735
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,201
yeah?

736
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,455
what up?

737
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:40,001
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey he

738
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:43,463
You do it behind the scenes, behind the scenes! Come on, go see!

739
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:44,714
Tch!

740
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,508
- Flirt up! - A spring?

741
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:50,887
Sorry me...

742
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:52,889
Bad Naohiko!

743
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:57,018
I…

744
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,647
I kissed Izumi...

745
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:04,942
sorry…

746
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,864
(Eiji) Izumi Sorry!

747
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:12,533
why?

748
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:17,538
Why are you doing it?!

749
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:19,666
[Sniffing sound]

750
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:21,751
sorry…

751
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:28,758
- I asked why! - Direct!

752
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:32,261
Hey, stop, calm down! Calm down! Stop it!

753
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:34,806
(Eiji) Come on (Taichi) Hey!

754
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,141
(Boy) What's wrong?

755
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,267
(Taichi) Hey!

756
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,187
(Boy) What? A fight? Who?

757
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,441
(Izumi) Nao! Hey!

758
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,527
(Taichi) Aihara...

759
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,156
What's on now...

760
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,158
Is it true?

761
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:03,751
Don't do anything that makes you want to quit your friend

762
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:07,672
(Taichi) What are you looking at, it's disbanding! Disbanding!

763
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:09,424
Go!

764
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,722
(Izumi) Wait, I want to talk to Nao-chan!

765
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:19,892
(Naohiko) Haa... It's a school festival, so I'll do it later

766
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,978
(Izumi) Eh... But!

767
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:25,440
Have you passed away from the class?

768
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:28,025
You better go back

769
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:46,878
(Mizuho Mizuho) Aihara-kun?

770
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:27,960
[The sound of whistling]

771
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:32,632
(Taichi) Hey!

772
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,803
Everyone's gone home already

773
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,268
[Sound of placing it on the desk]

774
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:46,896
Let's drink

775
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,067
Come on, let's go!

776
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,386
(Mizuho) Is it okay?

777
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:32,024
It's better to cool it down

778
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,360
It looks so painful...

779
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,782
What hurts is...

780
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:41,701
It's not me...

781
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,789
What happened?

782
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:52,420
I hurt someone I didn't want to hurt...

783
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:02,680
Both of them are important...

784
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:09,520
So I'll hold it in forever...

785
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,817
I'll forget someday...

786
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,282
But in the end...

787
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,829
I broke it...

788
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:33,294
[The sound of opening the plug and bubbles]

789
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:42,136
Ah, that's a shame...

790
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:46,182
What are you thinking about Aihara's guy...

791
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:49,727
Ah but...

792
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:53,439
It seems that he fell like this and ended up slugging

793
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:55,066
Isn't that what it is?

794
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,567
I don't know but...

795
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,782
I wonder if a day like this will come someday

796
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,409
Maybe it was scary...

797
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:08,621
What about (Taichi)?

798
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:11,958
Izumi originally liked Eiji.

799
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,794
I thought I was just getting in the way...

800
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:17,713
What are you talking about?

801
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,131
More than me

802
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:23,636
Eiji spent a long time with Izumi.

803
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,889
What is suitable for a spring

804
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:28,599
Actually...

805
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,770
I wonder if it's Eiji

806
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:37,900
if…

807
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:45,408
If Eiji had always loved Izumi...

808
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,288
The two broke their relationship

809
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,582
It's me...

810
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:59,714
I'm entitled to punch him...

811
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:04,885
do not have…

812
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:11,517
Hmm, ah...

813
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,520
Well... well, alright, but alright? See

814
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,896
Let's drink it for now

815
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:19,817
Delicious! Come on, I opened it well, so come on a toast!

816
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,194
Okay, come on, cheers!

817
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:24,613
cheers! Let's get brighter!

818
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:25,614
What?

819
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:55,478
(Teacher) Yes, then don't forget your homework.

820
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:13,079
[Chime sound]

821
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:19,752
What do you do for lunch?

822
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:21,504
I'll eat with the track and field club

823
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:22,546
(Taichi)

824
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:27,051
Hmm, what do you do for lunch?

825
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,305
Let's eat while watching the sea, is it today? Let's take a look, see

826
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:33,349
Oh, which one should I do today?

827
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,358
(Izumi) Koharu-chan!

828
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:48,364
Haa...

829
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,282
what?

830
00:56:52,118 --> 00:56:55,830
I didn't apologize properly for the other day

831
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:59,708
Why is Izumi apologizing?

832
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:03,170
The one who's wrong is Aihara-kun, and Izumi-chan is the victim, right?

833
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,799
But then...

834
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:17,351
He had a very hurtful face...

835
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,315
That shouldn't be... not

836
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,777
Because I...

837
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:31,365
I like Bessho-kun

838
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,326
picture?

839
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:39,123
Do you know why Aihara pretended to date me?

840
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,250
It's all for Izumi-chan

841
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:45,004
I like Bessho-kun and want to get closer

842
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,799
So I told Izumi-chan to become friends too.

843
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,302
Aihara-kun is

844
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:55,556
He tried to date me to keep me closer to Bessho-kun

845
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,435
But Izumi-chan

846
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:02,313
I don't know anything

847
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:08,986
You're able to apologize like you just now, because you're confident in yourself, right?

848
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:14,825
I can say this because I'm happy to be cared for by Bessho-kun!

849
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,953
Izumi-chan's thing

850
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,165
It's really frustrating...

851
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,671
I just don't want to be left awkward with Koharu-chan...

852
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,135
If so...

853
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,554
Please Bessho-kun

854
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:41,810
See

855
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,271
You can't do it

856
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:48,734
I don't want you to be too kind

857
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:55,157
(Taichi) Umm...

858
00:58:55,574 --> 00:59:00,120
Bessho likes Shiosaki Shiosaki

859
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,082
I'm dating but

860
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,960
I doubt Aihara...

861
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:11,924
And Aihara seems to like Shiozaki

862
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:15,094
I'm dating Fujimura...

863
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:22,393
And me! I like Ikezawa though!

864
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:26,814
Ikezawa is Aihara...

865
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:34,530
Fujimura is dating Aihara but...

866
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,741
Who do you like?

867
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,202
no…

868
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,871
What is this tick

869
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:45,457
It's too complicated! Oh no...

870
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:46,583
[The sound of a notebook falling down]

871
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:47,584
A little...

872
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:53,340
(Taichi) Wow...

873
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:57,011
Ah, hey, wait! Don't watch!

874
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:05,311
Ah, that's that...

875
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:08,022
It's my own fantasy

876
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:09,481
that's why…

877
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:10,774
Don't worry!

878
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,112
What is love?

879
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:17,948
(Taichi) What?

880
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:22,953
When I saw Aihara-kun being hurt

881
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:25,706
Maybe...

882
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,918
I wonder if he's going to break up with Fujimura-san

883
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,255
a bit…

884
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:35,215
I was hoping for it

885
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:42,139
I can't believe this feeling is love...

886
01:00:45,184 --> 01:00:46,643
I don't want to admit it

887
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:52,900
surely…

888
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:55,819
If I fall in love

889
01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:58,113
Everyone is right

890
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:03,202
I just can't say it out loud

891
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:06,872
I'm

892
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:10,376
Ikezawa, who is so human, too

893
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:12,294
I think it's good

894
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:21,720
(Mizuho) What?

895
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,019
Me...

896
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:32,356
I'll support you

897
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:37,361
Ikezawa is

898
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,738
