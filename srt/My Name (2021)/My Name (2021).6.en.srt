1
00:00:00,325 --> 00:00:03,889
Ripped by TTEOKBOKKIsubs

2
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,491
This is safe.

3
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,754
Go on.

4
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,882
Sir, will you be okay on your own?

5
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,759
How does it feel to be a killer?

6
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,471
Shh.

7
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,326
And you will…

8
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,661
never ever…

9
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,705
be able…

10
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,249
…to forget me.

11
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,750
Do I need to go now
for questioning?

12
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,673
Wanna drink?

13
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,645
First snowfall of the year.

14
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,192
Can I come in?

15
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,862
Have you eaten anything?

16
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,535
Do you even eat?

17
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,343
Jeez.

18
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,345
The decor is very you.

19
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,935
Tonight's not good.

20
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,026
So stuffy in here.

21
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,157
You shouldn't be alone
on a day like today.

22
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,338
Do you like the snow?

23
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,762
You always avoid answering.

24
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,432
What things do you like?

25
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,726
Don't you have any hobbies?

26
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,189
Now your fridge tells me
cooking is not one of them.

27
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,944
No, I don't.

28
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,281
Well, then what fun is life?

29
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,993
Is life supposed to be fun?

30
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,668
You're so frustrating.

31
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,128
No hobbies? You should make some.

32
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,090
People in our line of work
need to take a break.

33
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,175
Relax and not think sometimes.

34
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,056
Beaches are nice.

35
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,518
I like being there.

36
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,603
Oh.

37
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,232
Well…

38
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,319
It would be beautiful to look
at the ocean on a day like this.

39
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,282
Should we go now?

40
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,118
You'll lose your license if we go now.

41
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,081
We'll go another day, all right?

42
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,001
I'm a really good fisherman.

43
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,503
You'll never want restaurant sushi again.

44
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,796
I swear it.

45
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,844
There's no need to try so hard.

46
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,143
I'm fine.

47
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,240
No, you're not.

48
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,453
You and Do Gangjae…

49
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,581
you knew each other, right?

50
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,377
I heard him at the junkyard
before I passed out.

51
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,172
The way he said your name.

52
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,188
He tried to rape me a long time ago.

53
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,691
He drugged me first.

54
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,451
I got this scar…

55
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,331
when I tried to wake myself up
from the drug.

56
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,049
So it was Do Gangjae.

57
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,845
The one you wanted to catch.

58
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,396
I thought I wouldn't see you again
until after we die, but here we are.

59
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,236
You still living your life
fighting all the time?

60
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,322
No choice in the matter

61
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,408
if I want to survive.

62
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,288
Life is a battle.

63
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,919
You can't lose
and you can't give in.

64
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,712
That's why it's a war.

65
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,344
How else am I supposed to live?

66
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,807
Are there people you can trust?

67
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,397
That's good then.

68
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,816
Rest here for a few days.

69
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,459
Attention.

70
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,049
These are the possible routes
Choi Mujin could've taken.

71
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,095
Find out if anyone
within a two-mile radius

72
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,180
is associated with Dongcheon.

73
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,016
He had to have gotten treated.

74
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,809
Check with every hospital, every vet,

75
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,061
and retired doctor in the area.
Understood?

76
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,313
Yes, sir.

77
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,360
<i>Choi Mujin!</i>

78
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,456
Hey. It's me.

79
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,167
Can I get all the documents
on that car with the fake plate?

80
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,045
Call me when they're ready.
I'll pick 'em up.

81
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,796
Okay.

82
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,404
JIWOO

83
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,657
SONG JOONSU

84
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,993
Song Joonsu…

85
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,744
<i>Who is Song Joonsu?</i>

86
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,330
He died shortly after joining Narcotics.

87
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,835
You don't know anything.

88
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,588
SENDER
DO GANGJAE

89
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,178
<i>Jiwoo.</i>

90
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,556
<i>I'm going to stay here tonight.</i>

91
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,890
<i>Meet me here.</i>

92
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,312
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME…

93
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,254
What's up here?

94
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,007
It's a factory
that processes forest products.

95
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,973
And over there?

96
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,684
There is a small temple
on Cheonwang Mountain.

97
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,692
It's ready.

98
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,355
Sit down.

99
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,403
How are you feeling?

100
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,157
It hurts.

101
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,452
I haven't been stabbed in a while.

102
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,411
It hurts.

103
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,832
I had forgotten…

104
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,794
…just how much it hurts.

105
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,551
Do Gangjae sent me a photo.

106
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,518
The Song Joonsu
that they said died 17 years ago…

107
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,899
My father was a cop?

108
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,578
Yes.

109
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,873
Donghoon was a cop.

110
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,376
Cha Giho had sent him.

111
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,421
He wanted to take us down from inside.

112
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,675
But Donghoon flipped on him.

113
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,802
Came to our side.

114
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,764
Like I told you before…

115
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,894
Your father saved my life.

116
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,737
Let's go in.

117
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,116
YOON DONGHOON

118
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,244
I didn't even know my dad's name.

119
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,081
Two lives.

120
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,710
Two names.

121
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,676
So that's why he looked like
he was on the edge of a cliff.

122
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,308
That's how you look now.

123
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,689
Do you feel on the edge?

124
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,235
Whenever he had time,

125
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,029
he'd disappear somewhere by himself.

126
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,700
I assumed it was a girl.

127
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,746
<i>One day,</i>

128
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,624
<i>I happened to see him out on the street.</i>

129
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,252
<i>I followed him.</i>

130
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,298
<i>I was worried he was seeing someone shady.</i>

131
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,929
<i>But I just turned around and I left.</i>

132
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,518
<i>If she can make him smile like that,</i>

133
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,563
<i>it didn't matter who she was.</i>

134
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,483
I found out later…

135
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,279
that it was you.

136
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,703
Your dad is Yoon Donghoon.

137
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,498
He lived and died with the organization.

138
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,585
Jiwoo.

139
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,420
Don't get weak.

140
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,299
And don't ever forget how you got here.

141
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,220
Why did you hide it from me?

142
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,476
Because you need conviction

143
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,895
to be a killer.

144
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,484
I wanted you to find the answer yourself.

145
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,343
Jiwoo.

146
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,972
What more is there to confirm?

147
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,518
Or…

148
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,396
are you hesitating?

149
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,453
Can you tell me…

150
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,622
Have you seen this man?

151
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,584
No one has visited us for a while.

152
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,972
People don't come to temples much
when the weather gets cold.

153
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:58,937
Hello?

154
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,818
Where are you?

155
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,091
<i>Was Dongcheon involved?</i>

156
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,010
Dongcheon killed him.

157
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,888
Cha Giho couldn't accept his betrayal

158
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,433
and killed your father.

159
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,269
Those assholes can die.

160
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,574
What about Do Gangjae?

161
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,535
Don't we need to find Mujin?

162
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,287
There is no evidence.

163
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,997
That makes no sense.

164
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,375
At least we can try to investigate.

165
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,419
What are we going to do now?

166
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,923
Yoon Donghoon…

167
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,013
Come on in.

168
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,393
Captain.

169
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,687
Oh, hi.

170
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,607
Do you want soju?

171
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,526
It's all burnt.

172
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,529
I won't…

173
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,407
be able…

174
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,996
to fall asleep if I'm sober tonight.

175
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,711
Let me.

176
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,176
Pildo.

177
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,389
What would you do
if you found your sister's killer?

178
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,435
Put him away.

179
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,354
And if there's no evidence?

180
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,525
You find him and there's no…

181
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,237
No evidence.

182
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,587
What if…

183
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,923
you had the chance to kill the guy?

184
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,551
No cameras, no witnesses.

185
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,136
Nothing, but you!

186
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,056
Then?

187
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,313
Remember what you said
when I joined Narcotics?

188
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,236
"Investigations are like sandcastles.

189
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,156
You work hard to build it up,

190
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,783
but the wave comes
and knocks it down constantly.

191
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,873
But if you keep at it,
the low tide will come eventually.

192
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,752
That's when you get your man."

193
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,509
Choi Mujin.

194
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,471
Won't be free long.

195
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,061
That's not bad.

196
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,152
I learned it from you.

197
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,287
-Can I get a glass, please?
-Sure.

198
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,793
Yes.

199
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,794
<i>Taeju.</i>

200
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,838
<i>I don't think Jiwoo can finish the job.</i>

201
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,259
<i>You get rid of Cha Giho.</i>

202
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,642
Yes, sir.

203
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,982
YOON DONGHOON

204
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,657
Just a minute.

205
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,453
Wait, wait. Careful.

206
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,982
SECURITY GUARD BREAK TIMES

207
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,486
We're here.

208
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,904
-You're going off?
-Yes.

209
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,281
Careful. Careful.

210
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,366
Your head.

211
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,702
Get up. You're home.

212
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,913
One, two, three.

213
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,040
Where's your key?

214
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,666
I have it.

215
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,961
-Hey. Hey.
-I have it, so… so go.

216
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,424
Go, Pildo.

217
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,926
-Just open it.
-I'm okay.

218
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,052
Just go.

219
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,553
Shit.

220
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,263
-You want me to stay?
-Ah.

221
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,315
-Should I go?
-Yes, go.

222
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,193
-Good night.
-Okay.

223
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,298
Oh Hyejin.

224
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,175
Choi Mujin's dog!

225
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,887
Are you here to finish me?

226
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,141
Drop the knife.

227
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,562
Don't you see what's in my hand?

228
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,067
Drop the knife.

229
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,196
I came to ask you something.

230
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,616
Ask something?

231
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,620
You might die depending on the answer.

232
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,295
My dad died because of you.

233
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,717
But he never dropped his knife
until the moment he died.

234
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,218
To protect me.

235
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,556
I threw everything away
to catch this son of a bitch.

236
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,775
Tell me what you did to my dad
five years ago today.

237
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,029
Tell me!

238
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,665
Are you Jiwoo?

239
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,170
Yoon Jiwoo?

240
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,805
You remember the name.

241
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:20,975
Why?

242
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,062
Were you feeling guilty, huh?

243
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,523
Donghoon… No.

244
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,361
Joonsu was undercover.

245
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,199
He was our agent--

246
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,408
I know that.

247
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,371
I know that you sent him
into the organization.

248
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,666
And my father betrayed you,
so you decided to take his life?

249
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,211
Song Jiwoo…

250
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,090
How did you…

251
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,636
end up working for Choi Mujin?

252
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,101
Choi Mujin…

253
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,062
That demon and cunning!

254
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,203

-Captain!
-Jiwoo.

258
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,587
Captain!

259
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,714
Jiwoo.

260
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,931
Captain!

261
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,356
Captain! Captain!

262
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,735
Captain!

263
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,766
Get out of here.

266
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,296
Okay.

267
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,798
You, step in.

268
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,342
-Come on.
-Yes, sir.

269
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:02,053
-You won last year too, right?
-That's right.

270
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,512
Two years in a row.

271
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,681
Next time let someone else win.

272
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,641
-Yes, sir!
-Dongcheon!

273
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,392
Dongcheon!

274
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,474
Yeah.

275
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,226
Take it easy, man.

276
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,356
Enough.

277
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,440
That's enough.

278
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:02,863
What is this?

279
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,741
A gift for you.

280
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:09,912
"Gift for you."

281
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,831
Isn't it great?

282
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:15,918
Try it.

283
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,506
Want me to die quickly?

284
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,633
You punk.

285
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,176
Don't use disposable lighters.

286
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,511
You're the boss. Look the part.

287
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,929
It doesn't make a sound.

288
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,473
Yes, it does.

289
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,187
What sound did you expect?

290
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:45,448
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

get revenge?

341
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,464
Regardless of the price you pay?

342
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,466
<i>Here's the gun
that killed your dad.</i>

343
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,552
<i>You're gonna find him.</i>

344
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,179
Kill him.

345
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,266

Donghoon's killer is a policeman.

350
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,946
I'm giving you my dagger.

351
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,907
You kill him as soon as you can.

352
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,492
Don't buy it.

353

<i>Chamomile tea.
It's supposed to help with insomnia.</i>

YOON DONGHOON

355
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,512

<i>to be a killer.</i>

357
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,141
<i>Lay my head down</i>

358
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,852
<i>And rest my mind</i>

359
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:53,440
