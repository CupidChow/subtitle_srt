Ripped by TTEOKBOKKIsubs

2
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,527
Do they kill Choi Mujin?

3
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,741
No.

4
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,993
He wasn't at the gym.

5
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,791
<i>No. We're doing fine.</i>

6
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,210
Thank you for checking.

7
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,100
Ms. Kang.

8
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,351
Hmm.

9
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,103
Should we prepare ourselves?

10
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,605
No, we should be fine.

11
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,691
There's no official connection to the gym.

12
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,776
Exactly.

13
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,362
Don't give the cops anything.

14
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,073
Make sure no one talks.

15
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,199
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,663
Did you check the cameras?

17
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,915
They don't work.

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,584
Bullshit. Look how many they've got.

19
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,463
Of course, they don't work.
Gangs don't trust the police.

20
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,077
-Is this the only camera here?
-It's the only one we have.

21
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,799
Is this delivery truck
assigned to this area?

22
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,385
Sir, if you hear anything,

23
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,887
-would you mind giving me a call, please?
-I will.

24
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,157
Let's try over there.

25
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,329
None of the victims will talk.

26
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,166
Who came back?

27
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,335
Were you scared?

28
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,839
Your first time?

29
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,551
For me, it's been a while.

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,096
Never seen anyone this ballsy before.

31
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,766
DO NOT ENTER
UNDER INVESTIGATION

32
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,144
We're cops.

33
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,395
Don't be scared.

34
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,772
I'm not scared.

35
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,108
I'm sure you're not.

36
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,530
Yeah?

37
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,868
Yes, sir. Got it.

38
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,787
Keep asking around. I gotta go.

39
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:44,224
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?

40
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,299
Pildo.

41
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,009
Move.

42
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,645
We're in mourning.

43
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,814
Mm-hm. We know.

44
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,608
We're paying respects, punk.

45
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,946
Move out of my way.

46
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,880
One person.

47
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,801
That's fine.

48
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,928
We didn't bring an offering
for you, anyway.

49
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,310
That must hurt, huh?

50
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,254
I'd love a drink.

51
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,250
Destiny of a dog…

52
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,002
follows its owners.

53
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,842
That dog can live in luxury
if it gets lucky with a rich owner,

54
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,595
or it ends up dying out on the street.

55
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,931
It's a dog's death.

56
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,602
You cops are incredible, you know that?

57
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:22,108
Even incompetent idiots like you
can manage become captain.

58
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,488
You know you'd already be dead
if you were in our world.

59
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,873
I'm sick of it, too.

60
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,959
Let's end it, okay?

61
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,591
How soon are you planning
on getting taken down?

62
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,597
And why would I think of that?

63
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,648
One thing I know.

64
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,406
I'll never get caught
no matter what you do.

65
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,789
Hey.

66
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,709
What are you all doing here, huh?

67
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,794
Here.

68
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,714
Let me know if you ever wanna talk, huh?

69
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,467
You wanna talk?

70
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,511
Lots to say.

71
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,531
Think long and hard, okay?

72
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,033
Your man can't catch those guys.

73
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,954
Detective, let's go.

74
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,122
See you.

75
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,342
Where is that stupid cunt hiding?

76
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,719
Bored already.

77
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,556
I'll let you have a taste when I get her.

78
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,766
What the hell? Are you drunk?

79
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,686
Ah! Sorry, man, I forgot.

80
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,563
You can't fuck her anyway!

81
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,648
You motherfucker!

82
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,611
So let's catch her
and then we'll kill her.

83
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,866
Why aren't we getting any buyers?

84
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,660
We gave out plenty of stock!

85
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,289
Should I call Mango?

86
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,459
You think Mango is getting funny ideas?

87
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,131
Yes!

88
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,725

BALLISTICS FORENSICS ANALYSIS REQUEST

90
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,816
Good work, sir.

91
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,818
Find anything?

92
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,612
Nothing.

93
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,821
Sergeant Jeon!

94
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,364
Hello.

95
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,409
Shit. Search this.

96
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,328
Any new leads?

97
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:24,290
No witness, no video,
it's hard to identify anyone.

98
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,335
Pildo. Who am I?

99
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,544
Yeah.

100
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,008
This is the kind of guy I am!

101
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,888
Delivery truck's dashcam.

102
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,599
I track down the driver in Seongan.

103
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,517
Who is this?

104
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,311
Looks familiar. We gotta look him up.

105
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,356
<i>Why are you here?</i>

106
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,649
You're a girl.

107
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,034
Don't you think he looked
kind of familiar though?

108
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,580
Do Gangjae,
this asshole was in Dongcheon.

109
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,874
He disappeared four years ago.

110
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,834
And, now, it looks like he's back.

111
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,087
Did something happen?

112
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,048
There is a rumor
that someone died in the gym.

113
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,636
But what Choi Mujin do?

114
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,264
He knows we're onto him,
so I'm guessing he'll lay low, right?

115
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,435
He won't do that.

116
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,273
Choi Mujin's… ego was damaged.

117
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,238
Go find Gangjae.

118
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,116
It's dangerous to make a move now.

119
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,121
Are you scared?

120
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,915
No, sir.

121
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,838
If we don't fight back,
the organization crumbles.

122
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,884
I have to show them what kind
of operation they're dealing with.

123
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,762
Meet Dongcheon.

124
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,063
First…

125
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,191
let Mango go.

126
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,276
-What?
-What?

127
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,695
Let's see what Choi Mujin does.

128
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,947
And Gangjae?

129
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,490
Do we make an alert?

130
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,033
You'll just let him be?

131
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,578
No. Just observe it for the time being.

132
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,122
We'll get Choi Mujin.

133
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,875
We'll do it while he's still rattled.

134
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,003
Four people died.

135
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,174
If the two gangs collide, more will die.

136
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,341
Do not care?

137
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,138
Because they're still all human beings.

138
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,433
Those assholes can die.

139
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,023
Let's get Choi Mujin first.

140
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,794
MANGO IS BEING RELEASED.
IT'S A TRAP.

141
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,283
-The Musan branch is here.
-Get them ready.

142
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,998
The other organizations are here.

143
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,625
They are waiting your instructions.

144
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,256
Send them all away.

145
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,217
Sorry?

146
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,804
Is there someone you trust?

147
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,765
Yes.

148
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,102
Cha Giho started a game,

149
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,730
so I'll play too.

150
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,793
Bets down, please.

151
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,006
And you saved
the best for yourself.

152
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,841
-You can have it.
-Gosh.

153
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,551
-Hey.
-Hello, sir.

154
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,511
Hey.

155
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,348
Any word from the team on Dongcheon?

156
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,850
They're quiet.

157
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,144
The peons are going around
gathering intel,

158
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,979
but they haven't found Do Gangjae.

159
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,565
Maybe they're getting help
from other organizations?

160
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,234
No.

161
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,612
Choi Mujin will act personally.

162
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,658
But…

163
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,539
they may be crumbling from within.

164
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,540
What?

165
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,669
I think one of them will flip for us.

166
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,795
What…

167
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,088
Who?

168
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,548
I don't know yet.

169
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,675
I'll meet him later.

170
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,801
Pildo.

171
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,179
-Yeah.
-Later.

172
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,515
What? When?
Where are you meeting him?

173
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,229
What should we do
about Yamamoto?

174
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,607
Have him wait for the time being.

175
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,068
For building a new factory
and get new chemists,

176
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,402
it'll take too much time.

177
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,863
The buyers are nervous, too.

178
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,531
Taeju, you deal with the buyers.

179
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,200
Yes, sir.

180
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,119
You said there's
a new drug circulating, right?

181
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,956
I think it's Gangjae.

182
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,460
He wants me dead
so that he can take our market.

183
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,963
So…

184
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,592
if we get him, we get his drugs.

185
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,888
Yes, sir.

186
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,233
A TRAITOR IS MEETING CHA GIHO.
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

187
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,753
It's hard for us to keep waiting.

188
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,255
That's all I'm saying.

189
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,966
And how long can we wait
without drugs?

190
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,635
Gangjae's gang is a problem too.

191
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,846
But even Narcotics is after you.

192
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,266
Well, whose side do you think
we should take then?

193
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,685
What if a war breaks out?

194
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,104
Well…

195
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,940
you'll place your bet on who wins?

196
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,907
All right.

197
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,200
Go ahead.

198
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,745
Just be sure to remember.

199
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,082
The buy-in… is your life.

200
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,432
-Keep watching them.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,193
You act like we've met before.

202
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,402
Let me see your--

203
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,201
So…

204
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,705
Choi Mujin really did plant someone
among us.

205
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,583
Pildo.

206
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,338
Watch Oh Hyejin like a hawk.

207
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,466
It feels like our intel has been leaking

208
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,926
ever since she started with us.

209
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,054
If she's their informant,

210
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,098
and they removed the cameras
when she found them,

211
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,101
why would they risk blowing her cover?

212
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,020
What if they knew…

213
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,440
exactly how we think?

214
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,820
Let's go.

215
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,118
Yes.

216
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,708
It was a trap.

217
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,294
<i>Was Cha Giho trying to catch
my informant?</i>

218
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,254
Also…

219
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,424
Jung Taeju was there.

220
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,689
<i>Don't do anything
for the time being.</i>

221
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,818
Cha Giho is waiting
for the organization to move.

222
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,738
I'll find Gangjae.

223
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,831
I've calmed down the buyers
for the time being.

224
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,550
You may go.

225
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,513
Yes, sir.

226
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,330
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE GANGJAE IS
DONGMYO PARK 11 P.M.

227
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,424
-Pildo.
-Yeah.

228
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,553
It's Detective Oh's file.

229
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,597
Sir.

230
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,641
Why did you call out Taeju?

231
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,645
He planted a spy among us,

232
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,023
so I threw a stone on his way.

233
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,902
Let's see how far the ripples will travel.

234
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,112
Work hard.

235
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,864
Good night, sir.

I'm Oh Hyejin from Narcotics.

00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,244
Is the ballistic report ready?

245
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,705
Yes. I just left a message
for your captain.

246
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,044
Did you determine whose gun it was?

247
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,589
We don't have access to that here.
But we restored the gun's serial number.

248
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,016
SERIAL NUMBER IS GL86575

-Choi Mujin left a gun at the crime scene.
-Why?

252
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,948
Why now?

253
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,325
He's probably trying to bait me

254
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,245
since he thought it was a cop's gun.

GUN SERIAL NUMBER ANALYSIS REPORT

256
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,100
Who is Song Joonsu?

257
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,276
We got the firearm analysis back.

258
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,903
I confirmed with the Administration.

259
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,034
You pick it up?

260
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,122
The gun was issued
to Corporal Song Joonsu in '04.

261
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,208
Records show he was with Narcotics.

262
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,711
Who is he?

263
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,678
He was one of my guys.

264
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,474
He died shortly after joining Narcotics.

265
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,478
Was Dongcheon involved?

266
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,151
Dongcheon killed him.

267
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,370
Is this the report?

SONG JOONSU
SERIAL: GL86575

DIED DURING OPERATION,
GUN WAS NOT RECOVERED

SUPERVISOR IN CHARGE
NARCOTICS TEAM 1, LIEUTENANT CHA GIHO

272
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,205
Did Dongcheon kill a cop in the past?

273
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,876
The gun belonged to a cop
who died long ago.

274
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,338
Cha Giho says that cop was murdered
while following Dongcheon…

275
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,506
Didn't happen.

276
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,425
We do not kill cops.

277
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,179
Cha Giho has been chasing me for ages.

278
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,348
He crossed the line years ago.

279
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,393
He appeased, deceived,
and entrapped us.

280
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,061
He did anything he could.

281
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,523
And now that the gun has surfaced,

282
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,442
he's starting to play dirty.

283
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,779
Don't buy it.

284
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,790
I'm telling the truth.

285
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,334
The cops took all of it.

286
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,925
You know…

287
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,176
Huh?

288
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,386
…there aren't…

289
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,139
…very many people…

290
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,310
…in this world that I like.

291
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,353
Especially…

292
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,567
can't stand assholes that lie.

293
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,488
But who in this line of work doesn't lie?

294
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,741
It's a world of villains.

295
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,955
Listen, if you're gonna lie to me…

296
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,123
Here.

297
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,167
-Put more thought into it.
-That's not it, Gangjae…

298
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,674
You need to show sincerity.

HE FOUND AN IMPORTANT CLUE

302
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,148
TO CHOI MUJIN.
AND DURING INVESTIGATION…

303
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,192
What does it say?

304
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,027
-Hey.
-Hmm.

305
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,779
Gangjae's and Mango's are the same.

306
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,405
-LSD?
-Yeah.

307
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,740
Oh, jeez.

308
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,283
Hold on.

309
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,079
Captain.

310
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,914
On my desk.

311
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,960
Detective Oh.

312
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,629
What are you doing later?

313
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,174
Why?

314
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,468
Wanna grab soju?

315
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,473
I have plans.

316
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,601
Okay. See you.

317
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,654
"Wanna grab some soju with me?"

318
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,198
Rejected!

319
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,701
-She's not easy.
-She's not. God, loser.

320
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,869
Wait! Buy me a soju!

321
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,538
Gunpyeong.

322
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,249
"Wanna get some liquor?"

323
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,021
Have you heard of Do Gangjae or this drug?

324
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,099
What are you doing here?

325
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,560
Pildo, what are you doing here?

326
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,645
Answer me.

327
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,859
-I was watching Mango.
-Why?

328
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,028
The drugs left in the gym
was the same ones

329
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,404
that Mango was carrying with him.

330
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,572
I know that.

331
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,035
I'm asking why you're investigating alone.

332
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,831
Because dangerous assholes have a new drug

333
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,624
and no one is investigating.

334
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,795
Is that all?

335
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,732
I'm going to find Gangjae.

336
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,279
Act on your own again,
and I'll make you regret it.

337
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,989
Drive.

338
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,175
Have a good night.

339
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,260
-Thank you.
-Come again.

340
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,309
Welcome back.

341
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,862
-You're coming often lately.
-Yes.

342
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,989
-Spicy fish stew and soju?
-Yes, please.

343
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:40,990
Okay.

344
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,877
Yes?

345
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,423
It's 261.

346
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,133
Beomya-ro.

347
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,563
Okay. Thanks.

348
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,236
It's a factory that shut down last month.

349
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,333
Tailing a druggie on a Friday?

350
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,295
Why are you working so hard on this?

351
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,588
You got no friends?

352
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,924
Well, I don't see you
surrounded by friends.

353
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,141
You're doing this…

354
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,310
because of your dad, right?

355
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:39,900
Welcome.

356
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,696
Uh, I forgot my cigarettes.

357
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,156
Hm.

358
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,658
Would you go and buy me a pack, please?

359
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,872
Please, ma'am.

360
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,643
Your dad was an addict, wasn't he?

361
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,522
He was high when he was in that accident.

362
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,443
You're looking for someone, right?

363
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,154
Who is it?

364
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,542
He gave it to him for free?

365
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,507
I don't see any of his minions.

366
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,487
Argh!

367
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,888
Where's Do Gangjae?

368
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,184
Where's Do Gangjae?

369
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,998
A fortune-teller told me…

370
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:10,337
this would be a lucky year for me.

371
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,006
This is from our security camera.

372
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,716
She suddenly showed up,

373
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,510
beat up all my guys,
and took all the drugs.

374
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,887
That fucking narc.

375
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,598
Stop whining about some narc.

376
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,974
Shut the fuck up.

377
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:26,520
What? What? Show me.

378
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,731
Hey!

379
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,649
It's the fucking bitch!

380
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,781
Bang.

381
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,499
Oh Hyejin.

382
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,007
Oh Hyejin the detective.

383
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,141
Lovely to see you,

384
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,394
you fucking bitch.
