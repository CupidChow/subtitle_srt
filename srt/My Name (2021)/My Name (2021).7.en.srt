00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,781
<i>Donghoon… No.</i>

4
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,742
<i>Joonsu was undercover.</i>

5
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,618
SONG JOONSU,
INCHANG DRUG INVESTIGATION UNIT

6
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,412
<i>He was our agent…</i>

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,714
Hey.

8
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,845
How's the Captain?

9
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,930
He's still in surgery.

10
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,057
For four hours now.

11
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,362
I brought him home last night.

12
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,533
He seemed nervous,
so I offered to stay, but he said no.

13
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,998
I'm sure it's Choi Mujin's fault,
but I don't know why.

14
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,210
Why go after the Captain?

15
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,380
We'll catch the guy.

16
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,299
Captain shot him.

17
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,594
We found blood and fingerprints
at the scene.

18
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,601
Why do you look so pale?

19
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,523
I didn't get to sleep much.

20
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,402
Hey.

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,613
It didn't record?

22
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,950
Get all the surveillance videos
from nearby.

23
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,076
Okay. I'll go too.

24
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,586
The surgery went well.

25
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,005
We'll move him to the ICU
and monitor him. Don't worry.

26
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,888
<i>Cha Giho survived.</i>

27
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,223
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

28
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,313
<i>Jiwoo was there at the scene.</i>

29
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,358
<i>She may have discovered the truth.</i>

30
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,652
<i>We have to kill her.</i>

31
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,606
Captain.

32
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,674
<i>What would you do
if you found your sister's killer?</i>

33
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,510
You find him and there's no…

34
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,222
No evidence?

35
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,892
<i>We'll get Choi Mujin.</i>

36
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,603
<i>We'll do it while he's still rattled.</i>

37
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,990
<i>You should stay put
for the time being.</i>

38
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,159
<i>The police are after you
for Gangjae's murder.</i>

39
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,097
She wants to get revenge.

40
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,601
Let her.

41
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,952
JEON PILDO

42
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,582
Die, bitch!

43
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,455
I told you

44
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,916
it was foolish.

45
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,004
You're a traitor's daughter,

46
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,590
but you came to us
and said you'll kill the culprit.

47
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,343
<i>When I served Donghoon,</i>

48
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,220
I got to know him very well.

49
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,472
He didn't belong in this line of work.

50
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,855
So how does it feel to be a clueless pawn?

51
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,992
It was you who killed my dad, right?

52
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,371
Oh, I wanted to be the one who killed him.

53
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,501
You've never ever seen
the real Choi Mujin.

54
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,675
If you backstabbed him,
he'll make you pay personally.

55
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,763
He enjoys watching them take
their final breath.

56
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,643
I wonder how your father looked.

57
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,106
How will you look when you die?

58
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,651
How about we find out?

59
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,800
Do you assholes really think
that you're human?

60
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,843
What about…

61
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,221
you?

62
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,515
Are you still human?

63
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,569
Did you get the videos?

64
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,030
Yes. Even from the streets nearby.

65
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,865
Let's see.

66
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,993
Hey, this is Detective Na Daesoo.

67
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,036
Yes.

68
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,205
Yes, what I asked for.

69
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,917
Yes.

70
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,087
Yeah. Where is that?

71
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,299
Okay.

72
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,302
So, 7-35?

73
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,387
Yeah. Thank you.

74
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,639
Uh, can you please head out there first?
We'll meet you.

75
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,890
We'll be right behind you.

76
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,475
Yes. Thank you.

77
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,811
-Let's go.
-Where?

78
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,106
Uh, three days ago, a retired doctor,

79
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,191
treated a man in his 50's
with a stab wound.

80
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,777
- Where did he treat him?
- Cheonwang Temple.

81
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,837
Choi Mujin.

82
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,009
Uh… Hey.

83
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,068
COME IN ASAP
WE GOT CHOI MUJIN

84
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,721
You did this.

85
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,781
And Captain Cha Giho.

86
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,953
Why did you do it?

87
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,665
Why did you turn yourself in?

88
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,463
Were you scared after stabbing a cop?

89
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,300
Did you feel like it was over?

90
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,595
There are many kinds of people
in this world.

91
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,393
And every person thinks they're special.

92
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,609
But if you take a closer look,

93
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,321
they are only two categories.

94
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,784
The predator…

95
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,121
or the prey.

96
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,709
You eat or get eaten.

97
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,630
Cha Giho was prey
pretending to be a predator.

98
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,967
So he won't live long.

99
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,143
Which one are you?

100
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,063
You're a murderer

101
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,940
and a drug lord.

102
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,069
You've done the most horrible things.

103
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,032
And that's your excuse?

104
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,621
You did all this
because you're a predator?

105
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,292
What you've done is wrong.

106
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,797
Think it over in solitary confinement.

107
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,134
You'll have lots of time.

108
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,598
Jeon.

109
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,475
Pil.

110
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,019
Do.

111
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,189
You really think…

112
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,902
I'm going away?

113
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,747
Hey, Pildo.

114
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,666
What is that asshole up to?

115
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,419
We have to wait and see
if he's got something up his sleeve.

116
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,923
That scumbag's done for
once Captain wakes up.

117
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,802
Huh?

118
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,011
Hold on. Excuse me.

119
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,431
You won't be able to get out of this.

120
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,951
INCHANG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

121
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,080
Hey.

122
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,289
Where have you been?

123
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,546
How did you end up catching him?

124
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,464
He came in himself.

125
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,344
Pildo is pressuring him
about the Do Gangjae case.

126
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,014
I'll go in there with him.

127
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,242
You turn yourself in?

128
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,205
I…

129
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:21,999
Please, sir.

130
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,588
I came to prove that I am innocent.

131
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,070
I never stabbed Do Gangjae.

132
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,159
I never ordered Cha Giho's death either.

133
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,583
Are you relying on him then?

134
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,545
The mole you had among us all.

135
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,383
The one who told you
about the cameras at the hotel

136
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,302
and leaked investigation details.

137
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,470
How loyal.

138
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,351
Whoever that is,
it won't be able to get you out.

139
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,608
I witnessed you stabbing Do Gangjae.

140
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,738
We have your knife with your prints.

141
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,201
They're all over it.

142
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,039
There's no need to confess.

143
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,085
HEAD OF LEGAL AFFAIRS
KANG SOOYEON

144
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,003
We'll have the warrant in an hour.

145
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,221
This time you're finished.

146
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,701
Detective Oh.

147
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,036
Leaving?

148
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,334
Just going to my car.

149
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,794
I left something.

150
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,590
The mole? How did you know?

151
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,969
I was giving him a test.

152
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,972
I had to see if he had someone.

153
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,644
So is there a mole?

154
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,063
We're speculating.

155
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,482
I couldn't identify him yet.

156
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,361
Be quick. We got to work.

157
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,908
Pildo.

158
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,290
Thank you.

159
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,712
You need to answer my calls.

160
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,882
Whatever the situation is,
you answer my calls.

161
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,025
- Daesoo.
- Hey.

162
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,235
We found him.

163
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,361
What?

164
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,333
That car arrived and left
around the time the Captain was attacked.

165
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,376
That one?

166
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,465
-I'll look up the plates.
-Okay.

167
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,425
Follow him. See where he went.

168
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,604
What is it?

169
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,147

- Captain Cha…
- Yeah?

171
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,527
Requested this be turn over to you.

172
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,946
What is it?

173
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,950
He said to give it to you
if anything were to happen to him.

Hi. Can I help you
with something?

180
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,275
I'm here to check some evidence, please.

181
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,068
Oh. Sure.

182
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,590
You're looking for evidence
for Do Gangjae's murder case, right?

183
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,260
Yeah, that's right.

184
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:30,098
Shit. I can't find this car. 60K 8640?

00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,391
Yes, that's right.

186
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,187
I think it's a fake plate.

Hey, where's Detective Oh?

196
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,457
You really need to come and look at this.

197
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,472
I removed the evidence.

198
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,310
Okay.

199
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,463
Stop Detective Oh Hyejin
from leaving the building.

200
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,132
- <i>This is the control room.</i>
- Yes. Okay.

00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,592
<i>Report to the control room immediately</i>

<i>if you spot Corporal Oh Hyejin.</i>

<i>Corporal Oh Hyejin
of the Drug Investigation Unit…</i>

204
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,473
<i>Corporal Oh Hyejin
of the Drug Investigation…</i>

205
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,809
The evidence won't be a problem for us.

206
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,688
Yes.

207
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,318
I'll tell you all the details later
when we meet up in person.

208
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,540
<i>She went to the evidence room.</i>

209
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,876
<i>She took evidence
from the Do Gangjae case.</i>

210
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,348
<i>She went by the back door.</i>

211
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,515
<i>The back door!</i>

212
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,409
Unit, close the gate!

213
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,163
Stop!

214
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,382
We're not done questioning you!

215
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,549
Choi Mujin!

216
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,139
There is no reason
for my client to be here any longer.

217
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,767
Call me if you find the evidence.

218
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,935
But I will claim

219
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,604
that the evidence has been tampered with.

220
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,827
Did you find Hyejin?

221
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,037
No. I'm sorry, sir.

222
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,014
Are you saying
she joined our team on purpose

223
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,225
to get information
and take the Captain out?

224
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,228
Hey, Gunpyeong. Get her…

225
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,064
No.

226
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,317
Take her things and run her prints.

227
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,234
What?

228
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,070
Oh Hyejin
isn't actually Oh Hyejin!

229
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,240
That can't be her real name, right?

230
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,994
Shit.

231
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,122
Hey, Pildo! Snap out of it!

232
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,790
We have to catch her, asshole!

233
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,083
Stop it. That's enough.

234
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,294
- Calm down.
- We have to catch her and ask

235
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,338
why she stabbed the Captain!

236
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,256
Damn it!

237
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,728
Because dangerous assholes have a new drug

238
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,146
and no one is investigating.

239
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,856
Is that all?

240
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,358
Four people died…

241
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,029
if the two gangs collide, more will die.

242
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,531
Do they kill Choi Mujin?

243
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,702
<i>Was it all…</i>

244
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,997
<i>Was all that a lie?</i>

245
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,545
CHOI MUJIN

246
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,801
<i>Because you're one of them?</i>

247
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,272
Was Detective Oh your friend's daughter?

248
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,402
The one you requested the passport for.

249
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:17,946
Mm-hm.

250
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,449
Did you turn yourself in then

251
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,493
to give her a test?

252
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,122
I had to be certain.

253
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,627
It would be a waste to kill her.

254
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,840
I'm surprised.

255
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,468
She'll be a fugitive
now that she's exposed,

256
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,303
but she's willing to go this far.

257
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,849
How did you convince her
to do this for you?

258
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,528
I tricked her.

259
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,923
<i>I choose to trust Detective Oh.</i>

260
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,466
<i>Pildo!</i>

261
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,597
She got me out to kill me.

262
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,144
I'm giving you my dagger.

263
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,109
You kill him as soon as you can.

264
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,423
<i>Taeju, come here.</i>

265
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,383
- <i>Come here.</i>
<i>- Take one with us.</i>

266
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,273
We'll go and get rid
of that bitch for you, sir.

267
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,945
Where is she gone?

268
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,825
We'll wait.

269
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,537
She'll come on her own.

270
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,424
Her only life goal…

271
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,761
is me.

272
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,225
My dad and I used to talk about
building a beach house

273
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,602
and live in there.

274
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,856
And I always wonder
if he were still alive now…

275
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,528
would we be able to live like that?

Hey.

00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,129
Pildo. I just heard back.

282
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:12,175
Her prints… they aren't in the system.

283
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,718
That fucking bitch.

284
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,221
She didn't even register her fingerprints.

285
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,225
That means Dongcheon
bred her meticulously.

286
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,269
It's a mess in here.

287
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,563

I'm sorry, Papa.

00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,246
I didn't know how you had been living.

292
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,961
If I had I wouldn't have resented you.

293
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,840
I would've hugged you instead.

294
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,512
It must have been so lonely
and exhausting.

295
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,058
I think I can understand you now.

296
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,896
I miss you,

297
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,898

00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,455
Oh, hey.

299
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,125
What is all this, huh?

300
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,960
What happened in this place?

301
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,336
Damn.

302
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,379
Everything's gone.

303
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,882
No one's here.

304
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:20,219
Maybe Choi Mujin got rid of her
and already cleared the place out.

305
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,054
Oh, shit.

Watch me.

310
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,786
And see what happens.

311
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,479
Hey, stop!

312
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,358
Turn around.

313
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,072
Don't test me anymore.

314
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,159
You've toyed with me enough.

315
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,463
Hands up.

316
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:37,148
You're under arrest for obstruction
of justice and attempted murder.

317
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,820
You have the right to an attorney.

318
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,031
You may testify on your own behalf.

319
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,826
You may challenge
the properness of arrest.

- No, sir.

322
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,531
Let go. Shit.

323
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,866
I considered her a colleague.

324
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,409
Hey. Look up.

325
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,827
Hey, you…

326
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,913
Your life is over, asshole.

327
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,706
You traitor bitch.

328
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,832
Shit.

329
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,378
Let go! Let go of me!

330
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,182
Can we get her out?

331
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,936
She stole evidence from the police agency
and was caught on camera.

332
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,729
There's no way.

333
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,814
Get her out.

334
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,149
In case she confesses?

335
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,235
She won't do that.

336
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,655
She's probably waiting for me now.

337
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,617
You said she killed Mr. Jung
and will come to kill you too.

338
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,287
Are you saying you'll make her come?

339
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,514
Give us some privacy.

340
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,723
Yes, sir.

341
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,863
The Captain was suspicious of you.

342
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,699
So you stabbed him?

343
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,743
So he wouldn't expose your identity?

344
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,542
Why did you thank me?

345
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,671
For being fooled by you?

346
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,757
Tell me.

347
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,095
Make an excuse. Lie. Say something!

348
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,145
I trusted you.

349
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,026
I didn't stab the Captain.

350
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,661
If I'm honest,

351
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,458
would you believe me?

352
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,140
No, I can't.

353
00:41:58,933 --> 00:41:59,892
Forget it.

354
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:04,522
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

355
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,127
OH HYEJIN

356
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,269
Your name.

357
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,107
What's your name?

358
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,158
What's your actual name?
