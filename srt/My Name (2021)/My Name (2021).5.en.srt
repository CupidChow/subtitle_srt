1
00:00:00,325 --> 00:00:03,889
Ripped by TTEOKBOKKIsubs

2
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,610
Untie me.

3
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,781
What?

4
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,952
You still can't beat me in a fair fight?

5
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,963
You still have that look in your eyes.

6
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,176
Like you fear nothing.

7
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,813
Now, this look I like.

8
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,154
Listen,
Mango doesn't know anyone.

9
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,238
Captain.

10
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,991
I can't reach Detective Jeon.

11
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,077
He asked me to look up a location…

12
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,994
And?

13
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,371
And his phone was turned off
right after he arrived.

14
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,217
<i>Did you get him?</i>

15
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,760
Hello, Gangjae.

16
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,429
Oh.

17
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,016
Those idiots.

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,603
I knew you'd come here.

19
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,649
<i>Well, I didn't wanna go
empty-handed,</i>

20
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,235
<i>so I've been preparing a gift for you.</i>

21
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,363
Look here.

22
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,203
OH HYEJIN

23
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,249
Hurry up.

24
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,334
There isn't much time.

25
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,129
If you wanna get a corpse.

26
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,804
You thought you were
something special, didn't you?

27
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,556
You are…

28
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,433
…absolutely nothing.

29
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,686
Let Detective Jeon go.

30
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,480
He has nothing to do with this.

31
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,944
How about you…

32
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:38,408
just worry about
what I'm about to do to you.

33
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,870
I'll play with you all night long.

34
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,466
Aargh! Goddamn!

35
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,806
I wanted Choi Mujin to watch you die!

36
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,932
Detective!

37
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,102
Hey. Say your final words.

38
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,521
I'll relay it for you.

39
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,443
I'll kill you as soon as I can.

40
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,786
Do it.

41
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,310
This must hurt like hell.

42
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,772
As I crushed you,

43
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,649
your skull will crack open

44
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,860
and your brain will ooze out.

45
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,240
It would be fun to watch,

46
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,242
but I don't have the time.

47
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:05,995
See ya.

48
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,258
Wake up, Pildo!

49
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,546
Gangjae!

50
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,852
Get out.

51
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,645
Get out now!

52
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,797
Pildo!

53
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,473
Pildo!

54
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,274
Gosh!

55
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,608
Pildo!

56
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,526
OH HYEJIN

57
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,576
Pildo!

58
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,536
Oh, my god.

59
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,662
Pildo.

60
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,122
How did you get here?

61
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,415
I'm serious.

62
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,250
Damn it.

63
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,504
A detective gets handcuffed.

64
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,630
Good going.

65
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,717
You crazy bastard. Get up.

66
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,223
Why does it feel nice being cursed at?

67
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,268
You okay?

68
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,311
Yeah.

69
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,188
-I'm okay.
-Hey.

70
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,606
Hey, hey!

71
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,064
Are you all right, sir?

72
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,947
Why did you go alone?

73
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,952
Gangjae attempted to kill Jiwoo.

74
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,498
So because of Jiwoo.

75
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,878
You could have been killed.

76
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,887
Jiwoo shot the gun on the ship.

77
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,894
She perform the action
at the risk of exposing herself.

78
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,191
What did you do?

79
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,402
Huh?

80
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,697
Taeju.

81
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,783
Taeju!

82
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,916
Can you be trusted?

83
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,258
I'm sorry, sir.

84
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,397
She's in surgery right now.

85
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,356
Hold on.

86
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,192
How long will the surgery take?

87
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,028
We don't know yet.

88
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,363
We have to catch that asshole Do Gangjae.

89
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,116
You go and get some treatment first.

90
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,245
We can catch punks
like Do Gangjae whenever.

91
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,205
That asshole stabbed my partner!

92
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,582
Pildo!

93
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,004
I choose to trust Detective Oh.

94
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,590
Sir…

95
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,261
we can't send my team out
with those psychos running lose.

96
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,471
All Narcotics members
will carry firearms

97
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,640
until the situation is resolved.

98
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,517
-Hello.
-Hello.

99
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,893
-Police.
-Yes.

100
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,020
Can I take a look
at the video on that camera?

101
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,899
Have you seen this man?

102
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,527
Girls. Come over here.

103
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,195
Look at this.

104
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,948
This is Do Gangjae and Kim Cheolho.

105
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,575
Have you seen them?

106
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,264
-Where's Gangjae?
-I don't know!

107
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,351
Burn in hell, you motherfuckers!

108
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,896
The result isn't going to change.

109
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,108
You can end it quickly
or you can let it drag out.

110
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,816
Let's not waste our energy.

111
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,251
-Stay still, assholes.
-Sons of bitches!

112
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,836
You have the right to remain silent.

113
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,255
You have the right to an attorney.

114
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,881
You have the right to remain silent.

115
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,550
But don't do that.

116
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,093
Because I'm pissed off.

117
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,092
I'm sorry, sir. Gangjae…

118
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,149
Have you eaten?

119
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,152
No, sir. Not yet.

120
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,862
Want <i>samgyetang?</i>

121
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,448
Yes, sir.

122
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,450
We used to go there often.

123
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,076
Simakse.

124
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,661
Yes, sir.

125
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,545
Right.

126
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,964
You had a thing for their daughter.

127
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,550
No, sir.

128
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,801
Guess it didn't work out.

129
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,513
It wasn't anything, sir.

130
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,857
I know you're trying.

131
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,908
Let's see what Narcotics does next.

132
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,537
Gangjae will show up
if driven to a corner.

133
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,247
Yes, sir.

134
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,763
Papa.

135
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,892
Papa!

136
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,738
<i>Papa.</i>

137
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,615
<i>Papa?

138
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,283
Papa, open the door.

139
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,734
Papa!

140
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:08,986
Papa!

141
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,488
Papa! Don't go!

142
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,615
Please don't leave me here alone!

143
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,660
Papa!

144
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,998
Papa! Don't go!

145
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,958
Papa!

146
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,143
Are you okay?

147
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,028
You scowl even when you sleep.

148
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,034
You won't last long like that.

149
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,165
I used to live for revenge like you do.

150
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,378
I had a little sister.

151
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,674
She went clubbing
to celebrate getting into college,

152
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,302
her beer was drugged.

153
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,597
She died right then.

154
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,310
She had a weak heart.

155
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,233
Did they catch who did it?

156
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,776
No.

157
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,445
Don't know who it was.

158
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,200
If we catch all the drug dealers
and drug ring members,

159
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,160
he'll probably be among them.

160
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,543
I don't know who it is you wanna catch,

161
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,587
but I'll help you.

162
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,714
Let's get him together.

163
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,807
Here's some clothes.

164
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,142
I'll get your papers done.

165
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,656
How're you doing? You okay?

166
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,451
Touch this.

167
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,454
Touch right here.

168
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,251
So awesome, right?

169
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,422
The bump won't go down.

170
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,842
One centimeter over,
and I would have died.

171
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,926
God.

172
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,721
Your hand is covered in scars.

173
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,894
Because I was a coward.

174
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,524
Not anymore.

175
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,860
When I first joined Narcotics…

176
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,322
When someone had a knife,

177
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,490
I used my hands.

178
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,897
Detective Oh! Hey.

179
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,442
Let's go inside. It's cold.

180
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:43,909
After getting stabbed,

181
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,827
you need to fill
that hole with meat, you know.

182
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,081
We're using our remaining
team outing budget.

183
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,834
Hold on, Detective Oh
should be drinking something warm.

184
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,835
Here.

185
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,255
What is that?

186
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,548
It's some chamomile tea.

187
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,509
Nice, Gunpyeong.

188
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,135
Chamomile.

189
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,887
-Just grill the meat properly.
-Yes, sir.

190
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,430
Detective Oh's hungry.

191
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,891
Well done or medium? Which do you like?

192
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,643
Daesoo is too unrefined

193
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,812
and can't eat this
unless it's fully cooked.

194
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,106
Yeah, right. I eat beef tartare.

195
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,565
You punk.

196
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,484
Don't make her laugh. It'll hurt.

197
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,069
Sorry.

198
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,033
You're a miracle.

199
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,702
You're back with all of us.

200
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,703
Oh Hyejin.

201
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,709
Cheers.

202
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,883
What meat is this?

203
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,760
That's beef and that's mushroom.

204
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,388
Flip this.

205
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,700
Mr. Choi. It's me.

206
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,952
I know where Jiwoo is.

207
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,623
We need to send someone out.

208
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,711
Who is she?

209
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,259
A friend's daughter.

210
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,429
Book a flight
and find her a place to live.

211
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,224
A house on the beach.

212
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,228
I'll do that now, sir.

213
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:03,965
CHOI MUJIN, CEO OF HOTEL LIBER

214
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,342
CHARGED FOR DRUGS AND ASSAULT,
DONGCHEON

215
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,049
Shut it down and get out of there.

216
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,469
<i>I'll make preparations
so you can leave the country.</i>

217
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,221
I can't do that.

218
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,807
<i>Jiwoo.</i>

219
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,143
I still got to check on something.

220
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,269
<i>Yoon Jiwoo!</i>

221
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,980
Do as I say.

222
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,150
If they capture him, you'll be in danger.

223
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,445
I'm gonna take care of it.

224
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,261
Captain.
You wanted to see me?

225
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,475
Check out this number.

226
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,687
Get all calls made, received,
and where it's been the last three weeks.

227
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,646
Yes, sir.

228
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,232
OH HYEJIN

229
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,318
It's classified.

230
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,361
Yes, sir.

231
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,999
Asshole, get going.

232
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,335
Have a nice day.

233
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,670
I'll walk on my own.

234
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,047
-What?
-Let's get you processed.

235
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,298
Hey.

236
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,133
What are you doing here?

237
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,010
We said to take a few more days off.

238
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,470
Cabin fever.

239
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,388
We'll catch Do Gangjae soon.

240
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,188
Hey, they want us to carry firearms.
Pick up your gun.

241
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,232
-Okay.
-I got it, punk.

242
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,733
Here. You forgot this.

243
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,817
Thanks.

244
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,946
You're here.

245
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,948
Are you okay?

246
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,783
I'm doing fine, sir.

247
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,910
Captain Cha.

248
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,246
Hey. Come in.

249
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,835
<i>Jiwoo.
Did you hear from your dad?</i>

250
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,424
What did you say that make him come home?

251
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,763
OH HYEJIN

252
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,433
It's really good to see you again.

253
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,938
Do you know her?

254
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,234
Yes.

255
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,945
I saw her a few times
when she was with Violent Crimes.

256
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,281
She's a good worker.

257
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,451
Come on.

258
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,468
Detective Oh.

259
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,053
We should…

260
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,180
grab dinner soon.

261
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,121
Yoon Donghoon's daughter…

262
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,666
Did you find out anything else?

263
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,212
No, she's just nowhere.

264
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,716
She vanished
after the thing with her father.

265
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,511
Why do you ask?

266
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,184
The missing gun was at a crime scene.

267
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,356
Yoon Donghoon's gun?

268
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:42,160
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 3
SERGEANT CHO JINSAE

269
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,080
I've narrowed it down
to two places.

270
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,466
Cho Jinsae met with Cha Giho.

271
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:14,401
INCHANG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

272
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,241
Are you still looking
for your dad's killer?

273
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,743
Why did you lie?

274
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,372
Hmm.

275
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,670
Because something entertaining
seems to be going on.

276
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,552
Here. I got a tip for you.

277
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,138
Your dad's case…

278
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,682
got buried by Cha Giho.

279
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,517
Interesting, huh?

280
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,062
I heard a gun was found.

281
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,565
Is Cha Giho the killer?

282
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,278
If you tell anyone about who I am…

283
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,321
What would I gain
from exposing you?

284
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,449
Just a pain in the ass.

285
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,244
Best of luck.

286
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,812
Firearm number 20KG0637.

287
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,397
Corporal Oh Hye-jin.

288
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,524
Confirmed.

289
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,363
That's right.

290
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,073
We'll put out an APB.

291
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,493
Now?

292
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,496
Okay.

293
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,125
<i>The police are conducting a manhunt
for Do Gangjae and Kim Cheolho</i>

294
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,920
<i>on suspicions of murder
and distribution of drugs.</i>

295
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,881
<i>They've distributed

296
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,925
<i>since November of last year.</i>

<i>The police are asking

300
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,268
<i>to capture these dangerous criminals.</i>

301

<i>The government has issued
a new policy on real estate…</i>

302
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,281
Do Gangjae doesn't know we have you.

303
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,952
First one who grab the phone
will have a different future.

304
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,833
You take the phone,

305
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,543
you're dead.

306
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,756
The three of you, out.

307
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,467
You hear him? Get up.

308
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,262
Get up, you three! Get up!

309
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,305
You. Get out.

310
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,517
Motherfucker. Call and you're dead.

311
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,018
Get out of here. Out!

312
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,688
-Get out.
-Good thinking.

313
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,152
Yoon Jiwoo.

314
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,156
What are you doing with that girl, huh?

315
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,244
She asked for this.

316
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,833
You see,

317
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,503
I've caught many bad guys,

318
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,840
and you're a real demon, my friend.

319
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,512
A junkie like you wouldn't get it.

320
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,516
It's called conviction.

321
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,771
I don't know much
about shit like conviction.

322
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,649
But the price of my silence has reason.

323
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,867
A few bags of drugs won't cut it.

324
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,703
I see.

325
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,086
You never disappoint me.

326
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,004
Mm.

327
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,967
Hey, Mr. Hwang. How thick is it?

328
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,680
You son of a bitch. Fuck!

329
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,057
You prick. Hey!

330
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,810
I'm a detective, you son of a bitch.

331
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,062
Let me go!

332
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,438
You son of a bitch.

333
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,421
I just got here.

334
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,175
-Ha! Good job.
-Why are you paying him?

335
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,760
I'm in a good mood.

336
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,565
So? You let her through,
you moron?

337
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,275
Shit.

338
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,360
Hang up.

339
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,741
Chair. Have a seat.

340
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,288
What now?

341
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,917
Why do you bastards keep bugging me?
Goddamn it.

342
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,128
You were the one
that sold me out to Gangjae.

343
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,593
I only did because I was told to.

344
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,474
This is a dilemma.

345
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,605
How do I get rid of the guy
who tried to kill me?

346
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,408
I can be a cop and arrest you
for conspiracy to murder.

347
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,621
Or I can leak it to Choi Mujin

348
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,291
that you're Do Gangjae's puppet
who attacked his gym.

349
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,584
I was not!

350
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,337
All I did was get the drugs.

351
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,886
But would Choi Mujin believe you?

352
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,681
Yeah…

353
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,308
That's the better option.

354
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,354
It'll be a pain in the ass
to incriminate you.

355
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,190
Wait… Shit. Hold on.

356
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,866
What do you want?

357
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,951
Tell me.

358
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:00,431
<i>Do Gangjae is fleeing
the country by boat.</i>

363
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,055

00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,224
<i>Captain Cha Giho?</i>

365
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,437
<i>This is Do Gangjae.</i>

366
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,030
Why? Turning yourself in?

367
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,118
-<i>What? Like hell I am.</i>
-Do Gangjae.

368
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,411
Do Gangjae.

369
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,706
<i>I'm just trying to help you out.</i>

370
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,464
You wanna catch Choi Mujin?

371
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,346
I'll lead you to the guy…

372
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,683
if you let me get out.

373
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,490
Where did you get that intel?

374
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,993
From Jiwoo.

375
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,787
But what if it's a trap?

376
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,958
You think too much.

377
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,338
You suspect everything

378
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,174
and look for the safest route.

379
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,719
But we act now.

380
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,140
I believe Jiwoo.

381
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,855
You stay here.

382
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,443
If anything goes wrong,

383
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,696
someone must lead the organization.

384
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:43,928
TO JIWOO, FROM DAD

385

<i>The cars are coming in.</i>

386
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,752
It's Choi Mujin.

00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,425
<i>We're in position.</i>

DETECTIVE OH HYEJIN

390
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,832
Shit.

391
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,043
Stupid narcs.

392
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,525
<i>Don't move. Stay in position.</i>

393
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,943
Don't move. Stay in position.

394
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,908
Gangjae.

395
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,453
Walk over and say hi.

396
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,672
I'm glad you're here.

397
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,551
I thought I wouldn't see you.

398
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,124
Captain. Should we move?

399
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,295
Captain!

400
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:32,948
Should we move?

401
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,993
Gangjae!

402
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,623
<i>Arrest them. Arrest them!</i>

403
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,628
Keep down!

404
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,076
It's a good day to die.

405
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,290
Couldn't agree more.

406
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,893
Get over here, Gangjae.

407
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,494
Shit.

408
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,340
Fuck. Shit!

409
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,260
I wanted to live a fucking cool life.

410
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,638
You made a foolish choice.

411
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,476
So did you.

412
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,548
You let your guard down!

413
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,385
I won't die alone, you fucker!

414
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:29,935
Hands up.

415
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,447
Get out of here.

416
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,449
Move it!

417
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,884
You stupid bitch.

418
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,261
You don't know anything.

419
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:06,889
Drop it.

420
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,682
Shoot.

421
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,185
You said you'd kill me.

422
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,937
So do it.

423
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:16,857
Shoot.

424
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:21,570
Do it!

425
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,864
You can't, can you?

426
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,908
Not anyone can fucking kill people.

427
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,659
Put your gun down!

428
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,663
What will he do

429
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:35,459
if he finds out you're Choi Mujin's peon?

430
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:50,891
Choi Mujin!

431
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,149
Got you red-handed.

432
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,418
Hey, detective!

433
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,796
I'll turn myself in.

434
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,464
Detective Oh, calm down.

435
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,635
I'll confess everything.

436
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,305
And…

437
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,058
…Yoon Ji--

438
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:00,794
Fuck…

439
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,511
Fucking bitch.
