3
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,903
She won't slow us down.

4
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,071
Stand up, asshole, okay?

5
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,282
Hey there, Mango.

6
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,200
Answer me this, having a good day?

7
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,618
That hurts. Oh.

8
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,953
What are you doing?

9
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,788
She is my partner.

10
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,457
Let go.

11
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,253
Let go of him.

12
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,549
Goddamn it.

13
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,427
Hey, watch your mouth.

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,637
My partner was just saying hello to you.

15
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:58,850
You're brave…

16
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,395
but you need more skills.

17
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,191
Mm.

18
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,861
What are you doing?

19
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,489
You got a warrant?

20
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,533
Uh, no. I don't have one.

21
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,747
Well, you've known
for having tiny balls, Mango,

22
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,958
but you attack a cop and demand a warrant.

23
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,003
You're going overboard
so the drugs are here, right?

24
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,881
What do you mean?

25
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,549
What, what drugs are you talking about?

26
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,385
Wow, you're stuttering. How cute.

27
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,304
You know.

28
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,223
The small ones…

29
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,058
The black ones…

30
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,769
Who does this money
belong to, huh?

31
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,479
Shall we talk to the people inside?

32
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,106
I wonder how much they are gambling.

33
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,398
Wait, hold on!

34
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,484
You, don't move.

35
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,987
You can't even handle this.

36
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,116
Hang on, you can't do this
even if you are a cop.

37
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,284
Yes, I can.
To an asshole like you.

38
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,410
Come on.

39
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,996
-Hey! Everyone, freeze!
-Hang on.

40
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,790
This is the police!

41
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:07,919
Leave all the money on the table
and show me some ID's!

42
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,087
ID's out!

43
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,548
You're all getting busted.

44
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,092
-Get your ID's out.
-Detective.

45
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,261
Detective Jeon Pildo!

46
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,597
Why are you doing this?

47
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,515
Why?

48
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,392
Where are the drugs?

49
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,229
Oh, man, what drug are you talking about?

50
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,482
We don't even have Tylenol here.

51
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,734
Ah, didn't you hide it here last time?

52
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,073
Right, you hid it up there
last time too, yeah?

53
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,366
It was high up.

54
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,743
You runt. Let's go.

55
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,371
Hey, now, this isn't a pharmacy.

56
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,123
I can't even reach up here.

57
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,457
There's nothing up there!

58
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,876
What are you looking for?

59
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,627
-You little shit.
-Oh, my gosh.

60
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,795
-Hey!
-Yo!

61
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,463
You're obstructing my business.

62
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,632
Huh? I'm the one that needs drugs.

63
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,094
What…

64
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,220
Why…

65
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,973
That fucking bitch.

66
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,619
Shit. She found it.

67
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,037
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

68
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,288
Get over here, you asshole.

69
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,081
-Uh… Hold on.
-Come on now. Look here.

70
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,209
Asshole.

71
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,877
I'm so screwed.

72
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,717
Take, take it easy. I'm injured right now.

73
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,094
Come on!

74
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,347
Ah!

75
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,725
Oh, shit.

76
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,854
Hey, so… I'm talking right now!

77
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,274
I said to bring Mango out,
not beat everyone.

78
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,235
They wouldn't listen to me.

79
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,446
It wasn't because you wanted to show me
how tough you are?

80
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,202
Didn't you wanna test
what I was capable of?

81
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,789
Don't do that again.

82
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,169
What you're wearing
isn't even bulletproof.

83
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,464
This isn't Violent Crimes, you know.

84
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,175
Yeah, I get it.

85
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,348
Where did you get this?

86
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,978
Detective Oh isn't a complete flake.

87
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,230
It was just a gift. Yeah.

88
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,232
It's just a sample I was given.

89
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,110
Exactly. Who gave it to you?

90
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,822
Shit.

91
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,787
-Send it to NFS.
-Sir.

92
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,624
So, Mango.

93
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,128
How many years will you get this time?

94
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,131
Are you besties with the drug dealer?

95
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,966
Shit. Goddamn it.

96
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,682
This guy is…

97
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,643
really scary.

98
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,201
<i>Why did the gods create drugs?</i>

99
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,331
<i>They open Pandora's box.</i>

100
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,500
<i>The last sliver of hope?</i>

101
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,586
<i>I don't think so.</i>

102
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,380
<i>Drugs.</i>

103
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,886
<i>War, death, poverty, disease.</i>

104
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,804
<i>Why must we endure these hardships?</i>

105
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,097
<i>Forget them.</i>

106
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,102
If you put this in your mouth,

107
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,230
your fears disappear
and you become a superhero.

108
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,692
Not a trace left in your body.

109
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,653
It's a gift from the gods.

110
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,949
That's an enticing offer.

111
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,620
But, uh, Choi Mujin won't stand for it.

112

113
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,761
Go out and get yourselves a black suit.

114
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,931
Get ready for a funeral.

00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,063
He was?

117
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,774
He had a new kind of drug.

118
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,609
That's what Narcotics is looking for.

119
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,112
And where is it from?

120
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,822
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

121
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,698
I'll figure it out.

122
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,866
<i>Okay then.</i>

123
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,579
Call in Mr. Jung.

124
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,797
I registered you into the system.

125
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,550

No.

I hear that there's a new drug.

Yes, sir.

147
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,008
I've heard rumors.

148
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,265
Because of Mr. Bae, for three weeks,
we couldn't supply drugs.

149
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,226
During that time,
was the new drug ring formed?

150
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,978
I can look into it now, sir.

151
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,020
There's no need.

-Where?
-The North Port.

157
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,291
I'll go myself and check.

158
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,591

167
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,027
Yes, sir. Understood.

Dang it. Carbs make me fat,
but they taste so good.

169
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,685
All food is fattening
when you're old, man.

170
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,978
You, jerk. So you don't want it?

171
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,438
Ah, you lost.

172
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,776
-Here you are, Detective Oh.
-Thank you.

173
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,405
Detective Ko Gunpyeong.

174
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:40,866
This one? Hm.

175
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,955
We're not questioning Mango anymore?

176
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,582
He has intel, so we have to keep him
locked up for now.

177
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,584
He'll talk if we don't give him attention.

178
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,003
What about investigating?

179
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,630
Hey.

180
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,384
What is the first quality of a good cop?

181
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,347
For Narcotics, wouldn't it be information?

182
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,432
That's wrong.

183
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,683
It's patience.

184
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,145
If you can wait, you'll catch them.

185
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,522
Go eat.

186

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,385
Captain. The target's on the move.

188
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,679
Let's go.

189
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,807
Call for backup.

190
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,892
Sir.

191
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,978
-Let's go.
-Come on. We're heading out.

192
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,065
Number 20K70637.

193
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,192
Corporal Oh Hyejin.

194
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,154
Okay.

195
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,705
So, remove your cell phones.

196
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:24,970
Tonight,

197
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,973
our target is…

198
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,230
…Choi Mujin.

199
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,699
<i>Choi Mujin.</i>

200
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,494
He's the owner of Hotel Liber.

201
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,622
He's the leader of the largest drug ring
in our country Dongcheon.

202
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,375
They sell 90 percent of methamphetamine.

203
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:59,296
Bae Jungoo, their middle man, the CEO
of a shipping firm, committed suicide.

204
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,925
But a ship owned by Bae
arrived from Thailand two days ago.

205
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,802
Choi Mujin took over that factory.

206
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,347
North Port Section K.

207
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,393
Choi Mujin will arrive in 50 minutes.

208
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,937
Narcotics Teams Alpha and Beta
will go inside.

209
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,146
The rest will back them up.

210

HOTEL LIBER CHOI MUJIN, MONITOR 1

211
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,279
Focus on this one man.

212
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,407
We must arrest Choi Mujin.

213
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,658
Do you understand?

214
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,368
Yes, sir.

215
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,120
Move out.

216
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,209
Let's go.

217
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,559
Here's your body cam.

218
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,145
-Back up your data.
-I will.

219
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,730
Hey.

220
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,859
Make sure we get Choi Mujin
and the evidence. Okay?

221
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,360
Yes, sir.

222
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,363
Don't you be nervous. Got it?

223
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,856
We're going radio silent now.

224
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,140
Hold positions and standby.

225
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,561
Thank you for coming here.

226
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,774
-Is that the workshop?
-Yes.

227
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:27,027
We get materials in Thailand,
and we manufacture at sea.

228
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,654
Please come this way.

229
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,674
One, in position.

230
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,010
<i>Two, in position.</i>
<i>Choi Mujin is confirmed.</i>

231
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,013
Infiltrate.

232
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,688
<i>Get him!</i>

233
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,191
<i>Get him! Don't let him get away!</i>

234
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,764
They look like the crew.

235
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,766
They claim they don't know
about the drugs.

236
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,934
Keep going.

237
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:04,977
<i>We're going in.</i>

238
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,282
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>the target is Choi Mujin.</i>

239
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,950
<i>We need evidence.</i>

240
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,973
What's going on?

241
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,768
<i>Hey, Pildo! Pildo!</i>

242
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,978
<i>Listen up,</i>
<i>there's a situation with Pildo.</i>

243
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,439
<i>Team Two, move to Team One now. Hurry up!</i>

244
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,983
Now, we won't be short
on our supply.

245
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,736
Seems Mr. Bae was smart.

246
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,284
Yamamoto's goods are ready.

247
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,369
Sir.

248
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,415
Choi Mujin, put your hands up!

249
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,668
<i>Put that down!</i>

250
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,628
<i>No, stop!</i>

251
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,215
Choi Mujin, you're under arrest
for the manufacture of illegal drugs.

252
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,050
Don't, Jung Taeju!

253
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,638
Are you okay? Who fired that shot?

254
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,603
<i>Hey, Pildo. Pildo!</i>

255
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,938
Freeze, Choi Mujin!

256
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,529
<i>Get Choi Mujin.</i>

257
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,323
Don't let him get away!

258
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,034
Freeze, Choi Mujin!

259
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,300
That's Choi Mujin, damnit.
He's getting away.

260
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,894
Damn it! Let's go!

261
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,571
-Where's Choi Mujin?
-Choi Mujin?

262
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,114
-We have to find him.
-He was here?

263
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,491
-Find Choi Mujin!
-Let's find him. Come on!

264
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,314
Find him?

265
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,734
-You.
-Yes?

266
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,111
Go check the inside of the ship again.

267
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,070
Yes, sir.

268
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,369
Did you see who fired?

269
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,455
Damn!

270
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,715
Damn it. With that crack,
we can't even use it as evidence.

271
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,220
-Captain.
-Huh?

272
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,221
This is it.

273
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,929
These are crazy people.

274
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,689
Captain.

275
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,683
Shit!

276
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,619
Shit!

277
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,999
Cha Giho was after us.

278
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,292
We didn't realize it sooner

279
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,627
-because they--
-Taeju.

280
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,798
Who are we?

281
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,718
Did you forget who we are
because we wear designer suits

282
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,011
and have fancy titles?

283
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,139
I'm sorry.

284
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,477
Find who is sneaking our information.

285
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,230
Yes, sir.

286
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,482
But…

287
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,319
why didn't Jiwoo contact us?

288
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,461
<i>We checked,</i>
<i>and no one from our team</i>

289

<i>discharged their weapon.</i>

290
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,840

Look.

300
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,895
You and Choi Mujin were talking together.

301
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,105
I saw you.

302
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,816
Choi Mujin was there!

303
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,611
I don't know anything.

304

-Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Stop that!
-Ooh…

308
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,497
I saw you in there with Choi Mujin.

309
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,207
So, talk. Talk!

310
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,804

-What?

311

Captain. Wait. Do you suspect us?

Hey, Captain.

314
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,368
Captain. It wasn't us.

315
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,184
Put them away.

316
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,147
What the hell is going on?

317
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,900
Ah, shit.

318
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,240
Damn it.

319
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,451
Were Park Changoo and Mango
just fake outs?

320
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,831
We booked the small fries and waited
for Choi Mujin to let his guard down.

321
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,209
So he was the actual target
all along then.

322
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,044
We have to catch him in the act!

323
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,180
Choi Mujin.

324
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,849
Became the boss of Dongcheon 12 years ago.

325
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,351
He was suspected of countless crimes

326
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,895
including drug manufacture,
sales, assault,

327
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,272
and murder-for-hire,
but he was never indicted.

328
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,235
We never had enough evidence
and others always confessed for him.

Do you know who murdered him?

334
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,841
We don't know.

335
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,968
We never found the murder weapon.

336
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,886
-But--
-What happened?

337
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,021
You found no evidence and burned the ship?

338
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,107
Cha Giho.

339
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,025
What are you doing?

340
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:02,986
Sorry, sir.

341
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,197
I told you not to act on your emotions.

342
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,157
What will you do about this?

343
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,160
We have to catch Choi Mujin.

344
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,248
We have to kill that asshole!

345
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,840
All of you, keep quiet.

346
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,635
If this gets out, we're all dead.

347
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,852
Get it together.

348
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,885
Can't we just catch that asshole, huh?

349
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,389
And who fired that shot, huh?

350
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,561
How long have you been after him?

351
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,315
Since before I joined Narcotics, uh,
four years.

352
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,318
Why is Captain after him, specifically?

353
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,402
Why else?

354
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,197
We wanna take the largest drug ring down.

355
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,534
Do you know how much drugs
Dongcheon distributes yearly?

356
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,496
Yeah, but it's personal.

357
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,169
A while back, the youngest member
of Narcotics died.

358
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,172
I think it was around 2004
or something…

359
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,237
So from then until now…

360
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,279
Yeah.

361
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,115
Just imagine…

362
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,410
how the Captain must feel right now, yeah?

363
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,456
What do we do now?

364
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,250
What else can we do?

365
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,502
We try again.

366
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,964
Until the Dongcheon assholes are all gone.

367
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,300
Here.

368
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,220
How are you so chill, hmm?

369
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,349
Oh, Junho. Over here.

370
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,351
Junho.

371
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,561
What? Junho's here?

372
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,603
-Hey there.
-Huh?

373
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,772
-I need to make a phone call.
-Oh, okay.

374
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,773
Sit down.

375
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,942
-Hey, kid. You okay?
-Oh, yeah.

376
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,777
I'm glad you came.

377
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,029
-Yeah…
-Another glass, please!

378
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,239
That looks good.

379
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,449
Yeah. Eat up!

380
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,329
Are you okay?

381
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,878
<i>It was a raid,</i>
<i>I didn't know in advance.</i>

382
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,422
Do I have a tail?

383
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,132
No.

384
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,137
<i>The hotel has cameras.</i>

385
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,097
<i>And the hallway in front of the penthouse.</i>

386
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,600
<i>The basement elevator entrance.</i>
<i>The garage exit.</i>

387
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,436
<i>There are three cameras in those places.</i>

388
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,566
Which means someone is a mole.

389
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,194
I'll find out.

390
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,615
<i>Did you shoot the gun?</i>

391
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,327
<i>I had no way of contacting you.</i>

392
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,914
But I want you to know I…

393
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,461
decided to use the gun at the crime scene.

394
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,465
<i>The truth will get out now…</i>

395
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,428
<i>…since I left the gun.</i>

396
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,591
You know Junho?

397
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,385
You sent him on vacation.

398
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,178
We'll get you working again.
Don't worry about it.

399
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,596
We'll all work together once you return.

400
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,014
-Right?
-Yeah.

401
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,349
Let's drink.

402
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,517
You punks.

403
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,811
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

404
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,090
What?

405
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,553
Daesoo.

406
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,596
What?

407
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,472
What?

408
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,391
Hey.

409
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,101
What's this?

410
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,939
-What's going on?
-Ah…

411
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,649
Shit. Goddamn it.

412
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,408
-We've been compromised.
-Shit.

413
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,915
Hey!

414
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,584
You ready?

415
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,547
I've been waiting for this for five years,
what do you think?

416
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:55,124
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

417
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,374
Get out of the way! Watch out!

418
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,636
This place hasn't changed at all.

419
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,515
Mr. Jung!

420
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,642
I'm home!

421
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,770
Kill them all.

422
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,822
You son of a bitch!

423
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,077
You killing bastard!

424
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,299
Shit!

425
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,176
Stop!

426
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,678
Stop! Stop!

427
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:20,186
It's been so long, Taeju.

428
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,396
I thought I should say hi.

429
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,816
You asshole.

430
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,942
Do you really think--

431
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,944
Hey! Don't be mean.

432
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,948
Now, come on.

433
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,535
Aren't you glad I'm home?

434
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,833
Stop it!

435
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:47,379
You motherfucker! Goddamn it!

436
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,054
"Kill me if you want."

437
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,349
That's how you look.

438
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,353
I won't do it.

439
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,063
So calm down.

440
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,695
Your face.

441
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,948
Leg.

442
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,492
Arm.

443
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,079
Choose which one, I'll hit.

444
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,124
It's typical.

445
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,547
I couldn't choose.

446
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,562
THE POWER OF SCIENCE
REVEALS THE TRUTH

447
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,563
Thank you.

448
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,567
Hi.

449
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,860
Really? Okay.

450
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,113
Hey. Will you tell him I'll call him?

451
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,197
Thanks.

452
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,676
<i>Where are you?</i>

453
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,386
At home.

454
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,804
<i>Come to Dongcheon's gym.</i>

455
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,232
You need to get to a hospital.

456
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,821
Stand up straight.

457
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,158
How could you not see who attacked?
Are you kidding me?

458
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,117
Go in.

459
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,120
Jung Taeju.

460
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,456
You really won't talk?

461
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,083
Hmm?

462
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,393
I'M BACK

463
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,144
I don't know who it was,

464
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,647
but someone wrecked Dongcheon's muscle.

465
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,109
Three died
and one is in critical condition.

466
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,654
Do they kill Choi Mujin?
