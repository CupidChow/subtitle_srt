Ripped by TTEOKBOKKIsubs

2
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,077
<i>What's your name?</i>

3
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>What's your actual name?</i>

4
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,857
Send my message.

5
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,060
I don't need you.

6
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,148
I'm not here to help you.

7
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,446
Mr. Choi asked me to give you a message.

8
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,410
You won't end up in prison, I promise.

9
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,707
Come back to me.

10
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,386
You were hurt.

11
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,186
My client needs medical help.

12
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,229
What?

13
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,899
Our captain is still in a coma, lady.

14
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,318
Should I submit
a formal complaint?

15
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,737
I'd worry about yourself first before her.

16
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,157
You should cut your losses.

17
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,203
Bring me documents on Dongcheon,
and we'll request mitigation.

18
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,331
The reporters seem to be curious
about what happened.

19
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,712
If we say there was
a Dongcheon mole in Narcotics,

20
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,839
that would be news.

21
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,674
Hey.

22
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,178
<i>She left for the hospital.</i>

23
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,893
Bring her to me.

24
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,270
Yes, sir.

25
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:53,376
WARD 15

26
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,215
Captain?

27
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,092
<i>Pildo.</i>

28
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,014
I'm at the hospital. I'll come over.

29
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,599
-Is he awake?
-Yes.

30
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,684
-I'll be right back.
-Yeah.

31
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,768
Wait here. Okay.

32
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,445
This will hurt.

33
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,487
Stay calm.

34
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,531
Cut.

35
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,409
Mm.

36
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,456
-Help me.
-Mm.

37
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,770
Can you cut this?

38
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,480
Yes.

39
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,025
Mm.

40
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,945
Get me the dressing band.

41
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,698
Um… Band.

42
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,117
-Sorry. I'll go get it.
-Right.

43
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,256
I'm looking for the band.

44
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,015
Yes? Oh, professor.

45
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,267
Oh, I checked on him
this morning.

46
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,394
He didn't look well earlier today.

47
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,105
He was very septic.

48
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,356
He had a high fever,

49
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,442
and his CRP level
was between five and ten.

50
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,903
Yes. So we got a CT scan.

51
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,322
I took a look at it,
and that looked very bad too.

52
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,157
You said it could be endocytosis.

53
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,452
I thought it may be better
to just operate instead.

54
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,664
So I scheduled him
for a surgery this afternoon.

55
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,749
Captain.

56
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,793
Are you all right?

57
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,629
Hey.

58
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,965
I almost died.

59
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,677
-Well, do you want some water?
-No, I don't.

60
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,974
Detective Oh…

61
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,934
We caught her.

62
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,602
She did it. She stabbed you.

63
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,521
-She's in the hospital--
-Pildo.

64
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,607
Yeah?

65
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,115
You know…

66
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,869
Yoon Donghoon, right?

67
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,288
Yoon Donghoon of Dongcheon

68
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,582
who was killed five years ago?

69
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,708
Ah, yes.

70
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,460
She is…

71
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,464
…Yoon Donghoon's daughter.

72
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,190
Yoon Donghoon's real name was Song Joonsu.

73
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,485
I…

74
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,572
Wait, the late Narcotics detective?

75
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,535
He was undercover.

76
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,457
I sent him into Dongcheon.

77
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,632
I think our best option
is to get him in surgery today

78
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,301
which is why I schedule him
for this afternoon.

79
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,303
Yes.

80
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,848
You don't need to worry about it.

81
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,768
Yes, well, just in case…

82
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,561
But I am almost done here.

83
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,897
Once I finish, I'll check on him again.

84
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,816
Yes. Yes.

85
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,698
<i>Jung Taeju is the one who stabbed me.</i>

86
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,244
I brought him home last night.

87
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,163
He seemed nervous,
so I offered to stay, but he said no…

88
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,291
It wasn't your fault.

89
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,796
<i>So it was Do Gangjae.</i>

90
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,423
The one you wanted to catch.

91
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,554
You're doing this
because of your dad, right?

92
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,682
<i>Jiwoo…</i>

93
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,811
joined up with her dad's killer
to try and get revenge.

94
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,775
<i>Choi Mujin deceived her.</i>

95
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,822
<i>If I'm honest,</i>

96
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,367
will you believe me?

97
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,995
Pildo.

98
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,873
Thank you.

99
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,176
-Please finish up.
-Right.

100
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,391
-Are you finished?
-Yes. She'll be out shortly.

101
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,475
Yeah.

102
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,277
Take the side door and go down to B2.

103
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,321
My car is there for you.

104
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,673
This is good.

105
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,925
I wanted to punch you.

106
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,020
Argh!

107
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:57,948
Yeah?

108
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,575
<i>Pildo.</i>

109
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,369
<i>Hyejin got away.</i>

110
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,239
Song Jiwoo!

111
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,165
No. No!

112
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,124
Argh!

113
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,293
Song Jiwoo.

114
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,253
That's your name, right?

115
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,384
What do you plan to do?

116
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,179
Are you going to Choi Mujin?

117
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,725
The Captain told me.

118
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,852
Did you let him go

119
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,228
so you can kill him yourself?

120
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,024
Yeah, so move.

121
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,487
No.

122
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,863
I'll stop you.

123
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,536
No.

124
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,830
Enough already!

125
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,415
No!

126
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,710
You get it now.

127
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,545
You must know why I'm doing this!

128
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,340
I do.

129
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,801
That's why I'm stopping you.

130
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,054
No, you don't know

131
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,264
how I got to this point.

132
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,062
I threw away my future and my name
to catch that asshole!

133
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,149
But he tricked me and I killed someone.

134
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,653
If I don't kill him,
my life has no meaning.

135
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,371
Is this all your life is worth, huh?

136
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,124
Get out of my way.

137
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,718
How can I just let you go
and drive to your death?

138
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,639
Even if you kill him,
you'll be utterly destroyed!

139
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,224
Don't you get it?

140
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,934
I don't care about that.

141
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,061
Well, I do.

142
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,482
Go! Enough!

143
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,569
Let go!

144
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,008
Get in.

145
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,807
Get them! Go after them!

146
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,518
Stop!

147
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,826
Shit.

148
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,163
Hold on tight.

149
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,907
<i>We lost her.</i>

150
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,910
<i>An officer took her and they disappeared.</i>

151
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,352
We got here earlier than we expected.

152
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,107
You remember our beach plans, don't you?

153
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,863
My friend who loves to surf
rent out this place long-term.

154
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,732
Let me see your cut.

155
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,067
No, I'm fine.

156
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,241
Hearing that makes me angry.

157
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,497
Sit down.

158
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,157
I started carrying a knife
after my sister died.

159
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,913
I was determined to kill the bastard

160
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,749
if I found him.

161
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,473
Every night, I dreamt…

162
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,476
about killing the guy.

163
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,147
And eventually,

164
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,191
my face changed.

165
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,701
I look like a murderer consumed with rage.

166
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:32,916
I…

167
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,339
I was hurting myself.

168
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,848
Don't destroy yourself.

169
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,604
Don't move. Stay still.

170
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,852
Don't struggle alone anymore.

171
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,356
You can lean on me anytime.

172
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:28,198
<i>Every smile, every pain</i>

173
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:33,078
<i>Every memory coming back again</i>

174
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,205
<i>Pulling down</i>

175
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:41,586
<i>I'm sick of holding on</i>

176
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,007
<i>No more talking</i>

177
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,552
<i>Nothing to say</i>

178
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:53,348
<i>No use trying anyway</i>

179
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,058
<i>Pulling down</i>

180
00:23:55,142 --> 00:24:01,648
<i>I want these worries gone</i>

181
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,026
<i>What the hell</i>

182
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:12,117
<i>Is even going on?</i>

183
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:17,372
<i>Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh</i>

184
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,833
<i>A thought is haunting me</i>

185
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:23,128
<i>A thought is haunting me</i>

186
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:27,048
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

187
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,593
<i>A thought is haunting me</i>

188
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,845
<i>A thought is haunting</i>

189
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:37,684
<i>Me</i>

190
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,983
<i>The weight of the world</i>

191
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,611
<i>The burning of days</i>

192
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:52,574
<i>A heartbreaking sense
We're drifting slowly away</i>

193
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,161
<i>Losing sight of love now</i>

194
00:24:56,244 --> 00:25:01,541
<i>What went wrong?</i>

195
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,589
<i>Lay my head down and rest my mind</i>

196
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:12,302
<i>Give up searching 'cause I cannot find</i>

197
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,763
<i>The strength I need</i>

198
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:20,685
<i>To keep on holding on</i>

199
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:26,566
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

200
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,152
<i>A thought is haunting me</i>

201
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,239
<i>A thought is haunting me</i>

202
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:36,534
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

203
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,912
<i>A thought is haunting me</i>

204
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,624
<i>A thought is haunting me</i>

205
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,086
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

206
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,214
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh…</i>

207
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,057
Choi Mujin put a tattoo on my chest.

208
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,604
I burned it off.

209
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,286
You and I chose different directions.

210
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,046
Let's catch him…

211
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,674
together.

212
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,098
We'll fulfill your father's wish.

213
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,059
Judging with the law
rather than killing him.

214
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,735
Your father sacrificed his life for this.

215
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,239
And now you can do it.

216
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:31,691
BOW RESTAURANT

217
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,902
-Taeju!
-Hi.

218
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,945
-Are the boys here yet?
-No, not yet.

219
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,365
Hi. Welcome. Come in.

220
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,658
Hungry for pork belly.

221
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:42,869
Oh.

222
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,413
-Minjae, I'm sorry.
-Get out of here.

223
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,998
Hey, you.

224
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,418
Go, huh? Go on and study.

225
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,711
Huh?

226
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,046
I wanna join Dongcheon.

227
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,048
-Hey, stop.
-Take your bag.

228
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,841
Hey, what grade are you? Get out of here.

229
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,551
-Let him talk.
-What?

230
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,804
What do you mean? He's a kid.

231
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,180
Why do you wanna join?

232
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,891
Well…

233
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,644
I wanna be cool like you guys.

234
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,354
Seriously?

235
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,563
Are you smart?

236
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,607
Yes, I am.

237
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,943
Hey. Go and study then, okay?

238
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,111
I mean it, Boss.

239
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,779
-You kids watch way too many movies.
-Please accept me.

240
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,696
No, you don't get it.

241
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,281
-I can handle it.
-Hey, come on. Let's go.

242
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,855
<i>Boss. Donghoon is at his place.</i>

243
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,423
Papa!

244
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,341
Papa!

245
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,850
Papa!

246
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,896
Papa!

247
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,856
Jiwoo, don't come out!

248
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,608
Please, don't come out.

249
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,234
Open the door!

250
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,905
I…

251
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,491
never once…

252
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,788
betrayed someone who trusted in me.

253
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,834
So why does everyone keep betraying me?

254
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,801
Right…

255
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,346
She wants to kill me now.

256
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,184
That's why…

257
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,354
That's why…

258
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,440
she should've come here.

259
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,618
Right, Donghoon?

260
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,079
She should've come here.

261
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,668
She should've come to me.

262
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,630
There's a warrant out for you.

263
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,757
You must run away.

264
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,134
They say they have a witness.

265
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,719
It's must be Detective Oh.

266
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,971
You need to run.

267
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,812
You told me she would come to kill you.

268
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,856
Exactly.

269
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,692
She should've come here.

270
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,237
She should've…

271
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,531
come to me!

272
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,078
She betrayed me
and went back to the police.

273
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,710
Sir, please wait.

274
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,761
Ever since I saved her
from dying on the street,

275
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,388
her life belonged to me.

276
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,849
You need to stop this.

277
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:33,808
I won't!

278
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,979
I can't stop now.

279
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,691
It's not something I can just stop now.

280
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,615
It won't end until one of us is dead.

281
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,619
Either I die…

282
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,874
…or she dies.

283
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,378
So, leave.

284
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,632
Leave!

285
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,332
<i>Jiwoo.</i>

286
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,836
<i>You have to be happy</i>

287
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,382
<i>and live a good life
even if I'm not around, okay?</i>

288
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,743
Did you think I left?

289
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,829
I got scared.

290
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,665
"Don't be scared.

291
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,250
We're cops, aren't we?"

292
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,427
Let's go.

293
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,424
Where to now, ma'am?

294
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,885
Somewhere far away.

295
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,263
Dongcheon is finished.

296
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,181
Yes, ma'am.

297
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,089
It'll be hard.

298
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,718
The entire world will be against you.

299
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,846
After the trial, you'll be put away.

300
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,602
I know.

301
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,732
I'm ready.

302
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,033
Whatever you go through,

303
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,077
I'll be with you.

304
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,620
Hey!

305
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,080
Pildo!

306
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,417
-No!
-Jeon Pildo!

307
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,501
Pildo!

308
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,585
No!

309
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,505
What happened?

310
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,092
<i>You will catch Choi Mujin.</i>

311
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,504
Open it.

312
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,289
Where is that bitch?
We gotta find her.

313
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,707
There she is.

314
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,083
Whoa, whoa!

315
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,651
Argh!

316
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,372
Agh!

317
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,144
You look tired.

318
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,521
It's bearable.

319
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,067
I can still kill you.

320
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,702
Right. You should.

321
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,210
Your father was a weak man.

322
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,547
He had several chances to kill me,

323
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,050
but he lacked courage.

324
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,180
He was born to be prey.

325
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,024
His hesitation…

326
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,193
…made so that…

327
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,529
you…

328
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,535
me, and the policeman,
we've all been miserable.

329
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,626
But you are different.

330
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,130
You acted without fear.

331
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,552
So why?

332
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,223
Haven't you been waiting for this moment?

333
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,767
So why?

334
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,062
Why did you hesitate?

335
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,461
That's right, I did.

336
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,425
I wanted to live like a human.

337
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,935
You asked if I wanted revenge
no matter what.

338
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,481
I didn't know what you meant back then.

339
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,068
I do now.

340
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,200
To take revenge is to become a monster.

341
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,536
A monster is what you are.

342
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,300
That's right.

343
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,597
You're a lot like me.

344
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,142
Can you become…

345
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,396
a monster?

346
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,902
Because I hesitated,

347
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,865
another person precious to me died.

348
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,163
Someone who understood.

349
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,751
He was somebody said I could rely on.

350
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,928
I will become…

351
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,349
…a monster.

352
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,146
And I will take pleasure

353
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,316
into watching you breathe
your very last breath.

354
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,265
Argh!

355
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,811
Can you kill me in the state you're in?

356
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,609
Very good.

357
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:32,928
Get up.

358
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,430
That's right.

359
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,850
Argh!

360
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,525
Get up!

361
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:50,946
Stab me!

362
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,285
Again.

363
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,082
That's right.

364
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,460
Get up.

365
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,551
It won't end until one of us dies.

366
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,393
The temple.

367
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,605
Upper lip.

368
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,025
Chin.

369
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,360
Chest.

370
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,323
Do it.

371
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,535
Stab me.

372
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,247
Stab me!

373
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,210
Come on!

374
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,597
It's over for you.

375
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,269
Accept it.

376
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:51,149
You cannot… become a monster.

377
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:33,895
DECEASED, KIM JEONGA
