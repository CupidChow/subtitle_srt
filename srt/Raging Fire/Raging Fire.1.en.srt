1
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:56,487
THE FIRE IS ON FIRE

2
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,435
Good morning.

3
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,459
Morning.

4
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:28,583
What did the doctor say yesterday?

5
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:31,407
A little high blood pressure, no problem.

6
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:38,431
High blood pressure? It's not good to
be born prematurely later.

7
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:41,455
Or you don't work anymore.

8
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,479
Can not.

9
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:44,503
Why not?

10
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:47,427
After giving birth the new can work again.

11
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,451
Dear.

12
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:56,475
Be careful, yes.

13
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:59,499
You are careful.
- You are careful.

14
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:01,523
You.
- You.

15
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:12,447
EAST DISTRICT POLICE HQ

16
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:15,471
Inspector Yao.

17
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:18,495
Why just stand?
Let's get back to work.

18
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,419
You guys, tonight there is
a big action. Come on everyone cheer up.

19
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:30,443
What's this?
- That's for you.

20
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,467
That's my son's ex.

21
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:37,491
So messed up.
My wife ordered it for your wife.

22
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:39,515
Thank you.

23
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:42,439
But my baby is a boy, this is
a girl's dress. I don't think it fits.

24
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:44,463
What doesn't fit?
Then another daughter will be born.

25
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:46,487
Don't tell me to take it home again,
my wife will be angry.

26
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:49,411
Alright, I'll save it for now.

27
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:52,435
Thank you.
- Hey you just keep protesting.

28
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,459
Why?

29
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:57,483
Last week on the Crossing Bay
you caught Gao.

30
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:58,507
Yes.

31
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,531
Did you call the inspector over there?

32
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,555
Is such a superior order
still necessary?

33
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:07,479
Of course necessary. The case has
been handled but the boss is embarrassed.

34
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:11,403
You can handle cases,
but social relations are maintained.

35
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:13,427
Don't be rigid, just be flexible.

36
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:15,451
Teach me to be flexible.

37
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:17,475
I've bought a meal, it's done.

38
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:20,499
It's over then.
- No, return the meal.

39
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:23,423
Debt first, it's time to go.

40
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:26,447
Action this time, I will lead.

41
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:29,471
Everyone take a look at our menu tonight.

42
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,495
Wang Kun,
we've been following him for several years.

43
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,419
Killing, burning, extortion,
all done by him.

44
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:38,443
Intel's got the info
tonight at 9 o'clock.

45
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:43,467
Chang Mai's Vietnamese gang will make
big deals with Wang Kun.

46
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:45,491
No matter how vicious he is,
we have to catch him.

47
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:48,415
The last order tonight
at 8 o'clock is over.

48
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,439
Because the location of
the transaction is confidential,

49
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,463
tell everyone

50
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,487
tonight, all those bastards
we have to catch.

51
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:58,511
Yes, sir!
- Disband!

52
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:00,535
Yes, sir!

53
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,459
Why Bao?

54
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:08,483
Hey Bang, this needs your help. If you don't
come here tonight's action may be canceled.

55
00:06:08,507 --> 00:06:10,507
Good.
- Hurry up.

56
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:12,531
Hi, I can't do it myself.
- Fine, I'll be there.

57
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:20,455
This is bad.

58
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,479
Hi Bao.
- You're taking so long.

59
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:25,503
All the bosses are inside.
- Bao, why cancel the action?

60
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:32,427
You lied to me again.
- If you didn't say so you wouldn't
want to come here.

61
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,451
These bosses are looking for you,
it's important, let's help.

62
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:39,475
If you don't come in,
kill me, my career is over, understand?

63
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:44,499
We are comrades,
I am your friend, come on please.

64
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:46,523
Who is your best friend?

65
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,447
Sorry, busy people have finally arrived.

66
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:50,471
Wow ... Inspector Zhang.
- Inspector Zhou.

67
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:53,495
Your body is strong who can resist?

68
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,419
Please have a seat,
let me introduce you

69
00:06:56,443 --> 00:07:00,443
this is Inspector Dai in our area
he is the leader.

70
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,467
Inspector Li, you already know yourself.

71
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:06,491
This is Inspector He, Senior Superintendent of
the Internal Investigations and Complaints Division.

72
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:10,415
Master Chen Youli as well as his son.

73
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,439
Mr. Chen has been supporting
the police for a long time.

74
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:15,463
Today is specially invited you,
want to know yourself.

75
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:18,487
Don't you remember? In 2013, a theft case.

76
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:21,411
Handled by Inspector Zhang.

77
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:25,435
The big one in 2016 Saigon Harbor,
the shooting case.

78
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:29,459
Inspector Zhang alone, 2 bullets,
deal with international gangsters.

79
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:33,483
The thing is, all of them
used to be soldiers... Great...

80
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:38,407
Inspector Zhang has handled
many cases, let's toast him.

81
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:40,431
Cheers!

82
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:50,455
Ladies and gentlemen, today I am here
how can I help you?

83
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:57,479
Inspector Zhang, we know, you've worked
up until now to pursue one thing.

84
00:07:58,403 --> 00:08:00,403
Chance.

85
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:04,427
Hello Inspector Zhang,
I am Mr Chen's lawyer.

86
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:10,451
His son Mr. Chen was drunk the other day
and accidentally beat our police officer.

87
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:14,475
Actually this police officer has
forgiven his son Mr. Chen, so...

88
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:16,499
I got it.

89
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:20,423
But the report is already in,
so...

90
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:24,447
The report is on your desk,
just next week give it to me.

91
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,471
That is true.

92
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:32,495
You saw earlier, the man who was beaten
up in there was enjoying his meal.

93
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,419
Even if you report to the Criminal
Division, you may not be able to sue.

94
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:39,443
Bao, what are you kidding?
Are you new to me?

95
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:41,467
I want you to get promoted.
- You want to take me on stage?

96
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:44,491
To which stage?
Didn't he tell you to lick?

97
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:46,515
You are so hopeful.

98
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:55,439
Even if you insist that the result will be
the same, this boss needs a reputation.

99
00:08:55,463 --> 00:08:57,463
Please cooperate.

100
00:08:57,487 --> 00:09:00,487
Not a small child anymore, a
few months later he will be a father.

101
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:05,411
Come on please,
I love you.

102
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:16,435
Sorry.

103
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,459
Inspector Zhang, how's your stomach?
- No problem,

104
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:21,483
just drink too much.

105
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:25,407
Have you told clearly?
- It's very clear.

106
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:42,431
Good tea.

107
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:46,455
Manager, this tea is definitely not cheap.

108
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:49,479
This is indeed a premium tea.

109
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:51,503
Sekilonya 600 thousand.
- Wow, 600 thousand!

110
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:55,427
Wow, this is premium tea, you know.

111
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:03,451
I just drank 2 sips,
so 200 I think is enough.

112
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:05,475
Sorry, goodbye first.

113
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:09,499
Inspector Zhang, are you aware of
what you're doing?

114
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:11,523
Of course aware.
You are also aware of what you are doing.

115
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:13,547
Bang...

116
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:18,495
Don't tell me what I'm saying isn't clear.

117
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:24,419
In this case, if someone
is already involving someone else

118
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:29,443
God will not forgive.

119
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:48,491
Zhou, why are you so slow? Some
of the bulletproof uniforms are just old.

120
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:52,415
What is this?

121
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:54,439
There's no record of you.

122
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:57,463
What?

123
00:11:57,487 --> 00:11:59,487
Anymore question?

124
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,511
No!
- Street!

125
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:11,435
Sorry, I'm just following the rules.
There's no record of you here.

126
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,459
There is no superior order.

127
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:24,483
Halo?

128
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:26,507
Halo.

129
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:28,531
Tell me where are you?

130
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:30,555
I can't tell.

131
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:32,579
Hey, you wanna play me too?

132
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:34,603
Not me, but them.

133
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:38,427
I told you, no matter how hard or soft,
don't make your boss angry.

134
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:39,451
They are assholes,

135
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:41,475
The Police Complaints Division, the Independent
Corruption Eradication Commission have been monitoring them.

136
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:44,499
Yes, but it's not easy.

137
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:48,423
Yao, you know I've been waiting
for this for 4 years.

138
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:50,447
I have to catch Wang Kun's jerk.

139
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:53,471
I know it's been 4 years,
I haven't forgotten either.

140
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:57,495
You don't get involved,
they want to find fault with you.

141
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,519
I don't want you to lose
this job, buddy.

142
00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:01,543
Believe me, Wang Kun is easy to catch.

143
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,467
Let me catch

144
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:06,491
you do the interrogation, how?

145
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:08,515
Don't talk too much, tell me your position!

146
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,539
Yes, just like that.

147
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:15,463
The Information Division is there you know.
- I'm driving.

148
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:17,464
Call him!

149
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:27,488
Call the center,
there are 20 Wang Kun here.

150
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:30,412
It is suspected that the target on
the 3rd floor made a transaction.

151
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:36,436
Attention everyone,

152
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,460
the target is in the ski area.

153
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,484
Team 1, surround the ski area.

154
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:43,408
The relief team, standing guard outside.

155
00:13:58,432 --> 00:14:00,432
Tsuen Wan Ocean View Plaza.

156
00:14:02,456 --> 00:14:05,456
Inspector Yao, the Vietnamese have arrived.
What's in action now?

157
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Relax, wait until you see the
money and goods, then act.

158
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:13,404
All attention,
the Vietnamese have come.

159
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:15,428
Summarize them all.

160
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:55,452
What happen?
The screen is interrupted!

161
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:57,476
Inspector Yao?

162
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,400
Inspector Yao, there is a disturbance.
- The screen is interrupted.

163
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:12,424
Hey, Vietnamese apparently.

164
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:18,448
Why are all of these wearing masks,
what else is there a party?

165
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:21,472
Pretentious cool or what?

166
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:24,496
So handsome.

167
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Alright, straight to the point.

168
00:15:36,444 --> 00:15:38,444
Come on.

169
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:41,468
Where is the money?

170
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:55,492
Damn it!
Is there a police outside?

171
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,416
Sis, it's true that there are police.

172
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Damn, want to die huh?
Who are you guys?

173
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:20,464
There's been a shootout in the arena,
please help!

174
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:22,488
Inspector Yao, can you hear?

175
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:33,412
All units, can you hear?

176
00:16:33,436 --> 00:16:35,436
Can you hear me?

177
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,460
What do you want?

178
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:57,484
Dude, hold on!

179
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:33,408
Fuck you!

180
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:58,432
Hello, Inspector Yao.

181
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:32,456
You bastards,
not humans or ghosts...

182
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,480
Are you humans or not?

183
00:19:35,504 --> 00:19:39,404
No face huh?
Come on, take off your mask.

184
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:44,428
Why? Want to fight?
Come on...

185
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:53,452
Long time no see.

186
00:20:21,476 --> 00:20:23,476
Inspector Yao!

187
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Tsuen Wan Ocean View Plaza.

188
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:30,424
More than 20 people are injured,
please send an ambulance!

189
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:50,463
Aren't you mistaken?

190
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:53,487
I told him to just take the stuff,
not kill it!

191
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:55,511
Still killing a lot of cops!

192
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:57,535
Don't be angry,
you'll get sick.

193
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:00,459
Here's the item,
where's the money?

194
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:10,483
I've been under police surveillance, you
slowly spread this stuff.

195
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:13,407
You want to teach me?

196
00:22:14,431 --> 00:22:16,431
To,

197
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:18,455
are you right?

198
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,479
We're out of prison
already tortured enough.

199
00:22:20,503 --> 00:22:23,403
Make money slowly.

200
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,427
Don't act crazy like that.

201
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:29,451
It's too late,
you don't need to ask.

202
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:31,475
Hey!

203
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:40,499
Baozhu, the car was set on fire.

204
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:45,423
Ahua, I don't want to
be followed by the police.

205
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:51,447
Quan, guns, bullets, bulletproof
vests, you keep them.

206
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:54,471
No one needs to know where we are.

207
00:22:56,495 --> 00:23:01,495
Gongzi, the walkie-talkie was interrupted,

208
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,419
What are you doing?

209
00:23:08,443 --> 00:23:10,443
Sorry, sis Ao.

210
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:17,467
the rest of the money,

211
00:23:17,491 --> 00:23:19,491
if this is ok i
will share it.

212
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:23,415
Later, live normally.

213
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:26,439
Accompany the children,
or just work normally.

214
00:23:26,463 --> 00:23:29,463
If you don't have to, don't let anyone out.

215
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:38,487
Let's toast to Sis Biao.
- For Sis Biao!

216
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,410
Police! There's a search!

217
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:43,434
Turn on the lights, turn off the music!

218
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,458
KTP.

219
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:48,482
Where's your ID card, don't say you didn't bring it!
- Why are you so grumpy?

220
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:52,406
Do you want to die?
- What happen?

221
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,430
Do you know about Wang Kun?
- No!

222
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:57,454
Inspector Zhang, here.
- Do you know?

223
00:24:57,478 --> 00:24:59,478
No!

224
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:03,402
I assume you don't know.
I'll give you one more chance.

225
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:06,426
Do you want this place closed,
or do you want to be a spy?

226
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,450
Disband.

227
00:25:24,474 --> 00:25:26,474
Possible!

228
00:25:26,498 --> 00:25:28,498
Mundur ...

229
00:26:13,422 --> 00:26:15,422
Are you not wrong?

230
00:26:16,446 --> 00:26:18,446
Let's aim!

231
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,470
Spirit!

232
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:25,494
Come on!

233
00:26:35,418 --> 00:26:37,418
Smash him!

234
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:39,442
Smash!

235
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:41,466
The ball is out!

236
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,490
Yes, Inspector.

237
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:57,414
Accepted.

238
00:26:58,438 --> 00:27:03,438
This morning at 03:30, businessman Kaya Huo
Zhaotang was kidnapped in his own villa.

239
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:05,462
Wow, this big problem.
- Worse yet

240
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:07,486
was with his secretary.

241
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,410
The kidnappers demanded
a ransom of 1 billion.

242
00:27:10,434 --> 00:27:12,434
Threatening Mrs. Huo
not to report to the police.

243
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:16,458
Mrs. Huo immediately
contacted the head of security.

244
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:20,482
Was the secretary
asking for 1 billion?

245
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:21,506
May be.

246
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:26,430
Earlier, the Police Chief had explained
that this mission was a secret.

247
00:27:26,454 --> 00:27:29,454
Prioritize his safety Mr. Huo.

248
00:27:30,478 --> 00:27:35,478
These 2 thugs, willing to do anything.
Their names are Cola and Wang Kun.

249
00:27:35,502 --> 00:27:37,502
Take a look.

250
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:41,426
Look, the higher-ups are very concerned
about this case of Mr. Huo's kidnapping.

251
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,450
Please remember,
must immediately rescue Mr. hoo.

252
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:46,474
Yeah, pak.
- Yeah, pak.

253
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,498
Fine Inspector.

254
00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:51,422
Oh, Bang.

255
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:56,446
Anyway,
save Mr. Huo.

256
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,470
Yes, Sir.
- Fine Inspector.

257
00:28:00,494 --> 00:28:02,494
Until found.

258
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:08,418
Did he tell Shark to buy his shares
to make the stock go down?

259
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,491
Hey, congrats.
- Why?

260
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:26,415
Next month rise again
as you wish,

261
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,439
but don't be arrogant.

262
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:31,463
Are you jealous?
- Yes, a little.

263
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:33,487
Congratulations!

264
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,411
Still the same.
- It is not like that.

265
00:28:36,435 --> 00:28:38,435
Now catch 10 criminals,

266
00:28:38,459 --> 00:28:42,459
After getting promoted, you can catch 100
or 1000, then the world will be at peace.

267
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:48,483
Hey, you just get married.
Then don't forget to invite us.

268
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:50,507
Many come, will not lose.

269
00:28:50,531 --> 00:28:52,431
I didn't give the red packets.

270
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:55,455
Inspector, Cola is seen
taking his car.

271
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:04,479
Bride, are you coming?

272
00:29:04,503 --> 00:29:06,503
Leave this one to me,
Wang Kun you take care of.

273
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:08,527
The world will be at peace.

274
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:11,451
The smarter ones!
- Ready!

275
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,475
Wang Kun was already in sight.
He will go.

276
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:51,499
I'm always the one waiting.
Next time you just wait.

277
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:55,423
How much play?
Play mahjong?

278
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:59,447
in action!

279
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:12,471
Dimana Huo Zhaotang?

280
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:14,495
Come on say!

281
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:18,419
Where's the hostage?
Say!

282
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:22,443
What are you saying?
What hostage?

283
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,467
That's right!

284
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:26,491
Stand you up!

285
00:30:26,515 --> 00:30:29,415
Who really beat you?

286
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,439
Inspector.

287
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:36,463
How?
- He won't tell.

288
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:38,487
Give me time.

289
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:40,511
There's no time, tomorrow
before the stock comes out,

290
00:30:40,535 --> 00:30:43,435
must hurry to save Mr. Huo.

291
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:49,459
None of this will be published,
will not be recorded.

292
00:30:49,483 --> 00:30:51,483
No one knows.

293
00:30:51,507 --> 00:30:54,407
If anything happens,
I'll protect you, understand?

294
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:57,431
If this fails, the boss will be angry.

295
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:01,455
No one can take responsibility.

296
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:03,479
Ready.

297
00:31:15,403 --> 00:31:18,403
What happen? Have you guys gone crazy?

298
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:20,427
Where's the hostage?

299
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,451
Come on say!

300
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:44,475
Just you wait, I'll sue.

301
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:46,499
I don't know anything.

302
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:53,423
Why are you here?
- Come here!

303
00:31:56,447 --> 00:32:00,447
I count to 3,
is your mouth really that loud?

304
00:32:00,471 --> 00:32:03,471
If you still don't want to talk,
you're swallowing your own teeth!

305
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:05,495
1...

306
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,419
2...

307
00:32:12,443 --> 00:32:15,443
I will say...

308
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:20,467
Street Yunli No. 143.

309
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:22,491
Telpon Sis Biao.

310
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:28,415
Street Yunli No. 143, hurry!

311
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:39,439
Here.

312
00:32:39,463 --> 00:32:41,463
Mr. Huo, calm down.
We're the police.

313
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:53,487
Do you like getting beat up?
Your mother taught that?

314
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:58,411
Your lowly family gene
can indeed be inherited?

315
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,435
Is that so?

316
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:04,459
This bastard bit me!

317
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,483
Why?
- He bit me!

318
00:33:07,407 --> 00:33:10,407
Why is this? Let go!

319
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:49,431
Search!

320
00:33:50,455 --> 00:33:53,355
Hurry, get your ID card!

321
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:55,479
Don't run!

322
00:33:56,403 --> 00:33:58,403
Stop!

323
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:00,427
Don't run!

324
00:34:01,451 --> 00:34:03,451
Get out!

325
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,475
Open!

326
00:34:08,499 --> 00:34:10,499
This is Wang Kun's stuff.

327
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,423
Bang.

328
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:23,447
Sis Sha.
- You're great too.

329
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:27,471
Dare to also bring Wang Kun's belongings.
Who told you?

330
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:29,495
Don't know.

331
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:33,419
Yes you know, you know ...
Meng Gui!

332
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:36,443
Meng Gui...

333
00:34:39,467 --> 00:34:41,467
Of course, Wang Kun
and Ou Wangui's stuff

334
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:46,491
with the goods that
Meng Gui took was the same.

335
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:49,415
Several years ago,
for murder, he was imprisoned.

336
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:52,439
Half a year ago he was free and
hiding in Chaguoling,

337
00:34:52,463 --> 00:34:54,463
Gather help.

338
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:58,487
Received many asylums, became wives,
and raised many assassins.

339
00:34:58,511 --> 00:35:00,511
In short, he is crazy.

340
00:35:00,535 --> 00:35:03,435
Chaguoling, over there it's dangerous.

341
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:05,459
I've heard

342
00:35:05,483 --> 00:35:08,483
a policeman came in and
was immediately hacked.

343
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:11,407
Then looking for a mute man
to bear the blame.

344
00:35:11,431 --> 00:35:13,431
Anti-thugs are also helpless.

345
00:35:13,455 --> 00:35:17,455
What can be done, the boss said
today there is no warrant.

346
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:21,479
No?
Still have to go.

347
00:35:21,503 --> 00:35:25,403
It is dangerous to go there
without a search warrant and assistance.

348
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:29,427
Then how?
Time to go home and sleep?

349
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:32,451
We are cops,
obviously know there are criminals there.

350
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:34,475
Why wasn't he arrested? Seriously!

351
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,499
What are you guys afraid of?

352
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:39,423
No, just following the rules.

353
00:35:39,447 --> 00:35:43,447
Rule?
Just tell me you're scared!

354
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:44,471
Hey...

355
00:35:44,495 --> 00:35:47,495
You are great, good-natured,

356
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:49,519
sometimes it just sleeps,
which side are you on?

357
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:51,543
I really like sleeping,
but this time a lot of comrades died.

358
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,567
Even though I'm sleepy, I can't sleep!

359
00:35:53,591 --> 00:35:55,591
Already...

360
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:58,415
Dissolved.

361
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:06,439
We've worked 20 hours.

362
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:08,463
That's enough.

363
00:36:08,487 --> 00:36:11,487
Everyone is tired, let's go home.
No more fighting.

364
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:13,511
Right, let him go.
- Yes, come on.

365
00:36:15,435 --> 00:36:18,435
Listen to chairman Bang, let's disperse.

366
00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:45,459
Everyone here.

367
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:53,483
There is a change,
Gui stuff is scattered.

368
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:55,507
Already accepted Zhang Chongbang.

369
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:58,431
The police are looking for
us , we are easily caught.

370
00:36:58,455 --> 00:37:00,455
What now?

371
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:28,479
Stop it!

372
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:30,503
Fuck you!

373
00:37:32,427 --> 00:37:34,427
Don't make trouble!

374
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:38,451
You guys don't mess around here!

375
00:37:39,475 --> 00:37:41,475
Don't bother me!

376
00:37:53,499 --> 00:37:55,499
Who's that?

377
00:37:56,423 --> 00:37:59,423
Who's that? Come on down!

378
00:38:07,447 --> 00:38:11,447
What? Any cops on the roof?
Seriously!

379
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:20,471
What's wrong, who are you?

380
00:38:22,495 --> 00:38:24,495
What are you doing?

381
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:32,419
Here!

382
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,443
Don't run!

383
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:38,467
Move aside, don't come any closer!

384
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:46,491
Get out of the way!

385
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:51,415
Inspector, I don't know anything.
- Go out!

386
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:55,439
Don't be photographed!

387
00:38:56,463 --> 00:39:00,463
Congratulations, Meng Gui, I've caught you.

388
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:05,487
Sis Gui, this cop told me to
bring him here.

389
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:07,511
Sit down!

390
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:09,535
Diam!

391
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:23,459
Outside, please don't be noisy.

392
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:25,483
Outrageous.

393
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,407
How's the inspector?

394
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:34,431
The case in Tsuen Wan,
there were 8 of my members who died.

395
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:38,455
There are dozens more seriously injured
now being treated in the ICU.

396
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:41,479
For the sake of this stuff,

397
00:39:41,503 --> 00:39:45,403
Wang Kun's stuff is now with you.

398
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,427
How do you explain it?

399
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:56,451
If this is a charge, how?

400
00:39:56,475 --> 00:39:58,475
Don't play with fire, Ou Wangui.

401
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:05,499
You make money, if you hand over that
person, your punishment will be lighter.

402
00:40:17,423 --> 00:40:20,423
Here take it.

403
00:40:21,447 --> 00:40:23,447
Don't want?

404
00:40:24,471 --> 00:40:28,471
Or no mourning money
for your brother?

405
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:32,495
Speak nicely.

406
00:40:34,419 --> 00:40:36,419
Come to the police station!

407
00:40:36,443 --> 00:40:38,443
Do you want to die?

408
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:42,467
Everything is quiet.
- Why, want to die?

409
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:44,491
Damaged goods must be compensated.

410
00:41:09,415 --> 00:41:12,415
Boss, just leave it, boss.
- Fuck you!

411
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:28,439
Don't move, give up!

412
00:41:28,463 --> 00:41:30,463
Damn it!

413
00:41:40,487 --> 00:41:44,487
Don't move!
All lay down your arms!

414
00:42:02,411 --> 00:42:04,411
Get out!

415
00:43:26,435 --> 00:43:28,435
Come with me to the police station.

416
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:30,459
No way!

417
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:34,483
Follow me!
- You die!

418
00:43:54,407 --> 00:43:57,407
Hand over the guy.
- Don't hope!

419
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:13,431
Hand over the man!

420
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:32,479
After the police have
planned long and well

421
00:45:32,503 --> 00:45:34,503
finally managed to
raid a drug factory.

422
00:45:34,527 --> 00:45:38,427
Succeeded in confiscating high quality
pure methamphetamine worth 48 million.

423
00:45:38,451 --> 00:45:44,451
After the examination, the results are
the same as the drugs obtained last week.

424
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,475
The criminals were detained by
the police at the time of the raid .

425
00:45:47,499 --> 00:45:50,499
We the police this time
managed to solve this case.

426
00:45:50,523 --> 00:45:56,423
These people like to do a lot of merit,
even though our lives are at stake.

427
00:45:58,447 --> 00:46:01,447
It's always been like that,
what else should I do?

428
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:05,471
Change profession?

429
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:13,495
Why? Just look at me,
just kidding.

430
00:46:20,419 --> 00:46:22,419
Let's go home and sleep.

431
00:46:24,443 --> 00:46:27,443
Wanna go home, don't you?
- Yes.

432
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:34,467
Sooner or later I will catch them.

433
00:47:34,491 --> 00:47:36,491
Damn it!

434
00:47:58,415 --> 00:48:00,415
Here.

435
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:08,439
Look at you.

436
00:48:08,463 --> 00:48:10,463
Sorry.

437
00:48:14,487 --> 00:48:16,487
Sorry.

438
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:48,411
Are we wrong to give it another chance?

439
00:48:48,435 --> 00:48:53,435
Uphold the task,
we save others.

440
00:48:53,459 --> 00:48:58,459
Why didn't anyone save us?
Why?

441
00:48:58,483 --> 00:49:02,483
My wife and children are still
waiting for me to come home.

442
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:56,407
Go!

443
00:50:07,431 --> 00:50:11,431
You've been told to leave,
don't you know?

444
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:13,455
Calm down!

445
00:50:13,479 --> 00:50:15,479
Enough!

446
00:50:24,403 --> 00:50:26,403
Don't blame them.

447
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:29,427
It's fine.

448
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:35,451
So relaxing,
no need to catch criminals.

449
00:50:35,475 --> 00:50:38,475
Every year I always visit him.

450
00:50:38,499 --> 00:50:40,499
Anyway, I'm still here.

451
00:50:40,523 --> 00:50:43,423
Heard you want to be a father,
congratulations.

452
00:50:44,447 --> 00:50:46,447
Yes.

453
00:50:47,471 --> 00:50:49,471
In his dream, he longed to have children.

454
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,495
You? Have you met Qing?

455
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:55,519
No.

456
00:50:55,543 --> 00:50:58,443
I have never met him since I was free.

457
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:04,467
Imprisoned for several years, there was
no way my fiancé could wait for me.

458
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:11,491
Actually, the past few years
I've been visiting you,

459
00:51:11,515 --> 00:51:14,415
You refuse,
but I understand.

460
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:18,439
In prison, what do you want to see?

461
00:51:19,463 --> 00:51:23,463
Now that you're free,
what's the plan?

462
00:51:26,487 --> 00:51:29,487
You know,
Wang Kun is dead.

463
00:51:31,411 --> 00:51:33,411
Already heard that.

464
00:51:34,435 --> 00:51:36,435
We have been planning for several years.

465
00:51:37,459 --> 00:51:42,459
When he traded,
last week wanted to finish them off.

466
00:51:42,483 --> 00:51:47,483
Unexpectedly, a group of people appear
who know the police plan.

467
00:51:47,507 --> 00:51:51,407
Grab the item, and there are
still many killers roaming around.

468
00:51:51,431 --> 00:51:54,431
Among them there were 8 of us killed,
including Yao.

469
00:51:55,455 --> 00:51:57,455
Be less careful.

470
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:01,479
Yao has been a police officer for 30 years.

471
00:52:02,403 --> 00:52:04,403
He's a good cop.

472
00:52:04,427 --> 00:52:06,427
Good person.

473
00:52:07,451 --> 00:52:10,451
You know, he's the one who asked me to
become a cop.

474
00:52:11,475 --> 00:52:13,475
Know.

475
00:52:13,499 --> 00:52:16,499
Without him, you wouldn't be a cop.
Without you, I wouldn't be a cop.

476
00:52:16,523 --> 00:52:19,423
I will not let them go.

477
00:52:20,447 --> 00:52:22,447
I will definitely catch it.

478
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:24,471
Hope you succeed.

479
00:52:43,495 --> 00:52:46,495
Ao, Wang Kun was arrested.

480
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:48,519
He's looking for a lawyer, I'm helpless.

481
00:52:48,543 --> 00:52:51,443
How are you there, where?
- In Qingyi.

482
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,467
Hey!

483
00:53:00,491 --> 00:53:02,491
Stop it!

484
00:53:02,515 --> 00:53:06,415
What are you guys crazy about?
You guys are cops!

485
00:53:18,439 --> 00:53:20,439
He's dead.

486
00:54:04,463 --> 00:54:06,463
What are you doing?

487
00:54:06,487 --> 00:54:09,487
His superiors told him to save Mr. hao,
we saved.

488
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:12,411
Are we wrong?

489
00:54:12,435 --> 00:54:14,435
Otherwise, Mr. Hao it must be dead.

490
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,459
Which one do you choose?

491
00:54:20,483 --> 00:54:23,483
I'm tired.
I go first.

492
00:54:24,407 --> 00:54:26,407
Chief Bang.

493
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:28,431
Chief Bang!

494
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:49,455
Ladies and gentlemen, this case is
sensitive, today the court is closed.

495
00:54:49,479 --> 00:54:51,479
Tn. Huo Shaotang.

496
00:54:51,503 --> 00:54:54,403
As per your memory,
apart from He Weile dead

497
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:57,427
perpetrator Wang Kun, did he
take part in the kidnapping?

498
00:54:58,451 --> 00:55:00,451
Really, I don't know.

499
00:55:02,475 --> 00:55:05,475
Beating to death,
shouldn't be necessary.

500
00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:08,499
If we don't save you,
who will save you?

501
00:55:08,523 --> 00:55:10,523
We have helped,
how dare you say that?

502
00:55:10,547 --> 00:55:15,447
Please calm down, suspect
please control your emotions.

503
00:55:17,471 --> 00:55:21,471
Mr. Shitu Jie,
according to my client,

504
00:55:21,495 --> 00:55:26,495
You ordered them to do anything
to solve this case.

505
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:28,519
Do you admit it or not?

506
00:55:31,443 --> 00:55:36,443
That's right, before I kept asking for
this case to be resolved immediately.

507
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:40,467
I'm not telling them to take justice
into their own hands, let alone kill.

508
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:47,491
As a superior, asking to
immediately solve the case is natural.

509
00:55:47,515 --> 00:55:53,415
But how subordinates solve
cases, there are guidelines in the police.

510
00:55:53,439 --> 00:55:56,439
The police when carrying out their duties
use any means.

511
00:55:56,463 --> 00:55:59,463
So when the 6th suspect was
beaten to death

512
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:04,487
with my request to immediately resolve the
case, the two things have nothing to do.

513
00:56:05,411 --> 00:56:08,411
What did you say?
You said you wanted to protect us.

514
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:11,435
Now you don't admit it.

515
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:13,459
Please calm down.
- You bastard!

516
00:56:13,483 --> 00:56:15,483
You bastard!

517
00:56:19,407 --> 00:56:26,407
I swear, all my testimony
here is true.

518
00:56:37,431 --> 00:56:39,431
Senior Inspector Zhang ChongBang.

519
00:56:39,455 --> 00:56:42,455
According to the
testimony of the 6 suspects

520
00:56:42,479 --> 00:56:44,479
you on that day saw
all the events.

521
00:56:44,503 --> 00:56:46,403
I ask,

522
00:56:46,427 --> 00:56:52,427
Did you see for yourself, the victim refused to be
caught, and accidentally died?

523
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:57,451
Pertama kutegaskan,

524
00:56:57,475 --> 00:57:00,475
that night we received
orders from superiors.

525
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:04,499
To arrest the two suspects
He Weile and Weng Kun.

526
00:57:04,523 --> 00:57:10,423
Mr. Judge, the witness rejected
my question, whether he saw it or not.

527
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:13,447
Witness, please answer
according to the question.

528
00:57:19,471 --> 00:57:22,471
I wasn't there yet.

529
00:57:22,495 --> 00:57:25,495
So don't see for yourself, it is clear.

530
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:30,419
Did you see the six suspects
beat up He Weile yourself ?

531
00:57:53,443 --> 00:57:57,443
He Weile was
a very dangerous suspect .

532
00:57:57,467 --> 00:58:03,467
I believe we the police must
use measured violence to deal with him.

533
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:05,491
Measured hardness.

534
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,515
What does that mean?

535
00:58:07,539 --> 00:58:10,439
I don't want to guess what
measured violence is.

536
00:58:10,463 --> 00:58:15,463
You just answer, did you see the suspect
beat up He Weile?

537
00:58:16,487 --> 00:58:20,487
But Inspector Zhang,
let me remind you here,

538
00:58:20,511 --> 00:58:24,411
You testify under
an oath.

539
00:58:27,435 --> 00:58:29,435
Is there a beating or not?

540
00:58:34,459 --> 00:58:36,459
Is there or not?

541
00:58:36,483 --> 00:58:40,483
Witness, please answer.

542
00:58:48,407 --> 00:58:50,407
There is.

543
00:58:50,431 --> 00:58:52,431
Thank you.

544
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:34,479
Let's drink.

545
00:59:35,403 --> 00:59:38,403
George next door, let's go over there.

546
00:59:38,427 --> 00:59:41,427
All right, pay.

547
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:43,451
Just me.

548
00:59:43,475 --> 00:59:46,475
Thank you.
- No problem.

549
00:59:47,499 --> 00:59:50,499
Wow, this branded watch.
- Just normal.

550
00:59:50,523 --> 00:59:53,423
Definitely a million more.

551
00:59:53,447 --> 00:59:55,447
Really?

552
00:59:55,471 --> 00:59:57,471
Just take it back,
thanks.

553
00:59:57,495 --> 00:59:59,495
Come on, thank you my dear,
he's the treat.

554
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:01,519
Thank you.

555
01:00:01,543 --> 01:00:03,543
Really rich.

556
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:11,467
Is this really for me?

557
01:00:12,491 --> 01:00:15,491
Yes, as long as you're happy.

558
01:00:16,415 --> 01:00:20,415
Thank you, you're good.

559
01:00:23,439 --> 01:00:26,439
Honey, are you still eating?

560
01:00:27,463 --> 01:00:30,463
All right, I don't mind.

561
01:00:32,487 --> 01:00:35,487
You sit down, I'll take a shower first.

562
01:00:52,411 --> 01:00:55,411
Hey, why are you looking at my phone?

563
01:00:57,435 --> 01:00:59,435
Who's he?

564
01:00:59,459 --> 01:01:01,459
Friend.

565
01:01:02,483 --> 01:01:05,483
Return.
- No, you're mine!

566
01:01:05,507 --> 01:01:08,407
You make me sick!
- Bang Ni, don't go!

567
01:01:10,431 --> 01:01:12,431
Forgive me.

568
01:01:12,455 --> 01:01:17,455
Haven't you seen yourself?

569
01:01:17,479 --> 01:01:20,479
This is terrible, boss.

570
01:01:20,503 --> 01:01:24,403
Also, you're impotent,
you bastard prisoner!

571
01:01:25,427 --> 01:01:28,427
I don't like being called a prisoner!

572
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:30,451
If I wasn't in prison
my face wouldn't be like this!

573
01:01:30,475 --> 01:01:33,475
You cheap woman!

574
01:01:36,499 --> 01:01:41,499
Chairman Bang, an hour ago, the marine police
at Chai Wan Deraga found the body of a woman.

575
01:01:41,523 --> 01:01:44,423
The victim's name was Guan Meirou.
The watch was found on him.

576
01:01:44,447 --> 01:01:46,447
After checking, the watch code

577
01:01:46,471 --> 01:01:49,471
proved this is what Wang Kun wore.

578
01:01:49,495 --> 01:01:52,495
The victim was last seen in Wan Chai.

579
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:55,419
Together with a man named Zhao Zhiqiang,
they booked a hotel there.

580
01:01:55,443 --> 01:01:57,443
CCTV records them both entering the room.

581
01:01:57,467 --> 01:02:01,467
The man Zhao Gongzi as he came out
his hand dragging the suitcase.

582
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:06,491
What do you think?

583
01:02:12,415 --> 01:02:15,415
Is Ao involved?

584
01:02:16,439 --> 01:02:18,439
Better not him.

585
01:02:18,463 --> 01:02:20,463
Check the number Gongzi,
let's work!

586
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,487
All right, Inspector.

587
01:02:41,435 --> 01:02:43,435
CLUB FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP

588
01:02:54,459 --> 01:02:56,459
Hey, sit down.

589
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:10,483
This time it's quite big.

590
01:03:11,407 --> 01:03:13,407
This little crab of yours is quite vicious.

591
01:03:13,431 --> 01:03:17,431
Don't play with me.
- This opportunity is only once.

592
01:03:17,455 --> 01:03:19,455
Don't banks always change the system?

593
01:03:19,479 --> 01:03:21,479
You're not the only one who's interested.

594
01:03:21,503 --> 01:03:23,503
Don't waste our time!

595
01:03:24,427 --> 01:03:27,427
My hobby is playing big.

596
01:03:29,451 --> 01:03:32,451
Your bait is hard isn't it?
- If you want, I'll give you the bait.

597
01:03:37,475 --> 01:03:39,475
Chairman Bang, the target stops
at the Meihui building.

598
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:54,499
Don't park here.

599
01:03:54,523 --> 01:03:56,523
Street.

600
01:04:01,447 --> 01:04:03,447
The target is moving towards 3 o'clock.

601
01:04:03,471 --> 01:04:06,471
Zhougong, you guys follow Gongzi.
- Well.

602
01:04:15,495 --> 01:04:17,495
Big shark, I got off
at the Meihui building.

603
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:19,519
You guys keep on tailing.
- Ready.

604
01:04:26,443 --> 01:04:28,443
Police.

605
01:04:33,467 --> 01:04:35,467
Sis Ao, we are being
followed by the police.

606
01:04:35,491 --> 01:04:38,491
Remove all sim-cards.

607
01:04:38,515 --> 01:04:40,515
Where are you?
- On the road to Chai Wan.

608
01:04:47,439 --> 01:04:49,439
What is it?

609
01:04:51,463 --> 01:04:53,463
How come the police are following us?

610
01:04:53,487 --> 01:04:55,487
What else are you doing?

611
01:04:59,411 --> 01:05:01,411
Sorry.

612
01:05:01,435 --> 01:05:03,435
Damn, can you be smarter or not?

613
01:05:05,459 --> 01:05:07,459
Kubuntuti Ahua,
you follow Gongzi.

614
01:05:07,483 --> 01:05:09,483
Ready.

615
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:50,407
Don't move!

616
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:53,431
What is this,
what jogging can't be?

617
01:05:53,455 --> 01:05:55,455
Now you hit me.

618
01:05:55,479 --> 01:05:56,479
Bring him!

619
01:05:56,503 --> 01:05:58,503
Come up.
- Well.

620
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:21,427
Police, are you insured?

621
01:08:37,451 --> 01:08:40,451
Attention all teams,
don't let Gongzi ride the toll.

622
01:08:40,475 --> 01:08:42,475
At the next intersection, surround him.
- Well.

623
01:09:10,499 --> 01:09:13,499
Police, get back in the car!
- Close the door!

624
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:23,423
Close the door, duck down.
- Don't move, stay inside!

625
01:09:31,447 --> 01:09:32,447
Gongzi disini!

626
01:09:32,471 --> 01:09:34,471
Don't move,
raise your hand!

627
01:10:29,495 --> 01:10:31,495
Damn it!

628
01:11:31,419 --> 01:11:34,419
jogging?
You're jumping out of a car!

629
01:11:34,443 --> 01:11:38,443
Jump yes it's up to me.
Is it against the law?

630
01:11:38,467 --> 01:11:40,467
And...

631
01:11:40,491 --> 01:11:43,491
You, as cops, drive recklessly, you
still hit me.

632
01:11:43,515 --> 01:11:46,415
I will sue you!
- Don't act!

633
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:49,439
Gongzi is your brother,
you must be involved.

634
01:11:49,463 --> 01:11:51,463
Just admit it!

635
01:11:51,487 --> 01:11:55,487
Isn't this bullshit boring?

636
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:58,411
What is the job of the police now?

637
01:11:58,435 --> 01:12:01,435
Catch people doing hobbies.

638
01:12:01,459 --> 01:12:05,459
What proof do you want?

639
01:12:11,483 --> 01:12:13,483
How are you, Hua?

640
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:26,407
How's the family, Hua?

641
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:31,431
Your daughter must be 6 years old.

642
01:12:31,455 --> 01:12:33,455
Should have been in elementary school.

643
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:38,479
Accompany your daughter
don't think about anything else.

644
01:12:39,403 --> 01:12:45,403
Hey, when he grows up,
he won't care about you.

645
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,427
Then he has a world of his own.

646
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:49,451
Think of him.

647
01:12:55,475 --> 01:12:57,475
Okay.

648
01:12:57,499 --> 01:12:59,499
You understand?

649
01:13:13,423 --> 01:13:15,423
Don't hit again ...

650
01:13:24,447 --> 01:13:26,447
Sorry.

651
01:13:27,471 --> 01:13:32,471
I was greedy and
stole Wang Kun's watch.

652
01:13:32,495 --> 01:13:35,495
Definitely can help Hua.

653
01:13:35,519 --> 01:13:38,419
Hua can keep a secret.
He will not betray.

654
01:13:38,443 --> 01:13:40,443
There is still time.

655
01:13:44,467 --> 01:13:48,467
Gongzi has been caught, it's
just that the police lack evidence,

656
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:51,491
calm down first.

657
01:13:51,515 --> 01:13:54,415
What to do.

658
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:58,439
We are a team, whoever is at fault
must be replaced.

659
01:13:58,463 --> 01:14:00,463
All the same.

660
01:14:01,487 --> 01:14:06,487
The important thing now is how to
save Hua

661
01:14:06,488 --> 01:14:09,488
dari Zhang Chongbang.

662
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:13,412
The only way...

663
01:14:20,436 --> 01:14:25,436
I told you, who is wrong, even
God will not forgive.

664
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,960
These are some
police officers from 4 years ago.

665
01:14:56,961 --> 01:14:58,661
For murder is punishable by imprisonment.

666
01:14:58,685 --> 01:15:03,485
Freshly released, predictably, they were
connected to several criminal cases.

667
01:15:03,509 --> 01:15:06,409
We have checked at immigration.

668
01:15:06,433 --> 01:15:10,433
Last week, they all
drove their families out of Hong Kong.

669
01:15:10,457 --> 01:15:14,457
The family left in a hurry
as if there was a big case.

670
01:15:14,481 --> 01:15:17,481
Our evidence is only
enough to demand Gongzi.

671
01:15:17,505 --> 01:15:20,405
These people can't be let go.

672
01:15:20,429 --> 01:15:21,429
Yes, sir!

673
01:15:21,453 --> 01:15:23,453
Ready.
- Yes, sir.

674
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,477
All don't move!

675
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:27,501
Who allowed?

676
01:15:27,525 --> 01:15:29,425
I.

677
01:15:29,449 --> 01:15:32,449
Don't you know when there's
a lot of protest? Bro, let's talk.

678
01:15:32,473 --> 01:15:34,473
Let's hurry.
- Bang!

679
01:15:38,497 --> 01:15:42,497
Bro, please.

680
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:52,421
I understand your condition, I'm not
happy either, but you should know.

681
01:15:52,445 --> 01:15:57,445
Earlier in the plaza, many of our comrades
died, no more mistakes.

682
01:15:57,469 --> 01:15:59,469
And also

683
01:15:59,493 --> 01:16:03,493
Leave this case to Inspector Dai,
let's not interfere anymore, okay?

684
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,517
Disagree.

685
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:07,541
This is an order!
- Disagree.

686
01:16:07,565 --> 01:16:10,465
You're a cop.
- You too.

687
01:16:11,489 --> 01:16:14,489
This is an order, what do you think
I should do?

688
01:16:14,513 --> 01:16:19,413
Don't always use your position
to order me, Bao.

689
01:16:19,437 --> 01:16:23,437
Show your compassion, so many
have died, how can I stop?

690
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:28,461
My position is quite difficult.

691
01:16:29,485 --> 01:16:31,485
You sure can, yes.

692
01:16:32,409 --> 01:16:34,409
Let's go!

693
01:16:35,433 --> 01:16:38,433
Qiu GangAo has come.
They are here to make a report.

694
01:16:59,457 --> 01:17:03,457
You don't need this much.
We just want to make a report.

695
01:17:06,481 --> 01:17:08,481
That's good.

696
01:17:08,505 --> 01:17:10,505
We can save time.

697
01:17:10,529 --> 01:17:12,529
Brew some coffee.

698
01:17:12,553 --> 01:17:15,453
Qiu GangAo, free 6 months.

699
01:17:15,477 --> 01:17:19,477
There is no record of work, residence,
out of town, bank, nothing.

700
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,501
You could be the culprit.

701
01:17:21,525 --> 01:17:25,425
2 weeks ago Wang Kun was killed
his belongings were taken.

702
01:17:25,449 --> 01:17:28,449
8 of our police officers were killed,
you did it!

703
01:17:29,473 --> 01:17:33,473
You and Wang Kun have a quarrel, it's
all clear.

704
01:17:33,497 --> 01:17:38,497
Hua had admitted it,
for the sake of his wife and child.

705
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:43,421
He says you got involved and became
the chairman. I don't believe it myself.

706
01:17:44,445 --> 01:17:48,445
You've come, of course you're ready.
Please explain.

707
01:17:56,469 --> 01:17:58,469
Why are you laughing?

708
01:18:01,493 --> 01:18:08,493
In your position for decades, the
style of speech is more or less the same.

709
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:12,417
Guess what I believe you guys?

710
01:18:17,441 --> 01:18:23,441
Today I want to make a report about my
missing friend, his name is Zhao Zhiqiang.

711
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:25,465
Damn it, you killed the cops!

712
01:18:37,489 --> 01:18:43,489
Well, if you have any doubts,
we're ready to work together.

713
01:18:43,513 --> 01:18:47,413
According to the rules, I'm being held here
for at most 48 hours, starting from now on.

714
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:52,437
Oh yes, make me some sugar coffee,
use fresh-milk, thank you.

715
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,461
Quick.

716
01:18:54,485 --> 01:18:56,485
If you dare, just drink.

717
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:08,409
Which he says makes sense too.

718
01:19:10,433 --> 01:19:12,433
I made you coffee.

719
01:19:26,457 --> 01:19:29,457
The sugar is a little fresh-milk.

720
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:30,481
Thank you.

721
01:19:30,505 --> 01:19:32,505
This one you haven't changed.

722
01:19:39,429 --> 01:19:41,429
Haven't smelled this room in a long time.

723
01:19:42,453 --> 01:19:47,453
Remember, the first time you were
interrogated, you were sitting next to it.

724
01:19:49,477 --> 01:19:52,477
I remember He Laowen.

725
01:19:53,401 --> 01:19:58,401
I'm the bad cop, you're the good cop.
You're scared to the point of stomach ache.

726
01:20:00,425 --> 01:20:03,425
You always remember my bad side.

727
01:20:04,449 --> 01:20:10,449
How, Gongzi is missing
do we keep looking for him?

728
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:17,473
I have warned, don't be with the wrong person
, there must be a problem, see for yourself.

729
01:20:17,497 --> 01:20:20,497
That's right, you've been here too.

730
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:23,421
What can you give us?

731
01:20:23,445 --> 01:20:28,445
Chairman Bang alone could not arrest them
and many police officers died.

732
01:20:28,469 --> 01:20:31,469
How can I help?

733
01:20:36,493 --> 01:20:38,493
You can help.
You're talented.

734
01:20:38,517 --> 01:20:41,417
There's something I want to ask.

735
01:20:41,441 --> 01:20:48,441
There are people, regardless of the law,
cold blooded

736
01:20:48,465 --> 01:20:50,465
catch all the criminals,
so that the world is at peace.

737
01:20:50,489 --> 01:20:52,489
According to you?

738
01:20:55,413 --> 01:20:58,413
I think
there might be a grudge against you.

739
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:03,437
However, it needs proof.
If there's no

740
01:21:04,461 --> 01:21:08,461
what else to say?
- Sooner or later there will be evidence.

741
01:21:08,485 --> 01:21:13,485
This person was so famous,
there must be something wrong.

742
01:21:13,509 --> 01:21:15,509
If you make a wrong move, you
can be caught.

743
01:21:16,433 --> 01:21:18,433
Your confidence is pretty high too.

744
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:22,457
I'm afraid that another cop will die.

745
01:21:22,481 --> 01:21:25,481
If someone dies, it's the criminal first.

746
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:33,405
So the police, why must be afraid?
If you're scared, just be a postman, right?

747
01:21:33,429 --> 01:21:37,429
So the postman is good too.
Just deliver the mail.

748
01:21:37,453 --> 01:21:39,453
You guys are ...

749
01:21:40,477 --> 01:21:43,477
more like ushering in death.

750
01:21:51,401 --> 01:21:54,401
We'll see
who delivers what.

751
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,425
You are different from them.

752
01:22:11,449 --> 01:22:15,449
If you're willing to be a witness,
there's still time.

753
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:17,473
I'm here to report.

754
01:22:17,497 --> 01:22:20,497
Don't be like being interrogated.

755
01:22:20,521 --> 01:22:25,421
I will provide information
so that Gongzi can be found again.

756
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:27,411
The bad guys are out
there, you just sit here

757
01:22:27,423 --> 01:22:29,445
talking to me, what do
you want to talk about?

758
01:22:39,469 --> 01:22:41,469
Coffee, thank you.

759
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:50,493
One two three four...

760
01:22:50,517 --> 01:22:52,517
Come on, one more time.

761
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:56,441
One two three four...

762
01:22:56,465 --> 01:22:58,465
Lets follow.

763
01:22:58,489 --> 01:23:00,489
Look at the teacher.

764
01:23:00,513 --> 01:23:02,513
Good.

765
01:23:09,437 --> 01:23:11,437
Gongzi is dead,
his body was found.

766
01:23:12,461 --> 01:23:15,461
There is a letter.
He has admitted everything.

767
01:23:15,485 --> 01:23:18,485
Then all the evidence is cut off.
It's hard for us to hold them.

768
01:23:30,409 --> 01:23:33,409
Everyone, get out!

769
01:23:49,433 --> 01:23:52,433
Need proof, right?

770
01:24:01,457 --> 01:24:04,457
Proof!

771
01:24:05,481 --> 01:24:10,481
Don't be so emotional, what
I'm going to say next is illegal evidence.

772
01:24:10,505 --> 01:24:12,505
You can't use it.

773
01:24:13,429 --> 01:24:15,429
Did you kill your brother too?

774
01:24:16,453 --> 01:24:21,453
Gongzi you killed,
Wang Kun too.

775
01:24:21,477 --> 01:24:25,477
Yao and many other cops you
all killed.

776
01:24:27,401 --> 01:24:30,401
Why kill so many innocent people?

777
01:24:31,425 --> 01:24:33,425
Innocent?

778
01:24:33,449 --> 01:24:36,449
Are you discussing innocence with me?

779
01:24:36,473 --> 01:24:43,473
For the sake of the police I'm trying
in court, just one word from you...

780
01:24:43,497 --> 01:24:45,497
The five of us will not be imprisoned.

781
01:24:45,521 --> 01:24:49,421
You gave up defending us.
You took us to prison.

782
01:24:49,445 --> 01:24:51,445
In prison, every night, the
suspects I once arrested

783
01:24:51,469 --> 01:24:53,469
everyone is looking for me.

784
01:24:53,493 --> 01:24:56,493
Here, here talking innocent?

785
01:24:56,517 --> 01:25:00,417
Don't think it's great that you talk
like that in court, very professional.

786
01:25:00,441 --> 01:25:02,441
For the sake of criminals
you don't defend your brother.

787
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:04,465
That cola is a villain!

788
01:25:04,489 --> 01:25:07,489
Don't twist the facts.

789
01:25:07,513 --> 01:25:09,513
You've gone too far,
don't you need compensation?

790
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:12,437
You kill,
don't you need to go to jail?

791
01:25:12,461 --> 01:25:15,461
What's innocent?
Are you aware of what you are doing?

792
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:17,485
You killed the cop.

793
01:25:17,509 --> 01:25:20,409
You tortured Yao, still
you pushed him down.

794
01:25:20,433 --> 01:25:23,433
Is this justice?

795
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:25,457
You get revenge.

796
01:25:25,481 --> 01:25:30,481
Want revenge? Look for me.
Directly face me.

797
01:25:34,405 --> 01:25:37,405
That's the plan.

798
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:39,429
At the plaza that day
apparently you didn't come.

799
01:25:48,453 --> 01:25:51,453
48 hours have passed.

800
01:25:51,477 --> 01:25:53,477
You have to let me go.

801
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:56,401
Bang!

802
01:25:57,425 --> 01:26:00,425
Your wife at the dance hall, taken hostage.

803
01:26:00,449 --> 01:26:02,449
Ada good.

804
01:26:04,473 --> 01:26:06,473
Bang!
- Dare to touch my family?

805
01:26:12,497 --> 01:26:14,497
Let's go.

806
01:26:39,421 --> 01:26:41,421
Go, hurry!

807
01:26:44,445 --> 01:26:47,445
Inspector, 6090 reports
at the scene there was a shooting.

808
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:49,469
Ketua Bang,
Shitu Jie.

809
01:26:49,493 --> 01:26:51,493
like a lunatic, holding your wife hostage,
wanting to see you.

810
01:26:51,517 --> 01:26:53,517
Already shot 3 times.

811
01:26:54,441 --> 01:27:01,441
Inspector Zhang, inside is your wife, 10
small children, 4 old people, very dangerous.

812
01:27:01,465 --> 01:27:08,465
Shitu Jie brought a bomb, the team said
there was a control device on his neck connected to his pulse.

813
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:09,489
Designed so intricately.

814
01:27:09,513 --> 01:27:13,413
Now we have a solution.
- How to?

815
01:27:13,437 --> 01:27:16,437
That is, avoid explosions.

816
01:27:16,461 --> 01:27:18,461
Just kill him to stop his pulse.

817
01:27:21,485 --> 01:27:26,485
The thing is, your wife is handcuffed
by Shitu Jie's hands.

818
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:34,409
Come on, want someone else to die?
Where's Zhang Chongbang?

819
01:27:34,433 --> 01:27:38,433
I'm here Shitu Jie, I'm coming.

820
01:27:38,457 --> 01:27:43,457
Let go of my wife and these hostages,
come out and have a good talk.

821
01:27:45,481 --> 01:27:47,481
Don't be noisy!

822
01:27:49,405 --> 01:27:51,405
Finally you came too.

823
01:27:51,429 --> 01:27:53,429
Yes I came.

824
01:27:54,453 --> 01:27:58,453
The one over there told
me to get out, I just wanted to meet him!

825
01:27:58,477 --> 01:28:00,477
Get out, back off!

826
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:06,401
Don't worry,
they're out.

827
01:28:06,425 --> 01:28:10,425
Look, the bomb in your neck should
be dropped by a team of experts, how?

828
01:28:10,449 --> 01:28:13,449
If you want to help me,
listen to me.

829
01:28:13,473 --> 01:28:17,473
Otherwise, your wife and
child will die!

830
01:28:17,497 --> 01:28:20,497
Hey, calm down first.

831
01:28:20,521 --> 01:28:23,421
Listen to me first!

832
01:28:24,445 --> 01:28:28,445
Case 4 years ago, I was the bad guy.

833
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:33,469
I told them to save people
by force.

834
01:28:33,493 --> 01:28:40,493
I also say, if we can't save
Mr. Huo, everyone will have to endure this.

835
01:28:40,517 --> 01:28:42,517
I forced them.

836
01:28:44,441 --> 01:28:46,441
I'm greedy.

837
01:28:46,465 --> 01:28:49,465
I want the attention of the rich man.

838
01:28:49,489 --> 01:28:55,489
I should be responsible,
but I'm not.

839
01:28:56,413 --> 01:29:01,413
They are innocent.
I'm the one who embarrassed the police.

840
01:29:01,437 --> 01:29:03,437
I'm the one who embarrassed the police!

841
01:29:03,461 --> 01:29:05,461
Okay, calm down!

842
01:29:05,485 --> 01:29:09,485
Chairman Bang, don't you
like listening to facts?

843
01:29:09,509 --> 01:29:14,409
This is a fact, but I don't think there's any real intention.

844
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:19,433
Now give him 30 seconds
so he can make up his mind.

845
01:29:25,457 --> 01:29:27,457
Why is this?

846
01:29:27,481 --> 01:29:29,481
The bomb disposal team advanced,
all immediately retreated.

847
01:29:29,505 --> 01:29:31,505
Inspector Zhang, back off!

848
01:29:35,429 --> 01:29:37,429
All don't move!

849
01:29:38,453 --> 01:29:40,453
Save me!
- Get me pliers!

850
01:29:40,477 --> 01:29:42,477
Give it fast!

851
01:29:42,501 --> 01:29:45,401
Save me quickly, chief Bang.

852
01:29:45,425 --> 01:29:47,425
Quickly get the kids out of here.

853
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:52,449
The bomb exploded immediately,
everyone gone!

854
01:29:52,473 --> 01:29:54,473
Inspector Zhang, leave quickly!
- Come here quickly!

855
01:29:54,497 --> 01:29:56,497
Fast!

856
01:29:56,521 --> 01:29:59,421
Go away, there's no time!

857
01:29:59,445 --> 01:30:01,445
It's fine.

858
01:30:01,469 --> 01:30:06,469
Time is connected to the pulse,
when the pulse stops the bomb also stops.

859
01:30:06,493 --> 01:30:09,493
If you want to help your wife,
kill her.

860
01:30:10,417 --> 01:30:12,417
Inspector, there's no time!

861
01:30:17,441 --> 01:30:19,441
Shoot!

862
01:30:25,465 --> 01:30:27,465
It's fine.

863
01:30:33,489 --> 01:30:37,489
Now you understand,
at that moment how desperate I was.

864
01:30:37,513 --> 01:30:39,513
Wish you luck.

865
01:30:45,437 --> 01:30:48,437
Everything is gone fast!
Fast!

866
01:31:00,461 --> 01:31:02,461
SURGERY ROOM

867
01:31:15,485 --> 01:31:17,485
Inspector Zhang,
we're from Internal Investigations.

868
01:31:17,509 --> 01:31:21,409
Today you're at the dance hall
shooting at the Eagles.

869
01:31:21,433 --> 01:31:25,433
And repeatedly violated
instructions from superiors.

870
01:31:26,457 --> 01:31:29,457
This is an arrest warrant.

871
01:31:29,458 --> 01:31:30,958
What do you mean come at this time?

872
01:31:30,959 --> 01:31:32,459
Please cooperate.
- This is outrageous!

873
01:31:32,483 --> 01:31:36,483
Doctor!
How is my wife?

874
01:31:36,507 --> 01:31:39,407
Inspector Zhang, mistress Zhang and the
fetus got a great shake.

875
01:31:39,431 --> 01:31:43,431
As a result, his blood
pressure is getting higher.

876
01:31:43,455 --> 01:31:45,455
But don't worry, it's safe.

877
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:47,479
Thank you.
- Don't worry. Let.

878
01:31:50,403 --> 01:31:53,403
Inspector Zhang, fellow policemen
please don't make things difficult for us.

879
01:31:53,427 --> 01:31:55,427
His wife is not aware.
You guys are outrageous!

880
01:31:55,451 --> 01:31:58,451
All right, I'm with you.

881
01:32:14,499 --> 01:32:16,499
Sis Rong.

882
01:32:17,423 --> 01:32:20,423
How?
- Problem solved?

883
01:32:20,447 --> 01:32:26,447
I'm done, you want
the most powerful weapon, all complete.

884
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:30,471
Bank data, all
security guard data is here.

885
01:32:31,495 --> 01:32:33,495
But

886
01:32:36,419 --> 01:32:39,419
I don't expect you anymore.
- What do you mean?

887
01:32:40,443 --> 01:32:42,443
Still dare to speak.

888
01:32:42,467 --> 01:32:45,467
You've been caught, the
police have been looking for you.

889
01:32:45,491 --> 01:32:47,491
I still don't want to go to jail.

890
01:32:47,515 --> 01:32:52,415
Never mind, here is USD 100 million,
you want to give up?

891
01:32:52,439 --> 01:32:57,439
I said not to use you.
Not saying I gave up.

892
01:32:58,463 --> 01:33:01,463
Honestly, I've been
looking for someone else.

893
01:33:02,487 --> 01:33:04,487
You can go.

894
01:33:11,411 --> 01:33:14,411
Why are you still standing here?

895
01:33:14,435 --> 01:33:16,435
Go!

896
01:34:10,459 --> 01:34:13,459
This job isn't for you either.

897
01:34:30,483 --> 01:34:31,483
Well.

898
01:34:31,507 --> 01:34:35,407
Just like that, Wednesday at 8pm.

899
01:34:38,431 --> 01:34:41,431
What are you waiting for, just get started.
I still have a meeting.

900
01:34:41,455 --> 01:34:43,455
Close the phone.

901
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:49,479
Senior Inspector Zhang CongBang.

902
01:34:49,503 --> 01:34:54,403
The internal investigation this time was handled
by Senior Superintendent Luo Zhihui.

903
01:34:54,427 --> 01:35:00,427
This investigation can most likely
be dismissed, understand?

904
01:35:02,451 --> 01:35:06,451
The other day you shot at
the Eagles team, right?

905
01:35:08,475 --> 01:35:10,475
You are right.

906
01:35:10,499 --> 01:35:14,499
If you don't have a plausible
explanation today , you'll be prosecuted.

907
01:35:14,523 --> 01:35:17,423
Maybe you're in jail, you understand?

908
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:21,447
Understand.

909
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:29,471
Sorry, inspectors.
- Why?

910
01:35:31,495 --> 01:35:33,495
Don't listen to this investigation,
please come out.

911
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:35,519
I know.

912
01:35:35,543 --> 01:35:37,543
I know entering this time is
not according to the rules.

913
01:35:37,567 --> 01:35:42,467
But please don't stop him.

914
01:35:42,491 --> 01:35:46,491
Whatever your relationship,
obey the rules, get out!

915
01:35:46,515 --> 01:35:50,415
Inspector, we are one team, if he is wrong,
we are all wrong too.

916
01:35:50,439 --> 01:35:53,439
We're ready to take it, Inspector.

917
01:36:03,463 --> 01:36:07,463
Police is a matter of responsibility and
rules, not an emotional issue.

918
01:36:08,487 --> 01:36:11,487
If it still doesn't come out, it
can be punished.

919
01:36:39,411 --> 01:36:41,411
3 inspectors.

920
01:36:44,435 --> 01:36:47,435
Actually this world

921
01:36:47,459 --> 01:36:49,459
Truth is not just
black and white.

922
01:36:50,483 --> 01:36:53,483
There are still many
positions that are gray.

923
01:36:55,407 --> 01:36:57,407
This case,

924
01:36:57,431 --> 01:36:59,431
I can't choose.

925
01:36:59,455 --> 01:37:04,455
I was wrong to shoot at the police.

926
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:08,479
I'm sure if it was someone
else, things would be different,

927
01:37:08,503 --> 01:37:11,403
at that time there was no choice.

928
01:37:12,427 --> 01:37:14,427
The one I helped was my wife.

929
01:37:17,451 --> 01:37:19,451
I'm sure you will do
the same.

930
01:37:22,475 --> 01:37:25,475
19 years old entered the police department

931
01:37:25,499 --> 01:37:28,499
What are the rules, I understand.

932
01:37:29,423 --> 01:37:36,423
Nowadays, the police only focus
on relationships, not catching criminals.

933
01:37:36,447 --> 01:37:39,447
Indeed we learn a lot of techniques.

934
01:37:39,471 --> 01:37:42,471
The most skilled are
certainty and anticipation.

935
01:37:42,495 --> 01:37:45,495
Please understand.

936
01:37:45,519 --> 01:37:49,419
"Hey policeman,
what are you doing dead work?"

937
01:37:51,443 --> 01:37:53,443
But since when

938
01:37:55,467 --> 01:37:59,467
can we commit to one belief?

939
01:37:59,491 --> 01:38:04,491
It can even cost a life.

940
01:38:04,515 --> 01:38:06,515
What do we think?

941
01:38:06,539 --> 01:38:10,439
We are not thinking of
working less.

942
01:38:10,463 --> 01:38:13,463
But think about how to
do better.

943
01:38:19,487 --> 01:38:21,487
Any extras?

944
01:38:22,411 --> 01:38:24,411
There is.

945
01:38:25,435 --> 01:38:29,435
Regrettably,
this criminal is still at large.

946
01:38:29,459 --> 01:38:31,459
I haven't caught them yet.

947
01:38:44,483 --> 01:38:46,483
Just like that.

948
01:38:50,407 --> 01:38:56,407
Since I'm unwell,
internal investigation this time

949
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:58,431
temporarily stopped.

950
01:38:58,455 --> 01:39:01,455
To be continued tomorrow at the same time.

951
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:05,479
The law department sues you or not, it's
not up to me to decide.

952
01:39:06,403 --> 01:39:10,403
In these 24 hours, you're still a cop.

953
01:39:12,427 --> 01:39:14,427
Don't disappoint us.

954
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:20,451
Fuck you,
still haven't left.

955
01:39:21,475 --> 01:39:23,475
Thank you, Inspector.

956
01:39:27,499 --> 01:39:29,499
Thank you, Inspector.

957
01:39:42,423 --> 01:39:44,423
Chairman Bang, accept one case.

958
01:39:44,447 --> 01:39:46,447
In Ma Jiaorong's pocket was found a USB.

959
01:39:46,471 --> 01:39:48,471
It contains the security schedule
of Pan Asia Bank.

960
01:39:48,495 --> 01:39:52,495
Suspected of robbing a car from
Pan Asia Bank, the team is already there.

961
01:39:56,419 --> 01:40:02,419
PAN ASIA BANK CENTER

962
01:40:07,443 --> 01:40:10,443
Good understand, thank you.

963
01:40:10,467 --> 01:40:14,467
Chairman Bang, after being examined earlier,
there is a victim named David Wang.

964
01:40:14,491 --> 01:40:17,491
It turned out that he was the
manager of Fortune Bank.

965
01:40:17,515 --> 01:40:20,415
Bank Fortune today has
a special plenary meeting.

966
01:40:20,439 --> 01:40:22,439
So, Huo Zhaotang had already returned
from America.

967
01:40:22,463 --> 01:40:25,463
FORTUNE BANK CENTER

968
01:40:25,487 --> 01:40:28,487
Some say businessmen must be cunning.

969
01:40:28,511 --> 01:40:30,511
Actually doing business is like war.

970
01:40:30,535 --> 01:40:33,435
Without a clear brain,
will not win the war.

971
01:40:33,459 --> 01:40:35,459
In this world, who wants to be the bomb?

972
01:40:35,483 --> 01:40:37,483
"LEFOAF CATERING SERVICES"

973
01:40:42,407 --> 01:40:44,407
Inspector Xia, target won't be here.

974
01:40:44,431 --> 01:40:46,431
Released so soon?
- The target is definitely not here.

975
01:40:46,455 --> 01:40:48,455
On Ma Jiaorong's body was found a USB.

976
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:52,479
The criminal deliberately deceived
the police.

977
01:40:52,503 --> 01:40:54,503
Listen to me, the target is
at the Fortune Bank Center.

978
01:40:54,527 --> 01:40:56,527
At the Fortune Bank!

979
01:40:56,551 --> 01:40:58,551
What is the proof?

980
01:41:00,475 --> 01:41:02,475
I'm out for a bit.
- Well.

981
01:41:02,499 --> 01:41:04,499
Thank you.

982
01:41:04,523 --> 01:41:06,523
Please.

983
01:41:07,447 --> 01:41:12,447
This USB is proof,
inside is a robbery map.

984
01:41:12,471 --> 01:41:15,471
Contains the time for changing the security
guard. All the evidence here points to

985
01:41:15,495 --> 01:41:18,495
money carrier.

986
01:41:18,519 --> 01:41:20,519
Send some people there, why?

987
01:41:39,443 --> 01:41:43,443
Don't be careless!
What do you want?

988
01:41:45,467 --> 01:41:47,467
Don't play around.

989
01:41:48,491 --> 01:41:51,491
I won't send anyone.
You guys go alone.

990
01:41:52,415 --> 01:41:54,415
You guys are
used to breaking the rules right?

991
01:41:54,439 --> 01:41:57,439
Don't disturb me at work, understand?

992
01:41:58,463 --> 01:42:02,463
We provide data, not interfere.
What you're doing is pointless, you know?

993
01:42:02,487 --> 01:42:05,487
Since when can you talk?
You guys are breaking the rules.

994
01:42:05,511 --> 01:42:07,511
I have the right to sue!

995
01:42:08,435 --> 01:42:10,435
FORTUNE BANK CENTER CCTV ROOM

996
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:12,459
The CCTV room has been resolved.

997
01:42:15,483 --> 01:42:17,483
Director, we're ready.

998
01:42:18,407 --> 01:42:20,407
Don't mess around!

999
01:42:26,431 --> 01:42:31,431
It's no use having me come here,
it's an individual security system.

1000
01:42:39,455 --> 01:42:41,455
Open!

1001
01:42:41,479 --> 01:42:43,479
Quickly open!

1002
01:42:43,503 --> 01:42:45,503
Don't shoot.

1003
01:42:49,427 --> 01:42:54,427
Please, it's my fault.
I blame you.

1004
01:42:54,451 --> 01:42:57,451
Thank you for saving me.

1005
01:42:57,475 --> 01:43:02,475
I didn't mean to do that in court.

1006
01:43:02,499 --> 01:43:04,499
Because you've killed people.

1007
01:43:04,523 --> 01:43:09,423
There's a lot of money here, take it all.
Where are you going? Let me arrange.

1008
01:43:41,447 --> 01:43:43,447
Please help center.

1009
01:43:43,471 --> 01:43:46,471
Report, suspect looks out
of Fortune Bank

1010
01:43:46,495 --> 01:43:48,495
by arah Tsim Sha Tsui.

1011
01:43:48,519 --> 01:43:50,519
Allegedly carrying multiple weapons.

1012
01:43:56,443 --> 01:43:59,443
Chairman Bang, at the Fortune Bank,
one body was found.

1013
01:43:59,467 --> 01:44:01,467
He is Huo Zhaotang.

1014
01:44:12,491 --> 01:44:14,491
Handle!

1015
01:44:43,415 --> 01:44:45,415
Get out of the way!
Dangerous!

1016
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:07,439
Get out of the way!

1017
01:45:11,463 --> 01:45:14,463
Get out of the way!

1018
01:45:34,487 --> 01:45:36,487
Everyone step aside!
- Get out of the way!

1019
01:45:40,411 --> 01:45:42,411
Go!

1020
01:45:54,435 --> 01:45:57,435
Ao!
Put down your weapons!

1021
01:45:57,459 --> 01:45:59,459
You can't escape.

1022
01:46:23,483 --> 01:46:25,483
Big shark, watch out!

1023
01:46:32,407 --> 01:46:34,407
Follow!

1024
01:47:04,431 --> 01:47:06,431
Chief Bang, they're crazy!

1025
01:48:18,455 --> 01:48:20,455
Can you still walk?

1026
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:23,479
No problem.
Eat shabu shabu.

1027
01:48:23,503 --> 01:48:25,503
Well.

1028
01:49:41,427 --> 01:49:43,427
Give up.
- Give up what?

1029
01:49:43,451 --> 01:49:48,451
Listen, Hua.
- You want to die together? Put down your guns!

1030
01:49:48,475 --> 01:49:50,475
You still have time to give up.

1031
01:49:50,499 --> 01:49:54,499
Put down your guns!
- Okay, I put it down, you calm down!

1032
01:49:55,423 --> 01:49:59,423
You used to be a cop too, you were a
child hostage , are you human?

1033
01:49:59,447 --> 01:50:01,447
You also have a daughter.

1034
01:50:03,471 --> 01:50:05,471
My daughter, come here!

1035
01:50:50,495 --> 01:50:53,495
Quan hang on, you can!

1036
01:50:53,519 --> 01:50:55,519
Sis Ao ...

1037
01:50:57,443 --> 01:50:59,443
I can't walk anymore.

1038
01:51:09,467 --> 01:51:11,467
Hang on.

1039
01:51:21,491 --> 01:51:23,491
I'm taking a break.

1040
01:51:27,415 --> 01:51:30,415
Soon to be my brother again.
- Well.

1041
01:51:36,439 --> 01:51:38,439
Go!

1042
01:52:32,463 --> 01:52:35,463
You won't be able to escape.
Give it up!

1043
01:52:36,487 --> 01:52:38,487
Back to jail?

1044
01:52:39,411 --> 01:52:44,411
You said this, said that,
Qing did too.

1045
01:52:44,435 --> 01:52:47,435
So when I'm free,
I just kill him.

1046
01:56:02,459 --> 01:56:04,459
Wake up!

1047
01:59:06,483 --> 01:59:10,483
I admit I lost,
but will not accept fate!

1048
01:59:10,507 --> 01:59:14,407
While in prison
I thought of one thing.

1049
01:59:26,431 --> 01:59:30,431
If that day you were chasing Cola,

1050
01:59:30,455 --> 01:59:36,455
will the fate of both of us change?

1051
02:00:36,403 --> 02:00:44,403
Remembering Our Beloved Director,
Benny Chan
