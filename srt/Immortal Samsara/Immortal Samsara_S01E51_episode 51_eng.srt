 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,500
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,920
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,170
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,120
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,820
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,420
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,800
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,570
   

15
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,950
   

16
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,960
What's wrong? You don't like the food?

17
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,080
During the last 900 years...

18
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,560
did you get what you wanted?

19
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,340
Although I succeeded, the years have been long and the loneliness unbearable.

20
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,220
That love...

21
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,920
and that face...

22
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,440
never appeared again.

23
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,740
Huan Qin, it's been so many years since we last met.

24
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,520
I've come to see you.

25
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,700
In order to seek the truth, please forgive me.

26
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,320
 You lost your immortal spirit. As I expected, you weren't killed in battle. 

27
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,100
   

28
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,040
Something big has happened.

29
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,790
Your Majesty.

30
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,510
Your Majesty, by the order of His Supreme Majesty,

31
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,200
please go immediately to Lingxiao Hall to discuss an important matter with him.

32
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:17,130
Lu Jing, without my permission, no one is allowed to leave the Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

33
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,660
Yes.

34
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,420
Your Supreme Majesty, it has been a million years since the Heavenly Bell rang nine times.

35
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,220
If I may ask, Your Supreme Majesty, what happened?

36
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,940
Since your return, strange things keep happening.

37
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,420
Many immortal officials are concerned and came repeatedly to report things to me.

38
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,660
That's why I had to invite you here to discuss it.

39
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,950
The last time the bell rang through the Nine Heavens was when I returned from the Divine-Devil War.

40
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,700
I have no idea what I did to deserve that bell ringing for me again.

41
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,960
Please enlighten me, Your Supreme Majesty.

42
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,800
I closed the Heavenly Gates with nine strikes of the Heavenly Bell

43
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,460
because you are the only emperor left in the Nine Heavens.

44
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,460
No immortal officials in the Heaven Realm rank higher than you.

45
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,060
If I didn't do that, they wouldn't have the courage to speak their minds.

46
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,960
This is for the safety of the Heaven Realm.

47
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,500
Please don't take it to heart.

48
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,080
Your Majesty, you guarded the Heaven Realm for millions of years.

49
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,560
You have always been a role model for us.

50
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,880
However, since your return, I noticed that you have changed quite drastically.

51
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,440
I'm in charge of the Heavenly Army.

52
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,420
Yet you've never asked me about the defense of the Heaven Realm,

53
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,660
but you've visited the Mortal Realm many times and lingered there.

54
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,700
Here I thought His Majesty had committed some kind of big crime!

55
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,420
Turns out that he just visited the Mortal Realm a few times.

56
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,880
This is absurd!

57
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,960
I'd like to ask all the immortal officials present, which of you have not visited

58
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,300
and taken a stroll around the Mortal Realm in your spare time?

59
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,040
Tai You was just promoted.

60
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,680
It's understandable that he wants to be cautious.

61
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:44,200
Emperor Ying Yuan, I remember you used to never go to the Mortal Realm without a reason.

62
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,650
Your Supreme Majesty, you relieved me of my duties so I could rest well and recover from my injuries.

63
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,220
The heavenly guards are not under my jurisdiction.

64
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,100
What right do I have to meddle in it?

65
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,280
Many times during my trials, my life was in danger over and over again.

66
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,200
The perpetrator is treacherous.

67
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
He intends to ruin the peace of the Three Realms.

68
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,580
Therefore, I went to the Mortal Realm to investigate.

69
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,360
Who would dare assassinate you?!

70
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,460
Ying Yuan? Ying Yuan?

71
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,920
 Nothing major has happened in the Heaven Realm lately. Yet the bell rang all of a sudden. 

72
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,560
 The gate to the Nine Heavens has been closed. Even Greater Gods can't get in or out. 

73
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,460
 Is it really related to Ying Yuan? 

74
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,080
 But if it isn't, dressing up as my sister and walking around 

75
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,360
 during the day will only cause trouble if someone catches me. 

76
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,700
Yan Dan, here you are.

77
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,440
His Majesty has been summoned by His Supreme Majesty.

78
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,340
Lingxiao Hall has been surrounded by a large number of heavenly soldiers.

79
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,180
I heard from Star Deity Tai You's close attendant that His Supreme Majesty is going to question His Majesty.

80
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,980
Your Majesty, your safety is related to the stability of the Three Realms.

81
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,020
You're secretly protected when you visit the Mortal Realm.

82
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,620
Yet our heavenly soldiers didn't see you do any investigating in the Mortal Realm.

83
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,720
Instead, you were meeting a demon in private.

84
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,280
Your Majesty, are you guarding the Three Realms or your personal relationship?

85
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,240
What is the meaning of this, Your Supreme Majesty?

86
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,480
Ying Yuan, do you admit guilt?

87
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,460
Your Supreme Majesty, if you are talking about Zhi Xi, I don't know what I am guilty of.

88
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,100
Your Supreme Majesty.

89
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,600
Your Majesty.

90
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,480
I've been inconsiderate.

91
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,560
Lately, I've been helping His Majesty repair the divine tools.

92
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,960
Because I was anxious, I've been going in and out of Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

93
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,880
Not only have I caused His Majesty to be misunderstood by Star Deity Tai You,

94
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,200
but I've also offended His Majesty's close attendants.

95
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,900
When an emperor makes a mistake, he should be treated equally to everyone else.

96
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,360
As his close attendant, I shouldn't cover for him.

97
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,300
I saw with my own eyes that His Majesty held her—

98
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,840
You want to accuse me and His Majesty of breaking abstinence of love?

99
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,640
Qing Yun, I made it clear to you a long time ago, my ambition is to become a high-ranking fairy.

100
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,060
I'm not here to compete with you to be an immortal attendant.

101
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,660
Why work so hard to trick me into coming here?

102
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,760
You betrayed your master out of jealousy. Your words aren't credible.

103
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,560
Fairy Zhi Xi has a restrained nature and has been dedicated to cultivation.

104
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,140
Other than that, I remember when His Majesty regained his eyesight and returned,

105
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,960
Your Supreme Majesty proved that they did not love each other with the Uncoupling Cord.

106
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,640
That's right.

107
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,800
Emperor Ying Yuan and Zhi Xi have no feelings for each other.

108
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,880
You are wise, Your Supreme Majesty.

109
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,060
She's not Zhi Xi. She used a transformation spell.

110
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,920
That's right.

111
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,880
The one that Ying Yuan loves has always been the former immortal attendant of Yanxu Heavenly Palace,

112
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,420
now a demon of Yelan Mountain, Yan Dan.

113
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,200
Your Supreme Majesty, I came to the Heaven Realm

114
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,020
to investigate the disappearance of my good friend, Lu Ming.

115
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,060
It has nothing to do with Ying Yuan and Zhi Xi.

116
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,060
If you have to punish someone, I'm willing to bear all the consequences.

117
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:18,740
Ying Yuan, if even I could see through such a petty trick, would you really not know about it?

118
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,580
You were involved with this spirit during your trials in the Mortal Realm.

119
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,560
I never blamed you for this.

120
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,240
The Nine Heavens doesn't punish those who fall in love anymore.

121
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,340
However, you addressed her as Zhi Xi when you clearly knew she was Yan Dan.

122
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,760
You lied to all the immortal officials!

123
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,180
You really have let me down.

124
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,560
Ying Yuan, I can allow you to be in love, but it cannot be with this demon.

125
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,820
Do you dare test it?

126
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,880
The Uncoupling Cord didn't break.

127
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,140
An emperor really has fallen in love with a demon from the Mortal Realm.

128
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,360
How preposterous. Absolutely preposterous!

129
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,620
The agarwood didn't become ash, isn't that right?

130
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,080
It is true that I love Yan Dan.

131
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,700
Nine hundred years ago, I punished myself with the punishment of love.

132
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,260
Even so, the root of my love remains intact.

133
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,400
This time, I'm willing to take the punishment of love again.

134
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,700
But this love is honest and harmless to the Three Realms.

135
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,520
Even if Your Supreme Majesty did not seal the gates, I would still tell you the truth.

136
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,400
I was wondering why you were so nice to her!

137
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,080
Your Majesty, you have guts!

138
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,680
All right then.

139
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,580
The Heavenly Rules have already been amended.

140
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:49,140
On the sake of your voluntary confession, I can give you a choice.

141
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,440
If you're willing to give up your deity status and resign from the emperor's position,

142
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,060
I'll allow you to be an ordinary couple with her in the Mortal Realm.

143
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,880
Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty.

144
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,200
I'll go with her if she is willing.

145
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,580
But not right now.

146
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,180
Because I still have something important to finish.

147
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,840
You cannot have it both ways.

148
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,710
If you will not give up your deity status, you will have to suffer the divine love punishment.

149
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,060
This demon has already lost her deity status.

150
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,900
She seduced an emperor as a demon.

151
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,380
She should be executed!

152
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,800
As long as I'm here, I won't let anyone touch her.

153
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,220
Well...

154
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,760
Someone once reported to me that you faked your death during your trials

155
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,200
to deceive the Heaven Realm and be with this demon.

156
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,200
I did not believe it before, but now it seems to be true.

157
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,460
The immortal official that helped His Majesty fake his death and deceive the Heaven Realm

158
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,800
was Lu Ming, who was serving His Majesty with me.

159
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,460
The strange thing is Lu Ming went missing after His Majesty's return.

160
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,080
His fate is still unknown.

161
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,420
Did you two kill Lu Ming to hide the truth?

162
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,480
Your Supreme Majesty,

163
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,340
I think you know how Lu Ming died better than anyone else,

164
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,820
yet now you're accusing others to cover up your guilt.

165
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,860
How bold! How dare you slander His Supreme Majesty!

166
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,220
During my secret investigation, no matter how much evidence pointed to you,

167
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,660
I kept thinking that perhaps there was some misunderstanding.

168
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,420
But at this point, I can no longer deceive myself anymore.

169
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,440
Lu Ming was my best friend.

170
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,640
It is true that he is dead.

171
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,100
But as for the identity of his murderer, words alone are not proof.

172
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,560
This is the Merfolk Tear that he made with his memories when he was still alive.

173
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,600
 You wanted to see me, Your Supreme Majesty? 

174
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,620
 As an attendant, you should focus on your work and follow orders. 

175
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,140
 If you doubt your master, then that's the end of the road. 

176
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,320
This scene isn't enough to tell us who the real killer is,

177
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,160
but Lu Ming left me an important clue before he died, which was the Alignment of Nine Planets.

178
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,100
That's right.

179
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,340
The Alignment of Nine Planets is a once-in-a-million-year extraordinary celestial phenomenon.

180
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,980
The Universe Enchantment, an evil art, can only be practiced during that time.

181
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,860
If he succeeds, he doesn't have to cultivate anymore.

182
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,660
He can directly draw immortal power from others.

183
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,540
This dragon scale comes from the ancient bloodline of the Nine Fins.

184
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,780
This is the hardest thing in the world and only the Universe Enchantment can make it brittle.

185
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,480
After Immortal Lord Bei Ming died, his immortal spirit disappeared.

186
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,560
Then later someone put this dragon scale inside the immortal coffin.

187
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,620
Afterward, the dragon scale shattered.

188
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:47,580
This proves that Immortal Lord Bei Ming was killed by the Universe Enchantment.

189
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,760
The last Alignment of Nine Planets happened during the Divine-Devil War.

190
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,460
The power of the immortals to be sacrificed must be equal to the power of the Universe Enchantment practitioner.

191
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,640
Three emperors, Immortal Lord Bei Ming, and Star Deity Ji Du were all killed.

192
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,660
Except for me, there is only one other person

193
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,040
who is as strong as they were.

194
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,600
The Golden Cicada's Wings is the best artifact for Universe Enchantment cultivation.

195
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,460
The Three-Winged Raven Clan joined the Asura clan during the War of Genesis.

196
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,620
Then, Your Supreme Majesty exterminated them.

197
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,860
After that, the Golden Cicada's Wings went missing.

198
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,400
Where did you find this, Your Majesty?

199
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,240
In the Heavenly Corner, the Star Setter Pavilion to be specific.

200
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,520
Until yesterday, it was still lying on the Star-Observing Stone Screen, absorbing spiritual power for its owner.

201
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,520
I think Star Deity Ji Du must have found this back then.

202
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,080
That's why someone killed him in the war to silence him.

203
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,740
Heavenly Emperor, do you admit guilt?

204
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,820
Seizing artifacts, practicing evil arts, causing the Divine-Devil War, and killing fellow immortals!

205
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,600
If these accusations are true, are you really a heavenly emperor or a demonic king?!

206
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,440
Ying Yuan.

207
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:23,560
Emperor Ying Yuan. I've always let you have your way, yet what have you done?

208
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,550
You twist the truth and repay kindness with ingratitude.

209
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:32,980
You actually used a fictitious scene to make up such a ridiculous story.

210
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,420
Whether it's a story or not, there is no point in arguing.

211
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,480
I have the last piece of a Nine Fin dragon scale.

212
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,140
Your Supreme Majesty, do you dare hold it in your hand?

213
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,280
If you've never practiced the Universe Enchantment, this will prove your innocence.

214
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,820
You are the only emperor left in the Nine Heavens now.

215
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,820
I have always valued you.

216
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:13,730
Do you think I made such a fuss and summoned you here just because of Yan Dan?

217
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:21,280
I only punished you with the love punishment because I don't want your scandalous deeds

218
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,160
to be publicized and bring shame to your position.

219
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,460
But I really didn't expect you would be led astray and blinded by love.

220
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,180
All right. Very well then.

221
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:40,240
In that case, let us put an end to this matter today.

222
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,960
Bring her in!

223
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,880
 Something about Sister Tao looks off. 

224
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,540
 Looks like Liu Weiyang is already in the hands of the Heavenly Emperor. 

225
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,620
Tao Ziqi, didn't you die in the Divine-Devil War?

226
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,620
You are right.

227
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,720
She is Tao Ziqi.

228
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,080
Tao Ziqi, how did you return from the dead?

229
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,380
Tell the immortals.

230
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,760
During the Divine-Devil War,

231
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,240
I was ordered to go to the Devil Clan to persuade the Devil King to stop the war,

232
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,540
but I stumbled upon Ying Yuan and the Devil King meeting privately.

233
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,660
Ying Yuan was planning to usurp the throne of the Heavenly Emperor.

234
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,000
He had joined hands with the devil clan early on.

235
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,220
He intended to take advantage of the war to take down the emperors and immortals who supported His Supreme Majesty.

236
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,800
I was killed by Ying Yuan to silence me.

237
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,120
I wandered in the Life and Death Arena for years until I was rescued by His Supreme Majesty.

238
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,780
Only then did I learn that the three emperors killed the Devil King

239
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,840
at the cost of their lives and stopped Ying Yuan's conspiracy.

240
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,760
I see now.

241
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,360
Your Supreme Majesty said you would carry out a serious investigation.

242
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,700
But you only took someone as a hostage to make up a false confession.

243
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,660
Was the Divine-Devil War instigated by Emperor Ying Yuan?

244
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,540
This is absolute nonsense!

245
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,200
During the Divine-Devil War, His Majesty almost lost his life!

246
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,260
I saw it with my own eyes!

247
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,500
Three other emperors were all sacrificed.

248
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,880
Ying Yuan was the only one who left the battlefield, saying he was poisoned.

249
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,080
But this poison was quickly cured by the heart of the lotus.

250
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,340
Immortals, do you think this is just a coincidence?

251
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,020
The heart of the lotus was mine.

252
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,800
It was my decision to save His Majesty.

253
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:08,960
Besides, if he really was to set this up, who would put their fate in the hands of an outsider?

254
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,600
All warfare is based on deception.

255
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,360
He uses strategy and wins over people's hearts.

256
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,960
Have you ever thought of this?

257
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,920
You were serving Immortal Lord Bei Ming before,

258
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:25,900
why were you transferred by Ying Yuan to Yanxu Heavenly Palace on the eve of the Divine-Devil War?

259
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,840
Tao Ziqi showed up all of a sudden.

260
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,620
Her identity is questionable. She has no proof.

261
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,340
She should not be trusted.

262
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:43,040
Your Supreme Majesty, you just need to hold the Nine Fins dragon scale to prove your innocence.

263
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,840
Why bother going through all this?

264
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,560
Who knows if you have tampered with the dragon scale beforehand?

265
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,080
Why should His Supreme Majesty suffer this humiliation?

266
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,380
Ying Yuan,

267
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:07,720
I warned Lu Ming because he knew about an old secret of the Heaven Realm.

268
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,880
I should have kept it to myself forever, but I never thought

269
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:19,310
that the one I wanted to protect would make up such a lie to frame me.

270
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,120
Only the Asura Clan have a black tattoo on their forehead!

271
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,840
Ying Yuan, I would have never imaged you would be a remnant of the Asura Clan!

272
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,360
It is the Eternal Darkness.

273
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,860
Eternal Darkness?

274
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,880
Marshal, you were in the ancient battles.

275
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Surely you can recognize this evil art.

276
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,840
Ying Yuan is not an ordinary descendant of the Asura Clan.

277
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,180
He is the son of the Asura King, Xuan Ye.

278
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,110
Xuan Ye killed countless people.

279
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,500
He used the Universe Enchantment to exterminate other clans.

280
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,720
Ying Yuan even brought it up just now.

281
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,800
Like father, like son indeed.

282
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,640
You once said that my parents were nobodies from the two clans.

283
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,240
Now, you've changed the story today.

284
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,560
Which is true and which is false?

285
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,440
In the past, I was afraid that you would be burdened by your identity.

286
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,600
I wanted you to be kind, so I kept it from you.

287
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,280
But I never thought you secretly took the Soul Ripping Sword and practiced the Eternal Darkness in secret.

288
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,440
Are you trying to follow in your father's footsteps?

289
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,420
When Emperor Ying Yuan bound himself to the sacred tree, he wanted to kill himself.

290
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,540
I could not let it happen, so I stopped him.

291
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,720
This is what broke the Asura seal.

292
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,800
The Soul Ripping Sword appeared and was subdued by His Majesty because of his extraordinary immortal power.

293
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,120
Whether it's true or not, I'm sure you know, Marshal.

294
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,680
Only the son of Xuan Ye can practice the Eternal Darkness.

295
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,820
And the Soul Ripping Sword was Xuan Ye's sword.

296
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:22,660
Will it recognize and submit to anyone other than Xuan Ye's son as its new master?

297
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,570
 What a waste of your bloodline. 

298
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,560
 You actually chose to be with ordinary people. 

299
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,340
Regardless of his identity,

300
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,520
His Majesty played no part in the Asura Clan's brutal massacre.

301
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,400
During the War of Genesis, he placed righteousness above family and eliminated evil.

302
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,680
It is because of this contribution that His Supreme Majesty appointed Ying Yuan as Emperor Qingli.

303
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,210
Over the past millions of years, His Majesty has been guarding the world.

304
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:57,020
If it is true or not, you all have a heart and eyes, can't you see it clearly?

305
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,680
I trust His Majesty!

306
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,960
So what if he's Xuan Ye's son?

307
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,000
He hasn't done a single evil deed.

308
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,080
That's right. No one can choose their own bloodline.

309
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,400
I trust him as well.

310
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:29,230
I once thought I could teach him and make him the backbone of the Heaven Realm,

311
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,880
but I did not expect that he would be evil by nature.

312
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,020
In order to usurp the throne of the Heavenly Emperor, he actually tried to revive the Asura Clan.

313
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,760
He even colluded with the Devil Clan to kill immortals.

314
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,140
After they lost the War of Genesis, he had another plan.

315
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:50,040
Today, he made up such a ridiculous story to frame me.

316
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,340
You have such audacity because you knew

317
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,360
I have always treated you as my own

318
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,900
and I won't kill you, didn't you?

319
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:23,640
I have never forgotten your protection and care.

320
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,260
You taught me since I was a child that because I have a sinful ancestry,

321
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,140
I must atone for it with my life.

322
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,560
As soon as I could lift a sword, I went in war.

323
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,660
Ever since then,

324
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:40,020
the world is my responsibility and my wish.

325
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,220
For thousands of years, I have obeyed the heavenly rules and regulations.

326
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,820
The world is my priority, the rest isn't important.

327
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:01,720
Before I met Yan Dan, Ying Yuan never existed,

328
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,580
only the Emperor.

329
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,540
If I hadn't found solid evidence,

330
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:16,440
I wouldn't have believed that the heavenly emperor who taught me to protect the world

331
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,460
would have such a evil side to him!

332
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:24,120
Regardless of my identity and my bloodline,

333
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,530
the Nine Fins dragon scale and the Golden Cicada's Wings

334
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,800
are enough to prove that the Universe Enchantment existed.

335
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,500
Ying Yuan, you indeed have a silver tongue.  
 (T/N: silver tongue = persuasive speaker) 

336
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,700
But it doesn't change the fact that you slandered His Supreme Majesty.

337
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,420
You are good at disguising yourself indeed.

338
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,980
The Nine Fins Clan and the Three-Winged Raven Clan were both exterminated.

339
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,240
The evidence you have fabricated is completely absurd.

340
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,840
Fine. Since you're determined to be stubborn, I have no choice but to expose your true colors!

341
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,620
Tao Ziqi, is there anything else you want to add?

342
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,100
After my resurrection, I returned to the mortal world from the Night Forgetting River.

343
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,180
I discovered that...

344
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,500
Devil King Xuan Xiang was still alive.

345
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,700
What did you say? How can the Devil King still be alive?

346
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,860
It's a matter of the Three Realms. I dare not lie about it.

347
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,600
During the Divine-Devil War, the Devil King was seriously wounded.

348
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,640
So he hid in Zhucui Mountain in the Mortal Realm.

349
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,480
After I discovered it, I wanted to return to the Heaven Realm immediately to report it.

350
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,240
To my surprise, I saw Emperor Ying Yuan as well.

351
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,060
Under the guise of his trials in the mortal world,

352
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,660
Ying Yuan went through great trouble to locate the Devil King and helped him regain his power.

353
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,580
They have already joined forces a long time ago.

354
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,360
They may start... a second Divine-Devil War at any time.

355
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,920
Is the Devil King really still alive?

356
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,480
Where is he now?

357
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,420
I will lead my troops to kill him immediately!

358
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,360
I am afraid only His Majesty can answer you!

359
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,120
Your Majesty, I believe that you have nothing to do with the Devil Clan.

360
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,500
But what exactly is going on with the Devil King?

361
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,340
These two Devil Kings are different.

362
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,360
He wasn't the one who started the war.

363
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,140
But it was an elder of the Devil Clan, Shuo Hua, who use a Puppet Spell to replace him.

364
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,180
All you're doing is twisting the truth.

365
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,840
Officials, credible evidence requires two witnesses.

366
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,000
There is another witness who can vouch what Tao Ziqi's claims.

367
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,820
I'm the Soil Guardian from Zhucui Mountain.

368
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,620
I received the order to come here and see Your Supreme Majesty.

369
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,120
Soil Guardian, have you met these two before?

370
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,320
Yes.

371
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,480
They tried to steal the county annals of Zhucui mountain

372
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,460
and repeatedly asked me about the details of the Divine-Devil War and the Devil King.

373
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,200
When I didn't comply, they forced me to do it!

374
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,120
The night guards of the Pavilion of Books reported

375
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,340
that His Majesty had been visiting the Pavilion of Books late at night.

376
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:32,280
After His Majesty left, the precious historical records of the Divine-Devil War disappeared without a trace.

377
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,960
I can testify to that.

378
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,880
His Majesty has been either going in and out frequently or plotting with Yan Dan in the Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

379
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,600
I even saw them sleeping together.

380
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,740
Qing Yun, what are you talking about?!

381
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,260
Good for you, Ying Yuan.

382
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,060
You laid low for 900 years just to find the Devil King.

383
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:03,220
As soon as you returned, you were eager to destroy the evidence and pin the blame on His Supreme Majesty.

384
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,880
The Asura Clan indeed cannot be trusted.

385
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,340
Kill him! Avenge our fellow immortals!

386
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,540
Emperor Ying Yuan, a remnant of the Asura Clan,

387
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,860
was taken in by the Heaven Realm and entrusted with an important duty.

388
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,900
Shamefully, he refused to get rid of his evil ambitions.

389
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,660
He colluded with the Devil Clan, caused a war, and killed his fellow immortals.

390
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,800
He disregards the safety of the world for his own selfish desires.

391
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,560
The Nine Heavens will no longer tolerate him.

392
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,280
I decree that Ying Yuan is to be escorted to the Heavenly Gallows

393
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,220
for the Blades of Grievance Punishment!

394
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,820
You mustn't!

395
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,460
The matter has not been fully investigated!

396
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,100
You cannot convict him so hastily!

397
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,620
I have worked with His Majesty for many years.

398
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,920
No matter what they say!

399
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,540
I don't believe that he would kill his fellow immortals!

400
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:05,620
Huo De, Yue Yao, the evidence is in front of you, yet you defended the traitor several times.

401
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,460
Are you two his accomplices?

402
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,480
- I—
  - Enough!

403
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,940
Given that you have been deceived by him for years, you shall be removed from your duties.

404
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,420
Go back and reflect upon yourselves.

405
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,600
If anyone else wants to intercede for Ying Yuan,

406
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,200
you can join him on the Heavenly Gallows

407
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,800
for the Blades of Grievance Punishment!

408
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,980
You are determined to convict me on false charges.

409
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,640
Today, I have to get the truth!

410
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,900
Ying Yuan!

411
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,480
Stop!

412
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,660
Don't worry about me. Test him with the dragon scale!

413
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,000
Ying Yuan, don't worry about me!

414
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,620
We Lotuses are not that fragile!

415
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,260
I heard that vengeful spirits from the Nine Abysses transforming into blades

416
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,660
can cut through immortals' bones, slice immortals' flesh, and kill emperors!

417
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,340
You can't take this punishment. Go now!

418
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,860
I cannot let them hurt you.

419
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,200
Ying Yuan, I have deployed 100,000 heavenly soldiers outside Lingxiao Hall.

420
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,720
You have nowhere to run, just surrender.

421
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,680
If you still won't repent and try to slaughter immortals,

422
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,300
I will execute your loved one right now as punishment for your heinous crimes.

423
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,820
Don't worry about me! Go!

424
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,080
Don't worry.

425
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,040
I assure you we will be fine.

426
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:22,970
