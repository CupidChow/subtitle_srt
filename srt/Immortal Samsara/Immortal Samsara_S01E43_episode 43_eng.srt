 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,600
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,900
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,200
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,400
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,200
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,200
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:01:02,500
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths   ♫

10
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,000
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,400
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,400
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,000
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
   

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
   

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,800
Enjoy.

17
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,400
Eat more.

18
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,600
Miss Yan, it's such a waste of your acting talent to not be a con artist.

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,500
This was only 30% of my talent today.

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
In the future, I'll show you what I've really got.

21
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,600
Everyone, eat more.

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,400
If there's not enough food, I'll talk to the chef and have them make more dishes.

23
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,800
Thank you for your kindness.

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,200
But we don't have much money on us as it is.

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't worry that. All you need to worry about is enjoying the food.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,500
Yu Mo is a righteous man.

27
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,700
If Tang Zhou knew you were taking such good care of his fellow seniors and juniors,

28
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,800
he would definitely be grateful to you.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,600
Your friends are my friends too.

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,500
Enjoy the food. I'll get you another soup dish.

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
What was with that cat demon just now?

32
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,000
Master Xie has a beloved daughter.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
Who would have thought that a cat demon would start eyeing her?

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,000
So it keeps going to their house and causing trouble, trying to force Miss Xie to marry him.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,700
Master Xie had no choice but to ask us to capture the demon.

36
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,200
Actually, we already set up the demon-catching array.

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,000
If someone didn't act rashly, but followed the plan instead,

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,700
how would the cat demon have known about it and escaped?

39
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,000
Plan?

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
What plan?

41
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,800
I always prefer to make it quick when it comes to capturing demons.

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,100
I'm not used to people making comments from the sidelines.

43
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,600
That cat demon is quite capable.

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,800
We can only capture it if we work together.

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
But you're always working on your own.

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,400
This is just great! Now Lingxiao Sect's reputation is probably going to get worse from this!

47
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,000
- Who's working on their own?! 
 - You...

48
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,030
Tang Zhou.

49
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,200
Senior Brother Tang.

50
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,300
Senior Brother Tang. You're just in time.

51
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,900
Help us to capture a demon.

52
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,800
If we can't capture that cat demon, Lingxiao Sect's... reputation is going to be ruined.

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,200
Senior Brother Tang, you're resourceful.

54
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,800
And now, you are the only one who can help us.

55
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,100
You see him as a senior brother, but has he ever taken you as a junior sister?

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,600
He chose love over the sect and abandoned the sect.

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,800
Our Lingxiao Sect doesn't need his help.

58
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,500
Eldest Senior is right.

59
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,400
Tang Zhou is ungrateful and unkind, our Lingxiao Sect would rather be ruined than receive his help.

60
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,700
I'm afraid I can't help you with capturing the demon.

61
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,500
Senior Brother Tang!

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,000
Our paths are different, we shouldn't work together.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,500
The one who captures the demon first will be in charge of Lingxiao Sect.

64
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,800
Someone says he doesn't care, but deep in his heart, he still misses and loves his seniors and juniors.

65
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,600
What I said is right, isn't it?

66
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,600
There's no need to talk me into it.

67
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,400
I no longer have anything to do with the Lingxiao Sect.

68
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,300
You're great in all other aspects, but you're stubborn.

69
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,100
If you really had let it go, you wouldn't be staring at this sword blankly.

70
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,200
Now that the Lingxiao Sect has no leader,

71
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,000
Qin Qi and Dao Yuan are leading their own people and don't think much of each other.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,300
Right now the sect is struggling to survive to the point where they can't even feed themselves.

73
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,300
In my opinion, if this continues, my guess is they would have to sell the house and land.

74
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,800
The Lingxiao Sect is your master's home.

75
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
It used to be your home too.

76
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Can you stand to see it turn into this?

77
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,200
I know you blame yourself.

78
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,700
You think your departure is the reason the sect ended up like this.

79
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
But this is not the time to blame yourself.

80
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,300
This is the time you have to face it and help the whole sect get through it.

81
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,400
Anyway, I already promised that old man that we would capture the cat demon in three days.

82
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll leave it to you to decide.

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,800
Do you want to see the sect that you were once proud of fall to the ground and be mocked by others?

84
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,200
I've lost my entire cultivation base already.

85
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,600
I'll only embarrass the Lingxiao Sect now.

86
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I understand your struggles.

87
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,400
If you want, I can teach you Heavenly techniques,

88
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,700
so you can practice faster and help the sect get through this.

89
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,500
- Amazing! 
 - Great!

90
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,100
Amazing!

91
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,380
 - Great! 
 - Great! 

92
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,580
 - Great! 
 - Bravo. 

93
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,000
Another one!

94
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,900
 Great! 

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,800
- Thank you! 
 - Well done.

96
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,300
- Thank you! 
 - Nice.

97
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,800
- Thank you! 
 - Great.

98
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,000
- Move aside. 
 - What are you doing?

99
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,300
That's too much.

100
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,900
- What are you trying to do? 
 - What am I trying to do?

101
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,400
This is my territory.

102
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Since you are in my territory, shouldn't you pay a fee?

103
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,000
This is a public space.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,200
You're acting like a bully, I'm afraid the answer is no.

105
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,000
This girl is feisty!

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,900
I like her!

107
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,800
Good one, little girl.

108
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,000
Let's call it a day today. I'll get back at you some other day!

109
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,500
 That should teach him a lesson. 

110
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,800
It was Senior Brother Tang.

111
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,700
He might have lost his cultivation base,

112
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,100
but judging by the strength of this sword, it couldn't have been anyone else.

113
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,700
   

114
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,800
When I beat you, no one will say my Lingxiao Sect is incompetent again.

115
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,600
That's all the skill you have and you think you can hurt me?

116
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,000
I'd like to taste the genuine primordial pill of a Taoist.

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you're willing to kneel and bow to me three times right now, I might consider leaving your entire body intact.

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
The disciples of Lingxiao Sect will never succumb to evil.

119
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,200
With righteousness in mind, we are not afraid of death!

120
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,200
This is a matter concerning our sect. Why are you, an outsider, here?

121
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,600
Do you have a death wish?

122
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,700
Just go. Leave me be.

123
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,400
No matter who I am, I can't stand by and watch evil happen.

124
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,500
There's no reason behind it. I'm just here to fight evil.

125
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,900
You have no cultivation base at all.

126
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,800
You're not a Taoist master.

127
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,000
You really do have a death wish.

128
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,800
Great.

129
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,000
Then both of your primordial pills are mine!

130
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,800
 Go and tell Master Xie to dress his daughter in a wedding dress and to wait for me in her room! 

131
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
 I'll go and marry her tomorrow at noon! 

132
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,100
Senior Brother Tang, how did you two get hurt?

133
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,700
We went to capture the cat demon.

134
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,400
But it got away again.

135
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,300
The cat demon is very strong. I'm afraid it'll be a hard to go up against.

136
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,600
I knew you wouldn't ignore us.

137
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,200
Eldest Senior Brother was hurt by the cat demon, but his cultivation base is protecting him.

138
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,600
He'll recover after a few days of rest.

139
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,800
Senior Brother Tang, you've lost your cultivation base.

140
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,800
If you force yourself to capture the demon, you might hurt yourself.

141
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,000
Have a seat. I'll get you some medicine.

142
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,600
I'm fine. These are just flesh wounds.

143
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,100
But...

144
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,200
What I said was wrong.

145
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,300
I shouldn't have gone against you.

146
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,700
You saved my life today.

147
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,700
Let's just end the feud between you and the Lingxiao Sect.

148
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,600
Let bygones be bygones.

149
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,400
Cang Hong is your master.

150
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,300
You must be upset about what happened.

151
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,400
I understand.

152
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,000
You usually are a bit aggressive when it comes to cultivating.

153
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,500
But when you were out there capturing the demon, you made the Lingxiao Sect proud.

154
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,400
I know. You are following the right path in your heart.

155
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't want to bring any disgrace to the sect,

156
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,300
but... it seems unavoidable now.

157
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,600
Master Xie was right. I'm not qualified to be a demon catcher with my current abilities.

158
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,900
I can't be of any help and instead bring trouble.

159
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,100
Perhaps I really should just quit.

160
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,100
You two still don't get it?

161
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,400
Your ability isn't the reason you can't capture the demon.

162
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,300
Each of you excels in different ways, you can't succeed without the others.

163
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,200
But you all act on your own and compete with each other.

164
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,000
How can you achieve a goal by doing so?

165
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,800
Eldest Senior Brother is the one acting on his own here.

166
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,600
He chased us all out of the sect.

167
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm acting on my own?

168
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
Last time, when we were capturing the tiger demon,

169
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,000
you didn't take my advice and insisted one capturing it in private.

170
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The client was injured because of this.

171
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If that continues, we'll have to spend all the money in the sect to compensate them.

172
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,900
If we were to ignore it, the tiger demon would've eaten everyone in the town in a single night.

173
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,200
I had already set up a magical array in the mountain.

174
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,900
With your tools, we could have captured it without hurting anyone or anything.

175
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,000
Then why didn't you tell us earlier?!

176
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,800
- You didn't ask. 
 - You...

177
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,100
Isn't it all clear now?

178
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,100
Why didn't you tell each other your thoughts?

179
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,800
Obviously, you need each other.

180
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,700
You... are still inexperienced, so you'll need Eldest Senior Brother's help when setting up the array.

181
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,700
And you are bad at using tools. so naturally there would be some mistakes when you capture demons.

182
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,500
If this continues, it can only ruin the Lingxiao Sect's reputation.

183
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,800
If this sect's reputation continues to decline, you're still not willing to compromise?

184
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,200
- I'll compromise if he does. 
 - I'll compromise if she does.

185
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,800
 Stop repeating what I say! 

186
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,800
Well, you two are in sync. Aren't you?

187
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,600
Forget it. Forget it.

188
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,100
For the sake of Senior Brother Tang, if you stop acting on your own all the time,

189
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,900
I'm willing to work with you to manage the disciples and do my best to cooperate with you.

190
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,800
If you promise to not act recklessly, I'll tell you the plan

191
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,700
out of respect for Tang Zhou.

192
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,500
Once part of a sect,

193
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,500
then we're always a family.

194
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,400
Both of you work together.

195
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,000
In the future,

196
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I believe the Lingxiao Sect will regain its fame again.

197
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,600
All the disciples admire you the most.

198
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,500
I used to be jealous in the past.

199
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:44,300
But when you stepped up to help, that's when I knew why they treated you like that.

200
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,800
You are the most capable demon catcher and you were Martial Uncle Tang Jiang's favorite.

201
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,600
This jade calabash

202
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,000
should be yours.

203
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,800
You can always get your cultivation base back,

204
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,000
but the respect of people and their love is the hardest to obtain.

205
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,800
Come back.

206
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,700
Exactly, Senior Brother.

207
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,800
If you return, all of us will work as one.

208
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,900
Come back and lead the Lingxiao Sect.

209
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,800
The cat demon is going to marry Miss Xie tomorrow at noon.

210
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm heading back to think of ways to capture it.

211
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,000
This...

212
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,600
I just happened to pass by. Passing by.

213
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
I accidentally overheard your conversation.

214
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,800
Sounds like you three have reconciled. Congratulations!

215
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,600
Congratulations, everyone.

216
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Since you're here, let's use your smart little brain to come up with a solution then.

217
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,300
I do have a perfect plan in mind.

218
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,600
But someone might need to sacrifice a little.

219
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,800
Miss, you've finally come around and are willing to marry me.

220
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,900
How dare you fool me!

221
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,600
The cat demon has been taken care of. Come on in.

222
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,999
Now that we've subdued the cat demon, the Xie family can be at peace from now on.

223
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:50,600
Miss Xie doesn't need to be worried anymore.

224
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,500
Now you should believe the power of the Lingxiao Sect, right?

225
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,400
Before, I was distraught and used some harsh language.

226
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,100
I'm sorry.

227
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,800
I hope you all won't take it personally.

228
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,100
Today, finally I get to see how each of the Taoist Masters from the Lingxiao Sect is courageous and smart.

229
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,600
You really do live up to the name.

230
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,800
Really.

231
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,319
Where did you get the rouge? It's so hard to remove.

232
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,600
Look at your red lips.

233
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,900
It's quite cute.

234
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,939
I think you're as pretty as Sister Tao.

235
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,899
Really, you're like a fairy.

236
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,619
What's the rush in getting changed?

237
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:37,619
I want Yu Mo to get a good look at you.

238
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:40,440
It was all your idea, wasn't it?

239
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,659
It was because you wanted to protect your junior sister.

240
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,399
You were afraid the power of the cat demon was too strong, and it might hurt her.

241
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:52,400
If I didn't lose all my cultivation base for you, such demons would be no threat to me.

242
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,000
Done. It's not like you haven't given me trouble in the past.

243
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,499
This is karma.

244
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:04,239
You tortured me quite a bit in the past. I still remember it.

245
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:08,020
I'm going to record your experience today in "A Mortal's Life".

246
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,440
The demon catcher, Tang Zhou, the once mighty Taoist Master was bullied by a cat. What do you think?

247
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,020
Sounds good.

248
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,240
What are you doing?

249
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,000
Let's relive the moment when you were the main character.

250
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,579
You vile man! Why did you put me in the gourd again?

251
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:37,759
Who told you to make fun of me?

252
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,459
Then why are you in here too?

253
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:42,920
I wouldn't let you leave even if it meant my downfall.

254
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,779
Stop the nonsense. Hurry up and open it.

255
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,479
I can't. I'm in here too.

256
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:51,400
I can't open it.

257
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,460
You really are such a vile person.

258
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,160
How did the gourd turn into this?

259
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,699
I've been in here so many times.

260
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:10,280
I've never seen a view like this before.

261
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,120
Wait, didn't you lose your cultivation base?

262
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
This is my tool.

263
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,720
Of course, it'll obey my orders.

264
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,690
So you've been training inside your room every day lately. How is it going?

265
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,640
The Heavenly techniques that I taught you were great, right?

266
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,990
Seeing that you've pulled yourself together now, that's the Taoist Master Tang that I used to know.

267
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:42,640
♫   Heaven is tedious, let's go to the mortal world to experience all kinds of emotions   ♫

268
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,380
♫   We should learn to be a fish that swims around the world   ♫

269
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,329
♫   Joy and sorrow can easily be forgotten instantly   ♫

270
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,859
♫   when the dust washes over   ♫

271
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:03,860
♫   I have experienced the intertwined threads of love like a brocade   ♫

272
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:10,420
♫   I'm still engrossed in the moment of flowers blooming   ♫

273
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:18,320
♫   Sometimes I'm just overwhelmed with sadness   ♫

274
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,979
♫   At times, the tenderness eases my heart   ♫

275
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:29,620
♫   Unexpectedly, I can't help but share what I thought was off-limits   ♫

276
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:39,999
♫   I blame time for the mortal world's woe is on your shoulder   ♫

277
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:46,999
♫   Like the surging tides of stars, I continuously ask where the origin of love comes from   ♫

278
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:54,289
♫   I'm afraid the tears brimming in the corner of my eyes will fall and blur your silhouette   ♫

279
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:57,910
♫   In my momentary childishness,   ♫

280
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:04,820
♫   I now understand that all living things wither away   ♫

281
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:13,949
♫   Counting the passing of the seasons, no matter which directions, everything moves towards you   ♫

282
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:20,759
♫   The beauty is in the burning agarwood incense, there's still hope when the ashes settled   ♫

283
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:28,289
♫   Hear the beautiful prose with a fine beauty and a picturesque view, they pair well together   ♫

284
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,799
♫   Sew two hearts together and a stem sprouts forth   ♫

285
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:38,960
♫   Understand the wind, think about the rain, and do not awaken from the dream   ♫

286
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:49,660
♫   Just let me linger all day and night   ♫

287
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,300
It's been a while since I felt this happy.

288
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,820
It seems like not being able to get out isn't a bad thing after all.

289
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,540
If we were stuck here forever, how are we going to look for the divine tool?

290
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,920
How are we going to repair the scar on your chest?

291
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,140
That doesn't matter anymore.

292
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,820
 Yan Dan, remember. 

293
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,960
 He's Emperor Ying Yuan, not Tang Zhou. 

294
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,680
 He's only going through the trials and has to go back to the Nine Heavens eventually. 

295
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,160
Yu Mo?

296
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,099
Look what you've done.

297
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,379
Luckily, we fell into Yu Mo's room.

298
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:46,379
If we fell into some girl's bathtub, how would you have explained that?

299
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,400
Did the wound crack because of the cold?

300
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,240
It's fine.

301
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,040
But... how did the two of you get trapped in the gourd?

302
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,580
All thanks to vile Tang Zhou.

303
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,399
I was kind enough to help him capture the cat demon, but instead of being thankful, he did this.

304
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:12,730
I was trapped in the jade gourd for a whole day.

305
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,980
Nonsense.

306
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,739
You were having fun in there, weren't you?

307
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,139
Besides, it was you who teased me first.

308
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:25,620
Why are you playing the victim now?

309
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,359
It was because you trapped me in there.

310
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:30,899
I was left with no choice... all I could do was accept the fact.

311
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,420
That's the only way to make it more comfortable.

312
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,080
Well, I have nothing to say.

313
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,319
You like to talk tough, but I bet you can't let it go.

314
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,540
I know you too well.

315
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,960
Qin Qi and the others are going back tomorrow.

316
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,480
Are you sure you don't want to go with them?

317
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,720
I thought leaving was the best option I had.

318
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,700
But I never thought... it would turn out like this.

319
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,820
In the past, I also didn't understand what responsible and righteous people were thinking about.

320
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,120
But I get it now.

321
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,360
It turns out if you let go of your responsibilities recklessly, you could end up hurting a lot of people.

322
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,420
My eldest senior brother and my junior sister already reconciled.

323
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,859
Lingxiao Sect will get better.

324
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,580
What about you?

325
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,120
Everyone in your sect is waiting for you to go back.

326
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,880
I already chose to leave,

327
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,480
so I won't go back.

328
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,040
You can't fool me.

329
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,939
I know deep down that you are still worried about them.

330
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:14,340
Before, in order to save me and because the sect leader deceived you, you left in anger.

331
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,779
But the original intention of the Lingxiao Sect is good.

332
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:19,579
Punish evil and spread kindness, eliminate chaos and bring in the good.

333
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:22,640
Isn't that what you've always wanted?

334
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,179
Stop worrying. Here's a glass of As You Wish wine.

335
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:33,560
Drink it and you'll know what you really want.

336
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,180
I don't want you to regret your actions just because of a moment of impulsiveness.

337
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,500
If you still care about your sect, then you should go back.

338
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:05,909
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

339
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:12,109
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

340
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:19,959
♫   As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable  ♫

341
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:27,000
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

342
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:33,320
I have already forgiven you, Ying Yuan.

343
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,800
 Be it in the Heavenly Realm or the Mortal Realm, the knot in Yan Dan's heart was caused by Ying Yuan. 

344
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,160
 And now, it's untied because of Tang Zhou. 

345
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,060
 It had nothing to do with me from the very beginning. 

346
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:09,300
The mortals like to wear phoenix crowns and red dresses to their weddings.

347
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,520
As for the Devil Clan, it has always been black.

348
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,580
It's more formal.

349
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,459
This Moon in the Mirror Lake is beautiful.

350
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,719
I've never seen such a view, not even in the Nine Heavens.

351
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:30,640
No matter how beautiful the view is, it is nothing compared to the person in front of me.

352
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,140
The destruction of the Devil Clan is related to me.

353
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,340
Are you sure... you want to make me your wife?

354
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,580
Let bygones be bygones.

355
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,040
Only care about who's in front of you.

356
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,000
From today onward,

357
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,620
I'm only the husband of Tao Ziqi.

358
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:59,860
Be it the Devil Clan, or the title of Devil King, they have nothing to do with me.

359
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,920
Growing old with the person I love

360
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,380
is what I've always wanted in this life.

361
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,320
There are only the two of us here today.

362
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,280
Do you think this wedding ceremony is too simple?

363
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,860
We might not have friends or families to cheer for us,

364
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,420
but having you by my side... is more than enough.

365
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,500
There was a time when we all wanted to bring peace to the Three Realms.

366
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:41,240
Now that destiny is set, and the universe is at peace, I will always be by your side.

367
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:48,220
We'll travel everywhere and witness the beautiful scenery of this peaceful and prosperous age.

368
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,640
With heaven and earth plus the stars and moon as witnesses, starting today,

369
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,080
Liu Weiyang and Tao Ziqi are husband and wife.

370
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,380
We'll grow old together...

371
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,440
and never leave each other.

372
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,560
The seasons might change, and the stars shall shift,

373
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,860
we will hold onto each other, hand in hand,

374
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,600
until our hair turns white.

375
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,740
 Yan Dan? 

376
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:12,660
 It would be great if time could stay forever at this moment. 

377
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:18,130
 All the days I spend with you are the best ones in my life. 

378
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,520
 Yan Dan. You must stay safe, always. 

379
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,560
 Actually, I had already made up my mind when I was in the Moon in the Mirror Lake. 

380
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,340
 You are... the only one in my heart. 

381
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,980
Tang Zhou.

382
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,380
You're awake.

383
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,280
Qin Qi and the others have already packed up their things.

384
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,420
They're ready to head back to the Lingxiao Sect.

385
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,300
Miss Yan, thank you for your hospitality the past few days.

386
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,520
But the disciples of the Lingxiao Sect are not freeloaders.

387
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,320
You don't have to be so polite with me.

388
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,700
You took care of me before as well when I was in the mountain.

389
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,320
Keep it.

390
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,380
Senior Brother Tang, are you sure you don't want to go back with us?

391
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,120
The Lingxiao Sect has your eldest senior brother.

392
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,920
I have nothing to worry about.

393
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,580
Right now,

394
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,660
I have something more important to do.

395
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,160
There are also people that I want to protect.

396
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,780
We all support your decision.

397
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,080
I... I bought all of you some snacks.

398
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,419
You can have them on the way back.

399
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:48,840
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

400
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,179
Be careful.

401
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,600
I'll come to visit you when I have the chance.

402
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,480
I'll bring Tang Zhou with me.

403
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,040
All right.

404
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,860
When the time comes, I'll definitely spoil you with great meals.

405
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,420
Farewell.

406
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:40,000
