 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,600
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,800
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,200
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,400
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,200
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,200
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:01:02,600
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,000
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,400
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,400
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,700
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
   

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
   

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,200
Young Master Tang.

17
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,500
I'm sure you're exhausted from your travels.

18
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,600
I made some tea for you.

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
You may sit and take a break first.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
No need.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,600
I have a mission to finish, so I won't trouble you, Side Consort.

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,800
 The Side Consort is offering you tea. 

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,400
 You'll be disrespecting her if you don't accept it. 

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,300
 You should act casually so that we can get some intel out of her. 

25
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,300
Stop messing around.

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,200
Young Master Tang, there is no need to be anxious.

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,800
Please enjoy your tea.

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,600
I will tell you about the situation within the palace.

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,200
Thank you, Side Consort.

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,600
By the way, Side Consort, who wields the divine tools for cultivation in the palace?

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,000
His Majesty loves the art of cultivation.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,600
He got to know me during his journey.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,000
He forced me to become his side consort.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Since then, he made me create some divine tools, charms, and talismans for his cultivation.

35
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,400
Young Master, the cleansing talisman you saw was one of them.

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,000
However, as to why His Majesty needed them, and what he uses them for...

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,000
I have no idea.

38
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,600
This Pei Luo may seem devoted to Jiang Chen on the surface.

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Behind the scenes, he forces other maidens to be his concubines.

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,700
Looks like we were right about him. He was just pretending.

41
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,400
There is surely more to it than meets the eye.

42
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,800
If so, may I have a look at the cleansing talisman he used?

43
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
Both of us are cultivators.

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,000
We should help each other out.

45
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,200
I smell alcohol.

46
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,400
This item needs to be replaced every day.

47
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,000
This talisman was just replaced.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,700
If it reeks of alcohol...

49
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,000
Then it must have been kept within the wine cellar.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you for clearing up my confusion.

51
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
I shall take my leave for now.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,700
It does not matter.

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,200
Your Majesty...

54
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,800
Yan Dan...

55
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,200
We have plenty of time.

56
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,300
Your Majesty.

57
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,000
Your Majesty, what is that ornament you are wearing?

58
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,000
This?

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,400
The demon catcher who came to exorcise the palace before

60
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,600
gave me this Millennium Peach Wood as he was afraid that there might still be other demons around.

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,800
It can ward off evil and protect me.

62
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,400
Millennium Peach Wood is great for warding off evil.

63
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
But it has a fierce nature to it.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It is hard to adjust to.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,300
If it encounters a clashing object... it will backfire on you.

66
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,000
Your Majesty, why don't you let me take a look?

67
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Taoist Master, you do not need to worry about that.

68
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I have mixed it with tortoiseshell, qilin's horn, and the soil of Huan, to boost its power.

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,600
I am making the best use of it.

70
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,800
 These are very specific materials. 

71
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,200
 Only cultivators would be familiar with them. 

72
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,800
 There's no way for him to be so familiar with such materials... 

73
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,600
 unless he's a cultivator himself. 

74
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,100
Your Majesty.

75
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,400
A Taoist Master visited the Side Consort's palace today.

76
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,000
I have some state affairs to attend to.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,100
Taoist Master, please enjoy your drink.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Your Majesty, please take your time.

79
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,500
 All the other candlesticks have wax on them. 

80
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,400
 Why is this candlestick so clean? 

81
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,200
 Could it be... that it is not used to light lamps? 

82
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,400
 I can detect divine power here. 

83
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,700
 This must be where Pei Luo practices his arts. 

84
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,800
 It's a shame that the demon-subduing talisman is here. 

85
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,600
 Only Tang Zhou can get rid of it. 

86
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,800
 Lucky man. 

87
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,500
 This liquor not only smells like plants and grains, but it also has a faint smell of blood 

88
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,300
I sent out the signal right before I entered the palace.

89
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,200
You came pretty quickly.

90
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,200
I was worried that your mediocre power might drag Yan Dan and me down.

91
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,000
 Hurry, come look! 

92
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,800
 They're the women who went missing before! 

93
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,400
All these women... died from their throats being cut.

94
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,300
Looks like their deaths were not caused by evil demons... but by humans.

95
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,800
No wonder that brat ran so fast.

96
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,500
Do not worry. I've already attached a tracking talisman to him.

97
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,500
 Then we should go after him! 

98
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,000
Over here!

99
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,700
The tracking talisman was destroyed.

100
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,600
Looks like he has found out.

101
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,800
 Guards! There's an assassin here! 

102
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,100
There was an assassin! The assassin ran that way!

103
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,800
Go after him!

104
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,400
Your Majesty, there is no need to worry.

105
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,800
The tracking talisman is filled with phosphorus powder.

106
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,300
Once the lights go out and the phosphorus powder shines... his tracks will be revealed.

107
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,580
You really were training in secret.

108
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,900
How dare you trick me!

109
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,000
As a human, you have caused much more terror than demons.

110
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,940
And you even dare to protect yourself with Millennium Peach Wood!

111
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,020
How ironic.

112
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,840
Even the King of All Demons still requires the help of a mere mortal. Just you wait.

113
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,120
Stop talking. Hurry and get to it.

114
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,920
Thanks.

115
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,360
Sacrificial blood marks?

116
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,900
All arts that require blood are evil.

117
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,160
You killed your people to satisfy your selfish desires.

118
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,520
You have no right to rule over the people.

119
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,000
If I'm around, it doesn't matter what happens to the world!

120
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,340
This world would not exist without me!

121
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,620
 For your own selfish desires, you slaughtered innocent beings and framed your beloved! 

122
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,400
 Now you even want to blame this on us demons? 

123
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,060
As Taoist Masters, you actually have a demon as your partner?

124
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,520
- How dare you criticize me when you yourselves are hypocrites!
 - Excuse me.

125
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,220
You're the one who started all this.

126
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,460
Don't act as if you're innocent, when you were the one who changed her to her real form.

127
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,080
What does that flower have to do with me?

128
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,000
Talk is useless!

129
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,020
Looks like you'll be adding more sacrificial blood marks to my body!

130
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,340
My Pill of Immortality will be completed soon!

131
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,240
You won't be able to stop me!

132
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,660
Tang Zhou, does your Distance Keeping Lock work on flowers, too?

133
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,040
Since it's my spell, I can summon you irrespective of your form.

134
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,100
What are you up to?

135
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,000
I have an idea!

136
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,340
Yan Dan! Run!

137
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,680
One step!

138
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,080
Yan Dan?

139
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,860
Who told you to be so reckless?

140
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,360
I should've locked you in the jade calabash!

141
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,320
 Losing some petals does not matter, as long as I get to avenge Jiang Chen. 

142
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,560
You concocted the elixir with blood and a huge amount of yin energy.

143
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,880
Your inner organs are burning up.

144
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,850
You shifted the blame for the bloody river, the crow phenomenon, and murders on Jiang Chen.

145
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,580
How dare you say you love her?

146
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,640
Do you even understand the meaning of love?

147
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,560
It was her!

148
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,600
She was the one who let me down first!

149
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,350
 Consort Jiang Chen hasn't appeared in a long time. 

150
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,900
 Your Majesty has only just recovered from a serious illness too. 

151
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,870
 All the parties are getting restless. 

152
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,360
 We are very worried about the situation. 

153
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,000
 Your Majesty, please get a new concubine as soon as possible. 

154
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,220
 Have descendants to win the people's hearts. 

155
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,030
 I already made a promise to Consort Jiang Chen to spend our lives together, and take no others. 

156
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,330
 It's impossible for me to get a new concubine. 

157
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,680
 Moreover, I recovered a long time ago. 

158
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,220
 Do not try to persuade me again. 

159
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,060
 Your Majesty. 

160
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,500
 Your Majesty? 

161
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,780
 - Are you suffering a relapse? Hurry! Summon the physician! 
 - Yes, Sir! 

162
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,460
 Your Majesty! 

163
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:58,660
 Pei Luo, the physician said you were anxious. So there was phlegm in your throat. 

164
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,080
 You already recovered from your illness a long time ago. 

165
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,060
 There is no need to worry. 

166
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,980
 Even after I recovered, I am no different from ordinary people. 

167
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,840
 I am the ruler of the world. 

168
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,860
 I need to live hundreds of years, have the lifespan of an immortal. 

169
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,160
 Why are you still obsessed with longevity? 

170
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,320
 I was once plagued by an illness before. 

171
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,000
 And I was almost separated from you forever. 

172
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,920
 How could I not be afraid? 

173
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,340
 If I can't live forever, 

174
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,940
 I'll still have to offer my position to someone else when I lose the people's hearts. 

175
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,700
 I wasn't willing to take another concubine, even though I was pressured by my subjects, 

176
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,810
 because you and I promised to spend our lives together forever. 

177
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:08,390
 How can we fulfill that promise if you don't help me to achieve immortality? 

178
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,940
 Jiang Chen, give me another divine pill. 

179
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,200
 Back then, you were on the verge of death. 

180
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,260
 You only wanted to live for a few more days. 

181
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,380
 Thus, I helped you recover your health. 

182
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,620
 Now, you can grow old peacefully. 

183
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,380
 Why are you still so discontented? 

184
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,440
 You're a demon. 

185
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,180
 You can live for millennia! 

186
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,740
 Although I have recovered from my illness, I can only live for several decades. 

187
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,960
 It's easy for you to help me attain immortality. 

188
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,320
 Why are you being so selfish? 

189
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,540
 Why won't you help me? 

190
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,540
 You are making something out of nothing. 

191
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,220
 How am I supposed to help you? 

192
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,320
 Pei Luo, why have you become so greedy? 

193
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,740
 Do you still remember the past us, and our wishes? 

194
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,780
 I definitely do! 

195
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,940
 But do you know how much pressure I'm under to keep our promise? 

196
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,360
 I have ignored all of their requests to select another concubine! 

197
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,300
 Have you ever considered my feelings? 

198
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,060
 Jiang Chen. 

199
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,200
 I'm not the one who changed. 

200
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,620
 You're the one who has changed! 

201
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,120
 If taking a side consort and producing an offspring can stabilize your position... 

202
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,220
 then go ahead.

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,060

212
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,020
 This troupe is terrible. 

213
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,580
 They are far inferior to you. 

214
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:52,400
 Why don't you perform on the stage and entertain us, Consort? 

215
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,100
 Your Majesty, I cannot assist you. I do not deserve to be your consort. 

216
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,880
 I will confine myself to my palace. 

217
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,500
 I will not venture even half a step out of my palace. 

218
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:10,540

♪  Our deep love, embedded within spring  ♪

220

 Jiang Chen, you were the one who broke our promise first. 

221
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,700
 Don't regret this in the future. 

222
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,540
 Even if I were to die in the palace, I will never regret it. 

223
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:56,220
 It appears your royal ambition will never be satisfied. 

224
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,280
 She revealed her real form as a demon to save your position. 

225
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,800
Her demonic power was lost saving you from the evil produced by refining elixir through murder!

226
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,980
Everything she did was for you!

227
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,060
How did she let you down?

228
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:28,580
She said she loved me. Yet she refused to help me become immortal, so we could be together forever.

229
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,580
That means she didn't love me enough!

230
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,260
If she had done it for me,

231
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,880
why would I have needed to practice such a devilish art, and have her take the blame?

232
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,380
You were the one too obsessed with immortality.

233
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,020
She didn't hide anything from you.

234
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,040
There is no way to attain immortality.

235
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,440
The elixir you made through murder didn't help you survive.

236
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,700
It was because Jiang Chen found a divine tool for you.

237
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,200
That's how you were able to stay alive.

238
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
But you didn't know what was good for you.

239
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,620
You didn't know how to be grateful. You only knew greed.

240
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:03,360
This divine tool was a calamity to both you and her.

241
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,460
What I feared came true today.

242
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,900
You...

243
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,680
What do you mean?

244
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,260
For your sake, Jiang Chen borrowed an extra twenty years from me.

245
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,700
She hoped you would be happy for the next twenty years.

246
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,360
Now her hope has been destroyed, and she has perished.

247
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,120
It is time to retrieve my divine tool.

248
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,380
 Is that your Extraordinary Eye? 

249
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,160
 That is not ordinary demon essence. 

250
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,260
 Who exactly is he? 

251
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,160
Your hands were already soaked with blood.

252
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,080
You will be punished by the heavens.

253
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,980
Jiang Chen! I'm sure Jiang Chen has a way!

254
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,280
The elixir! The elixir must be inside the box!

255
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,260
The elixir must be inside the box!

256
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,540
All of you can surely open it!

257
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,760
 The Heart Locking Vine is a spell invented by the Flower Spirit Clan. 

258
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,300
 It's formed by an obsession. 

259
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,780
 You can only open it after you let go of your obsession. 

260
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,140
 Since Jiang Chen became a vengeful demon because of you, 

261
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,460
 you are the only person who can open the box. 

262
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,660
 All Jiang Chen ever wanted was a single tear drop from her beloved. 

263
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,600
Jiang Chen...

264
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,720
   

265
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,560
 Pei Luo. 

266
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:38,150
   

267
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,900
 Choosing a consort is an important matter. 

268
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,500
 You and I are already included in history that will be passed down for generations. 

269
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,620
 Why are we still imitating the common people and writing a marriage certificate? 

270
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,040
 I do not care about making my name known throughout history. 

271
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,560
 A marriage certificate is the only thing I want. 

272
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:06,820
 Once we write our names together on it, it proves that we will be together forever. 

273
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,980
 I have to keep it safe, just in case you go back on your word someday. 

274
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,220
 I cured your illness and fulfilled your wish for you. 

275
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,200
 Even so, I didn't expect my actions to shackle you once again. 

276
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,440
 From start to finish, I only hoped that you could stay happy and safe. 

277
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,800
 One day, I hope we can stand under the paper umbrella together  

278
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,970
 and accompany each other until the end of time. 

279
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,160
   

280
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,660
 At the sight of hills and rivers, you miss the one far away in vain. 

281
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,800
 You should cherish the one before you instead. 

282
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,640
 I only hope that our feelings are mutual. 

283
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,540
 Instead of admiring the country, we only admire each other. 

284
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,660
Jiang Chen...

285
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,360
Jiang Chen...

286
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,880
Jiang Chen...

287
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,900
Jiang Chen...

288
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,140
 The flower contains the last of Jiang Chen's qi! 

289
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,840
 Hurry! Let Pei Luo see her one last time. 

290
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:57,975
   

291
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,820
Jiang Chen...

292
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,580
Jiang Chen...

293
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,640
I am late.

294
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,620
I was wrong.

295
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,560
I... I no longer wish to attain immortality anymore.

296
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,760
Jiang Chen...

297
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,060
Jiang Chen, your wish has been fulfilled.

298
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,020
Rest in peace.

299
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,380
Don't worry.

300
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,200
I will remember our promise.

301
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,620
I will keep watch over this world on your behalf.

302
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,900
I will experience the Five Sufferings, Six Delusions,

303
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,460
Seven Emotions, Eight Hardships,

304
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,220
and write a play that can touch the hearts

305
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,540
of everyone in the Three Realms and Four Seas.

306
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,380
Yan Dan, do you think I'm being too cruel

307
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,640
by retrieving my Extraordinary Eye right now?

308
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,000
 I believe Pei Luo wouldn't have ended up like this if he trusted Jiang Chen. 

309
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,100
 People who are in love should treated each other sincerely, without harboring enmity. 

310
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:51,120
What if you discovered that I was lying to you one day?

311
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,260
What would you do then?

312
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,060
 Mountain Chief, did you do something to let me down? 

313
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,400
 If so, I'll make you serve me well as compensation. 

314
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,160
Just now, I tested Pei Luo.

315
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,400
There is no way he could cast a spell to trap Yan Dan, with his level of cultivation.

316
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,460
He looked like he had no idea what a four-leaf lotus was when he looked at her.

317
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:15,140
If that's true, the person who hurt Yan Dan has nothing to do with this case.

318
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,620
The King of Andu is dead. The capital will surely be in turmoil.

319
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,540
We must leave this place.

320
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,040
Wait a moment.

321
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,620
I've retrieved my Extraordinary Eye now.

322
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,940
I can use my demonic power to give Yan Dan her body back.

323
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,480
Didn't we discuss this already?

324
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,500
It's too risky to give her back her body now.

325
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,220
Moreover, there were only two of us initially.

326
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,540
Don't you think people will be suspicious if they see an extra person?

327
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,860
We can talk about it after we leave this place.

328
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,980
 Wait! 

329
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,140
 I thought something was off when I was in the secret chamber. 

330
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,000
 Although the wind had stopped, my petals still flew to the top of the cauldron. 

331
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,240
 The cauldron is magical. 

332
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,530
 Could it be hiding some powerful divine tools? 

333
00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:02,340
The Truth Duster is a divine divine tool that will suck up all things and suspend all smoke when it appears.

334
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,720
 Maybe the cauldron is hiding the Truth Duster! 

335
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,020
 Let's quickly go back and check it out! 

336
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,560
Side Consort?

337
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,360
How dare you two commit such an evil act?

338
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,880
Speak. Why did you try to harm her?

339
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,560
Taoist Master, please spare us! W-We tried to use the divine tool in her palace, but she saw us.

340
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,560
That's... That's why we tried to harm her.

341
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,320
Thank you, Young Master.

342
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,960
Young Master, you've saved my life.

343
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,420
I have no way to repay the favor.

344
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:32,280
I'm willing to give you the Truth Duster, the treasure of our sect, to repay you for saving my life.

345
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,080
Your Highness, I was looking for that divine tool as well.

346
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,250
Thank you.

347
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,480
The King of Andu forced me to be his consort.

348
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:12,260
He also wiped out my entire sect to get his hands on the Truth Duster.

349
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,240
This divine tool contains immense divine power.

350
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,560
The wind will be sucked in and smoke will stop in motion when you use it.

351
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,660
It can cleanse all things.

352
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,520
This divine tool has never shown any affinity toward anyone.

353
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,880
As a cultivator, I know that all divine tools are alive.

354
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,020
Since the divine tool has recognized you as its master, then you are destined to have it.

355
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,980
Young Master, please accept the divine tool.

356
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,960
 It's all thanks to me that you found the divine tool. 

357
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,600
 You better prepare some amazing delicacies and legendary stories  

358
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,920
 to thank me when we get out of the palace. 

359
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,640
Brother Tang, I heard that you were honest, upright, and untainted by greed.

360
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,540
But it seems to me that it is not the case here.

361
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,640
Senior Brother Yu, seems like you don't know me at all.

362
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,740
You see, I am greedy and petty.

363
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,400
Forget about divine tools.

364
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,180
Even if it's a flower, I'll take it as my own.

365
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,640
I would never let someone else have it.

366
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,320
You can only wield this divine tool if you know the secrets of it.

367
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,620
Otherwise, it is just a normal duster.

368
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,840
The King of Andu stole it from me in a hurry.

369
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,300
The formula should still be within my sect.

370
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,560
I wonder if you two would be willing to make the extra trip?

371
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,880
Side Consort, do you mean that if we escort you back to your sect,

372
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,260
you will share the secret technique with us?

373
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,780
The King of Andu is already dead.

374
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,880
There is no one here to restrict my freedom anymore.

375
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,640
I wish to return to my sect and watch over my master's grave.

376
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,580
However, my sect is far away and the journey is difficult.

377
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,540
I'm scared of making the trip alone.

378
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,740
This divine tool can save my life.

379
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,760
Thank you for giving it to me, Your Highness.

380
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,260
I'll definitely escort you back to your sect.

381
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:59,600
   

382
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,020
Since Sheng De isn't around, I have something to tell you.

383
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,980
The palace case is closed.

384
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,420
I'm going to take Yan Dan home.

385
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,920
She is still very stubborn.

386
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,120
She still needs me to teach her.

387
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,080
She is a member of Yelan Mountain.

388
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,060
She does not need you to tell her what to do.

389
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,340
The Distance Keeping Lock proves that she is my demon now.

390
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,000
Dispel it immediately.

391
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,580
Or else, I will kill you.

392
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,060
Are you trying to tell me that you also want to be captured?

393
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,080
You can give it a try.

394
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,880
 They're at it again. 

395
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,000
 I really don't dare offend any one of them. 

396
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,480
 When kings fight, inferior demons like me really do suffer. 

397
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,360
Have you ever thought of listening to her opinion before taking her away?

398
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,580
Fine.

399
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,280
I'll let you hear exactly what she's thinking right now.

400
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,720
 No hiding! Show yourself and speak. 

401
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,420
I'm finally back!

402
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,600
I was in my real form for way too long.

403
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,040
Let me see... Am I okay?

404
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,680
Why is this stupid bracelet still here?

405
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,320
Fine, then. It can stay there.

406
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,240
Don't worry. Advisor Lotus, you still look as beautiful as always.

407
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,060
I need to see whether I have any power left.

408
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,760
Demonic power?

409
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,840
Who are you? Why are you here?

410
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,460
- I...
 - She is a demon I captured.

411
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,680
She was hiding in my sleeves before.

412
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,500
She got to know who you were after hearing about the palace case.

413
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,100
However, she has a kind nature.

414
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,320
She'll never harm anyone. There's no need to worry.

415
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,620
Since Young Master Tang speaks for her, I won't worry.

416
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,300
Miss, what's your name?

417
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,700
I am Yan Dan.

418
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,000
Thank you for the clues you gave us.

419
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,340
That is how we were able to reveal the King of Andu's true colors.

420
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,360
You are too kind.

421
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,620
I still have to thank you all for saving me.

422
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,500
Don't mention it. It's our duty!

423
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,480
Yan Dan, Tang Zhou has agreed to take Sheng De back to her sect.

424
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,020
Sheng De has been serving and taking care of him along the journey.

425
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,120
They are getting along well.

426
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,340
We shouldn't interrupt them. Let's bid farewell to them.

427
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,180
Sheng De is a guest. There is no need to trouble her.

428
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,300
Yan Dan has always served me.

429
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,960
That is why she must stay.

430
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,160
Tang Zhou, did you forget about your mission?

431
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,960
You have an important mission to fulfill.

432
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,480
Also, humans and demons are different.

433
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,040
No matter how reluctant you are, you have to part ways with her eventually.

434
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,740
I believe you understand what I mean.

435
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,920
You do not get to decide whether she stays or goes.

436
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,420
She has to decide that herself.

437
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,700
What about this? What about this?

438
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,780
Let me say something.

439
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:25,580
Actually, after visiting the Shen's Residence, Lingxiao Sect, and the palace,

440
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:30,980
I understand how painful it is to lose a good friend, and the satisfaction of avenging a loved one.

441
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:36,960
However, even after all that, I still have so many questions about the people and the world itself.

442
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,640
I wish to explore the world more, so I can fulfill the promise I made to Jiang Chen.

443
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,500
I will write a play that will be known throughout the world.

444
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,640
You mean... You don't wish to return to Yelan Mountain?

445
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,780
Of course, I want to go back. It is my home.

446
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,300
Just not right now.

447
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,020
We left the mountain so we could do a kind deed every day, didn't we?

448
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,840
Besides, Tang Zhou has already promised Sheng De that he'll escort her back.

449
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,300
It is inconvenient for a man and a woman to travel alone.

450
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:05,480
Why don't we join them and travel together to... gain new experiences and also watch each other's back.

451
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,460
What do you think?

452
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,000
Didn't you just say that you would respect her decision?

453
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,100
Yan Dan, then let's do it.

454

00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:03,280
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

470
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:11,100
♫   As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable  ♫

471
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:18,300
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

472
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:26,720
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫
