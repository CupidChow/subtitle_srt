 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,600
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,920
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai advises people from the mortal world   ♫

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,070
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,220
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,920
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,220
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,700
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,470
   

15
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,950
   

16
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,500
Ground Block is actually here.

17
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,220
We must take Ground Block away first.

18
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,030
If Ying Yuan obtains it and stabilizes his divine power, it will be bad for us.

19
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,980
It is my fault.

20
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,500
Otherwise, Ying Yuan wouldn't have lived until now.

21
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,920
It's good that you know it now.

22
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,960
As its name indicates, Ground Block can collapse mountains and destroy lands.

23
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,480
This divine tool has always been untraceable and difficult to locate.

24
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,960
Even if they do find it and want to get it out,

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,900
it will turn this beautiful paradise into ruins.

26
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,060
How would his friends allow him to do that?

27
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,580
That's right.

28
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,700
Ground Block can't be taken by force.

29
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,600
If Ying Yuan tries to get it out by force, his body will burst instantly, and he will die.

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,800
It will implicate me.

31
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,640
I still have a few days left before my Shared-Fate Spell is broken.

32
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,720
Ling Jiang, you shall go to the Mortal Realm now.

33
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,480
Kill him immediately when the seven days are up.

34
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,920
All of the hardships we've endured while planning this have led us to this point.

35
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,140
If once again we can’t...

36
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,220
Kill Ying Yuan, I will kill myself to atone for it

37
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,960
Who shall get Ground Block out?

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,420
Too many people in the Mortal Realm know that Ying Yuan is not dead.

39
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,140
Those people are not to be feared,

40
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,490
but if they really start making a fuss, I'm afraid it will cause us much trouble, too.

41
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,560
Don't worry.

42
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,120
His weakness is in my hands.

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,680
There is someone who cares most about the glory of divinity

44
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,660
and is bent on bringing honor to the Heaven Realm.

45
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,480
It's time to give her a chance.

46
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,780
The Four Seas are peaceful, and the Three Realms are thriving.

47
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,480
It's all thanks to all of you.

48
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,800
You may be dismissed today.

49
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,600
Your Supreme Majesty, I have one more thing to report.

50
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,870
When my disciples were inspecting the Mortal Realm,

51
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,720
we found Emperor Ying Yuan's divine tool, Ground Block,

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,580
had fallen into Yelan Mountain, the territory of Demon Clan.

53
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,920
I'm afraid that the demons of Yelan Mountain would take advantage of it.

54
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,460
I implore Your Supreme Majesty to send someone to retrieve it.

55
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,380
That was harsh, Star Deity Tai You.

56
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,560
I have heard that these years, the demons in Yelan Mountain have been managed well.

57
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,640
They do not disturb the mortals.

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,560
So why do you make them sound like rebels with evil intentions?

59
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,340
Ground Block was lost in the Divine-Devil War.

60
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,660
It will collapse mountains and destroy lands if it's extracted by force.

61
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,720
It will bring catastrophic effects to the Mortal Realm.

62
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,760
Zhi Xi, you are the curator of the Magical Pavilion.

63
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,740
You are responsible for the maintenance and repair of all divine tools.

64
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,960
What do you think about this?

65
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,040
Ground Block is an ancient divine tool.

66
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,580
The Heaven Realm has all the rights to retrieve it.

67
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,580
Immortal Lord Yue Yao's concern is reasonable.

68
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,960
Fortunately, we have studied how to collect large divine tools.

69
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,660
I can lay out a magical array for the collection.

70
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,500
I can retrieve Ground Block without causing too much damage to Yelan Mountain.

71
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,700
Very well. You are pure-hearted and wise as I expected.

72
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,460
You know what I want well.

73
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,160
I shall entrust this to you.

74
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,500
You must retrieve Ground Block intact.

75
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,800
Seeing Ground Block will also relieve my pain of losing Ying Yuan.

76
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,500
I will not fail my mission.

77
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,900
Zhi Xi, there is a matter that concerns many people.

78
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,680
It could have implicated you if I had told you.

79
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,380
That's why I have been keeping it from you.

80
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,740
In Yelan Mountain right now...

81
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,360
Lu Ming.

82
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,140
Why are you chit-chatting here?

83
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,100
I just saw Simu looking around for you.

84
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,640
Perhaps His Supreme Majesty is in need of your service.

85
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,080
All right. I will go now.

86
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,180
You sent Lu Ming away on purpose.

87
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,940
Do you wish to give me some advice?

88
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,700
You run the Magical Pavilion well, Fairy Zhi Xi.

89
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,900
And you are His Supreme Majesty's favorite.

90
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,020
Who am I to give you any advice?

91
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,400
The retrieval of the divine tool is an honorable task.

92
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,980
This is a great honor bestowed upon you by His Supreme Majesty.

93
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:42,430
I guess after you get the Ground Block back, your divine rank will be elevated again.

94
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:48,160
But there is a hidden concern behind this task if you think about it.

95
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,800
I don't know if I should say it.

96
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,320
Just speak your mind, Star Deity.

97
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,300
There's a great story about you cutting out your heart to save your master.

98
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,420
But the Heaven Realm was once abuzz with rumors

99
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:06,880
that you saved your master because you were in love with him.

100
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,840
Emperor Qingli has passed away.

101
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,640
This... is a slanderous statement.

102
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,780
Emperor Ying Yuan only cared about the world.

103
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,500
I have nothing but respect and admiration for him.

104
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,270
His Supreme Majesty has already used the Uncoupling Cord to prove our innocence.

105
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:34,250
But Uncoupling Cord can only cut off mutual love, not unrequited love.

106
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:40,460
- You... 
 - My words may not be pleasant to hear, but I said them with your best interests in mind.

107
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,500
Rumor has it that in Yelan Mountain, there are many bewitched demons.

108
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,880
What if word reaches the Heaven Realm that you were bewitched by them and failed to retrieve Ground Block?

109
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,000
There will be speculation that you were distracted by love.

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,820
His Supreme Majesty will be furious.

111
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,760
Deities mustn't fall in love.

112
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,600
I am well aware of that.

113
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,560
Everything I do is to relieve His Supreme Majesty's burdens

114
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,050
and take up the responsibility as curator of the Magical Pavilion without any self-interest.

115
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,600
I will never give others the opportunity to slander me.

116
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,040
You are the most ambitious fairy indeed.

117
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,460
Otherwise, you wouldn't be holding a high-ranking position at such a young age.

118
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,180
You even turned your own sister in for your divine rank.

119
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,800
I hope you'll also be able to identify what's priority and make the right choice this time.

120
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,260
Don't let your years of hard work go to waste.

121
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,840
It's not working. The Extraordinary Eye can't enter his body.

122
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:04,380
If we knew that hosting the wedding would aggravate Mr. Tang's illness...

123
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,240
Zi Lin and I pushed too hard.

124
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,740
We've failed to feed him any medicine and pass him any spiritual power.

125
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,580
What should we do?

126
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,960
Now, his divine power is dissipating from his body.

127
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,580
Within a day, his divine power will burst out of his body and kill him.

128
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,100
Let me give it a try with the Great Silk Scripture.

129
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,080
No. His body is overloaded with divine power.

130
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,360
- If this goes on, I'm afraid you will get hurt. 
 - I'm not afraid of getting hurt.

131
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,920
Tang Zhou's veins are blocked. Great Silk Scripture won't work on him.

132
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,100
That mysterious man sealed all his veins with one blow.

133
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,800
There are 81 moves in Great Silk Scripture.

134
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I don't believe none of these moves can save him.

135
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,960
Yan Dan...

136
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,760
No need to talk me out of it. I have made up my mind.

137
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,080
Yan Dan!

138
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,060
Yan Dan, are you all right?

139
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,580
I'm fine. I'm okay now.

140
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,780
 Yan Dan. 

141
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,160
You can't save him by doing this. You're only hurting yourself.

142
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,840
Yan Dan, don't hurt yourself anymore.

143
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,640
I know you all want to protect me, but please let me save him.

144
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,740
Could you please let me try?

145
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,480
Yan Dan.

146
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,140
Yu Mo, let Yan Dan try again.

147
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,720
If it still doesn't work, we'll think of another way.

148
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,180
Stop!

149
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,280
I'd like to try again.

150
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,140
 Yan Dan! 

151
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,660
Yan Dan.

152
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,380
We can't let her keep doing this.

153
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,520
Take Tang Zhou to the hot spring now.

154
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,120
The hot spring will repair his divine power and prevent his body from being burned.

155
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,620
 All right. 

156
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,700
It is here, indeed.

157
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,460
 Zhi Xi, there is a matter that concerns many people. 

158
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,960
 It could have implicated you if I had told you. That's why I have been keeping it from you. 

159
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,240
 In Yelan Mountain... 

160
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,320
Is there really something going on in this mountain?

161
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,060
I must find out the truth.

162
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,940
Emperor Ying Yuan?

163
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,780
He is still alive?

164
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,940
 Why is his celestial vest is damaged? 

165
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,380
 His mortal body can't withstand such ramming divine power. 

166
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,760
 If his divine body is blown up by divine power, his primordial spirit will vanish. 

167
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,920
 Withered Stone Palm? 

168
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,940
 What a vicious move. 

169
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,940
 All I can do now is apply some Spirit-Cleansing Ointment on him to help stabilize his divine power a little. 

170
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,810
 Given what Tai You said to me earlier, was he already aware Emperor Ying Yuan is here? 

171
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,720
 Was he implying that I shouldn't help him? 

172
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,580
 Have I ruined his mortal trial? 

173
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,780
 What is Emperor Ying Yuan doing in the demons’ territories? 

174
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,850
 If I take him back to the Heaven Realm, will it create more rumors and tarnish his reputation? 

175
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,980
Yan Dan?

176
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Why is there stardust from the Heaven Realm?

177
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,060
Could it be...

178
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,520
Zhi Xi!

179
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,580
Sister!

180
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,500
Zhi Xi!

181
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,660
I know it's you.

182
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,660
Come out!

183
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,100
Why won't you come out to see me?

184
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,000
Zhi Xi!

185
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,620
You once said you would always protect me.

186
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,700
That you would never leave me.

187
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,400
You broke your promise once.

188
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,820
Are you going to break it again?

189
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,020
You said you'd never forgive me.

190
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,300
Now, I don't have the audacity to face you.

191
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,120
If you really didn't want to see me,

192
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,780
then why did you save me from getting hurt when I was about to fall just now?

193
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,820
You lost your divine life and fell into the Mortal Realm because of me.

194
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,480
Even if I saved you a million times, it still wouldn't be enough to make up for what I did to you.

195
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,930
I'm not worthy of standing in front of you, and I'm not worthy of being your sister.

196
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,160
Stop crying.

197
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,200
You look like an ugly kitten.

198
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,700
I remember when you were little, no matter how Master punished you,

199
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:30,500
how those divine officials mocked you, and slandered you, you never cried.

200
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:37,170
I knew at that time that my sister was the best divine official of the Four-Leaf Lotus Clan.

201
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:41,860
Now that all your wishes have come true, why are you crying?

202
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,080
I indeed got everything I dreamed of.

203
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,540
Divine rank, position, admiration, and Heavenly Emperor's trust.

204
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,310
But I only realized that even though I had gotten everything,

205
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:58,680
all this is meaningless without you by my side.

206
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,140
The day you jumped off the bridge, half of me died with you.

207
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,720
I no longer live for myself for the rest of my life.

208
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,900
I put up with hardships and focus on my cultivation,

209
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,700
only to repay the pain you have suffered a hundred times to Ying Deng.

210
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,160
What goes around comes around.

211
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,420
She got her reckoning.

212
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,460
It's my turn now.

213
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,260
I didn't want to hurt you, yet you died because of me.

214
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,800
When you jumped off the bridge in despair that day, it was all because of my mistake.

215
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,760
This is Beak-Breaking Dagger.

216
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,480
One stab with it can hurt the divine soul.

217
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,100
The pain will last for a century.

218
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,310
If it can alleviate even a little of your hatred, no matter how you punish me, I will accept it.

219
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,560
Do you really mean it?

220
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,600
Look at what this is.

221
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,220
I've collected all the stars.

222
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,620
Your punishment is, from now on,

223
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:35,600
only death will do us part.

224
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,940
Will you still take me as your sister?

225
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,820
Well, of course!

226
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,360
What about you?

227
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,460
Do you ever regret having me as your sister?

228
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,820
Never.

229
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,660
You had cultivated diligently for a thousand years,

230
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,720
you did all of the tasks that I didn't want to do.

231
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,200
When I made a mistake, you covered for me, you shared my burden.

232
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,760
You left me all the good food and nice stuff.

233
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,670
At that time, you didn't even abandon me as your sister.

234
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:34,180
Now that you've made just one small mistake, how could I possibly abandon you?

235
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,700
When I was imprisoned...

236
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,680
I was really mad at you.

237
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,940
But all these years...

238
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,600
I've also really missed you.

239
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,440
I met Ying Deng in the Mortal Realm.

240
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,320
I killed her myself. Aren't I awesome?

241
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,360
Come to think of it, you did get revenge for what happened to me.

242
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,400
I have experienced a lot in my years in the Mortal Realm.

243
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,180
I understand the inner demons that bothered you back then.

244
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,460
I've forgiven you long ago for everything you did in the past.

245
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:28,600
Sister, we, the Four-Leaf Lotus Clan, are linked by our spiritual roots.

246
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,220
You will always be the closest person to me.

247
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,560
Sister.

248
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,360
Yan Dan.

249
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,520
I've missed you so much.

250
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,040
Let's never be apart again.

251
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,260
Yan Dan.

252
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,420
I can't believe you met Emperor Ying Yuan again in the Mortal Realm.

253
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,060
This destiny between you two is very rare.

254
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,560
Sister, now that you are the curator of the Magical Pavilion, you must know a lot of things.

255
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,820
Can you tell me how I can retrieve the divine tool Ground Block?

256
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,040
You are looking for Ground Block?

257
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,400
Is it to save His Majesty?

258
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,820
Twenty years ago, the Heaven Realm announced that he died during his mortal trial.

259
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,500
How come I just saw him in the hot spring

260
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,320
with his celestial vest ripped and a Withered Stone Palm injury?

261
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,060
You are smart.

262
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,040
I'm sure you know why.

263
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,680
Someone in the Heaven Realm doesn't want him back.

264
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,980
 Could it be Star Deity Tai You? 

265
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,980
He has lost his memory of the Divine Realm.

266
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,720
All his powers are gone, leaving him a mere mortal.

267
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,680
Now he has been hit with the Withered Stone Palm making his divine power surge. It’s hard for it to settle down.

268
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,320
Without Ground Block to stabilize his divine power,

269
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,430
in a few days, he will die suspiciously in the Mortal Realm.

270
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,400
But there is a law in the Heaven Realm.

271
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,400
No one is allowed to interfere with the mortal trials.

272
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,640
And my mission in the Mortal Realm, this time, is to retrieve Ground Block.

273
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,220
According to the rules, I should take it back first

274
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,500
and report His Majesty's injury before I come back to rescue him.

275
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,260
His life is at stake now.

276
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,100
He doesn't have time to wait for the procedures.

277
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,380
Besides, the perpetrator is in the Heaven Realm.

278
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,900
If the news is brought back to the Heaven Realm, he will die for sure.

279
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,780
Sister, I know you don't want to break the rules.

280
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,860
How about this? Show me how it's done, and I'll do it.

281
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,280
I won't compromise your divine rank.

282
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,720
How is my divine rank more important than you?

283
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,540
Yan Dan, even if I tell you, it's useless.

284
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,220
Having come for the mortal trials, he can only return to his place

285
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,960
under the premise of preserving his divine power and passing all the trials.

286
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,980
His Majesty's celestial vest is damaged.

287
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,000
Without the divine tool to repair it, he won't be able to last until the completion of the trial.

288
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,560
But to find Ground Block, I need to set up a magical array in the mountain and look everywhere for it.

289
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,960
It will take at least 24 hours.

290
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,380
Given His Majesty's current condition, he won't last until then.

291
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,520
Unless...

292
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,500
Unless what?

293
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,700
Unless His Majesty dies.

294
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,100
His Majesty has one last trial left, the death trial.

295
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,740
And the divine tool belongs to His Majesty.

296
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,440
Divine tools are protective of their masters.

297
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,100
If the divine tools are within ten miles of their masters, and their lives are in danger,

298
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,460
they will sense it and get back to their masters.

299
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,620
I understand now.

300
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,280
That means only when Tang Zhou is dying

301
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:03,460
will the divine tool, Ground Block, return, and will the Withered Stone Palm injury be cured.

302
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,660
By then, he will complete his trial and restore his divinity.

303
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,160
This is the only way.

304
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,880
But now, His Majesty's divine power is about to burst.

305
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,120
If his body is damaged, he will lose his divine power.

306
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,400
By then, even if we find Ground Block, his soul will still disperse.

307
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,100
All will be meaningless.

308
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,900
I won't let his body be damaged.

309
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,680
What are you going to do?

310
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,540
Are you going to use the remaining half of your Four-Leaf Lotus heart to save him?

311
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,900
You mustn't do that!

312
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,660
There are hundreds of dieties and thousands of heavenly physicians in the Heaven Realm.

313
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,500
I'm certain they will figure something out to save him.

314
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,260
Why do you have to sacrifice yourself?

315
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,220
Sister, do you still not understand?

316
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,080
He has been harmed several times by people from the Heaven Realm.

317
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,650
Before we get to the bottom of this, we mustn't get anyone from the Heaven Realm involved.

318
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,020
And you can't tell anyone of them.

319
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,980
Have you ever thought about yourself?

320
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,100
If you cut out your heart again, you'll lose your primordial spirit and your life.

321
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,600
He ended up like this because he saved me and my friends.

322
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,760
I will repay him with half of my heart.

323
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,040
When His Majesty is recovered and returns to his place, your relationship will be back to where it used to be.

324
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:29,220
Why would a high and mighty emperor turn his back on the Three Realms for a petty divine attendant like you?

325
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,160
Didn't you already try it once, 900 years ago, and get your answer?

326
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,700
Why do you repeat the same mistake?

327
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:49,320
I used to think love is two people spending the rest of their lives together.

328
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,180
But now, having started my life afresh,

329
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:58,020
I've not only learned how to write a moving play,

330
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,040
but I've also understood what true love is.

331
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:08,620
True love is allowing him to achieve his dreams and protect everything he cherishes.

332
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,080
Sister, what is the meaning of this?

333
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,840
Yan Dan, I'm sorry.

334
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,820
I know you want to save His Majesty.

335
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,640
I can break the rules and take His Majesty back to the Heaven Realm now.

336
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,800
He has a prestigious status and is respected by many.

337
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,000
He will be safe and sound.

338
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,420
But you're different.

339
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,340
I've already lost you once.

340
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,340
I can't afford that again.

341
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,340
Sister.

342
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,740
Listen to me, sister.

343
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,640
He has given up his status as a divine.

344
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,800
He won't return to the Heaven Realm with you.

345
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,300
If you force him to go with you, he will confront you with a fierce fight.

346
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,540
But given his current condition, he won't survive this.

347
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,080
Don't worry.

348
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,540
He'll go back with me willingly.

349
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,060
Sister.

350
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,100
Sister!

351
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,960
 He is so badly injured. 

352
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,620
 He mustn't die within the seven-day limit. 

353
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,580
 I should find out how much time he has left to live. 

354
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,160
He has the Asura Totem.

355
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,320
Is he... one of my Asura Clan, too?

356
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,520
 That fairy from the Heaven Realm has returned. 

357
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,780
 She mustn't see this totem. 

358
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,580
 It will be a serious offense if I kill one of our own. 

359
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,080
 This is a big deal. 

360
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,500
 I'd better go back and report it first. 

361
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,980
Tang Zhou?

362
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,260
Tang Zhou, you're finally awake.

363
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,340
I was worried sick.

364
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,000
Are you all right?

365
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,700
My immortal spirit...

366
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,820
Your celestial vest is damaged. You passed out because of weakness.

367
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,520
An immortal lord happened to pass by just now.

368
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,260
He protected your divine power with his.

369
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,120
But he said you need to go to the Nine Heavens as soon as possible

370
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,220
to have the heavenly essence to keep you alive.

371
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,920
An immortal lord from where? Why did he help me?

372
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,560
Your real form is an emperor.

373
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,180
No matter what difficulties you encounter, the divine will always come to help you.

374
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,580
They just taught me the way to ascend to the Nine Heavens.

375
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,980
We should not waste any more time.

376
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,480
Let's go to the Nine Heavens now.

377
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,360
Come on.

378
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,440
What is this?

379
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,620
How come I've never seen it before?

380
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,120
Inside it is the divine power from the Nine Heavens.

381
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,460
It's a gift from the immortal lord just now.

382
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,950
It is because of him that I'm able to open the path to the Nine Heavens.

383
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,620
You once said all your experiences in the Heaven Realm were heartbreaking, and you didn't want to go back.

384
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,300
Why are you so eager to go back now?

385
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,080
Because I want to catch the stars.

386
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,760
The divines in the sky like to spread their divine power, like a rain of stars.

387
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,380
If I can catch it, my spiritual power will grow.

388
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,920
I always love to find a protector.

389
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,660
How can I miss such a good opportunity?

390
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,440
Come on.

391
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,760
Tang Zhou, I haven't seen this in a long time.

392
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,680
Come back to the Nine Heavens and watch the stars with me.

393
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,000
 Sister, I knew you wouldn't let me do this. 

394
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,040
 However, you've cultivated for hundreds of years. 

395
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,880
 Your divine power is stronger than mine. 

396
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,360
 I had to play you at your own game, pretending to have been trapped by you 

397
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,720
 and finding a way to get out with your divine tool. 

398
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,800
It's a good imitation... but you are not her.

399
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,100
What gave me away?

400
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,460
The way you walk and your demeanor are different from hers.

401
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,060
Not to mention she once crushed a pool of stars that I gave her.

402
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:00,080
The real her would never ask me to watch stars with her.

403
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,380
But I indulged myself once and watched the stars with her.

404
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,360
Now that I'm dying...

405
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,280
that's my most beautiful memory.

406
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,120
Tell me, who are you exactly?

407
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,640
Like you, I care about her, too.

408
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,240
So, today, I have to take you back to the Heaven Realm even if it might hurt both of us.

409
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,920
Sister!

410
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,960
Tang Zhou, don't hurt my sister!

411
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,520
Yan Dan, what are you doing here?

412
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,940
Sister... if you insist on taking him away,

413
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,500
will you let me stay here and say a few more words to him?

414
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,360
I have some unfinished business with him.

415
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,100
I'm sorry, Yan Dan.

416
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,840
I didn't know you have a sister.

417
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,940
I thought she was the making of a Puppet Spell.

418
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,280
That's why I pointed my sword at her.

419
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,800
You could tell that it was someone else, not me.

420
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,400
Why?

421
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,900
I see my loved one...

422
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,840
not only with my eyes but also with my heart.

423
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,000
You said that you love me... but what proof do you have?

424
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,160
Now I have nothing left.

425
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:50,520
Only this sword can serve as the token of my love.

426
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,640
Fine.

427
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,100
How about your life?

428
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,420
Yan Dan!

429
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,980
Sister, you lied to me once.

430
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,780
I have to get even.

431
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,080
You are now tied by my spiritual root.

432
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,380
If you want to escape, you will have to cut it off.

433
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,140
But that will turn me back into my original form.

434
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,620
You won't hurt me, right?

435
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,560
Yan Dan, don't do anything rash.

436
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,840
Once you do this, there will be no turning back.

437
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,320
You said that you love me.

438
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,100
Fine.

439
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,940
Answer me, then.

440
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,700
Will you give up your life for me?

441
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,880
I will.

442
00:36:53,340 --> 00:37:00,340

443

You owed me a life.

You have given it back now.

445
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:13,680
From now on... all debts between us are settled.

♫   I've experienced the ups and downs of the world alone   ♫

470
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:16,460
♫   Finally, I can rest in your heart   ♫

471
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,980
♫   We've been together for a lifetime and gone through all the trials   ♫

472
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,160
♫   We won't complain as time will turn our hardship into sweetness   ♫

473
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:33,000
♫   I won't ask how long forever is, but we'll smile and laugh together   ♫

474
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:39,760
♫   Let the past be the past   ♫

475
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,440
♫   We're entangled like agarwood intertwined into flames   ♫

476
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,060
♫   It doesn’t extinguish and I've forgotten the cold wind and snow along the way   ♫

477
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,960
♫   I've experienced the ups and downs of the world alone   ♫

478
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,780
♫   Finally, I can rest in your heart   ♫

479
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,580
♫   We've been together for a lifetime and gone through all the trials   ♫

480
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,740
♫   We won't complain as time will turn our hardship into sweetness   ♫

481
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:30,960
♫   I won't ask how long forever is, but we'll smile and laugh together   ♫

482
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:37,780
♫   Let the past be the past   ♫
