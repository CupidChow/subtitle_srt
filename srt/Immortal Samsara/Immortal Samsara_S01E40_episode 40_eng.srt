 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,500
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,920
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,070
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,220
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths   ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,920
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,320
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,000
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,770
   

15
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,190
   

16
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,004
   

17
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,140
 Mountain Chief! 

18
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,660
You're finally here.

19
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,180
Didn't we say that we'll go our separate ways.

20
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,320
Why did you come to see me?

21
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,400
I dare not disobey you.

22
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,920
However, some other people disagree.

23
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,080
- Sister Yan Dan. You can't leave! 
 - Sister Yan Dan.

24
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,400
- You can't leave. 
 - Sister Yan Dan, you can't leave.

25
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
Why are you all here?

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,620
Do you know how many people I send every day to clean your Pavilion of Books?

27
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,540
If you're gone, all that effort to built it would be wasted.

28
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,540
It would be Yelan Mountain's biggest deficit spending.

29
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,060
That's right. I haven't grown up yet.

30
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,860
How can you leave?

31
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,840
Zi Yan.

32
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,800
Without you, this mountain would be less fun.

33
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,380
If you're not going back to Yelan Mountain, then I shall go back to Fox Clan.

34
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,100
Yan Dan. If you're not going back, I won't either.

35
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,380
I'll go to the Fox Clan with Princess Lin Lang.

36
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,380
Sister Yan Dan. In Demon Suppression Hall, you promised to celebrate my birthday.

37
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,940
My birthday is tomorrow.

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,480
You wouldn't lie to me, right?

39
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,900
I...

40
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,940
All right, then. I won't leave.

41
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,400
I'll stay until tomorrow to celebrate Dan Shu's birthday.

42
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,480
That's great!

43
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,920
Dan Shu, this is for you.

44
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,940
Thank you!

45
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,360
Sister Yan Dan, the noodles you made are very long. Amazing!

46
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,120
You have good skills, Sister Yan Dan.

47
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,520
I can't guarantee how good it might taste, but it implies my wish for your well-being.

48
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,340
Make a wish first.

49
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,900
I wish that we'll stay together forever like the longevity noodles and will never be apart.

50
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,460
Dan Shu, look at what Bai Ling has prepared for you.

51
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,220
What is it?

52
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,420
 Don't ruin it. 

53
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,960
They look just like us!

54
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
You're so skillful.

55
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,660
Indeed. The little paper men are so cute.

56
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,980
Dan Shu, put it away now. Or else, they might take it from you.

57
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,220
Thank you.

58
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,480
Let's eat, everyone.

59
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,980
I'll get you some.

60
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,880
Thank you, Sister.

61
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,744
   

62
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,020
Yan Dan.

63
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,180
Why are you here? You said you won't leave,

64
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,520
but it was all lie.

65
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,700
You can lie to them... but you can't lie to me.

66
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,580
I just didn't expect that you'd even have the boat ready.

67
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,140
Don't be sad.

68
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,340
It's not like I'll never be back.

69
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,620
I'll come back often to visit you all.

70
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,120
I'll also come back to see you, Yu Mo.

71
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,320
You use the word "back," not "go".

72
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,900
In this world, the only place we can go "back" to is home.

73
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:00,960
Perhaps you don't even realize.

74
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,800
You were once alone...

75
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,760
but right now, in your heart, you see us as your family.

76
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,860
Are you truly able to leave us all behind?

77
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,620
The person they like is the version of me who was once carefree.

78
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,260
The current me brings everybody nothing but unhappiness.

79
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,960
Yan Dan, you can't say that.

80
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,560
Not only are you underestimating everyone by saying that, but you also underestimate yourself.

81
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,800
Do you know how important you are to us?

82
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,300
All right.

83
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,500
Since you've decided to leave...

84
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,460
take it with you. So I'll be more at ease.

85
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,800
What nonsense are you talking about?

86
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,140
Without the Extraordinary Eye, your power as the Nine Fins will be unstable.

87
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,020
As a mountain chief, if you keep recuperating in seclusion, it'll spoil your name.

88
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,800
I don't care.

89
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,400
When I came to the Mortal Realm and couldn't find you,

90
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:30,400
I gave it to Jiang Chen in exchange for your whereabouts. That's how I found you.

91
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:37,200
Since you want to leave, the Extraordinary Eye no longer means anything to me.

92
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,520
What's the point for me to keep it?

93
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,800
Are you insane? How can you carelessly dispose of the Extraordinary Eye?

94
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,840
- Senior Tang. 
 - Go away!

95
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,580
Yan Dan!

96
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,840
Come up now.

97
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,100
Senior Tang.

98
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,740
So... So it's true.

99
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,000
Did the sect leader order you to come?

100
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,040
The spirit-subduing chain vibrated for no reason.

101
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,600
The sect leader said the chain and the magical bracelet are both treasures of the sect.

102
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,180
They can sense each other.

103
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,400
If it moves, it must be because you're having mortal thoughts.

104
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,200
None of us believed it.

105
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,560
Senior Tang, who is that person?

106
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,420
Could she be...

107
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,460
Could she be Yan Dan?

108
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,040
Since you've decided to leave, why did you retrieve it for me?

109
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,560
You know that I'm leaving, yet you deliberately threw the Extraordinary Eye into the water.

110
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,060
- Do you want me to leave with worries? 
 - That's not my intention!

111
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,260
I thought you didn't even care.

112
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,580
You thought I didn't even care?

113
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,160
To you, am I the kind of person who doesn't even care about the precious treasure of my best friend?

114
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,920
If this is what you think...

115
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,400
I've found the Extraordinary Eye, anyway. You may do whatever you want with it.

116
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,200
Handle it yourself. I don't care anymore.

117
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,100
Sorry.

118
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,600
I won't throw it away again.

119
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,100
It's really her.

120
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,700
I've let our master down.

121
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,000
Will this magical bracelet...

122
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
be taken away now?

123
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
The sect leader only ordered us to bring you back.

124
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,900
Senior Tang, Sect Leader thinks highly of you.

125
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,600
As long as you admit your mistake and never do it again, he'll surely forgive you.

126
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,600
What if I don't admit my mistake?

127
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,900
If Sect Leader wants to punish me, he may do so.

128
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,400
But I can't go back with you today.

129
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,100
Don't worry. Sect Leader knows that you can't stop me.

130
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
He won't blame you.

131
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,300
After I send Yan Dan home safely...

132
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,400
I'll be back for my punishment.

133
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,900
Senior Tang, you've only known her for a few months.

134
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,600
Because of her, you're going against the orders of our sect.

135
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,400
Is it worth it?

136
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,600
Whether it's worth it or not...

137
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,000
it's my wish.

138
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
Yan Dan.

139
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,800
What's wrong? Did you catch a cold?

140
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,500
I'm fine.

141
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,400
Yan Dan!

142
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,500
Jade Ice Toad?

143
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,900
Do you know what you're doing?

144
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,600
Sect Leader ordered me to bring you back, no matter what.

145
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,800
I have no choice but to do this.

146
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,500
The Jade Ice Toad venom is only deadly to demons, it doesn't harm humans.

147
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,100
Senior Tang, if you leave with us, I'll give you the antidote right away.

148
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,700
This is a weapon to kill demons, you can't use it on humans.

149
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,500
Lingxiao Sect has always been noble and honest.

150
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,800
Give me the antidote.

151
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,500
Give it to me!

152
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,700
Senior Tang. Go treat Yan Dan's poisoning.

153
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,300
If you ever use these dirty tricks again... I won't spare you.

154
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
She went out tougher, but now she got carried back.

155
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,200
Mountain Chief has his way.

156
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,800
This demon caught a cold right after being in the water for a short while.

157
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,200
I think there's more to the story.

158
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,600
She has taken the medicine all evening, yet she hasn't recovered.

159
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,900
Someone needs to look after her the whole night, then.

160
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,600
What happened to Sister Yan Dan?

161
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
I don't know.

162
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,300
After taking the medicine, her chills got worse.

163
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,600
We infused her with spiritual power.

164
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,100
But once it reaches her core, it's like dripping water merging with a river, it dissipates.

165
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,800
Perhaps she got...

166
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,800
I have seen this symptom of chill blockage before.

167
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
It's indeed caused by Jade Ice Toad.

168
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,200
Such ice toads are extremely rare.

169
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,600
They've never appeared in Shenxiao Palace before.

170
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,000
I wonder when it got into the river and bit Yan Dan.

171
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,200
Is this ice toad very powerful?

172
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,800
How's Yan Dan doing?

173
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,800
Jade Ice Toads are highly venomous.

174
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,800
The venom will spread all over a demon's body and turn the body into a block of ice.

175
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,700
There is no cure.

176
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,600
Liu Weiyang. Can you be my protector?

177
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,600
I'll transfer the venom from Yan Dan's body into mine.

178
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,000
No way!

179
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You can't do that.

180
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,700
Although Jade Ice Toad is very venomous, the power of the Extraordinary Eye in my body may be able to neutralize it.

181
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,200
Don't worry.

182
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,600
Let me do it, then.

183
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,300
You transferred so much spiritual power to Yan Dan.

184
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,400
Your body isn't as strong as mine now.

185
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,100
It's just a chill venom. Let me do it.

186
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,400
- Zi Lin. 
 - Let me do it.

187
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,800
Yan Dan and I are like sisters.

188
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,400
I should share her burden.

189
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,200
Zi Lin and Yan Dan are always at odds.

190
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,600
He can't take this task from me.

191
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,700
I want to do it, too. The wolf tribe has thick fur. I'm never afraid of the cold.

192
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,000
My fur is even thicker.

193
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Let me help Sister Yan Dan.

194
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,500
I appreciate your kindness.

195
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,200
I thank you on behalf of Yan Dan. But Yan Dan got poisoned because of me.

196
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,800
How can I be at ease to have you suffer?

197
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Don't worry.

198
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,600
I have a more important task for you.

199
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,800
- What task? 
 - Yan Dan's demonic essence is sealed by ice.

200
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Whether it's to transfer the venom or treat her wound, we must melt the ice first.

201
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,600
Liu Weiyang and I will protect her body so that the chill won't spread.

202
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,000
Go find some charcoal and make a big fire.

203
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,700
So that she's surrounded by warmth at all times.

204
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,500
- Okay. I'll go now. 
 - No need.

205
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,000
This is the Miss Tao whom Yan Dan often mentions.

206
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,100
I was heating up the stove in the kitchen and I bumped into Miss Tao.

207
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,800
Turns out she has prepared everything.

208
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,300
I'm glad to finally meet you.

209
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,000
We didn't expect you to be so thoughtful.

210
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,800
Thank you.

211
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,000
I heard everything you said just now.

212
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,400
I thought Yan Dan only caught a cold.

213
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,100
That's why I prepared this stove.

214
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,400
In her current state, coal fire is far from enough.

215
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,300
You must find another thing.

216
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,500
- Do you mean lava? 
 - Exactly.

217
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,800
"Lava"? What lava?

218
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,500
In Endless Cave of Quju Mountain, there's an eternal flame.

219
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,800
The rock in the fire is lava.

220
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,600
This place is unbearably hot.

221
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,100
What's wrong? Are you tired of living?

222
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,200
Do you wish to taste your roasted flesh?

223
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,000
I mean, do you know what this is?

224
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,800
Even I'm afraid half of my body would melt.

225
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,500
Don't you want to live?

226
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,300
Of course, I want to live.

227
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,400
Because someone is waiting for me.

228
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,200
Wait, wait!

229
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,000
Love has blinded you.

230
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You're worse than my previous master.

231
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,800
Look at him. At least, he was in love with a goddess.

232
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,100
Look at you.

233
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,100
You're crazy over a flower demon who rejected you multiple times.

234
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
If you keep babbling, I'll send you back to the sword.

235
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,700
Go away!

236
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,600
Be careful. Don't burn your hand.

237
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,700
If you can no longer hold a sword, I won't want to follow you.

238
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,000
You used the Emperor's divine tools  to store this thing?

239
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,900
You...

240
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,000
What a waste of a treasure.

241
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,600
 In Heavenly Realm and Mortal Realm, he fell in love with this flower demon twice. 

242
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,600
 His entanglement with Yan Dan in their past life should be hidden from him as long as possible. 

243
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,200
Yu Mo.

244
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,000
Yan Dan. You're finally awake.

245
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,400
Sister Tao.

246
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,200
Why am I in Shenxiao Palace again?

247
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Why am I so warm?

248
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
What is this?

249
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,200
This is lava.

250
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,800
The other day, you were bitten by a Jade Ice Toad and got chill venom.

251
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,600
Yu Mo brought you back to recuperate.

252
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,000
Thankfully, we got this thing, so we could expel the venom.

253
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,000
Where are the others?

254
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,900
Zi Lin, Lin Lang, and Bai Ling are on the way to search for lava.

255
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Isn't this the lava?

256
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,100
Yes.

257
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,500
After entering Quju Mountain, one must go through the Seven Level of Fires to reach to the lava.

258
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,200
With their power, they can only pass one level a day.

259
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,700
They departed two days ago.

260
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,400
An unknown person left this lava in front of Shenxiao Palace this morning.

261
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,600
I wrote them a letter.

262
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,700
They're on their way back.

263
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,400
Yan Dan. Your demonic essence just recovered.

264
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,700
Let's stop wasting time.

265
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,200
I'll draw the chill venom out of your body.

266
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,900
That's enough.

267
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,000
No need.

268
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,900
I'm no longer a little flower demon.

269
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,600
I practiced the fire spell.

270
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,800
In addition to the immortal power I learned, I can neutralize the venom myself.

271
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,500
Don't worry.

272
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,600
What should we do?

273
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,400
I tried everything.

274
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,800
I can't beat him.

275
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,500
If not, I would restrain him and stuff it into his mouth.

276
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,800
What else can we do?

277
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,200
He's always so sensitive to the smell of this medicine.

278
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,200
I've mashed it and boiled it. But I still can't deceive him.

279
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,000
Mr. Liu said his inner power is injured.

280
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,900
If he insists on not taking the medicine, it may cause chronic issues.

281
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,700
- His inner power is injured? 
 - Yan Dan, why are you here?

282
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,600
Thank goodness.

283
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,400
Was the chill venom, that's said to have no antidote, treated by you?

284
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,800
Don't worry. I'm feeling better.

285
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,500
You mentioned that Yu Mo injured his inner power.

286
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
What's going on?

287
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,440
It's because... he misused his inner energy during his practice.

288
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,820
As you know, just because he thinks he has a high cultivation level, he wants to advance in a hurry.

289
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,100
Furthermore, unlike in Yelan Mountain, there's no hot spring water to help him.

290
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,500
That's how he injured his inner power.

291
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,060
Drop the act. What actually happened?

292
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,620
Zi Lin.

293
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,680
All right, then.

294
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,760
He didn't injure his inner power because of cultivation.

295
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,200
After the Extraordinary Eye returned to his body, slow cultivation is needed to merge with the spiritual power.

296
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,000
But he transferred the venom from your body to his.

297
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,680
He overloaded his body. That's how it got worse.

298
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,200
You were unconscious then.

299
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,300
Mountain Chief knew that you couldn't dispel the chill venom yourself.

300
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,760
Hence he took the risk.

301
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,360
He didn't allow us to tell you.

302
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,140
You have no idea how much he cares about you.

303
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,420
All three of us wanted to help transfer the venom.

304
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,240
But he didn't allow it and insisted on doing it himself.

305
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,520
He's looking down on us.

306
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,960
During the venom transfer, all of you wanted to help me as well?

307
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,040
You didn't see it. Even the two little rascals claimed they were not afraid of the cold because of their furs.

308
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,640
You...

309
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,040
You always help me unconditionally.

310
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,580
I truly don't know what I should say now.

311
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,080
Thank you.

312
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,440
How about Yu Mo? Why...

313
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,740
Why is he refusing to take the medicine?

314
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,560
Because the prescription includes lotus leaves.

315
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,500
He insists on not eating your kind.

316
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,700
What a stupid fish.

317
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,840
Take it out! I won't take it.

318
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,940
Yan Dan... Is she gone yet?

319
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,700
You obviously care about her, why are you avoiding her?

320
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,520
Okay. Answer me, then.

321
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,580
Do you want her to stay or leave?

322
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,480
You have no idea, but when Yan Dan jumped into the lake, disregarding her safety,

323
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,460
to retrieve the Extraordinary Eye. I was so moved by her action.

324
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,440
She was poisoned because of me.

325
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,700
You don't know how sad I was.

326
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,160
Perhaps it was my mistake.

327
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,500
It was just an accident.

328
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,040
You accuse yourself because of such a petty matter.

329
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,380
Are you still the fearless Yu Mo that I once knew?

330
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,380
I appreciate that you don't take medicine that contains lotus leaves.

331
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,140
But as plants, we're different from you, the fish.

332
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:10,180
Even if we lose a few leaves, as long as our roots remain, we can regrow.

333
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,380
Therefore, don't worry and take the medicine.

334
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,140
If you still want to leave...

335
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,980
it'll be better for you to leave soon.

336
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,880
How can I leave with you being in this condition?

337
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,520
I know you want to find a place to start all over.

338
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,800
Since you've made up your mind, don't turn back.

339
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,240
I hope that neither I...

340
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,980
nor anyone from the mountain will become your burden.

341
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,680
Take this medicine first.

342
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:54,020
 Perhaps letting you go is the last thing I can do for you. 

343
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,540
Okay.

344
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,080
I'll take it.

345
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,100
You may go now.

346
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,200
You're a stupid fish indeed.

347
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:31,940
When we were in the Heaven Realm, although you were my minion, you were in fact protecting me.

348
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,900
Right now in Yelan Mountain, I've been cared for by everyone.

349
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,500
All of you treat me so well.

350
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,240
If I were to leave at will, wouldn't I be extremely selfish?

351
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,180
It's okay.

352
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,480
Everyone in Yelan Mountain is one family.

353
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,060
There's no need to be bothered by it.

354
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,260
See. As you said, we're a family.

355
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,880
I've regained my memories and gotten the ability to protect everyone.

356
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,600
I have all the more reason to stay now.

357
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,620
If you don't want to leave, you may of course stay.

358
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,300
Don't forget that you don't owe me, but I owe you.

359
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:10,020
When we were in the Heaven Realm, I was the little black fish raised by you for hundreds of years.

360
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,060
I've once said, I'll take care of you forever.

361
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,820
How can I break my promise? Right?

362
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,480
I've grown up.

363
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,820
And you, the hot-tempered little black fish who loved to roll his eyes at me, have also grown up.

364
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,480
Whatever you say.

365
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,460
Since you're no longer angry, here, let's restore it.

366
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,260
You're right. How can I break the promise?

367
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,100
From today on, I shall be the most powerful guardian of Yelan Mountain.

368
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,140
You can count on me.

369
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,600
From now on, I shall protect Yelan Mountain.

370
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,740
This is great. Sister Yan Dan is no longer leaving.

371
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,400
Zi Yan, you must be happy now?

372
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:32,304
   

373
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,920
The Art of Thousand Trials is hard to master indeed.

374
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,140
I'm afraid it'll take more time for me to succeed.

375
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,400
Sect Leader.

376
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,620
Come in.

377
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,760
Greetings, Sect Leader.

378
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,420
You're back.

379
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,200
Where's Tang Zhou?

380
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,740
Senior Tang... He refused to come back with us.

381
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,040
We've left the mountain for so long.

382
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,580
To be honest, I'm homesick.

383
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,160
When are we going back?

384
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,620
A few days ago, a few little demons went missing in the mountain.

385
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,940
I told Bai Ling to go back first in order to find the clues.

386
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,520
She found that they suddenly lost contact after leaving the mountain.

387
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,740
In this case, why don't we first go to the town where the little demons went missing?

388
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,400
We can also take Zi Yan and Dan Shu to see the world.

389
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,200
When this is done, we shall go back together.

390
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,860
Okay. We've been staying at Shenxiao Palace long enough.

391
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,900
Let's bid our farewell to Liu Weiyang first.

392
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,260
Sister Tao.

393
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,940
   

394
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,900
- It's you. 
 - What are you doing here?

395
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,380
It's nothing. I saw a butterfly just now.

396
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,960
It looked interesting, so I followed it all the way here.

397
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,880
Are you looking for Xuan Xiang?

398
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,020
He's in the study. I'll take you there.

399
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,620
Are you leaving now?

400
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,720
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

401
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,800
Although Shenxiao Palace has always been quiet, you and Tang Zhou are leaving one after another,

402
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,920
it indeed makes me loath to be parted with you.

403
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,160
Am I so unworthy for you all to stay behind?

404
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,720
Isn't having Sister Tao here enough for you?

405
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,960
You only need her to stay by your side.

406
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,680
How many more ladies do you want?

407
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,340
Yan Dan. Don't get me in trouble.

408
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,900
I only have eyes for Ziqi.

409
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,240
By the way, will you return soon after you leave?

410
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,140
Please write before you come.

411
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,120
If you disturb our alone time, I shall get even with you.

412
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,180
Moon in the Mirror Lake is your spiritual domain.

413
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,880
Even the letters from Yelan Mountain won't be able to reach here.

414
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,700
How do you communicate with letters?

415
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,620
That's simple. Use a Silk Letter.

416
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,860
This is a special messaging tool made by Shenxiao Palace.

417
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,840
I'll give you some later.

418
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,940
"Silk Letter"?

419
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,640
Is that a kind of purple paper?

420
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,840
Exactly. Have you seen it before?

421
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,340
No. I happened to see Sister Tao was using it earlier.

422
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,300
That's how I saw it.

423
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,060
You were sending a letter?

424
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:52,860
Before I was killed, I knew that the Divine-Devil War can't be avoided.

425
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:59,740
Therefore, I prayed silently, hoping my friends of the Immortal Clan can come back safely with victory.

426
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:07,400
Now, I found out that most of my friends have lost their lives, I'm suffering in sorrow.

427
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,660
So I turned a Silk Letter into a reincarnation talisman,

428
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,780
then burned it to the dead as my condolences.

429
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:22,460
Ziqi. You don't have to mourn secretly because of my feelings.

430
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,300
No matter what you want to do, I'll be by your side.

431
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,180
Thank you, Xuan Xiang.

432
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,035
   

433
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,980
Your Highness. Here you are.

434
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,200
We've prepared everything.

435
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,480
Everything is as in the previous years.

436
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,860
In the previous years... I stayed up with you on New Year's Eve.

437
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,500
But this year... it will be the last time.

438
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,860
What do you mean?

439
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,180
Your Highness, ae you getting rid of us?

440
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,650
I'll stop gambling. Please give me a chance.

441
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,650
I beg you, too. I'll stop buying jewelries.

442
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,720
I promise I will never oversleep.

443
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,960
I'll wake up as the roaster crows to collect intelligence for Shenxiao Palace.

444
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,560
You've all misunderstood.

445
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:30,280
I'll stop spending New Year's Eve with you because I've found the love of my life.

446
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,950
From today on, Shenxiao Palace will no longer exist.

447
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,520
Do you really want to do that?

448
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,500
They worked for you for so many years.

449
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,780
Even if you want to dismiss them, you shouldn't let them down.

450
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,920
Fu Shuang. I've already figured it out.

451
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,940
I'll gift you Indulgence House.

452
00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:02,510
If you don't want to leave, or if you can't find another place to go, you may start another business.

453
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,740
We're not going anywhere.

454
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,240
As long as Your Highness needs us, we'll always be around.

455
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,740
You don't need to do that.

456
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,940
I have Ziqi now.

457
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,880
In this life, I no longer have mortal needs.

458
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:31,720
Since Your Highness has decided, I shall bid my farewell.

459
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,280
Fu Shuang. Why did you transform into an old woman?

460
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:48,260
A flower would only be complete when it blooms for the person it loves.

461
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:54,800
Since the person who admires the flower is gone, the flower shall never bloom again.

462
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,100
Zi Yan, the ground is dirty.

463
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,160
It's so beautiful!

464
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,680
In four hours... it'll be the new year.

465
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,860
According to tradition, we may say our wishes.

466
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,580
Yan Dan. What's your wish?

467
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:48,020
I wish that everyone's wishes may come true.

468
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,700
Also, I wish everyone likes my play.

469
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,440
Yan Dan. You're being dishonest.

470
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,640
I'm not.

471
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,020
This is all I want.

472
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,720
Zi Yan. What about you? What wish do you have?

473
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,260
I want to grow up soon.

474
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,200
Zi Yan. I couldn't hear you.

475
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:16,720
I wish to master the most difficult magical spell.

476
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,040
What about you?

477
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,700
Me?

478
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,260
I...

479
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,840
I wish that the mountain will have peace.

480
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,840
Zi Lin, you're the one being dishonest.

481
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,340
 Your true wish is to confess to Lin Lang, right? 

482
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,800
 It's not nice to communicate telepathically in front of everyone. 

483
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,560
 A man should be bold. Give me your deadline. 

484
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,840
 Lantern Festival. 

485
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,360
 Latest by Lantern Festival, I'll confess to her. 

486
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,180
What about you, Yu Mo? What wish do you have?

487
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,940
My wish?

488
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,780
I wish that everyone will always be as happy as you are today.

489
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,080
So beautiful!

490
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,820
It's so pretty.

491
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,920
It's so pretty.

492
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,100
This piece of cloth was left behind when the little demon was wrestling with the kidnappers.

493
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,160
Take a look. Can you get any clues from it?

494
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,400
It looks like it's from a Taoist robe.

495
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,760
But there are so many sects that catch demons. How can we differentiate them?

496
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:28,260
I once saw a Taoist Master, his robe is of similar material.

497
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,640
You mean Tang Zhou?

498
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,300
I've heard you mentioned him often.

499
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:41,040
Could he have led the people of Lingxiao Sect to catch the demons of our mountain?

500
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,480
That's impossible!

501
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,320
He once promised me that Lingxiao Sect and Yelan Mountain will never offend each other.

502
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,380
I don't trust the words of a Taoist Master.

503
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:57,120
Besides... whenever I mention the name Tang Zhou, without knowing why, my whole body feels uncomfortable.

504
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,520
I'm disgusted and dizzy.

505
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,160
 Help! 

506
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,660
Zi Yan?

507
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,180
Let me go!

508
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,200
Let go!

509
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,700
How could it be you?

510
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,900
Look at his clothes. It's him.

511
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,760
Are you being serious? How dare you catch the demons of Yelan Mountain?

512
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,400
You're caught red-handed.

513
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,640
Yu Mo. Don't listen to his excuses.

514
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,460
Let's beat him up to avenge the missing demons.

515
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,200
The missing little demons have nothing to do with me, Little Brother.

516
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,760
If I hadn't seen it myself, I wouldn't believe it.

517
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,680
I caught him because he stole the chicken of a nearby farmer.

518
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,820
A farmer works hard.

519
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,100
You should teach him to obey rules.

520
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,080
Zi Yan. Is that true?

521
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,660
I saw many fat chickens gathering together.

522
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,020
I wanted to get one and grill it for Sister Yan Dan.

523
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,240
Can't I?

524
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,940
When did you damage your robe?

525
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,240
It was burned when I was getting the lava.

526
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,140
 It was indeed you. 

527
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,800
Do you have anything to do with the missing demons in the mountain?

528
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,740
Yu Mo. We have a promise.

529
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,480
We will never offend each other.

530
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,420
Seriously?

531
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,260
Do you believe in his lie?

532
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,900
The fabric matches his robe.

533
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,100
Even if it's not him, it must be the people from his sect.

534
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,100
Taoist robes are all similar.

535
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,940
You can't judge by this piece of cloth that it was Lingxiao Sect's doing.

536
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,160
I'll investigate this matter.

537
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,420
If it was done by someone from our sect, I won't let anybody else kill him.

538
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,180
Okay.

539
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,140
You must remember our promise.

540
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,720
Or else, I'll not pardon Lingxiao Sect.

541
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,700
Yu Mo.

542
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,300
Are you hiding something from me?

543
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,760
Were you following us?

544
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,980
I just want to be sure of her safety.

545
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,500
However...

546
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,360
Yan Dan doesn't want to see you.

547
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,240
When she returns to the mountain, I'll leave.

548
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:15,730
