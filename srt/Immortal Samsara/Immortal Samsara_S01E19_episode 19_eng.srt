 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,500
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai advises people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,920
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,170
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,480
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,220
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,000
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,020
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,220
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,000
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,780
   

15
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,950
   

16
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,820
They are just under the influence of Prison Lizard. Don't kill them!

17
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,720
Careful!

18
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,020
Your Majesty.

19
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,740
I will take my leave.

20
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,840
- Your Supreme Majesty. 
 - You have served the punishment for your wrongdoings.

21
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,460
You could have remained in your palace. Why are you here?

22
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,160
Your Supreme Majesty, I have a favor to ask.

23
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,410
Why is your divine spirit damaged?

24
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,960
It's nothing major.

25
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,160
For a mere fairy, you went against the Heavenly Rules and got yourself badly injured.

26
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,940
Is she worth it?

27
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,680
Your Supreme Majesty, I was injured because I was ambushed in Night Forgetting River.

28
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,980
Knowing your power, you shouldn't be this badly wounded.

29
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,480
Who was the assailant?

30
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,580
I got some clues about the Divine-Devil War from Underworld King.

31
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,300
It differs from what's in the Heavenly Annals.

32
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,640
As I investigated further, a mysterious figure ambushed me.

33
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,480
Underground King was then killed.

34
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,220
I wish to enter the Mortal Realm to get to the bottom of this.

35
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,260
I am here to seek for your approval.

36
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,520
The Divine-Devil War is a serious subject for the Three Realms.

37
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,360
Many died in this battle.

38
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,900
If there is something more to it, it should be investigated thoroughly.

39
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,880
What is your plan?

40
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,100
After the war, some Devil Clan members snuck into Mortal Realm.

41
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,400
I wish to descend to Mortal Realm to investigate.

42
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,640
However, the war is history now.

43
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,140
If you conduct an investigation now, you'll attract gossip and rumors.

44
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,760
The peace of the Three Realms will be disrupted.

45
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,960
Have you thought about this?

46
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,600
Please be at ease, Your Supreme Majesty.

47
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,440
I will use the excuse of going through the Mortal Realm trials in order to conduct the investigation.

48
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,420
All right. I shall make an announcement

49
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,840
that Emperor Qingli of East Land, Ying Yuan, violated the Heavenly Rules,

50
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,340
and thus, will be subject to the Mortal Realm trials post-ascension ceremony.

51
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:58,000
I will preserve your memory and divine power so that you can efficiently carry out your tasks.

52
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,340
Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty.

53
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,880
But remember, even though you'll be in Mortal Realm, you are still subject to the Heavenly Rules.

54
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,100
I will arrange a love aversion training for you.

55
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,480
It will prevent you from being distracted and speed up your progress.

56
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,080
I understand.

57
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,780
What is that?

58
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,540
How can it bring the dead back to life?

59
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,360
It's called the "Extraordinary Eye".

60
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,220
"The Extraordinary Eye"?

61
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,400
Either way, you saved me again.

62
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,700
I don't know how to repay both instances of your kindness.

63
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,220
We were destined to meet. If you don't mind, let's form a brotherhood right here, right now.

64
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,800
What do you think?

65
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,420
You saved me just now too.

66
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,040
It is something I should do.

67
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,400
However, I have another matter to attend to now.

68
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,100
I shall get going.

69
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,560
Greetings, Mountain Chief!

70
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,380
On behalf of the demons of the Avian Clan, I sincerely greet you, Mountain Chief.

71
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,120
Mountain Chief,  greetings from the demons of the Flower Spirit Clan. 

72
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,120
 - Greetings, Mountain Chief. 
 - Salutations, from the Wolf Clan. 

73
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,920
 Greetings, Mountain Chief. 

74
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,380
What are you doing?

75
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,840
In Yelan Mountain, the strongest individual becomes the Mountain Chief.

76
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,940
Thanks to this panacea and power-boosting springs,

77
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,100
Prison Lizard reigned over the mountain and declared himself as the king.

78
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,300
But it's different now.

79
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,800
You killed him.

80
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,480
That means you are stronger than him.

81
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Naturally, you are our Mountain Chief now.

82
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,500
I was not born on this mountain, so I have no right to be its ruler.

83
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,440
It doesn't matter.

84
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,260
After Prison Lizard became the Mountain Chief, many demons were displaced and lost their home.

85
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,080
Your origin does not alter the fact that you're our hero.

86
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,520
It was you who eliminated the tyrant of this mountain.

87
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,720
We all are willing to accept your leadership.

88
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,900
Please do not decline our offer.

89
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,260
I saw you being hounded by your enemies.

90
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,080
Yelan Mountain is a great hiding spot.

91
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,340
Many demons gather here.

92
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,360
If you hide here, your enemies won't dare to pursue you further.

93
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,440
Isn't this a win-win situation?

94
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,120
I came to Mortal Realm is to search for a person.

95
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,560
It is an urgent matter that shouldn't be delayed.

96
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,020
That's more of a reason for you to stay!

97
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,100
All the clans here have lots of networks.

98
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,660
Once you become the Mountain Chief, all the demons will work for you.

99
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,860
They can locate grass or even a grain of sand for you, let alone a person.

100
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,400
I can stay, one one condition.

101
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,020
Say it.

102
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,260
I will do anything that's within my capability.

103
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,040
What is your name?

104
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,620
Zi Lin.

105
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,860
Everyone!  I can stand here because Zi Lin risked his life to save me.

106
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:11,220
All of you can stand here because Zi Lin fearlessly defended your rights.

107
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,920
Therefore, though everyone says that whoever kills Prison Lizard becomes the new mountain chief,

108
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,120
I believe this throne should be shared between us.

109
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,620
I...

110
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,660
From now on, you'll be in charge of external affairs.

111
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,100
What do you think?

112
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,680
You mean I'll deal with external affairs while you deal with internal affairs?

113
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,140
Brilliant idea!

114
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,720
May I know the name of the "insider"? 
  (T/N: "Insider" is another way to refer to his wife) 

115
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,380
"Insider"?

116
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,540
Yu Mo.

117
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,920
You have heard it!

118
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,540
Kneel before Mountain Chief Yu Mo now!

119
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,420
 Greetings, Mountain Chiefs. 

120
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,100
 Greetings, Mountain Chiefs. 

121
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,240
No need to be courteous.

122
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,740
From now on, we are a family.

123
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,320
There's no need for such formality here.

124
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,980
Bai Ling, from now on, you'll be the head of Internal Affairs.

125
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,800
Wounded patients are allowed to be treated in this spring.

126
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,000
You'll organize the proceedings.

127
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,100
I thank you for your faith in me, Mountain Chief. I will do my best.

128
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,000
Now that peace has been restored,

129
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,580
please dispatch messengers to notify the displaced demons.

130
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,940
If you run into mortals on your way down the mountain, do not hurt them.

131
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,720
I am the Mountain Chief.

132
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,380
Do good, and I'll make sure you live well.

133
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,460
Cause harm, and I'll make sure you pay the price.

134
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,960
 Understood! 

135
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,440
Your Majesty.

136
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,480
When Yan Dan was here,

137
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,300
what she wanted most was to see you rise in ranks.

138
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,080
I'm here to make her wish come true.

139
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,960
I heard you are going to Mortal Realm as another act of self-punishment.

140
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,600
Has Yan Dan crossed the Night Forgetting River?

141
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,400
Is she well?

142
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,760
Back then, she gave all she had for you,

143
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,920
but you wronged her.

144
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,840
Then she suffered more torture because of the fake registry.

145
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,920
Your concern is meaningless, at this point.

146
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,680
 Judging from his expression, was he too late? 

147
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,320
 Has Yan Dan turned into ashes? 

148
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:54,020
Everyone now believes that Fairy Zhi Xi gouged her heart out to save the Emperor.

149
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,920
She was then promoted.

150
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,100
But her sister, Yan Dan, was evil and tried to poison another fairy.

151
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,220
She bore the consequences.

152
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,980
Your wish has come true now.

153
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,940
From now on, you will have a comfortable life.

154
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,240
Fairy Zhi Xi. I wish you...

155
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,160
a prosperous and successful future.

156
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,000
Thank you...

157
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,100
Your Majesty.

158
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,740
I can't share this starry view...

159
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,180
with anyone again.

00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,160
Why am I flying?

161
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,200
Help!

162
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,400
My dear.

163
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,100
From now on, no one can separate us.

164
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,700
Yes.

165
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,540
- Help! 
 - Monster!

166
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,320
"Monster"?

167
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
Are they referring to me?

168
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,100
What's going on?

169
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,120
 Who am I? 

170
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,080
 Why am I here? 

171
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,600
 Why can't I recall anything? 

172
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,300

176
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,600

Since the day I left,

188
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,660
I have been longing for you.

189
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,920
I need help. Please play along.

190
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:59,300
Away from home for a decade... My dreams at night are all about our old memories.

191
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,020
I remember the misty weather, and the blue, shimmering waves.

192
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,380
When we met, we were young.

193
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,200
We have gone through so many autumns.

194
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,820
Even the wine has gone cold.

195
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,240
How can I make up for all these missing seasons?

196
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,640
But who knows my feelings as I ascend to this hall tonight?

197
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,220
- It's her!
- Catch her!

198
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,200
And so I came to this realization tonight:

199
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,760
After wandering around, I have reunited with you.

200
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,580
I will forgo my fame and honor so we can spend eternity together.

201
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,720
Though people will try to separate us, I will not leave you.

202
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,080
If I can be with you, I am not afraid of death.

203
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,760
Let's be lovers and cast away the wish to become deities.

204
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,220
The Prince of Andu is the guest of honor here!

205
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,820
Who dares to disrupt his enjoyment? Move aside!

206
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,020
The play was marvelous.

207
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,900
The prose you sang was elegant and touching.

208
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,480
Where did you get the story from?

209
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,320
I composed it myself.

210
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,220
You're quite a talented composer.

211
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:42,380
Would you like to stay in Liyuan with me to work on scripts and perform soul-moving plays?

212
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,760
 (T/N: "Liyuan" - Tang Dynasty's royal performing arts and music academy) 

213
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,020
That will do.

214
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,500
Let's stay here and look after each other.

215
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,340
What is your name?

216
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,900
I'm...

217
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,640
Bai Piaoliang!
 (T/N: meaning "Just Beautiful") 

218
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,080
Yes, Bai Piaoliang.

219
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,540
Hurry up!

220
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,120
You were on shift last night.

221
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,020
Something went missing in the pavilion yesterday.

222
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,800
The tributary divine tool from Underworld Realm, Sonic Bat, went missing.

223
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,920
Where is it?

224
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,400
Tell me!

225
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,060
I do not know.

226
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,580
You were on duty here all night yesterday.

227
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,420
How can you pledge ignorance?

228
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,520
Unless... are you the thief?

229
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,320
You received a promotion and are now undermining authority.

230
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,900
You even ignore my questions.

231
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:09,200
As Vice Curator of Magical Pavilion, you failed to safeguard the divine tools.

232
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
Do you admit your mistake?

233
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,520
I made a huge mistake that cost my sister's life.

234
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,920
I don't have the presence of mind to do my duties anymore.

235
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,320
Please punish me as you deem fit.

236
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,040
Punishment?

237
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,320
Then you will be disappointed.

238
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:44,520
I'll keep you here, so you'll forever be reminded that you have what you have now

239
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,620
at the cost of her life.

240
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,540
 Attention, Magical Pavilion! 

241
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,560
Emperor Qingli, Ying Yuan, will descend to Mortal Realm soon.

242
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,520
Please prepare any protective divine tools for His Majesty's use.

243
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,200
Why is His Majesty suddenly going to the Mortal Realm?

244
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,460
His Majesty defied His Supreme Majesty and went against the Heavenly Rules.

245
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:19,160
His Supreme Majesty then ordered His Majesty to go through mortal trials through the Pool of Eight Hardships.

246
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,940
We'll put this on hold.

247
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,420
All of you, prepare the divine tools now.

248
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,180
 Yes. 

249
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,840
You are useless.

250
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,660
 Your Majesty. 

251
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,660
Your Majesty, you always took care of us in Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

252
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:39,380
Now that you're demoted to Mortal Realm, we cannot sit by and do nothing.

253
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,180
These divine tools will help you in the Mortal Realm.

254
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,240
Please take them with you.

255
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,600
Your Majesty, the Mortal Realm is full of unknown dangers.

256
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,580
The Magical Pavilion has selected several divine tools for you.

257
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,400
Please take them for protection, Your Majesty.

258
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,820
I will carry nothing with me.

259
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,580
Please return.

260
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,180
Your Majesty!

261
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,060
I wonder if you'll take this with you.

262
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,060
His Supreme Majesty asked me to see you off.

263
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,420
It's a lotus seed from the Jade Pool.

264
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,720
If you plant it in Mortal Realm, it will definitely grow into something beautiful.

265
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,780
I hope the sight of it will bring solace to you in the Mortal Realm, Your Majesty.

266
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,420
All right.

267
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,500
I'll keep it.

268
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:01,680
Your Majesty, you refuse to take our offerings, but you treasure that mere seed.

269
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,480
Does the seed have some other significance?

270
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,340
If you do not explain, we will all be disappointed.

271
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,940
I don’t care how you feel.

272
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,540
 We won’t delay your departure, Your Majesty. 

273
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,740
Thank you for intervening, Your Majesty.

274
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,060
I wonder if Yan Dan is doing well.

275
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,590
She is in the Mortal Realm now.

276
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,860
Since her memory was forcefully removed, she can only be a demon now.

277
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,580
A demon?

278
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,680
That's not bad. They live a long life.

279
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,940
I'm sure she'll be able to live more freely.

280
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,440
Who would have thought that I would go to Mortal Realm too?

281
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:11,040
If I find her, I'll bring you news of her when I return.

282
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

283
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,680
The mortals are made of flesh.

284
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,820
Their bodies can't contain the power of the Greater Gods.

285
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,140
When an immortal enters the Mortal Realm to go through mortal trials,

286
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,300
they create a divine vest to protect their immortal spirit, in case their mortal body bursts open.

287
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:36,240
Therefore, Your Majesty must take good care of the divine vest, and also Yan Dan.

288
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,360
I know.

289
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,900
You have to go through the Eight Hardships in the trials of the Mortal Realm.

290
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,720
I wish you all the best, Your Majesty.

291
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,840
Compared to what she went through in Night  Forgetting River...

292
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,200
this is nothing.

293
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,840
Farewell, Your Majesty.

00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,940
♫   The wind becomes the monument for lovers   ♫

317
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,800
It sure feels different being a Mountain Chief.

318
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,060
Everything looks better than usual.

319
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,180
Stop! Stop! Hey! Stop!

320
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,800
- What are you doing? 
 - What?

321
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,080
I just asked you to be the mountain chief. It’s not a big deal!

322
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,980
- I... 
 - If you die, how will I rule the mountain by myself?

323
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,480
It's okay.

324
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,200
Let's renounce our titles and forget it.

325
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
Let me go.

326
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,400
I won’t!

327
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,600
I won't kill myself.

328
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,720
I'll be the Mountain Chief, all right?

329
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,000
The mark on my wrist was left by the person I'm looking for.

330
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,100
I'm using a spell to combine my blood and her spiritual power.

331
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:57,620
Fish will gather here, pick up her scent,

332
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,740
swim along the current, and track her down.

333
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,820
The world is vast.

334
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,900
How much blood do you have to drain to find her?

335
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,280
I don't like your self-harming way of finding someone.

336
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,140
Let's find another solution.

337
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,340
I would do anything to find her.

338
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,680
How romantic of you.

339
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,620
The person you're looking for must be a demon.

340
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,720
What is this?

341
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,440
What's going on?

342
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,000
No way.

343
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,720
Did I work too much these two days?

344
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,580
Oh, no!

345
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,740
It is already bad enough that I lost my memories at such a young age.

346
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,640
And now I'm becoming ugly?

347
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,440
A fish with a pink mark?

348
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,960
Maybe Heaven heard my plea and sent me the solution.

349
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,600
As they say, "Eat the part to cure the part."

350
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,320
After I ate this fish, my beauty has been restored!

351
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,720
No. I have to get more of them.

352
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,260
Why would that old man want to attack me with a wooden sword?

353
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,600
Was the fish his pet?

354
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,560
Mister...

355
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,480
I should run.

356
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,300
The Southern Capital is populated.

357
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,240
This demon is using her power recklessly.

358
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,360
She might frighten the mortals.

359
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,500
Seriously? It was just one fish. No need to chase me like that.

360
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,980
Does he have to make a big deal out of this?

361
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,300
This demon is weak but smart.

362
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:22,240
   

363
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,540
Fairy Zhi Xi, are you in charge of this year's divine tool replacement for all palaces?

364
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,540
Fairy Ying Deng is about to be promoted to be His Supreme Majesty's assistant.

365
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,540
She has a lot on her plate, so she entrusts trivial matters to me.

366
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,780
In that case, you'll be the curator once she leaves.

367
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,340
There have been no new people in Magical Pavilion for a century.

368
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,040
It's time for a change in ranks.

369
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,900
Indeed. It is time.

370
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,120
Your Supreme Majesty, fellow deities,

371
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,480
I am Ying Deng, Curator of Magical Pavilion.

372
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,100
The bicentennial replacement of divine tools,

373
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:35,640
disposal of waste, and the allocation of items have always been under my care.

374
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,940
Since I'm about to leave the Pavilion,

375
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:44,100
I fear that my successor will mess things up due to her lack of experience.

376
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:50,080
Therefore, before I step down, I have prepared new divine tools for all of you.

377
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,240
I appreciate your efforts, Fairy Ying Deng.

378
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,900
What a delicate object.

379
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,980
What is that divine tool?

380
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,200
Your Supreme Majesty, that is the artifact I prepared for Emperor Ying Yuan.

381
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,660
He is going through the trials in Mortal Realm.

382
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,380
He'll be able to use it when he returns.

383
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,600
Good.

384
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,220
I'm glad you served him in Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

385
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,860
Bring it here.

386
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,340
This belt sure smells pleasant.

387
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,980
I concocted this Poluo Perfume myself.

388
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,680
It is refreshing and can help you focus. It's perfect for one's health recovery.

389
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,520
You are very thoughtful.

390
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,000
Wait.

391
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,600
One jade buckle is missing from this belt!

392
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,920
Perhaps...

393
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,340
I overlooked something.

394
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,580
Please forgive me.

395
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,520
Your Supreme Majesty, Curator Ying Deng has always been attentive to His Majesty's well-being.

396
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,320
She is very meticulous too, so she would never make such a simple mistake.

397
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,020
I think someone might have stolen the jade buckle.

398
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,140
Please elaborate.

399
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,300
Your Supreme Majesty, Magical Pavilion was robbed a while ago.

400
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,420
Curator Ying Deng did not want to raise concern, so she didn't report it.

401
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,960
A similar event has occurred again.

402
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,520
Someone must be after Magical Pavilion now.

403
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,780
Please help us, Your Supreme Majesty.

404
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,840
His Supreme Majesty has to handle many affairs every day.

405
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,760
Such a trivial matter can be dealt with internally.

406
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,960
It is not a concern, Your Supreme Majesty.

407
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,660
Fairy Ying Deng, you have worked tirelessly for Magical Pavilion.

408
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:13,360
It would be unjust if you were to take the blame for submitting mediocre divine tools.

409
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:23,220
Your Supreme Majesty, if there truly is a criminal in the Nine Heavens...

410
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,320
Please remain here.

411
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,560
Curator Ying Deng, weren't you trying to identify who stole the Sonic Bat?

412
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,300
Now that we have help from the Heavenly Soldiers, you must be overjoyed.

413
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,280
What's with your sulking face?

414
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:27,480
Do you have something you don't want to be discovered?

415
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,460
So it was you who messed with the belt.

416
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,060
You collected so many of His Majesty's belongings.

417
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,580
I'm just learning from you.

418
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,380
What do you want to do?

419
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,500
I should ask you that question.

420
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,720
Poluo Perfume is made from clover and elm extract.

421
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,720
It does have a restorative effect, but once you increase the dosage of each ingredient

422
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,960
and mix it with several other medicinal herbs,

423
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,140
you'll get the seductive yet forbidden perfume, Lovesick.

424
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,280
So what if you know that exists?

425
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,860
I didn't add those extra ingredients.

426
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,660
You cannot prove that I'm guilty.

427
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,340
Just because you didn't do it doesn't mean I can't.

428
00:42:51,500 --> 00:43:01,550
