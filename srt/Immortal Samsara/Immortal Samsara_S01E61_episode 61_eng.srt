1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,000
   
   

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,430
Wait for me!

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,900
Hurry, come this way!

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,360
Wait up.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,540
- Slow down, slow down. 
- Hurry up!

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,500
Mountain Chief, the troublemaker from the neighboring mountain came here again to catch fish and shrimp!

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,680
Hurry and do something!

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:33,980
🐢 ~ Our Turtle Flipping Deity team thanks you for watching with us ~ 🐢

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,020
Heitu, why are you only getting here now? Hurry, come help me.

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,820
Little Gou Dan, why do you suddenly want to eat fish? 
  (T/N: Gou Dan means Rascal) 

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,660
Today is my mother's birthday.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,200
She said that the food she craved the most in the first half of her life was fish,

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,980
so I want to catch two big fish for her.

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,000
Judging by the way you tried to do it, I'm guessing you haven't been cultivating hard enough.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,160
What? Didn't your father teach you properly?

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,460
Come here.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,700
Now, you stay here and watch how I do it. Okay?

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,000
The fish are here! The fish are here!

19
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,100
Happy birthday, Mother!

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,580
Thank you, Gou Dan.

21
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,300
But the fish is so big.

22
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,780
You didn't steal it from the market, did you?

23
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,580
Of course not! I caught it from the river at Yelan Mountain.

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,330
Really? Then how come I heard that Mountain Chief Yu never lets anyone catch fish in his territory?

25
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,180
Well, that's because I had a good helper!

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,640
Helper? Who was it?

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,340
I don't really know who he is. I call him Heitu.

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,840
Gou Dan, remember what I'm saying. The next time you meet this "Heitu", you need to thank him. Understood?

29
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,260
Understood.

30
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,700
Good boy. Let's eat now.

31
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,860
Come on. Have some more.

32
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,320
   

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,000
   
   

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,200
The immortal melon planted by Lu Ming is finally ripe.

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,250
Let's eat the melon while watching the play for a moment.

36
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,640
- Okay? 
 - All right. 
 - Sure.

37
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,520
What are you looking at?!

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm here for that brat, Ying Yuan.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,400
You can't let the other Divine Officials know that I'm here today...

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,760
You've become a big fan of plays after you retired.

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,270
When have you ever missed a play when the Troupe Zhenxi is here?

42
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,440
Just admit it.

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,560
You know about it already?

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,800
Let the show begin!

45
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,430
I won!

46
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,100
Zi Lin, give me the spiritual power.

47
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,900
What spiritual power?

48
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,540
We made a bet on who would get married first, Zhao Lan or Yu Mo.

49
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,300
This is all your fault. Why couldn't you try harder?

50
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,280
My father forced me to have men joust to be my spouse.

51
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,560
I didn't expect that I would meet someone who could make my heart flutter.

52
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,060
Zhao Lan, you shouldn't mind his nonsense.

53
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,000
This is great news. Congratulations.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,740
- Congratulations. 
 - Exactly! Congratulations!

55
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,460
Zhao Lan, congratulations.

56
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,040
Thank you.

57
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,780
Zhao Lan, congratulations.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,680
Yan Dan, where is that demon, Prince Troublemaker?

59
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,520
What Prince Troublemaker?

60
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,400
My Gou Dan went fishing with Zi Yan.

61
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,820
I'm telling you, you need to discipline him more often.

62
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:29,080
Every time he sees me, he becomes like a certain person. He gets that gleam in his eye, thinking about how to flip me.

63
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,220
You don't know, but your Gou Dan is just like her.

64
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,420
He is still so little, but he loves trying to find someone to support him.

65
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,640
Don't give him some random nicknames.

66
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,720
Besides, I don't rely on anyone now.

67
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,990
I set up Troupe Zhenxi and took in those homeless demons.

68
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,760
You're also the King of All Demons.

69
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,140
You should be thanking me, instead of raking my past up.

70
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,060
- Exactly. 
 - Fine.

71
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,280
Okay. I think it's almost time.

72
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,800
Everyone be seated. The show is about to begin.

73
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,600
Sit.

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,800
Here, have some tea.

75
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,600
Are you Yan Dan?

76
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,240
That's me...

77
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,640
Why are you...

78
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,480
It's really you, Novelist Yan Dan?

79
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,240
I've always been a fan of your plays!

80
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,260
I collected many excerpts from your plays and made a book, "Samsara Collection".

81
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,340
I've read it so many times, and every time I do, I'm always moved to tears.

82
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,960
May I have your autograph?

83
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,350
I'd like to keep it for memory's sake.

84
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,340
Of course.
