 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,439
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai advises people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,759
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,970
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,479
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,279
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,000
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,470
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,900
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,270
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,340
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,200
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,679
   

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,950
   

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,080
I go to the battlefield to command spiritual beasts and cast spells against the enemy.

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,139
I'm not there to be stabbed or rained on. Why are you so nervous?

18
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:41,799
Look at the big bag you've prepared.

19
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,339
There are medicine, clothing, and many things more, the only thing missing is a coffin.

20
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,899
How ominous. Take it back.

21
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,940
I-Immortal Lord!

22
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,019
With Emperor Ying Yuan leading the army, what's there to be worried about?

23
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:59,719
Probably the Devil Clan will surrender by tomorrow.

24
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,900
If you really care about me, please take care of the spiritual beasts in this pond for me.

25
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,739
The two little dragons are going to transform into immortals.

26
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,839
Plus, it's also the crucial moment for the little black fish to turn into a human form.

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,179
Do feed them with enough spiritual medicine every day.

28
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,639
- Understood? 
- Understood.

29
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,040
Also...

30
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,619
All right. I know.

31
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:27,039
By the way, it's almost time.

32
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,319
You should set off now.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,740
- Have you remembered everything I said? 
- Yes, I have.

34
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,480
Very good.

35
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,080
 Greetings, Your Supreme Majesty. 

36
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:07,899
Thanks to the ancient deities and the late martyrs, we've all been blessed with peace and harmony for years.

37
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:12,680
However, the devils and evil spirits have redeployed to war.

38
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,519
The balance of the world mustn't be ruined.

39
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,180
Today, I assign Emperor Qingli of East Land, Ying Yuan, to lead the army,

40
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,679
assisted by Emperor Zhao Sheng, the Greater Deity Purple Star,

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,799
Emperor Wan Yue of Pleasure and Virtue,

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,460
Primordial Divine Emperor, Chang Sheng,

43
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,180
Star Deity Ji Du, Huan Qin, and Immortal Lord Bei Ming.

44
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,620
They will be leading millions of divine soldiers to the battlefield.

45
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,540
This battle must clean up the Six Realms.

46
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,720
The Four Emperors assisted me in the War of Genesis.

47
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,940
After this battle, all treacherous evils must be wiped out and peace restored.

48
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:09,500
 With the deity's blessings, all Six Realms will be in peace. 

49
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,959
 Under the command of the Greater Deity, victory is in sight. 

50
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,640
 May the Six Realms be in eternal peace. 

51
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:37,900
 Victory goes to the Divine Realm and the Deity Realm. 

52
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,160
 The Northern area of the Divine Realm is the weakest point of the Heaven-Devil barrier. 

53
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,200
 Are they going to... 

54
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,799
You go to the Devil Realm as planned.

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
I need to check on something.

56
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,700
I'll join you later.

57
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,560
Soldiers. Let's go!

58
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,300
 Yes. 

59
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,139
Luckily, all the heavenly generals and soldiers have gone on the war expedition, therefore, it's not guarded.

60
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,679
The Sacred Temple has always been guarded by us, Merfolk Clan.

61
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,939
If we sneak in here without permission, it's a violation of the Heavenly Rules.

62
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:45,039
It's a violation of the law only when someone finds us.

63
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,340
However, at this late hour, who will see us?

64
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,780
If you want to make a wish, you should do it under the shooting star.

65
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,540
If anything happens, I-I'll be doomed.

66
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,879
Don't worry, we won't get you involved.

67
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,360
Even if the sky caves in, Yan Dan and I will be there to defend it.

68
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,079
- Let's go. 
- Come on.

69
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,770
   

70
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,339
Four Emperors, please bless upon me from any misfortune and accidents.

71
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,060
Do you really come here to make a wish?

72
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,039
Didn't you say that you had already wished upon a shooting star and your wish had come true?

73
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,640
How could they be the same?

74
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,199
This place is where all deities and immortals come to make wishes.

75
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,300
This place must be more powerful.

76
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,499
I just finished "The Tale of The Genesis Hero" and the Jade Pool Festivity is around the corner.

77
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:45,739
I'd like to wish upon the ancient deities to bless us for triumphing over others.

78
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,240
Seriously?

79
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,919
But, since we're here, it'd be a great loss not to draw inspiration from here.

80
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,400
Come on.

81
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:11,479
“Wish Emperor Ying Yuan all the best and may he pass by my place every day.”
   

82
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,320
It's Fairy Meng Li.

83
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Fairy Meng Li is a true beauty, but why is she so blind?

84
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,160
Didn't you say that Emperor Ying Yuan likes to help others?

85
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,879
He can be a good option as your backer.

86
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,960
Why do we not consider him?

87
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,160
Does he have an ugly face?

88
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,000
He has an... ordinary look.

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,959
Most importantly, he's dull and rigid.

90
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,499
He talks about the Heavenly Rules all the time and set many restrictions.

91
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:43,060
Yet, he has drawn so much affection.

92
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,199
Stop idling here.

93
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,319
Go over there and check things out.

94
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,840
Perhaps you might get some good ideas for our play.

95
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,800
Go ahead.

96
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,120
 May the Six Realms return to peace. 

97
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,420
Indeed, there has such a boring character in this world.

98
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,460
 I'll repay my gratitude to Immortal Lord Bei Ming for raising me. 

99
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,150
 Wish Yan Dan always be happy. 

100
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,579
What did you write? Show me.

101
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:47,959
How petty of you, Little Black Fish.

102
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,480
You're not showing me, it must be a secret?

103
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,839
Don't tell me you have athlete's foot?

104
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,120
Nonsense.

105
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,460
I wrote "Wish Yan Dan always be happy".

106
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,900
Only a fool believes that.

107
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,440
How come you have so many wishes?

108
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,359
Why did you peek at my wishes?

109
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,759
It's not easy to make it here.

110
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,480
Of course, I need to make enough wishes.

111
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,359
Turn away from me. Don't look at me.

112
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:17,360
How petty of you.

113
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,800
 First, I have a lot of wishes and all of them should come true. 

114
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,180
 Second, I want to be the most successful screenwriter in the Six Realms 

115
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,079
 and "The Tale of The Genesis Hero" would triumph over others. 

116
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,940
 May Zhi Xi succeed in the ascension examination.  

117
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,880
 Third, 

118
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,980
 wish Yu Mo always be happy. 

119
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,900
 Fourth, Tortoise-Flipping Man makes a fool of himself in the battle. 

120
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,059
 All the fairies will restore their sanity and see through his true nature. 

121
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,360
   
  

122
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,240
 Fifth, may the Six Realms return to peace. 

123
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,980
 Emperor Ying Yuan annihilates the devils and returns safe and sound. 

124
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,679
Oh my heaven! The sky is going to collapse.

125
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,959
What have you done?

126
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,559
This huge pillar is the main support of the Sacred Temple. Once it collapses, the Sacred Temple will cave in.

127
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,119
The Sacred Temple is the backbone of the Jade Pool.

128
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,939
If it falls down, the Jade Pool will overturn in a second and flood the Nine Heavens.

129
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:04,359
It's the sin of genocide.

130
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,199
We did nothing but sit here writing wishes.

131
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,520
That's right. The Sacred Temple connects the Divine and the Mortal Realms.

132
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,619
Does the Devil Clan intend to flood the Divine Realm after the Mortal Realm is being occupied?

133
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:16,419
Oh, Heavens. We're doomed!

134
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,960
You are here as expected.

135
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,140
You failed to destroy the barrier, so you tried to knock down the pillar of the Sacred Temple instead.

136
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,019
If the pillar collapses, it'll not only deteriorate the crack of the barrier

137
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,679
but also the Divine Realm will be flooded by the water of the Jade Pool and fall into chaos.

138
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:18,640
The weakening of the barrier shows that it's Heaven's will to help the Devil Clan change course.

139
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,220
Even if you're an Emperor, you can't stop the fading power of the barrier.

140
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,980
Without the barrier,

141
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,059
there's no way you immortals can rule the Six Realms and have the Heavenly Emperor dominate the Six Realms.

142
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:34,760
Xuan Xiang. If you're unwilling to live under the reign of the Deity and the Divine Realm,

143
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,780
I'm more than happy to challenge you today to see who's the strongest.

144
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,859
It's not necessary to wage a war involving the army of three realms. That will lead to chaos in the entire world.

145
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:46,400
What good does it do to you?

146
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,840
You're wrong.

147
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,639
I don't care about who's the strongest between us.

148
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,059
What I want is chaos in the Six Realms and the death of all living beings.

149
00:12:56,059 --> 00:13:01,179
Divine rules have been unfair, I'll destroy it and bring a new order to the world.

150
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,759
Emperor Ying Yuan, you're standing high above everything.

151
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:10,359
Have you ever thought about why the Devil Clan must be born to be inferior to the Divine Clan?

152
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:14,000
Why should the Devil Clan live under your jurisdiction?

153
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,899
Why can the Heavenly Emperor dominate the Six Realms while I'm only worthy of being a lowly slave?

154
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,679
No one has ever treated you as a slave.

155
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,540
Ran Qing cast this barrier to suppress the Devil Clan for thousands of years.

156
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:33,220
We are forcibly grounded in this deadly territory and spied on by envoys from the Divine Realm.

157
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,580
You Divine Clan has always suppressed and guarded against us.

158
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,640
If I don't revolt, I'll be on the chopping block sooner or later.

159
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:35,160
Ten thousand years ago, if Supreme God hadn't ended the War of Genesis, the Devil Clan would've perished long ago.

160
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,779
In recent years, you've been expanding your territories and plundering the divine tools from the Divine Realm.

161
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,560
In order to avoid disasters, His Supreme Majesty has never punished you for that.

162
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,700
All you've received from the Deity and the Divine Realm is grace, we owe you nothing.

163
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,020
We Devil's Clan would rather not have this grace.

164
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,359
We'll fight for what we deserve.

165
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,000
Turns out you're using your clan's well-being as an excuse for your own greed.

166
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,380
In the end, all your clansmen will sacrifice because of it.

167
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,080
 I don't care how you slander me. 

168
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,780
 We'll find out who is the winner on the battlefield. 

169
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,939
Are you insane?

170
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:34,859
The pillar is massive, yet you're trying to fix it with your body which is just a lotus stem.

171
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:36,839
You're throwing straw against the wind.

172
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,059
You might end up in your original form and your primordial spirit will perish.

173
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:41,560
Yu Mo!

174
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,619
How could you indulge her? She's a Four-leaf Lotus at least.

175
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:47,879
- So what? 
 - But you're merely a little black fish!

176
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,479
"You throw me a peach, repay with a beautiful jade."

177
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,079
I've told you that I will stay with Yan Dan.

178
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Even if the sky is going to fall down, we'll defend it!

179
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,879
Even if we end up dying, I'll die with her.

180
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,279
As expected of you, my friend. Well done!

181
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,040
Fine.

182
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,120
Since you're not afraid of death, I'll join forces.

183
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,700
Hurry up, perform the Xiaohan Scriptures!

184
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,119
I'll use the Heaven's Secret first.

185
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,780
No way.

186
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,359
The ancient cultivation method is completely different from the current one.

187
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,700
You can't perform the spell by memorizing it.

188
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,719
Hurry! Reverse your operation.

189
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,719
  Use the Heaven's Will first, then the Heaven's Secret. 

190
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,120
Assemble.

191
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,280
Huan Qin, you've been hiding here for several days, intending to join forces with Ying Yuan to defeat my Devil army.

192
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,100
We were aware of you and used you as bait. Seizing you today is like shooting a fish in a barrel.

193
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,720
You Four Emperors used to guard each other's back and fought side by side.

194
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,640
How come today, they don't even dare to come to collect your dead body?

195
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,920
Xuan Xiang,  fifty thousand divine soldiers have already undone your Devil troop in the capital.

196
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,400
You have no more support behind you. Surrender now.

197
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,380
I'd like to offer my blood and flesh as Gods' sacrifice.

198
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,340
I humbly plead for the ultimate power to turn over the primordial spirit of the universe.

199
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,520
Huan Qin.

200
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,660
Ying Yuan!

201
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,840
Ying Yuan!

202
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,040
Ying Yuan!

203
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,640
Ying Yuan.

204
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,760
Your eyes.

205
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,680
I'm fine.

206
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,440
I made a hasty move just now.

207
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,439
I didn't expect that the Nine-Tailed Hydra could be so poisonous under the enhancement of the Eye of Devils.

208
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:44,480
Once someone touches it, the poison will penetrate the body.

209
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,039
You must go to the Heavenly Infirmary for treatment immediately.

210
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,399
No. I'm the commander.

211
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,219
We just settled our territory and Xuan Xiang is still at large. How could I leave now?

212
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:52,700
But...

213
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,180
Are you all right? I'm fine.

214
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,539
We shall eliminate the devils now. You two chase after them right away.

215
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,559
We've already defeated the enemy's rear defense and Xuan Xiang is fleeing now.

216
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,900
We have won the war.

217
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,219
Now, your injury is what matters the most. You can't delay the treatment.

218
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:14,700
He's right, Ying Yuan.

219
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,559
I'll send someone to escort you back to the Heavenly Court immediately.

220
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,679
Say no more.

221
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,439
This war's importance is beyond everything. Just chase after him.

222
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,360
Go!

223
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,519
- All right. 
- Got it.

224
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,619
Your Majesty!

225
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,620
   

226
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,180
   

227
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:24,380
   

228
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,819
Sure. I got it.

229
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,400
What good food did you bring me this time?

230
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,080
You've been serving in Yanxu Heavenly Palace some time now.

231
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,719
Plus, it's wartime at the moment.

232
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,759
How can you still being so indolent without thinking about how to improve yourself?

233
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,939
Deputy Curator Zhi Xi came here today is to collect the divine tools for healing after the war.

234
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:08,039
You have stayed by His Majesty's side to serve, so you should know well about its location.

235
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,160
Please lead the way.

236
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,440
Sure.

237
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,479
Forget it. I know you're occupied with work.

238
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:20,699
Although you didn't bring me delicious food, I've prepared a surprise for you.

239
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:23,819
You haven't come to visit me for quite some time, the present has been with me for a long time.

240
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:27,719
I'm your older sister as well as the Deputy Curator of Magical Pavilion.

241
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,460
I'll get anything I want by myself.

242
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,500
A short while later, the wounded soldiers will arrive at Heavenly Infirmary.

243
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,620
Let's get the business done as fast as possible.

244
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,000
Got it.

245
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,479
I'm so sorry. I didn't know it'd be such an emergency.

246
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,796
I'll lead you to get the divine tools now.

247
00:32:46,796 --> 00:32:48,145
Let's go.

248
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,500
I haven't got the Crimson Cloud Cauldron and the Golden Satin.

249
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,119
I haven't seen these two divine tools before.

250
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,980
Tortoise-Flipping Man never mentioned them either.

251
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,520
Sister, are you sure they're stored here?

252
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,879
The Magical Pavilion never makes any mistakes in the records.

253
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,900
It's your negligence as you're not familiar with the divine tools yet.

254
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,520
 Since I lost half of my Lotus stem, my primordial spirit has been impaired.  

255
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,599
 My cultivation has reduced half of its power. 

256
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,600
 My strength has severely declined too. 

257
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,460
You're amazing, Sister.

258
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,779
You're clumsy.

259
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:04,279
You'll only take care of yourself after a few falls.

260
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,899
First, do the Heaven's Will. Then, the Heaven's Secret.

261
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:10,759
Did you practice as I told you last time? Has the strength been improved?

262
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:12,700
Come on, sing me praises.

263
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,950
Cold Dawn Scriptures is an advanced divine art.

264
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:19,660
I practice it because of my duty's statues in Magical Pavilion.

265
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,167
You're merely an immortal attendant in charge of cleaning.

266
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:26,399
You're not even familiar with the locations of the divine tools in this palace, yet you're studying these scriptures.

267
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,520
This is ignoring the priority of your work.

268
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,359
That's not it.

269
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,929
When I was copying the scriptures, I found some mistakes...

270
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:37,959
His Majesty asked you to copy the scriptures, not to learn them secretly.

271
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,439
There are rules and orders in the Divine Realm.

272
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,910
Everyone has their own task and rules to obey.

273
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,149
Amidst the War of Genesis,

274
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,499
His Supreme Majesty gouged his flesh in order to save the ancient Blood Eagle clan.

275
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:52,560
That’s how Blood Eagle Clan’s bloodline can carry on.

276
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,359
However, His Supreme Majesty has a permanent crescent scar.

277
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:59,760
Can you ever achieve what they did?

278
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:09,379
You can have a carefree life during this war because the Greater Deities sacrifice themselves to protect the Divine Realm.

279
00:35:09,379 --> 00:35:15,140
Ever since the war commenced, I've been sending divine tools and medicine to the battlefield nonstop.

280
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,519
However, you're idling around as usual.

281
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,340
You can't even manage your duty.

282
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,720
I-I’m not idling around.

283
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,719
I'm not familiar with those divine tools that have not been frequently used.

284
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,640
You don't have to explain to me.

285
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,480
You're a grown-up. You should know your responsibility.

286
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,939
I'm going back to the Heavenly Infirmary with these divine tools.

287
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,360
Sister...

288
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,879
Yan Dan is indeed smart.

289
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,680
I still can't master the scriptures no matter how much effort I put in,

290
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,899
 - but she can pick up the skill in a short time. 
 - Yan Dan? 

291
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:20,819
Of course. Yan Dan is much smarter than her older sister, Zhi Xi.

292
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,180
Stop gossiping here.

293
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,040
She and I are different.

294
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,820
No need to make a comparison.

295
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,920
   

296
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,939
How's the war? Did we win?

297
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,940
Then, what's with this look?

298
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,300
We paid a huge price for this victory.

299
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:05,820
Since the War of Genesis, we have never lost so many superior immortal and greater deities.

300
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,460
What about Emperor Ying Yuan?

301
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,740
   

302
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,280
Huan Qin.

303
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,680
Huan Qin.

304
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,480
 Huan Qin. Huan Qin. 

305
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,379
 Does it mean that none of the greater deities who went to war survived except Emperor Ying Yuan? 

306
00:38:08,379 --> 00:38:11,240
 Even Star Deity Ji Du died on the battlefield. 

307
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,699
 Not only that, the Four Divine Tools have gone missing in the war. 

308
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:19,960
As many as eighty thousand divine generals and soldiers died.

309
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,379
When the divine soldiers sent Emperor Ying Yuan back, they said everything went well.

310
00:38:23,379 --> 00:38:25,180
How is this happening?

311
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,540
   

312
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,430
 Your Majesty. 

313
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,839
Where are the three Emperors? Where are Huan Qin and the rest?

314
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,199
Your Majesty, the war has ended.

315
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,819
At least, it’s a good ending.

316
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,839
The only thing you need to do now is to get some rest and recuperate.

317
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,959
If your emotions are unstable, the poison will spread faster throughout your body.

318
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,439
Answer me.

319
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,039
Before I left, the Devil Realm had already been wiped out.

320
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,059
Why are there so many casualties? Or did you misreport the situation?

321
00:38:56,059 --> 00:38:59,519
The fire poison has intruded into his heart. His Majesty...His Majesty is going to be possessed by the devil.

322
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,519
Answer me. Tell me.

323
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,759
The news has spread through the Divine Realm and His Supreme Majesty has made an announcement.

324
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:11,599
It's said that Xuan Xiang, the Devil King, caught the three Emperors and Star Deity Ju Di off guard and lured our army into the Illusion of Devils.

325
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,220
Therefore... Therefore...

326
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,000
Your Majesty.

327
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,820
I shouldn't have left them.

328
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,580
I shouldn't have left them.

329
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,700
I shouldn't have left them.

330
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,439
I shouldn't have left them.

331
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,139
Your Majesty. You can't get emotional.

332
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:34,960
Don't touch me!

333
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,539
His Majesty is going insane. Inform His Supreme Majesty right now!

334
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,940
 The Divine-Devil War caused heavy casualties. 

335
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,739
 Many comrades from the old days with whom I had fought together  

336
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:31,600
 have sacrificed, leaving me to live a petty life alone. 

337
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,060
 I am grateful for being appointed to lead the army. 

338
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,879
 However, I was tricked by the enemy and led our men into chaos. 

339
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:43,680
 I feel I am a disgrace and unworthy of remaining in the Nine Heavens. 

340
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,780
 Having the poison penetrate my bones is my punishment from Heaven and I shall endure it. 

341
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,080
 I won't harm the Divine Realm with this sick body. 

342
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,880
 I will leave this place with great remorse. 

343
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,060
 I only wish Your Supreme Majesty happiness. 

344
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:02,700
 Please don't search for me. Please forget me. From Ying Yuan. 

345
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,940
Is the fire poison incurable?

346
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,299
It's difficult to heal his injury. We've tried our best, but we can merely make His Majesty feel less pain. We are only delaying the time before the poison comes into effect.

347
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,679
However... However, His Majesty was overwhelmed with grief and refused to receive treatments.

348
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:20,340
Ying Yuan is always intransigent.

349
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,760
He's resenting himself now.

350
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:29,280
If we force him to come back, I'm afraid he might kill himself out of remorse.

351
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,880
We won the war and need to send a message to the public.

352
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,439
If the news of Emperor Ying Yuan being infected by fire poison spreads out, I'm afraid it might cause a commotion in all realms.

353
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:41,719
The Jade Pool Festivity is around the corner.

354
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,120
The Demon, Devil, and Underworld Realms suffered catastrophic damage,

355
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,320
Your Supreme Majesty, please set new orders in the Six Realms.

356
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,039
Ying Yuan has recovered from the injury.

357
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:58,999
However, he blames himself for the tragic losses and has decided to travel the lower realms. He will return.

358
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,700
Understood.

359
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,620
As for the Six Realms,

360
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:12,380
the current Nine Heavens have no more Greater Gods left except Ying Yuan and me,

361
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,700
The Deity Realm is like an empty shell.

362
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:23,659
From today onwards, the Deity Realm and the Divine Realm are combined into the Heavenly Realm.

363
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:30,539
 The Underworld Realm was razed to the ground amid the war and no longer exists. 

364
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:37,020
 The Devil Clan offended the gods several times and even started a war to rebel. 

365
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:42,659
 All the perpetrators will be imprisoned in the Life and Death Arena of Forgetting Night River, forever and ever. 

366
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:46,179
 The land of the Demon Clan and the war-related territories of the Devil Realm  

367
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:51,420
 will be combined with the mortals' world, collectively referred to as the Mortal Realm. 

368
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,440
 The war-raging Six Realms is in the past. 

369
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,879
From now on, only have the Heavenly, the Mortal, and the Devil Realms.

370
00:43:16,879 --> 00:43:20,619
The majestic Heavenly Realm offers grace towards the other realms.

371
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:25,180
May all clans of different origins submit to the Heavenly Realm.

372
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:34,300
 Your Supreme Majesty, your sagacity brings peace to the Three Realms. 

373
