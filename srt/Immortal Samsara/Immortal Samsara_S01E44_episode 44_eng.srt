00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,540
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

3
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,860
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

4
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,110
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

5
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,490
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

6
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,260
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

7
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,040
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:01:02,460
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths   ♫

9
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,060
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

10
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,260
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

11
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,360
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,340
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

13
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,910
   

14
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,990
   

15
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,460
Little Tortoise!

16
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,200
Little Tortoise! Little Tortoise!

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,980
Little Tortoise, stop! I'm getting upset!

18
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,360
Don't take everything to heart. Okay?

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,460
You can do that... but I can't.

20
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,900
The Fox Clan came from the Divine Clan.

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,640
Moreover, you are the princess of the Fox Clan.

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,020
I must show great sincerity to your father to get his consent for our marriage.

23
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,300
Had I known that I'd meet someone I love,

24
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,280
I would have practiced diligently every day, mastered spells,

25
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,740
and become the best demon in the world.

26
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,840
That's the only way for me to be a man worthy of you.

27
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,560
Little Tortoise... even if you have nothing,

28
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,640
I'll stay with you forever.

29
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,980
Who are you? How dare you trespass on the Demon Clan's forbidden area?

30
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,880
It's done.

31
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,760
Stay away from water for seven days, or the wound will get infected.

32
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,860
Also, watch what you eat.

33
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,980
Spicy food, seafood, as well as raw and cold food are not allowed. Got it?

34
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,340
You're young, but you nag a lot.

35
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,140
Vile man!

36
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,460
After drinking As You Wish wine yesterday, have you figured out what you want the most?

37
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,840
Isn't returning to the Lingxiao Sect truly your deepest desire?

38
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,220
When I left, I was very angry...

39
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,780
but this time... I'm truly relieved.

40
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,740
While at Moon in the Mirror lake, I said

41
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,960
that in the past... I shouldered the sect's responsibility.

42
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,580
But now...

43
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,460
I live for myself.

44
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,660
I don't want to have any regrets.

45
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,000
Yan Dan, please understand how I feel.

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,180
The one I want to protect the most...

47
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,660
is right in front of me.

48
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,300
Now that you know I've regained my memory...

49
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,060
you should also know that I told you the truth earlier.

50
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,580
You and I can't be together.

51
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,780
After I help you get the four divine tools,

52
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,720
you'll return to the Heavenly Realm and become the emperor again.

53
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,880
That will be the end of the story between the two of us.

54
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,020
Yan Dan...

55
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,740
the As You Wish wine we drank last night... was very effective.

56
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,120
Can you teach me how to make it?

57
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,920
The ingredients for the wine are very rare.

58
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,240
I've used them up.

59
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,400
Since the raw materials are precious and rare...

60
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,880
then forget it.

61
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,220
   

62
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,300
You went alone to collect flower dew on a cold night.

63
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,940
Is it just to help Tang Zhou sleep well?

64
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,360
Yu Mo, where were you?

65
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,060
I've been looking for you.

66
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,160
I don't have much to do, so I went for a walk.

67
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,000
What is this?

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,960
The medicine I made for you to heal your scar.

69
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,640
I got the formula some time ago

70
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,540
but one ingredient, moonlight, was hard to collect.

71
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,040
- "Moonlight"? 
 - Yes.

72
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,800
This medicine is specially formulated with wind, flowers, snow, and moonlight.

73
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,020
I collected the first three but the last one, Moonlight,

74
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,900
must be collected from the new moon, full moon, first moon, and last quarter's moon

75
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,220
in order to successfully concoct the medicine.

76
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,360
Did you go to Mixu Mountain to collect Moonlight?

77
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,600
Yes. It was the last quarter that night

78
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,400
and the last moonlight I had to collect.

79
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,080
Earlier, on Yelan Mountain,

80
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,760
I promised to help you heal your scar.

81
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,620
Of course, I have to fulfill my promise.

82
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,860
Now I know about this medicine.

83
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,860
Your wound will not recur.

84
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,600
 You treat me sincerely, but I misinterpreted you. 

85
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,160
 Yan Dan, I'm sorry. 

86
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,300
- Yan Dan. 
 - All right.

87
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,460
Don't thank me again.

88
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,520
Luckily for me, when I had no memory of my past

89
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,820
and my demonic power was low, you were the one who protected me.

90
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,240
Now, I have regained my memory and increased my demonic power.

91
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,060
From now on, Little Black Fish, you can rely on me.

92
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,100
All right.

93
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,600
- Mountain Chief! 
 - What's wrong, Bai Ling?

94
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,520
Mountain Chief Zi Lin and Lin Lang are missing.

95
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,220
What?

96
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,680
 Mr. Tang, sorry to disturb you. 

97
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,960
  I have a business proposal. 

98
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,920
The Phantom Griffin sent a message.

99
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,260
I have to bring the divine tools to Fengquan Valley tomorrow to exchange for the hostages.

100
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:59,280
If not, Lin Lang and Zi Lin might die, and the whole mountain will also be destroyed.

101
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,500
Yu Mo, it's the Phantom Griffin from the East Sea Dragon Palace.

102
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,640
Since we began searching for divine tools,

103
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,620
you haven't used your divine arts because you lost your memory.

104
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,620
You rarely wielded the three divine tools.

105
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,560
Who would know that you have the divine tools and who would hold Zi Lin and Lin Lang as hostages?

106
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,740
Could it be... the Lord of Shenxiao Palace?

107
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,100
Impossible.

108
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,900
In the War of Genesis, this person worked in collusion with the Dragon King and slaughtered the Nine Fins Clan.

109
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,360
After that, he killed my master in the Divine-Devil War.

110
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,020
He is my sworn enemy.

111
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,980
I will recognize him.

112
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,220
Didn't Immortal Lord Bei Ming die in the battle?

113
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,060
Who is this?

114
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:53,560
He has reappeared but why did he target you this time?

115
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,100
The first time I descended the mountain to catch demons,

116
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,520
someone came after me and locked me in a magical array.

117
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,860
My celestial vest was damaged.

118
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,160
Now, he knows that I'm alive.

119
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,720
He will act again.

120
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,900
He started planning since he exterminated the Nine Fins Clan.

121
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,800
It shows that he has foresight.

122
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,760
After tens of thousands of years, he hasn't been discovered.

123
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,700
It shows that he is meticulous.

124
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,560
Now, he knows all about Tang Zhou descending to the Mortal Realm

125
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,120
to go through the trials and has easily damaged his celestial vest.

126
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,800
Therefore, he must be a very noble deity.

127
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,400
He knows I'm still alive but didn't come to the mountain directly.

128
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,730
That's because he knows that Yelan Mountain is where the Demon Clans gather.

129
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,210
If a war breaks out, the Heaven Realm will be alerted.

130
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,160
So he won't act recklessly.

131
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,480
Therefore, you shouldn't hand over the divine tools to him.

132
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,060
Otherwise, those who died tragically would have died in vain.

133
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,200
Yelan Mountain will be in danger, too.

134
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,480
If you die, the Three Realms will be in chaos.

135
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,900
This sounds far-fetched.

136
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,660
I wonder which almighty god Mr. Tang Zhou is the reincarnation of.

137
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,660
How come it sounds like the mountain is in imminent danger?

138
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,600
Yan Dan, when you said that I was an emperor from heaven...

139
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,900
I thought you were kidding.

140
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,640
Is that actually true?

141
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,920
Why don't we ask Lu Ming?

142
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,420
No.

143
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:40,480
If he finds out that Tang Zhou is alive, he'll investigate who sabotaged his plan.

144
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,820
If we ask him now, we'll put him in an awkward position.

145
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
I'll mobilize demons on the mountain.

146
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,960
Even if the man is an almighty god, if the demons work as one, we can save the hostages.

147
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,180
You're too naïve.

148
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,600
This person's demonic power must be extraordinarily strong.

149
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,140
If you assemble all the demons, you'll send them to their deaths.

150
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,680
Yan Dan is right.

151
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,980
But if Tang Zhou retains his divine power, and I use my Nine-Fins power,

152
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,540
the two of us might be able to defeat him.

153
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,440
Now, his soul-splitting condition has caused his body to wear out.

154
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,420
Using the divine power again might be life-threatening.

155
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,640
- I have... 
 - I have...

156
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,860
- Mountain Chief! 
 - Zi Yan.

157
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,100
Don't worry. Mountain Chief will rescue Lin Lang.

158
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,560
- Zi Yan. 
 - Mountain Chief, I can find my sister.

159
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,280
Our sense of smell is famous in the Three Realms.

160
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,000
To the Fox Clan, everyone smells different.

161
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,620
We can locate someone thousands of miles away by his or her scent.

162
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,360
My sister is in the Fengquan Valley.

163
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,160
Mountain Chief, Miss Yan Dan, take me along.

164
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,680
I remember that you were not fond of alcohol.

165
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,980
This is your favorite, but you don't remember that.

166
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,020
"On the Broken Day, Heaven and Earth clash."

167
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,000
"Shooting stars would occur, they are pretty but bad omens."

168
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:49,500
For the divine officials in heaven, shooting stars are just a routine errand.

169
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,940
For a Taoist like you, they are a form of fortune-telling.

170
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,880
It's better to be ordinary mortals.

171
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,280
They make a wish on a shooting star and believe it will come true.

172
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,920
Stay still.

173
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,360
We all know how to make a wish.

174
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,880
Yes, by pulling my eyelash.

175
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
Is that logical?

176
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,800
This won't do. I'll pull yours, too.

177
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,980
Vile man!

178
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,320
Yan Dan, can you guess what my wish was?

179
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,200
Peace in the Three Realms and joy to all beings.

180
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,520
I wished that you would... be as happy as before.

181
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,400
And...

182
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,440
that you'd like me.

183
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,380
♫   My most bewildering memory is the moonlight  ♫

184
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,960
♫  falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves   ♫

185
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:55,240
You came to the Mortal Realm to be tempered.

186
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,460
Everything that has happened is but a dream.

187
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,920
♫   If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go?   ♫

188
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,640
Do you see it?

189
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,960
Your final home is in the clouds where meteors gather.

190
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,580
You'll return there sooner or later.

191
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,020
Love isn't permitted for a diety.

192
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,940
We are... not meant to be together.

193
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,580
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

194
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,040
You'll return there sooner or later.

195
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,840
♫   I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust   ♫

196
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,020
What if I don't want to go back?

197
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,460
♫   Life&nbsp;after life...  ♫

198
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,820
If our plan fails, I'll hand over the divine tools tomorrow.

199
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,420
♫   You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers   ♫

200
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,890
Then I can no longer return to the Heaven Realm.

201
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,960
♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

202
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,900
You'll die if that happens. Do you understand?

203
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,380
♫   You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky... 

204
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,160
If I die...

205
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,860
♫  ...don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine  

206
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,530
will you forgive me?

207
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:04,860
♫   In my dream, the one I loved is with me   ♫

208
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,360
Yan Dan.

209
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,640
Even though... you never told me...

210
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,520
what I had done wrong.

211
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,780
♫   The mortal life is short...  ♫

212
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,180
Do you know why I'm watching shooting stars from here?

213
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,580
♫  ...yet we suffered for love with lovers not living up to expectations   ♫

214
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:34,720
Nine hundred years ago... I watched shooting stars with someone.

215
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,700
I hated him at first.

216
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:44,960
But later, without realizing it, I fell in love with him.

217
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,540
He saved me...

218
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,080
and broke my heart.

219
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,720
He told me that he is responsible

220
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,680
for all beings and he cannot care about anyone.

221
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,430
I didn't understand what he meant at that time...

222
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,680
but I do now.

223
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:19,220
Mortals, demons, and deities, all have their respective responsibilities

224
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,290
Therefore, Tang Zhou...

225
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,360
you can't stay here.

226
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,070
However, Yan Dan, that person is not me.

227
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,300
You and he are alike.

228
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,240
You both have the same responsibility that you both have to bear.

229
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,340
I don't want you to regret it in the future when you remember what you've done today.

230
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:48,240
I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you return smoothly.

231
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,640
But Yan Dan, I'm different from that person.

232
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,460
I am not him.

233
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,720
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

234
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:20,620
♫   As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable   ♫

235
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,840
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

236
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:35,780
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫

237
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,400
Yu Mo. Yu Mo, save me!

238
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,180
- Sister! 
 - Zi Yan!

239
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,380
Zi Yan!

240
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,980
- Sister! 
 - Save me, Yu Mo!

241
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,220
Do something quickly!

242
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,360
Zi Yan! Zi Yan!

243
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,300
Brother Yu Mo, my sister is over there.

244
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,660
Quick, Yu Mo!

245
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,460
Sister!

246
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,080
Zi Yan.

247
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,420
Zi Lin, are you all right?

248
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,660
I'm fine.

249
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,360
Sister, are you all right?

250
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,100
Yes. Let me take a look at you.

251
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,440
You're not my sister.

252
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,760
You do not smell like her.

253
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,020
What's wrong, Zi Yan?

254
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,900
How could that be?

255
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,840
You look like her.

256
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,400
Zi Yan!

257
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,540
Puppet Spell.

258
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,900
It is clear that the Fox Clan has a keen sense of smell.

259
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,500
What a pity. I cut off one of her tails...

260
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,620
but I still can't deceive him.

261
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,620
How dare you cut off my sister's tail?

262
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,040
I'll kill you!

263
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,760
Don't move.

264
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,200
Stay still.

265
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,040
Surrender without a fight, or the child dies because of you.

266
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,940
How can you play such an old trick on me?

267
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,960
Zi Yan. Good boy.

268
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,900
Close your eyes.

269
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
Taoist Master Tang!

270
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,820
What a surprise! I can't believe we've reunited again.

271
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,100
If you're so obsessed with me, why don't you show yourself?

272
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,180
You are about to die.

273
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,500
Why should I show myself to you?

274
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,480
You are not the one who injured me.

275
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,120
You have much greater divine power.

276
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,320
My subordinate was useless.

277
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,240
I have to do this myself.

278
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,780
I know that Xuan Xiang taught you how to bind the divine tools.

279
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,280
If you don't surrender them,  I can't have them.

280
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,720
But your divine power is sealed, and you can't fight me.

281
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,140
Hand them over now.

282
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,320
I guarantee that your friends will be safe.

283
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,300
Who are you?

284
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:09,100
Hand over the divine tools, and I will dispel your doubts and let you die without regret.

285
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,680
If I die with you today, I will die without regret.

286
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,500
Don't worry, I'm fine.

287
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,320
Immortal Lord Bei Ming!

288
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,320
This is Puppet Spell.

289
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,940
Yan Dan!

290
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,780
You will die if your celestial vest is damaged.

291
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,960
There's no coming back from that.

292
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,660
Surprisingly, you managed to collect three divine tools and stabilize the heart meridian.

293
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:25,560
And I didn't expect this silly girl to willingly sacrifice her real form to save your life.

294
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,420
Compassion is an obstacle of the heart.

295
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,540
Her existence has become your lifeline.

296
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,300
Let her go! Or I'll destroy these three divine tools!

297
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,780
- Don't do it, Tang Zhou. 
 - A little flower demon will not affect my plan.

298
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,580
I just want to kill you with my own hands.

299
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,540
Tang Zhou!

300
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,640
Don't do it, Tang Zhou.

301
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,600
Tang Zhou! Tang Zhou!

302
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,560
Didn't we agree last night that you won't hand them over, regardless of who we have to face?

303
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,840
I'm a vile man. What I say doesn't count.

304
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,740
Sorry.

305
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,340
I must kill you with my own hands just to be sure.

306
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,160
You won't get what you wish for.

307
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,260
Look at your hands.

308
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,220
Ordinary mortal divine tools can't trap you.

309
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:44,280
I sucked you into the jade gourd to put the Shared-Fate Spell on you.

310
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,520
- "Shared-Fate Spell"? 
 - Yes.

311
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,440
We painstakingly researched the spell to stop you from murdering and silencing us.

312
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,200
The blood of the spell caster and recipient are connected.

313
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,840
If you hurt him, black streaks will grow on you.

314
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,300
The deeper you hurt him, the more black streaks you get.

315
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,040
You act stealthily so that the Heaven Realm won't know.

316
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,440
If you go back with black spots on your face, you will cause suspicion.

317
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,460
To break the spell, you must not use your divine power for seven days and focus on your practice.

318
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:26,040
Before the spell expires, if Tang Zhou dies, like him, your soul will be scattered.

319
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,100
I don't believe you.

320
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,220
- Yu Mo! 
 - Who are you?

321
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,940
How dare you pretend to be my master?

322
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,060
Your celestial vest is damaged, and I struck you with my palm.

323
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,780
Killing you or not doesn't matter.

324
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,200
After seven days, I'll send someone to collect your body!

325
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,720
Tang Zhou. Zi Lin and Lin Lang have been rescued and sent back to Yelan Mountain. Don't worry.

326
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,340
- Tang Zhou. 
 - Tang Zhou!

327
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,100
Are you all right?

328
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,900
I'm fine.

329
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,200
What is this?

330
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,740
Oh, no.

331
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,780
What happened?

332
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,620
Tang Zhou!

333
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,600
Why can't I inject the Power of the Lotus?

334
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,920
Will he die if this carries on like this?

335
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,080
I secretly tested his spiritual power just now.

336
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,000
He's drained after using his divine power. His primordial spirit is unstable.

337
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,140
Moreover, they must have discovered how useful your Four-Leaf Lotus is

338
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,840
and did something to him during the fight.

339
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,760
Let's send him back to Yelan Mountain quickly and heal him in the hot spring.

340
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,960
Guardian of Soil. Did you see everything that just happened?

341
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,200
Record it truthfully and report to the Heaven Realm.

342
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,260
This concerns the life and death of Ying Yuan, Emperor Qingli.

343
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,380
Do it immediately.

344
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,040
Yes.

345
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,360
Judging by the power of the mysterious person,

346
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,440
he might be a superior deity with an exceptional cultivation base but he didn't show his face.

347
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,540
I have a lowly position.

348
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,620
My letter to the Heaven Realm might be intercepted before it reaches His Supreme Majesty.

349
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,100
Rest assured. Within seven days, he'll return to the Heaven Realm.

350
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,340
By then, we'll track the letter and find out who intercepts it.

351
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,940
We'll then know who it is.

352
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,560
I understand. Don't worry, Young Master.

353
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,080
You are awake, Mr. Tang.

354
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,820
This is Yelan Mountain's treasured land of hot springs.

355
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,860
It can heal all wounds.

356
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,600
Do not worry. All the demons on Yelan Mountain are trying to save you.

357
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,540
You'll be fine.

358
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,600
Thank you all.

359
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,080
What's wrong?

360
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,420
I don't know why I'm a little nauseous.

361
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,200
Is that so?

362
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,020
Didn't you look quite mighty when you rescued Lin Lang earlier?

363
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,340
I...

364
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:42,280
Maybe when you were practicing in heaven, Mr. Tang played tricks on you.

365
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,820
What nonsense is that?

366
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,440
With the skills I have, only I can be the bully.

367
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,160
My divine spirit is unstable.

368
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,580
My soul-splitting condition has recurred.

369
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,380
- Did I scare you? 
 - Step back!

370
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,840
I'm sorry, Mr. Tang.

371
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,780
I probably have an upset stomach today.

372
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,340
I'll thank you for your kindness next time.

373
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,800
I-I'll come back with Lin Lang to thank you another day.

374
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:40,620
Every time I see your friend, I feel very close to him and want to touch his head.

375
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:49,340
Could it be... that we had a chance encounter in the past?

376
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,520
The mysteries of heaven must not be revealed.

377
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,020
Don't worry.

378
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,420
This hot spring has a magical effect.

379
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,120
I feel refreshed.

380
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:48,620
I didn't expect things to get to this point in the end, and that you'd be implicated.

381
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,880
I don't know how to repay you.

382
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,780
You're repaying me already.

383
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,440
- If you are generous—  
 - I'm not.

384
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,760
I don't mean Yan Dan.

385
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,200
If you can find me a burial plot...

386
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,760
with mountains and water, I'll be happy.

387
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,460
You won't get off so easily.

388
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,700
I'm the king of all demons.

389
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,020
The king of all demons heals a demon catcher.

390
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,900
How can I give up such a beautiful story about myself?

391
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,880
Don't think too much.

392
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,960
Heal peacefully in here.

393
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,880
Everybody from Devil Realm is dead.

394
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,700
The mysterious man has the power and moves of the Heavenly Realm's divine arts.

395
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,300
But why does he know the Puppet Spell?

396
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,880
I sent a letter to ask Liu Weiyang.

397
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,040
He said that only he and the Devil Clan elders know the magical spell.

398
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,300
But the elders were turned into ashes thousands of years ago in the Life and Death Arena.

399
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:06,580
Now, besides him, there's another one who knows the spell.

400
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:13,040
However, it's inappropriate for me to ask him further.

401
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,900
Tao Ziqi?

402
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,580
That's right.

403
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,640
Tao Ziqi has just been revived.

404
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:28,140
Her immortal power cannot rival that man unless

405
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:34,420
she taught this spell to others in the Divine Realm before the Divine-Devil War.

406
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,920
I think so, too.

407
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,300
That was why I wrote to invite them to the mountain.

408
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,200
I want to take the opportunity to chat with them.

409
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,380
And see who else has learned the Puppet Spell besides her.

410
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,400
Where's Yan Dan?

411
00:34:53,900 --> 00:35:00,340
In the Pavilion of Books, looking for a cure for you and clues for Ground Block.

412
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:05,320
After his palm struck you, your heavenly essence clashed inside you, you have a pulse occlusion.

413
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,180
Medicine, stone needles, and spiritual power won't work on you.

414
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:15,200
If we don't find a solution quickly, I'm afraid that you won't last for over half a month.

415
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:24,000
My assassin made a mistake that year.

416
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,960
He struck me this time after some careful plans.

417
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,280
It cannot be easily resolved.

418
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,820
Where there are divine tools, there are abnormalities.

419
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:41,440
I've been looking for clues about the divine tools but I am yet to discover anything about Ground Block.

420
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:49,120
Even if I find one divine tool, it won't stop the celestial vest's destruction.

421
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,000
You've traveled everywhere, but you are just one person.

422
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
As the king of all demons, I command all demons.

423
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,900
Perhaps, we'll find the clues for Ground Block soon.

424
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,560
If I'm doomed to die, why should I delay my death?

425
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:13,600
I put the Shared-Fate Spell on the man and his soul will scatter like mine.

426
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,220
At least,

427
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,080
I'll get to spend my last days with you and Yan Dan.

428
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,740
I have no regrets.

429
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:33,520
Yu Mo, for Yan Dan's sake, I have one more thing to do.

430
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:45,980
 We only have seven days before the mysterious man breaks the Shared-Fate Spell and kills again. 

431
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,340
 When that happens, calamity might befall Yelan Mountain. 

432
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,680
 There are books from everywhere. 

433
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,000
 Where should I look? 

434
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,680
 Must I helplessly watch him die again? 

435
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,380
Yan Dan. This is bad.

436
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,240
A demon friend in the hall demands an explanation from Yelan Mountain.

437
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,440
I was only away for a short time, and someone has stirred up trouble here.

438
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,840
I want to see who it is!

439
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,760
Leader of the Fox Clan, it was a misunderstanding.

440
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,160
Look at Zi Yan and Lin Lang. They are well cared for at our mountain.

441
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,780
They're cute and clean.

442
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,500
Their furs are so smooth and shiny.

443
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,920
The kidnap was an accident.

444
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,160
We treat them like family.

445
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,920
- Why must you take them away? 
 - Okay, that's enough.

446
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,000
Stop rocking me. It's killing me.

447
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,640
What family?

448
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,260
Lin Lang has been on the mountain for so long, and yet she wasn't given any status.

449
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,620
She was kidnapped by an unknown person and had a narrow escape.

450
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,520
- Yes. Yes. The Fox Clan always repays others' kindness. 
 - Yes. Yes.

451
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,000
For Zi Yan's life, Lin Lang agrees to marry below herself.

452
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,700
- And now, is Yelan Mountain looking down on her instead? 
 - No, no.

453
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,860
Please don't say that. She is highly regarded.

454
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,300
We encountered some incidents on the mountain earlier and were busy.

455
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,920
- So we delayed... 
 - Fine.

456
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,780
That's not an excuse.

457
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:20,560
They may stay, and I can disregard the kidnap

458
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,780
if Mountain Chief Yu Mo officially marries Lin Lang

459
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,380
and Miss Yan Dan marries Zi Yan.

460
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:36,660
I will keep quiet and give the betrothal gift and dowry with the utmost sincerity.

461
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,700
Zi Yan, don't make trouble.

462
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,700
Let me explain, Clan Leader.

463
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,400
Although initially, Lin Lang came because of Yu Mo,

464
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,460
during her time on Yelan Mountain, she has fallen deeply for another handsome young talent.

465
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,980
- Am I right, Lin Lang? 
 - Yes.

466
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,700
"A handsome young talent"?

467
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,310
On this mountain, other than the mountain chief, what other young talent do you have?

468
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:08,830
Was Lin Lang being playful and you simply got a bratty tortoise to fool me?

469
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,320
- No, Father. I... 
 - Who?

470
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,120
Who dares to take Lin Lang away? I'll kill him!

471
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,440
Father. He's the bratty tortoise I love.

472
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,420
I will marry him.

473
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,240
- Faher! 
 - Our Fox Clan descends from the Divine Clan.

474
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,570
Some foxes married dragons and phoenixes.

475
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,760
We were expelled from the divine registry,

476
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,500
- but I have worked hard to raise you as my daughter for hundreds of years. 
 - Father, I...

477
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,800
How can you marry below yourself to a tortoise that eats stinky fish and shrimp?

478
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,640
Clan leader, say what you want nicely.

479
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,860
- Don't get agitated. 
 - Go away!

480
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,840
- Yes. Father, calm down. 
 - Let me ask you again.

481
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,640
Are you determined to marry him?

482
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:04,400
Father, when Zi Lin and I were kidnapped, we took an oath.

483
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,280
If we survived, we'd stay together forever and never part ways.

484
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,600
Father-in-law, if I marry Lin Lang,

485
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,040
I promise I'll stop eating shrimp and fish.

486
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,960
- Good. Good. 
 - Do you consent?

487
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,460
- I'll kill myself now. 
 - Father!

488
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,360
- Father-in-law! 
 - Step aside!

489
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,000
I can no longer keep the secret of Zi Lin from you, Clan Leader.
