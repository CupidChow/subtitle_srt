 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,500
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,860
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,070
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,120
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths   ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,020
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,320
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,100
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,670
   

15
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,050
   

16
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,820
It's typical to not readily disclose the location of the treasure.

17
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,440
This tombstone is pretty interesting.

18
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,080
I think this comes off!

19
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,820
 I did something good! I'll get one more point! 

20
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,950
   

21
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,680
"Trespassers of my tomb will be punished."

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,940
As they say, "Ignore an elder's word at your own peril."

23
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,140
Look, I think we should listen to the tomb owner.

24
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,640
Let's not go inside.

25
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,820
"Life is death's door."

26
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,080
"Death is life's abode."

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,640
"This tomb leads to the underworld."

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,980
"Whoever disturbs my sleep will perish."

29
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,640
They're just scare tactics.

30
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,220
If ghosts do exist, they won't stand a chance when we unsheathe our swords.

31
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,720
Let's not waste any more time.

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,000
Everyone, look for the entrance.

33
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,360
It's normal for humans to be scared. But you too?

34
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,860
Big fish eat small fish. Weak demons fear powerful demons. Nothing unusual about that.

35
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,320
Besides, I'm not scared!

36
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,200
I... I'm just worried you might get back-stabbed again.

37
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,500
I'd have to save you again.

38
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,600
All right.

39
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,700
Then you can protect me, starting now.

40
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,400
You coward! You go first!

41
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,860
Bai Piaoliang, don't worry.

42
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,460
We thought there'd be a lot of traps inside the tomb.

43
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,060
But look, we managed to enter unharmed.

44
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,720
The  passage outside is as wide as a road.

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,100
All the traps would've long been triggered by previous tomb raiders. Don't worry.

46
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,800
If that's true, none of the people who came before managed to get out alive!

47
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,900
We're with you. Don't worry.

48
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,680
Let's go.

49
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,220
Everyone, this way.

50
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,640
It's safe.

51
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,140
What a lovely smile.

52
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,880
Her eyes are mesmerizing.

53
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,480
Were these stone statues made to resemble the imperial concubine?

54
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,740
They're beautiful, don't you think?

55
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,780
Second Brother, you...

56
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,840
Second and Third Younger Brothers!

57
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,700
Don't move!

58
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,240
What happened to them?

59
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,220
I sense a very strong evil aura.

60
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,960
I think it's a magical array.

61
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,500
Stay here. I'm going to check it out.

62
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,780
Of all the little thieves, you're the best-looking one.

63
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,420
Are you the tomb owner?

64
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,880
So what, if I am?

65
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,680
Right or wrong, everything is futile.

66
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,340
Affection is a deception. So is love.

67
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,980
Only hatred is real.

68
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,020
The person you hate is the king who killed you.

69
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,760
I have long forgotten him.

70
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:05,600
Now, I hate... whoever steals my things!

71
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,460
- Bai Piaoliang. 
 - Don't move!

72
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,760
Don't look back!

73
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,980
I guessed right.

74
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,280
You must have gotten trapped in a magical array.

75
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,740
You were standing in front of a statue. Then you suddenly went crazy.

76
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,200
The same thing happened to the others.

77
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,660
Swordswoman Jin almost stabbed you. And you almost stabbed her.

78
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,040
It could be the legendary Hallucination Array.

79
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,940
If entrapped, indiscernible by sight or sound, the four seasons overlap. It won't end till one perishes.

80
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,260
What I saw were those who were trapped in the array before.

81
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,820
We kept trying to kill each another.

82
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,540
The array confuses the human mind.

83
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,260
But it has no effect on demons.

84
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,640
That's why you were fine.

85
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,540
Oh, right.

86
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,340
I was entrapped, but you didn't run away.

87
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,720
Of course not!

88
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,080
I'm not a fraudster.

89
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,900
I have a sense of loyalty, okay?

90
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,280
I don't think you meant to say "fraudster".

91
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,240
How did you know you could save me by covering my eyes?

92
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,760
I saw Qi Niu stab Qi Hu's eyes, stopping the craziness.

93
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,400
So I took the risk. It worked!

94
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,450
This time, I definitely saved your life. You can't deny it.

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,780
The array is likely triggered by the statues' eyes.

96
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,420
If you stare into the eyes, you'll be trapped.

97
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,320
But if you close your eyes, you can escape.

98
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,080
Okay. Then let's go.

99
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,160
How? The statues are constantly moving.

100
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,600
The route has completely changed.

101
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,440
Plus, the tomb is circular in shape. Everything looks exactly the same.

102
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,920
The people we came with have been missing for a while.

103
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,320
I'm afraid someone added apparitions to the Hallucination Array.

104
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,520
What do we do now?

105
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,040
You'd have to cover my eyes with your hand.

106
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,520
With my hands?

107
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,260
Why can't you just close your eyes?

108
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,100
Close your eyes. I'll lead the way. We'll break out of this place.

109
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,500
Enough talking. Let's go.

110
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,000
Careful!

111
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,040
We managed to escape!

112
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,740
Open your eyes! It's fine now.

113
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,160
We got ourselves out!

114
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,860
Look! Aren't I amazing?

115
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,160
Did he just ignore his savior?

116
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,440
Say something.

117
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,960
What's that sound?

118
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,560
Isn't... Isn't that Qin Mingyang?

119
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,140
He's too deeply immersed in the Hallucination Array.

120
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,380
He's beyond saving.

121
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,020
He will die from the madness.

122
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,100
It's better to end it here.

123
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,880
Wait! Let me try.

124
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,860
Maybe he can be saved.

125
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,000
Well? I'm amazing, right?

126
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,620
I underestimated you.

127
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,320
Guess you've got some skills.

128
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,460
Of course! Like I said, I can protect you.

129
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,940
Even if you lose your mind like him, I will still save you.

130
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,240
You curse me each time you speak. Perhaps you should return to the calabash.

131
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,040
No!

132
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,040
You know how I am. I often get carried away.

133
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,280
Be more understanding.

134
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,580
Are you leaving? What about him?

135
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,780
You said you'd save him.

136
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,260
Wait here for us.

137
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,540
We'll come back for you when we find the exit.

138
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,560
Hang in there.

139
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,960
It's the imperial concubine again.

140
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,180
Stop looking. What if it's another magical array?

141
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,660
I already saw everything.

142
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,940
Stay back.

143
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,240
The Eight Trigrams?

144
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,040
The art of Qimen. 
  (T/N: ancient Chinese form of divination) 

145
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,040
It has existed for a long time. This is the Genli Hexagram.

146
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,940
"Genli Hexagram"?

147
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,420
"The door of life is in the north. The door of death is bound to earth."

148
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,200
I think the tomb's exit might be behind the door of life.

149
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,920
What was that?

150
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,520
Where are we?

151
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,920
Your hand. Are you done groping?

152
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Sorry. I didn't know you were under me.

153
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,920
What are you doing?

154
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,360
Bats.

155
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,600
Are you done? The bats are gone.

156
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,280
Look.

157
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,160
There's a tombstone here.

158
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,640
"The heartless king. What crime did the imperial concubine commit?"

159
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,820
"We were ordered to build this tomb. We know our sin is deep."

160
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,800
"We are leaving this door of life, hoping that the concubine"

161
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,920
"will be able to escape and ascend to heaven, spared from repression."

162
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,100
"We pray she attains bliss."

163
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:30,020
The previous tombstone said, "Life is death's door. Death is life's abode."

164
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,900
It must mean that the door of life leads to a dead end.

165
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:41,580
Only behind the door of death is a chance to live. The bats have been living here... there must be a way out!

166
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,880
That Qin Mingyang.

167
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,520
He pretended to be crazy so he could take the treasure for himself. But he saved us instead.

168
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,320
Fate sure played a cruel joke, right?

169
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,220
You saved him for nothing.

170
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,740
A demon saved a human. But the human harmed other humans.

171
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,380
This series of events wasn't what I had envisioned.

172
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,400
Then what did you think would happen?

173
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,100
We should go back and save them.

174
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,560
That Qin Mingyang deserved to die. Good riddance. But the others are innocent.

175
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,020
Let's go.

176
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,560
Taoist Master Tang, your bravery is unparalleled.

177
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,000
Solving magical arrays is as easy as plucking petals.

178
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,460
You can take on a horde of demons, but I have nothing much to contribute.

179
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,260
How about this? I'll wait here for your triumphant return.

180
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,260
Rest assured. It's not that I don't want to go with you.

181
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,740
But I was sealed in the calabash for a long time.

182
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,160
My demonic power has weakened.

183
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,540
Moreover, this tunnel is so long.

184
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,720
I doubt I can fly up to the top.

185
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,920
No problem. Just hold onto me.

186
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,560
That's inappropriate. It's inappropriate.

187
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,590
What you said makes sense.

188
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,720
It's inappropriate to take you up like this.

189
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,880
It's better to go back into the calabash.

190
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,040
Say no more. Friends ought to go together.

191
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,040
Help me.

192
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,340
What happened? You suddenly look decades older!

193
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,240
He... He sucked my life away.

194
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,820
What?

195
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,340
 Accelerated aging. Could it be the Seven Star Deity Jade? 

196
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,660
Did someone steal your life span?

197
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,300
A life span is set by heaven. Can it be stolen?

198
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,900
Was he carrying a divine tool?

199
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,700
He used...

200
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,980
He used...

201
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,580
Used what?

202
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,880
What on earth? Is he dead?

203
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,230
How could he die at the most critical moment?

204
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,940
At least finish your sentence, Sir!

205
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,100
Let's get out of here.

206
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,020
Yu Heng is one of the strongest demon catchers in the Mortal Realm.

207
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,400
He's been hiding in the East Sea.

208
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,900
We received intel that he went to Lanxi Town to catch demons.

209
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,300
But there's no concrete evidence to prove that he captured Yan Dan.

210
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,820
His apothecary is protected by lethal demon-catching arrays.

211
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,480
Are you sure you want to break in alone? Also, look where we are.

212
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,940
This is the East Sea. What if Dragon Clan members find you?

213
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,520
As long as there's a chance we'll find Yan Dan...

214
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,440
Whether it's mountains of knives or a sea of fire, to hell and sky,

215
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,820
I will take the risk.

216
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,370
What kind of demon are you?

217
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,500
How come you possess such incredible powers?

218
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,260
Lucky you. She's not the one in it.

219
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,240
Or else, your lesson today wouldn't have been so easy.

220
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,580
Come on.

221
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,660
Aside from Qin Mingyang, everyone else who entered the tomb is gone!

222
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,220
They might be in danger. And who could have stolen his life span?

223
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,600
Was it really the imperial concubine?

224
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,480
The imperial concubine's soul was just a product of the array.

225
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,600
The treasure in the tomb is gone. But the tomb's legend is spreading like wildfire.

226
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,800
There's only one explanation. Someone has been mystifying the situation.

227
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,800
"Humans die for wealth. Fowls die for food."

228
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,660
"Where the birds are, there will be men."

229
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,940
I was right to follow the birds. Here you are, humans!

230
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,120
What she said is indeed true!

231
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,720
Miss, this place is dangerous!

232
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,980
What did you mean by "What she said is true"? Who did you mean?

233
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,920
She's my mother.

234
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,300
She also said, "The tomb's entrance leads to the underworld."

235
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,600
Be careful not to wake her up.

236
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,400
Young Lady. Young Lady! What are you doing here again?

237
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,930
This is our Young Lady.

238
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,740
She's not mentally well due to a childhood sickness.

239
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,340
She's delirious and speaks nonsense.

240
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,320
Please disregard it.

241
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,300
This is the middle of nowhere. Why did the young lady come all the way here?

242
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,840
You are unaware, but the Shen Residence is close by.

243
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,300
Lately, there have been a lot of ghost sightings.

244
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,060
That's why I lost track of where the young lady went.

245
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,700
The two of you are dressed like skilled individuals.

246
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,360
Can you perform ghost exorcism?

247
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,880
They're bad people! We need to hurry back.

248
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,600
They are evil ghosts who crawled out from the underworld. Hurry, let's go home!

249
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,220
You see? The young lady is confused again.

250
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,680
If you can help restore peace to the Shen family, our master will certainly reward you well.

251
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,510
All right. We were wondering where to go.

252
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,760
We'll take you up on the offer, then.

253
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,320
Please follow me.

254
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,440
Go.

255
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,680
Bring the divine mist bestowed by the Heavenly Court. Serve it to the Crown Princess Consort.

256
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,700
Don't call me that!

257
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,460
Our fathers are discussing our marriage in the main hall.

258
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,560
There's nothing wrong with calling you that now.

259
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,900
Or could it be that you feel shy?

260
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,400
Father taught me that the Dragon Clan is the Heavenly Court's vanguard.

261
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,200
There isn't a day to rest while training.

262
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,760
I personally train the soldiers of the East Sea.

263
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,600
It's already an achievement that the South Sea soldiers can take a punch from us.

264
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,620
Zhao Lan, when we're married, they will become your personal bodyguards.

265
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,340
Zhao Lan, trust me.

266
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,360
I will protect you forever.

267
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,840
No harm will befall you.

268
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,580
I don't need your protection. I can handle it myself!

269
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,560
Your Highness.

270
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,220
The apothecary where your elixirs are being made was destroyed by a demon.

271
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,080
All the potions and extracts were ruined.

272
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,060
I did my best to fight him off.

273
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,420
But the witchcraft used by this demon was very odd.

274
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,460
It controlled both water and fire.

275
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,400
Water and fire?

276
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,220
What did the demon look like?

277
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,780
The demon's human appearance was immaculate.

278
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,380
I couldn't tell its original form.

279
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:15,620
But during the fight, I noticed a symbol resembling either a flower or fish on its wrist.

280
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,640
So Yu Mo is still alive.

281
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,500
Pass on my order. Send the elites to capture this demon, no matter the cost!

282
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,960
Yes, Your Highness.

283
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,900
   

284
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,320
My Xiangjun is different from other people.

285
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,520
In order to avoid unnecessary hatred from the others, I deliberately built my mansion in a remote area.

286
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,580
Then, the Feng Shui Master said this place had an unfavorable atmosphere, attracting evil.

287
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,540
I didn't think much of it.

288
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,560
But now...

289
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,940
Taoist Master Tang. You look quite young.

290
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,540
Can you really deal with the evil ghost?

291
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,360
I am a disciple of the Lingxiao Sect.

292
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,600
I've been trained in the art of exorcism.

293
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,680
Please do not worry.

294
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,200
Forgive me for my ignorance.

295
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,620
So you are from the famous Lingxiao Sect.

296
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,360
Taoist Master Tang... Are you married?

297
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,280
Why do you ask, Master Shen?

298
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:06,100
Taoist Master Tang. You come from a famous sect, and you seem very talented.

299
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,380
You're also composed and reliable.

300
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,700
If you don't mind, would you be willing to marry my daughter, Xiangjun?

301
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,880
I understand. Our Xiangjun is out of your league.

302
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,560
But the Shen family has plenty of fertile lands and businesses.

303
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,400
Gold and silk are in abundance.

304
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,820
If you're willing, I shall give all of my family wealth to you.

305
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,300
I apologize. Please continue.

306
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,400
I'm just a little shocked.

307
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,780
I thought we'd be watching the exorcism today.

308
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,500
Turns out, it's a happy union between man and woman!

309
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,080
I understand.

310
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,160
I'm being too rash.

311
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,020
I already have one foot in the coffin. 
 (T/N: He is old and nearing death) 

312
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,460
The only thing that worries me is Xiangjun's future marriage.

313
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,420
The girl's birth horoscope is unfavorable. She easily attracts evil.

314
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,340
When ordinary men see her, they either get scared or repulsed.

315
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,240
Except you, Taoist Master Tang.

316
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Not only are you unafraid, but you're also able to protect her.

317
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,240
If you agree to this, all my worries will be resolved, even if you just take her in as your concubine.

318
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,340
Dad!

319
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,040
Master Shen only wants the girl to be looked after.

320
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,620
Why won't you agree?

321
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,960
Other people could only wish for such a golden opportunity.

322
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,720
Quit tempting me, Wifey.

323
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,700
I'm devoted only to you. I will not marry another.

324
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,940
What did you call me?

325
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,580
“Wifey.”

326
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,040
She... She's your wife?

327
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,720
We married on our own.

328
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,360
We haven't informed the elders from my sect.

329
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,220
"Married on our own?" You can't simply say those things!

330
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,780
Have you forgotten? I gave you a jade gourd when I made the vow.

331
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,240
I remember.

332
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,500
I see.

333
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,220
I guess Xiangjun isn't fortunate.

334
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,400
Master Shen, Lingxiao Sect has a secret way to get rid of ghosts.

335
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,860
You can sacrifice a little demon and ask it to leave.

336
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,620
Once you get rid of the evil ghost in the residence, Miss Shen will be safe.

337
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,760
I'm sure you're right, Taoist Master Tang.

338
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,940
It's late. I'll get the servants to prepare your room. Please rest early.

339
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,360
We can discuss the exorcism tomorrow.

340
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,800
   

341
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,100
You used me to turn him down. And you're making me sleep on the floor.

342
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,320
Don't you think that's a bit unreasonable?

343
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,500
Master Shen was wrong to prepare just one room.

344
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,120
I guess he's trying to test if what I said is true.

345
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,200
I'm the kind of person that shouldn't get a cold.

346
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,140
When I'm cold, I can't sleep.

347
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,620
Then I'll start sleepwalking. My sleepwalking is very scary.

348
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,800
Aren't you scared?

349
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,000
You're already scary while awake.

350
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,720
Are you sure you want to keep watching me?

351
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,300
Taoist Master Tang, you said there are no ghosts in the world.

352
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:31,720
But you told Master Shen to sacrifice a demon to get rid of any evil ghosts.

353
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,160
That was fabricated on the spot, right?

354
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,660
Taoist Master Tang?

355
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,240
It's true, if you keep rambling.

356
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,500
What's going on?

357
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,720
Taoist Master Tang! Taoist Master Tang!

358
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,740
Taoist Master Tang! Wake up.

359
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,640
 Wake up! 

360
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,480
 Who are you? 

361
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,060
 What's wrong with you? 

362
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,160
 It's your fault... 

363
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,020
 I've become like this. 

364
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,220
 Why won't you give back what you owe me? 

365
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,220
 It's my fault? 

366
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,320
 What do I owe you? 

367
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
 What do you want me to give back to you? 

368
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,080
 You owe me half a heart. 

369
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,880
 This is your fault. 

370
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,240
 Give it back to me. 

371
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,140
 My heart is in pain. 

372
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,260
 It's as if I'm in a dream. 

373
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,040
 Did she use some demonic spell on me? 

374
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,200
Did you just zone out?

375
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,340
I didn't mean to wake you.

376
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,360
There really is a ghost here! Listen.

377
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,800
Sounds like it's coming from the west.

378
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,100
So exciting! Let's go and check!

379
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,440
You're a coward but deadly curious.

380
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,980
Remember when we first met?

381
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,820
I did lie about a lot of stuff.

382
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,020
But the line about wanting to become the world's best scriptwriter is 100% true.

383
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,400
For that aspiration, I have to experience and observe as much as possible.

384
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,080
Let's go.

385
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,340
Stop dawdling!

386
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,280
Someone outside is playing tricks with phosphorus fire.

387
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,800
Hurry up!

388
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,300
Stunned? How dare you trick us?

389
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:29,800
 Since they used such an outdated tactic to lure us out, we can't leave them hanging. 

390
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,800
You like to fight, right? Here's your chance.

391
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,940
Get him. Find out who he is! Go!

392
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,480
Let's fight him together!

393
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,380
I thought you hated demons.

394
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,440
Why did you risk your life to save me?

395
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,520
I guess I got bored and wanted to repay my savior.

396
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,560
- What are you doing? 
 - Don't misunderstand!

397
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,700
I wanted to check if your heart is injured.

398
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,700
Mortals need it to live, right?

399
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,180
I can't repay something like that.

400
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:42,720
 You owe me half a heart. I need you to give it back to me. 

401
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,590
 Give it back to me! 

402
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,010
What are you doing? Don't play foul!

403
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,500
You were fine just a minute ago!

404
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,320
"Play foul"?

405
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,400
I'm fine. Just leave it.

406
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,140
Such a weirdo. Like I care!

407
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,220
I only did it because you just saved me.

408
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,180
Come on. Let's go take a look.

409
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,820
Xiao Yi, I'm sorry.

410
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,160
I'm sorry.

412
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,500
First, a mysterious person ambushed us.

413
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,900
Then Master Shen dug up a grave to bury flowers.

414
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,700
What kind of play is this supposed to be?

415
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,500
From the imperial concubine’s tomb to the Shen Residence....

416
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,400
The story is getting more interesting.

417
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,540
Taoist Master Tang. Why don't we make a bet and see who can reveal the truth first?

418
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,560
What are we betting?

419
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,060
Finding out the truth.

420
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,000
If I win, you'll set me free.

421
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,420
And if you lose?

422
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,600
Then... you can order me around however you like.

423
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,420
I already do that.

424
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,880
It's not the same.

425
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,640
A bet is about establishing your own good fortune.

426
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,780
Think about it.

427
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,480
Which hero in history didn't want to be the best?

428
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,540
Besides, don't you want to beat me with real skills?

429
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,680
Boring.

430
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,480
I was going to give this to you if you agreed to this bet.

431
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,500
You got lucky.

432
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,020
Are you a flower girl or something? I haven't used the petal you gave me last time.

433
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,540
That person only dared to attack because he had already set up the array.

434
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,280
He wasn't strong enough to hurt me.

435
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,180
I'll keep this, then.

436
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,560
You already plucked it.

437
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,640
I'll keep an extra to use next time.

438
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,660
Crafty prick.

439
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,520
You even used the Dragon-Binding Chains. Ao Xuan, come out!

440
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,300
He's not here? Then that's no fun.

441
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,600
The Dragon-Binding Chains are activated by blood.

442
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,040
No one can escape. Just give up!

443
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,720
Attack!

444
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,500
Dragon Clan of the East Sea. It's a joke, after all.

445
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,770
   

446
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,000
Master Shen, after much thought, we decided to come to speak to you.

447
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,960
So I kept having out-of-body experiences, not because of ghosts...

448
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,440
I was sleepwalking.

449
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,860
So, Master Shen, the ghost you asked us to catch turned out to be you?

450
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,400
I think so.

451
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,860
The soil in the courtyard's flowerbed is quite loose.

452
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,280
I suppose this isn't the first time you sleepwalked.

453
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,480
You seem conflicted. Did something else come to mind?

454
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,500
By the way, Master Shen... Whose bones are buried in the flowerbed?

455
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,560
Nothing escapes from Taoist Master Tang's sight.

456
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,860
I didn't want to tell outsiders about our household affairs.

457
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,420
It's your first time at my residence, and you've already discovered my heartache.

458
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,000
I suppose this, too, is fate.

459
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,860
The bones buried in the flowerbed belong to my late wife, Xiao Yi.

460
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,100
She was from the Duoxi Clan.

461
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,860
Burying the bones without a coffin is their custom.

462
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,560
Duoxi Clan buries only the bones.

463
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,680
Why does that sound so familiar?

464
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,920
So, is burying flowers late at night also part of the custom?

465
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,540
No.

466
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:56,940
I looked for Xiao Yi in my sleep because...

467
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,120
I once witnessed Xiangjun secretly harming someone.

468
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,660
I let Xiao Yi down.

469
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,800
Master Shen, isn't your daughter crazy in...

470
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,540
Isn't she delirious?

471
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,420
I don't know what happened.

472
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,000
But I saw Xiangjun harming someone secretly at the old well.

473
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,500
She used demonic witchcraft to kill someone.

474
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,420
How did you know she was using demonic witchcraft?

475
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,500
The Duoxi Clan are experts in demonic witchcraft.

476
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,320
Xiao Yi and I grew up together. So I know a thing or two.

477
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,780
But Xiao Yi died young. She couldn't have taught Xiangjun!

478
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,420
So... Xiangjun must have been possessed!

479
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,580
Taoist Master Tang, I'm begging you.

480
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,520
If you could help Xiangjun return to normal, I'll die without regret.

481
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,760
This well is pretty deep.

482
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,080
But there's nothing inside.

483
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,700
Do you believe what Master Shen said?

484
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,100
The eccentric Miss Shen was possessed by devils.

485
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,300
No wonder he wants you to marry her.

486
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,960
It's so you can heal her.

487
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,160
Master Shen's wife passed away when Miss Shen was very young.

488
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,540
The body buried in the flowerbed is indeed a young woman's.

489
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,580
And it's been quite some time.

490
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,440
There's something on the ground!

491
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,460
Isn't that Sword Woman Jin?

492
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,640
But even if she died, it hasn't been more than a day!

493
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,480
She turned into skeletal remains in one day.

494
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,780
It must be the demonic witchcraft.

495
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,620
Looks like Master Shen is not lying about the demonic spell.

496
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:15,080

♫   My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves   ♫

499
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:53,230
♫   For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you   ♫

500
00:43:53,230 --> 00:44:00,300
♫   If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go?   ♫

501
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:07,430
♫   Turn around and become the delusion of my life  ♫

502
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:14,500
♫   The most beautiful destiny is hidden in the dark night, "love" is the word for everything   ♫

503
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:21,430
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

504
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:28,600

505
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:34,740
♫   Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most  ♫

506
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:42,580
♫   You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers   ♫

507
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:49,010
♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

508
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:56,850
♫  You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine ♫

509
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:04,330
♫   In my dream, the one I loved is with me   ♫

510
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:24,950
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

511
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:31,280
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

512
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:39,000
♫   As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable  ♫

00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,200
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

514
