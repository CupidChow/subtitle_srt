00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,300
 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,500
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,920
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,170
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,456
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:47,220
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,920
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,320
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,800
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,770
   

15
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,150
   

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:40,200
   

17
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,730
 Tang Zhou! 

18
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,020
 - Tang Zhou? What's going on? 
 - Don't come near me. 

19
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,000
 - Go away! 
 - I'm not going. 

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,640
 - Are you— 
 - Leave! 

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,220
 I'll lose control soon. Run! 

22
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,240
 Let me pass my energy to you. 

23
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,060
 She is my beloved one. 

24
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,440
 Unfortunately, our time together is short. 

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,660
 It will come to an end soon. 

26
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:30,000
 May she forget her past and live a happy life. 

27
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,000
You're back.

28
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,700
 Ying Yuan... 

29
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,500
 The Tortoise-Flipping Deity? It's you? 

30
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,040
  My title is Qingli Emperor Ying Yuan. 

31
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,800
  A refined, happy face, but harsh brows filled with sadness.  

32
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,860
 Embellished words lead to emptiness, while simple phrases have deeper meanings. 

33
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,820
 The younger sister is Yan Dan. 

34
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,480
 This is a Distance-Keeping Bracelet. 

35
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,900
 I have placed a Distance-Keeping Lock on it. 

36
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,640
 When you're within 15 steps of me, you will be pushed away like just now. 

37
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,880
 Let me ask you. If one day, I fell in love 

38
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,410
 but I harmed no one and did nothing wrong, would you kill me? 

39
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,160
 I will kill you. 

40
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,060
 You're smart. 

41
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:34,180
 In a GO game, the best way to resolve a deadlock... is to withdraw. 

42
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,140
 Otherwise, both parties will be hurt. 

43
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,920
 Whether it was in Yanxu Heavenly Palace, or in the cottage by the Land Under the Horizon, 

44
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,400
 no matter the time, the location, or the nature of your feelings, 

45
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,120
 did you ever... have me in your heart? 

46
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,220
♫   Three thousand tumultuous waves break the heart finer than dust   ♫

47
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,440
 My heart is devoted to all beings.  

48
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,780
 There is no room for anything else. 

49
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,300
 I have tasted every kind of pain. 

50
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,680
 A gouged heart, thunder strikes, 

51
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,400
 shred to pieces as I jumped off the Bridge of Emptiness, 

52
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,360
 scorched by the Death Fire. 

53
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,880
 None of them is as painful as heartbreak. 

54
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,940
 I must forget him and never look back. 

55
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,960
   

56
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,040
   

57
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,980
   

58
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,780
   

59
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,580
   

60
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,420
   

61
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,340
   

62
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,380
   

63
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,840
   

64
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,480
   

65
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,000
   

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,440
 From now on, the Deity Realm and the Divine Realm are called the Heavenly Realm. 

67
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,360
 The Ghost Realm had been razed to the ground during the war and no longer exists. 

68
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,560
 The Demon Realm and the Devil Realm's territory all belong to the mortal world  

69
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,320
 and is called the Mortal Realm. 

70
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,580
I thought you'd be in a bad mood since Miss Tao left.

71
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,120
I didn't expect you to get over it so quickly.

72
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,720
There is still some time before she recovers and leaves.

73
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,620
Don't worry. I'll try my best to keep her here.

74
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,600
By the way, have you mastered the divine arts I taught you?

75
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,200
I'm already familiar with it.

76
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,380
The three divine tools have been embedded into my body.

77
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,220
The soul-crushing symptoms are getting much better.

78
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,780
The divine tools are embedded in your body.

79
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,960
In the future, even I won't be able to steal them from you.

80
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,980
Unless you fall in love with some girl, take it out and gift it to her.

81
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,480
But that's a good thing.

82
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,660
Tang Zhou. If you hadn't gotten Ink and Paper, I wouldn't have met Ziqi again.

83
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,980
We're friends.

84
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,540
If you have something to say, just say it.

85
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,100
One must fulfill his responsibilities in his position.

86
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,220
You're a Greater God... and the Devil Clan Leader.

87
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,740
But sacrificed all the people just for one person.

88
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,980
Have you ever blamed yourself?

89
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,840
Of course, I have.

90
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,460
As the Devil King, that the Devil Realm was razed to the ground

91
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,100
and its people killed and driven away,

92
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,540
saddens me and I feel guilty.

93
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,640
But I couldn't give the people what they wanted.

94
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,840
And all I wanted...

95
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,560
was only Ziqi.

96
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,720
But you and Miss Tao are from different worlds.

97
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,300
Now, thousands of lives... of the Devil Clan and Immortal Clan are in your hands.

98
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,920
You've sacrificed so much.

99
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,820
Aren't you afraid that things will go against your wishes?

100
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,700
A thousand years ago, neither she nor I were afraid.

101
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,780
Because we felt that as long as we had clear consciences...

102
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,380
the blame and looks from others were nothing at all.

103
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:26,320
But now... she is afraid to face our relationship due to her guilt and wants to evade it.

104
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,860
I must bring her back.

105
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,060
Since I've decided to give up my responsibilities and choose the one I love,

106
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,580
I must hold on until the end.

107
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,320
Otherwise... I'll have let everyone down.

108
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,000
Tang Zhou. If Yan Dan was in danger now, would you sacrifice your life to save her?

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,960
I would.

110
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,420
Look. You can even sacrifice your life.

111
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,200
Then why is it so hard to tell her that you love her?

112
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,100
I'm a demon catcher,

113
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,240
the future chief of the Lingxiao Sect.

114
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,040
I must not fall in love.

115
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,700
Moreover...

116
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,860
mortals and demons walk their paths in different ways.

117
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,500
What if you end up walking in the same direction?

118
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,200
No matter which realm you're in or what clan you belong to, you can develop feelings for someone.

119
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,760
As a mortal, you should know that a mortal's life is very short.

120
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,260
Be brave and pursue the one you love.

121
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,820
Don't wait until it's too late.

122
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,580
Tang Zhou. She once told you to forget the past

123
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,620
and appreciate what you have in the moment.

124
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,180
But what's the past?

125
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,700
That is, one day you meet someone, and everything in front of you becomes dim.

126
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,360
Don't hesitate anymore.

127
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,280
Otherwise... you'll definitely regret it.

128
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,740
Were you waiting for me?

129
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,800
What you want to say... is about Yan Dan, right?

130
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,580
Nothing gets past you.

131
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,460
The bond between Liu Weiyang and Miss Tao is touching.

132
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,420
I don't want to avoid it anymore.

133
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,540
No matter what Yan Dan thinks of me, I'm going to tell her my feelings for her.

134
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,160
But you're the successor of the Lingxiao Sect.

135
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,660
Even if you're willing to face your feelings, will your sect seniors and juniors agree?

136
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,320
I know. You like Yan Dan as well.

137
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,880
You two have spent more time together.

138
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,320
- But— 
 - But, Yan Dan is a demon.

139
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,520
If her identity is discovered, do you know how serious the consequences will be?

140
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,240
And can you bear those consequences?

141
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,760
I hope you can think it over before making a decision.

142
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,780
The premise is... you can't hurt Yan Dan.

143
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,080
Don't worry.

144
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,360
I'll deal with the grievances in my sect properly.

145
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,640
I won't let anything hurt Yan Dan.

146
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,200
After your trials, you'll return to the Heavenly Realm to be the a greater god.

147
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,600
What happens to Yan Dan?

148
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,340
No matter what my identity is, I'll protect her well.

149
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,080
Yan Dan always looks happy and carefree.

150
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,460
But actually, she has a clear stand on love and hate.

151
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:40,100
If she only regards you as a friend, your feelings for her will only make her sadder.

152
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,200
If she rejects you...

153
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,800
I'm afraid you two can't even be friends.

154
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,600
Have you thought about all this?

155
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,020
No matter what the result will be... I don't want to have any regrets.

156
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,500
Everyone has the right to make their own decisions.

157
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,680
I definitely won't interfere with your decision.

158
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,040
But listen to me.

159
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,340
Even if you're my brother, if you ever hurt Yan Dan...

160
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,020
I won't spare you.

161
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,220
Thank you for your care for Yan Dan.

162
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,260
Yu Mo. Rest assured.

163
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,460
I won't let Yan Dan get hurt because of Tang Zhou.

164
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,460
 Yan Dan. Because I was so afraid to lose you, 

165
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,740
 what I've been too afraid to say to you, someone else will say first. 

166
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,380
 Actually, I'm selfish too. 

167
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,860
 I want to take this chance to see... 

168
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,640
 if you only think of me as your master and backer. 

169
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:39,420
♫   I want to be the star that leads you to all corners of the world   ♫

170
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:46,544
♫   Heaven is tedious, let's go to the mortal world to experience all kinds of emotions   ♫

171
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:53,320
♫   We should learn to be a fish that swims around the world   ♫

172
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:00,820
♫   Joy and sorrow can easily be forgotten instantly when the dust washes over   ♫

173
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:07,740
♫   I have experienced the intertwined threads of love like a brocade   ♫

174
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:15,080
♫   I'm still engrossed in the moment of flowers blooming   ♫

175
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:22,300
♫   Sometimes I'm just overwhelmed with sadness   ♫

176
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:29,480
Yan Dan. I've decided... to no longer be the leader of the Lingxiao sect.

177
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,400
In the past decades, I've only been living for the moral obligation to my sect.

178
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,540
But now, I just want to live for myself once.

179
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,020
You've saved me so many times along the way.

180
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,940
From now on,

181
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,920
I'll protect you.

182
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:11,280
Actually... when I first met you, you were quite annoying.

183
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,740
- But... 
 - Stop.

184
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,300
Stop.

185
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:28,380
I know that there have been a lot of misunderstandings and prejudices between us.

186
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,400
But now, waking and sleeping, all I think about is you.

187
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,000
It's all because of you.

188
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,580
My body and my heart were dedicated to all common people.

189
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,880
There was no space to love anyone else.

190
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,160
There wasn't before, what comes next is to be decided.

191
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,630
  Ying Yuan, you'll never abandoned your responsibilities.  

192
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,720
What about the one in your dream?

193
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,000
Aren't you looking for her?

194
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,380
Won't you let her down... if you say such words to me now?

195
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,620
The dream is fiction. What's real is in front of me.

196
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,100
I want to cherish the one who's in front of me.

197
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,110
Let the past be the past. Love is sometimes an illusion.

198
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,120
It's impossible for us to be together.

199
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,920
But I don't want to have any regrets.

200
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:36,680
♫   I blame time for the mortal world's woe is on your shoulder   ♫

201
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:44,800
♫   Like the surging tides of stars, I continuously ask where the origin of love comes from   ♫

202
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,080
What are you doing?

203
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,040
Isn't that the recall memory pearl that the Dragon King gave you?

204
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,780
♫   In my momentary childishness,   ♫

205
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,980
The shattered pearl shall be the witness.

206
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,060
Let bygones be bygones.

207
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:10,740
♫   Counting the passing of the seasons, no matter which directions, everything moves towards you   ♫

208
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,880
♫   The beauty is in the burning agarwood incense, there's still hope when the ashes settled   ♫

209
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,620
I'd like to turn everything in the past... into a sky full of stars...

210
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,480
and give them to you.

211
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:36,100
♫   Understand the wind, think about the rain, and do not awaken from the dream   ♫

212
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,240
 There's so many! 

213
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,220
Catch the stars.

214
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,540
Catching the stars again.

215
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,400
The shooting star that day was just a cover for the illusion of stars in the sky.

216
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,860
And today it is just powder fragments of the pearl.

217
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,780
It's fake.

218
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,460
It's all fake.

219
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,920
It won't come true.

220
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,400
But my love is real.

221
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,500
But I don't want your love anymore.

222
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,140
Don't waste any more effort.

223
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,080
Let me tell you again.

224
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,560
It's impossible for us to be together.

225
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,300
I would never love with you.

226
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,620
   

227
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,180
The spirit-subduing chain and the chief's magical bracelet interact with each other.

228
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,640
The spirit-subduing chain has been vibrating frequently lately.

229
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,740
Is Senior Brother Tang in danger?

230
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,920
You wanted to use the fire of Illusion of Devils... to roast chicken.

231
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,700
Devil Fire Roasted Chicken is only available here in the Three Realms.

232
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,180
Yan Dan will love it.

233
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,880
Tang Zhou was rejected. You look happy though.

234
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,080
What can I be happy about?

235
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,420
I expected this to happen.

236
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,080
I also reminded him.

237
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,540
That if he was rejected when he confessed to Yan Dan, they probably can't even be friends.

238
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,500
Yan Dan is so sad. How can I be happy?

239
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,980
As her master, she's my Advisor Lotus.

240
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,740
I can only roast a chicken to make her happy.

241
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,300
In that case, I'll also roast one for my Ziqi.

242
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,800
Liu Weiyang. I've always wanted to ask you something.

243
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,500
Fu Shuang changed herself into an old woman with a magical spell.

244
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,800
This magical spell is the legendary puppet spell, right?

245
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,600
Exactly.

246
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,200
Can only people of the Devil Clan learn this spell?

247
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,800
Can one look like anyone after mastering this spell?

248
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,100
The puppet spell is different from other magical spells.

249
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,800
Anyone can learn it.

250
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,600
But this is the top secret spell of our Devil Clan.

251
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,300
Except for me, only a few elders can use it.

252
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,800
Then what's the difference between this spell and the mortals' face-changing technique?

253
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,400
The person using the puppet spell has the same face, figure, voice, and smell.

254
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,200
No one can see through it except for those who also know the puppet spell.

255
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,900
Do you think there's more to what happened during the Divine-Devil War?

256
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,200
Although Shuo Hua has the power of the Devil King, but the Four Sovereign Lords fought him at the same time.

257
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,000
How could they have been hurt so badly?

258
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,200
Even if I took the field myself, there would be no chance of winning.

259
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,300
In the end, the Divine Clan won.

260
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:27,000
But judging from the casualties, it seemed more like neither side won.

261
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,100
But if someone interfered, who would have had the greatest advantage from it all?

262
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,600
The Ghost Realm was razed to the ground.

263
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,500
The Demon Clan was forced to live in the same realm with the mortals.

264
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,000
The Devil Realm was almost destroyed.

265
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,600
The Divine Realm and the Heavenly Realm also suffered a great loss after coming together.

266
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,700
It seems that no party gained benefit.

267
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,900
Could it be that you're overthinking it?

268
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,900
I hope so.

269
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,400
Yan Dan, how do I look?

270
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,400
Well... I don't know how to play GO.

271
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,300
But I know you're really good at it.

272
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,400
Could you please teach me?

273
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,400
I won't be playing GO ever again.

274
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,700
Well... You used to hate this Distance-Keeping Lock.

275
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,300
I'll teach you the spell today.

276
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,800
If you're upset, you can use it to punish me.

277
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Tang Zhou. I don't need it anymore.

278
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,400
Also... I really hate this outfit.

279
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:33,540
If you dare wear it again in front of me, I'll burn it when I see it.

280
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,600
Liu Weiyang, are you helping me or setting me up?

281
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,800
Yan Dan, don't get me wrong.

282
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Liu Weiyong chose the clothes.

283
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,400
Yan Dan!

284
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,900
Yan Dan. I said those words thoughtfully, not on a whim.

285
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
The agarwood hairpin...

286
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,300
went around in circles and ended up back with you.

287
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,500
This is our destiny.

288
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,800
The agarwood incense has already long burnt out.

289
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,100
Even if there's fate... we still can't be together in the end.

290
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,400
Even if...

291
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,600
Even if it's really my wishful thinking... will you still destroy it?

292
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,200
Haven't you...

293
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,400
ever felt anything for me?

294
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,500
 Yan Dan. Be clear-headed. 

295
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,600
 He can't be Tang Zhou forever. 

296
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,600
 Sooner or later, he'll become that merciless Emperor Ying Yuan. 

297
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,000
♫   For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you   ♫

298
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,750
No, I haven't.

Please help me take off the Distance-Keeping Bracelet.

302
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,900
Let's not... see each other ever again.

♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

312
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:17,300
♫   You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine  ♫

313
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:24,900
♫   In my dream, the one I loved is with me   ♫

314
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:45,600
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

315
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,800
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

316
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,200
Do you have to leave?

317
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,600
♫  my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable   ♫

318
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,700
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

319
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:14,200
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫

320
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,300
Thank you very much...

321
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:55,200
Yan Dan. Can we... be friends...

322
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,600
like we were before?

323
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,300
Is that all right?

324
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,600
Twenty!

325
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,200
How do know the spell of the Distance-Keeping Lock?

326
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,100
Because just like Liu Weiyang, I've regained my memory.

327
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,000
The Distance-Keeping Lock is in your memories?

328
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,500
Then is your past related to my lost memory?

329
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,800
No.

330
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,600
I stayed for a period of time in the Heavenly Realm.

331
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,800
But at that time, you were the superior and lofty emperor.

332
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,200
And I was just a lowly immortal attendant.

333
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,700
You and I... didn't have any kind of relationship.

334
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,200
Right now you're restrained by the magical bracelet.

335
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,600
In the future, you'll be restrained by the Heavenly Rules.

336
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,800
You should not forget...

337
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,800
that you only came to the Mortal Realm to go through hardships.

338
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,400
You'll have to go back sooner or later.

339
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,800
I don't want to be an deity!

340
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,000
I just want to stay here!

341
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Nine hundred years ago, beside the Night Forgetting River, I was waiting for you to say this. 

342
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,800
 But now... it's too late. 

343
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,000
You're only saying this now because you're a mortal, Tang Zhou.

344
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,600
When you become the Emperor one day, there's no way you'd make this choice.

345
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Don't promise... what you can't deliver.

346
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,000
I don't know what my memory as the emperor is like.

347
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,600
I only know that if I meet you as the emperor, I would still fall in love with you.

348
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,800
Even if you've regained your memory...

349
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,400
I would still choose to be with you.

350
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,390
   

351
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:01,100
♫   The moment of our first meeting in Heaven and on Earth   ♫

352
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:07,000
♫   Even the star frost can't stop the fleeting time   ♫

353
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:15,200
♫   I once borrowed your eyes to warm the coldest moment  ♫

354
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:22,400
♫   I've traveled across the Night Forgetting River, but it's hard to forget this fate   ♫

355
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:29,260
♫   I followed you across the endless seas reluctant to leave you   ♫

356
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,200
♫   It seems too hard to profess my love, the words are caught in my throat   ♫

357
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,500
 So, Tang Zhou wasn't Huo De. 

358
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,700
 Turns out he's Emperor Ying Yuan. 

359
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:46,300
 I thought... we could keep getting along like this. 

360
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,000
 Never parting even as time goes on. 

361
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,200
 I didn't expect... you still met him again. 

362
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,100
 And I... was still too late. 

363
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:07,000
♫   As epiphyllum withers, I'm willing to sink in deep and never let you down in this life   ♫

364
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:15,200
♫   I'm keeping the last glimpse of you, so I won't fear missing you after reincarnation   ♫

365
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,900
♫   Your heart is still beating in my chest   ♫

367
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
♫   Your heart is still beating in my chest   ♫

368
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:03,600
♫   Deep love is engraved in my heart with just one look, I'm willing to take the leap for you   ♫

369
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:10,400
♫   As epiphyllum withers, I'm willing to sink in deep and never let you down in this life   ♫

370
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:18,700
♫   I'm keeping the last glimpse of you, so I won't fear missing you after reincarnation   ♫

371
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:25,800
♫   Your heart is still beating in my chest   ♫

372
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,800
♫   The flowers bloom and fall, even though I say nothing and you hear nothing   ♫

373
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,700
The food is here.

374
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,100
Please enjoy.

375
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,800
I know you've already regained your memory.

376
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,000
You don't have to hold it back in front of me.

377
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,800
Just cry if you want.

378
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,200
Speaking of which, I really am unlucky.

379
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,600
I fell in love with the same person again this time.

380
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Now I know why Sheng De wanted to kill me.

381
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,700
Little did I know she was Ying Deng.

382
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:14,000
But I'm glad... I didn't become as stubborn and crazy as she was.

383
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,600
Don't worry.

384
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,300
Although I remember everything now...

385
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,600
I'm not the same Yan Dan I was before.

386
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:29,800
For me... love isn't everything in my life now.

387
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,000
There's something I have to say.

388
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,400
There were many misunderstandings in the past.

389
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,500
Actually... when you were on the Heavenly Gallows for the second time,

390
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:46,000
Ying Yuan had already asked Marshal Huo De to prepare the Letter of Immunity.

391
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,100
Even if you made it to the Heavenly Gallows, you wouldn't have been punished by fire.

392
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,000
He never intended to hurt you.

393
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,400
Actually what I can't forgive... isn't that he sent me to the Heavenly Gallows,

394
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:08,900
but that he erased our memories... and made me forget the past.

395
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,000
But none of this matters anymore.

396
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,800
Do you blame me...

397
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,600
for not telling you about your past?

398
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:32,900
Only because you hid it from me, I could live a carefree life at Yelan Mountain for all these years.

399
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,500
Yu Mo.

400
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:42,300
Now I finally know that you're that little black fish that I almost smashed to death.

401
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,600
Let me ask you.

402
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:54,400
Did you lose a dragon horn because I came to the Mortal Realm?

403
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,600
No.

404
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:03,400
It's because Ao Xuan found out my true identity... so I had to leave the Nine Heavens.

405
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,400
The dragon horn... was also broken because of him.

406
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,600
I was being chased by him the day I met Zi Lin.

407
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,800
If you don't believe it, you can go ask Zi Lin.

408
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:21,100
When... I was still a fish... you didn't actually smash me.

409
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,800
At the time, it was a critical moment as I was about to take a human form.

410
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,000
I was on the verge of death.

411
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,400
So I looked like I was dying.

412
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,900
You showed your real form to protect me and then I was able to take a human form.

413
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,900
Therefore, I have to thank you.

414
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,400
Otherwise...

415
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,900
how could I rely on you and let you name me as you like?

416
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,600
I didn't expect that there would be such a chance meeting.

417
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Actually, it's good to regain my memory.

418
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,500
I know that Lu Ming was promoted.

419
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,600
He really made us immortal attendants proud.

420
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,200
Also my sister...

421
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,700
What happened to Ying Deng must have been done by my sister.

422
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:15,800
Now, I know... my sister still cares about me.

423
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,100
That's good enough.

424
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,500
Then Zhi Xi was promoted.

425
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,400
She is now the curator of the Magical Pavilion.

426
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,400
If you want to see her... Lu Ming can help.

427
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,500
There's no need.

428
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Don't disturb her peaceful life.

429
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,300
Yan Dan.

430
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:57,800
Since you've regained your memory, I can't take advantage of you anymore.

431
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,900
From now on... can I continue being your follower?

432
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,600
This is the mark you gave me.

433
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,700
How could you erase it?

434
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,900
Yu Mo. Now that I've regained my memory,

435
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,700
I can't continue to play the role of Advisor Lotus anymore.

436
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,700
I owe you too much.

437
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,400
I really have no idea how to pay it back.

438
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
What are you talking about?

439
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,100
We owe each other nothing.

440
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,100
You're my backer and I'm your follower. It's a matter of course.

441
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:04,600
We promised before... we'd share good things and endure difficulties together.

442
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,800
As a Nine Fins... I keep my promise.

443
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,800
How can I possibly leave you behind?

444
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:15,200
But because you're my friend, I can't get you into trouble anymore.

445
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,000
Yu Mo.

446
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,000
Maybe the best choice for me...

447
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,200
is to leave now.

448
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,400
I can't waste any more of your life.

449
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,190
   

450
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,700
Yan Dan.

451
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,500
Here is the indenture contract you signed.

452
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,700
If the deadline hasn't arrived... you can't terminate it early.

453
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,800
I'm sorry.

454
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,000
I've made up my mind.

455
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,000
Let's go our separate ways after tomorrow.

456
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,600
Come on.

457
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,300
Let's get drunk tonight.

458
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,700

♫   No matter how the world changes, you're always by my side   ♫

464
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:34,200
♫   If time is the wilderness, you're a flower field planting memories   ♫

465
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:42,200
♫   I've never said I miss you and I wonder when I fell in love with you   ♫

466
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,200
♫   We're entangled like agarwood intertwined into flames   ♫

467
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,000
♫   It doesn’t extinguish and I've forgotten the cold wind and snow along the way   ♫

468
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,850
♫   I've experienced the ups and downs of the world alone   ♫

469
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:05,900
♫   Finally, I can rest in your heart   ♫

470
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,400
♫   We've been together for a lifetime and gone through all the trials   ♫

471
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,600
♫   We won't complain as time will turn our hardship into sweetness   ♫

472
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:22,700
♫   I won't ask how long forever is, but we'll smile and laugh together   ♫

473
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:30,200
♫   Let the past be the past   ♫

474
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,900
♫   We're entangled like agarwood intertwined into flames   ♫

475
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,600
♫   It doesn’t extinguish and I've forgotten the cold wind and snow along the way   ♫

476
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,560
♫   I've experienced the ups and downs of the world alone   ♫

477
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:04,170
♫   Finally, I can rest in your heart   ♫

478
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:09,000
♫   We've been together for a lifetime and gone through all the trials   ♫

479
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,200
♫   We won't complain as time will turn our hardship into sweetness   ♫

480
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:21,300
♫   I won't ask how long forever is, but we'll smile and laugh together   ♫

481
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:27,800
♫   Let the past be the past   ♫
