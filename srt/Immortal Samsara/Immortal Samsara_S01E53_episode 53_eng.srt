 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,600
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,820
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,170
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,220
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,570
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths   ♫

10
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,020
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,320
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,420
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,500
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,770
   

15
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,050
   

16
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,280
Still no word?

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,000
Your Supreme Majesty, we've searched through the Mortal Realm.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,700
Yelan Mountain was deserted.

19
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,980
We found the Cloud-Steering Boat at the North Sea.

20
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,300
We searched through the North Sea, but they were still nowhere to be found.

21
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,900
The Cloud-Steering Boat being in the North Sea was only a little trick to distract us.

22
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
What about Tao Ziqi?

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,480
- Still no word from her. 
 - Still no word from her?

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,120
That means she's trapped.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,340
Get Tai You over here.

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,140
Why didn't you tell me that Ying Yuan was the Young Lord?

28
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,060
You even tried to kill him.

29
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,920
Don't forget that you swore to serve His Majesty for all eternity and to restore the entire Asura Clan.

30
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,240
I'm helping him.

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,920
He's obsessed with love.

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,560
How could he assume such a great responsibility?

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,880
He must go through hardships so that he can take over the great task of restoring the clan.

34
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,060
He was nearly killed by the Blades of Grievance Punishment.

35
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,860
You don't want to restore the clan at all.

36
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,320
You're just using us to achieve your ambition.

37
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,440
Where is your real form?

38
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,900
Are you really trying to revolt?

39
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,160
For all these years, I've always trusted you and followed your orders.

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,040
So what if you achieve the Universe Enchantment?

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,860
His Majesty's blood runs in Ying Yuan's veins.

42
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,660
You can't defeat him.

43
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,700
Greetings Star Deity.

44
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,320
These are all tributes specially picked by the new master of the Night Forgetting River.

45
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,420
They are offerings to be sent to the Divine Cemetery Forest.

46
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,940
Did it scare you, Star Deity? Please forgive us.

47
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,260
Seriously. What's wrong with the Night Forgetting River?! Even the fish are agitated.

48
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,940
Star Deity, these are the most valuable and precious Three Pools Carp of the Night Forgetting River.

49
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,180
Okay. You may leave.

50
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,740
Let them go.

51
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,940
I'm fine.

52
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,460
Yi Zang, thank you.

53
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,760
The heavenly soldiers conducted a rigorous inspection.

54
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,100
Without your help, I'm afraid we couldn't have gotten into the Divine Cemetery Forest.

55
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,540
We've been friends for 800 years.

56
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,560
Of course, I'll help you if you ask.

57
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,060
Besides, the previous Underworld King was such a tyrant.

58
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,180
It's all thanks to Emperor Ying Yuan for imposing sanctions on him.

59
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,460
Everyone in the Night Forgetting River has always remembered this kindness.

60
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,100
People who do good deeds bear good fruit.

61
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,100
It's unnecessary to bring up the past.

62
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,220
You three should go conduct your search.

63
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,440
I'll guard the entrance.

64
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,560
I'll definitely get you back to the Mortal Realm safely.

65
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,100
Thank you.

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,260
We'll know if it was him in just a moment.

67
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,980
It's in the shape of a crescent moon.

68
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,800
Zhi Xi told me about this before.

69
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,020
During the War of Genesis, in order to save the ancient bloodline, the Blood Eagle Clan,

70
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,440
His Supreme Majesty once used the divine tool, Crescent Blade,

71
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,020
to rip out his blood and flesh to feed the eagle,

72
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,300
so that the Blood Eagle Clan could survive.

73
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,520
But the wound on his body could never heal.

74
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,880
Its shape was like a crescent moon.

75
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,380
This is the scar left when His Supreme Majesty ripped out his flesh to feed the eagle.

76
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,120
This immortal body... belongs to him.

77
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,240
Someone cast a Puppet Spell on His Supreme Majesty's immortal body.

78
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,820
It was swapped with Huan Qin's and hidden here.

79
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:08,120
So it seems that the real Heavenly Emperor has already been...

80
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,420
Then, the current Heavenly Emperor is Huan Qin?

81
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,120
Who exactly is it that could deceive everyone like this?

82
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,820
That day when I was restoring the barrier,

83
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,600
His Supreme Majesty prevented me from becoming a demon with a wisp of his primordial spirit.

84
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,500
Now that his immortal body is here, and I've got his primordial spirit,

85
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,740
I'm sure I can bring His Supreme Majesty back to life.

86
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,920
If His Supreme Majesty could be revived, then Huan Qin's crime will be revealed.

87
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,900
Your Supreme Majesty!

88
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,380
Your Supreme Majesty!

89
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:16,120
Ying Yuan, you've finally discovered the secret that I've been keeping my entire life.

90
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,640
Is it Huan Qin?

91
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,840
It turns out that I was wrong about him.

92
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,360
Right from the beginning, it's because

93
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,520
I realized everything too late.

94
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,260
The treacherous are cunning.

95
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,980
You can't blame yourself.

96
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,640
You are a worthy Emperor.

97
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,040
If your mother was still alive, I am sure she would be proud of you.

98
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,160
My mother?

99
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
That's right.

100
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,140
In Nine Heavens, why are you the only person

101
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,520
who can repair the Heaven-Demon Barrier that the Primordial Lord left?

102
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,820
Because Primordial Lord, Ran Qing, is your biological mother.

103
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,820
Soul Ripping Sword, come!

104
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,260
When your mother destroyed her own primordial spirit, it shattered Xuanye's Moment-Turning Gear.

105
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,220
The broken pieces of the Moment-Turning Gear are hidden inside the Soul-Ripping Sword.

106
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,240
It retained some traces of residual memories.

107
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,580
The past and grievances between your mother and Xuan Ye is inside it.

108
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,800
 The Asura Clan slaughtered other clans. It's an injustice. 

109
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,120
 If you don't stop right now, 

110
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,580
 it'll be a declaration of war against us, the Deity Clan. 

111
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,500
 Are you all right? 

112
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,320
 - Thank you for your help. 
 - What's your name? 

113
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,400
 Why are you here alone? 

114
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,820
 After I was born, my entire family died. 

115
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,700
 I've lived in exile since then. 

116
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,920
 I don't have a name. 

117
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,780
 Ran Qing, the Asura Clan will start war sooner or later. 

118
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,980
 This person's identity is unknown. How could you let him stay in the Nine Heavens? 

119
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,140
 He was born out of a calamity. His family was broken apart. 

120
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,300
 Of course, no one knows about his identity. 

121
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,980
 I've already looked into his spiritual essence. He's just a demon who has little spiritual power. 

122
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,040
 If we send him back to the savage region, I'm afraid he'll certainly die. 

123
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,790
 There are no survivors in the places the Asura Clan soldiers have visited. 

124
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,400
 If he did really had such little spiritual power, 

125
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,980
 how could he stay alive long enough for you to rescue him? 

126
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,500
 Saving lives is the reason why I go onto the battlefield. 

127
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,080
 Ignoring a life over mere suspicion and cowardice is not what a merciful person should do. 

128
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,780
 Ran Qing. 

129
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,340
 Fine. I know you have a gentle heart. 

130
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,640
 How about this? 

131
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,520
 I'll transfer some divine power to him, so that he can fight regular soldiers from the Asura Clan. 

132
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,740
 Will that do? Just send him back to the mortal world. 

133
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,340
 It's blessing enough for me to be alive. 

134
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,340
 I won't be insatiable and covet divine power. 

135
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,640
 Greater God, Ran Qing, means well. 

136
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,980
 I shouldn't put you in a hard spot. 

137
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,360
 Oh right, this is the tea I just made for you two. 

138
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,240
 Please enjoy it. 

139
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,480
 Greater God. 

140
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,740
 Your Supreme Majesty. 

141
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,640
 Careful. Are you hurt? 

142
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,220
 I'm fine. I... didn't have a good hold on it. 

143
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,420
 Your Supreme Majesty, I was careless. 

144
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,380
 Greater God, thank you for your help during this time. 

145
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,640
 I am willing to return to the Mortal Realm now. 

146
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,160
 Ran Qing! 

147
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,960
 You got what you wanted. Others put pressure on me and you do as well. 

148
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,920
 I didn't touch him just now. He was pretending. 

149
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,360
 His injury hasn't healed yet. I'll take him back to the Mortal Realm. 

150
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,280
 Then, I'll come with you. 

151
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,840
 It's not necessary. There are many affairs in both the Deity and Divine Realms that demand your attention. 

152
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,280
 There's no one in the world that can hurt me. 

153
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,840
 Are you all right? 

154
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,660
 I am fine. 

155
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,800
 You are a Greater God. 

156
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,440
 I am a demon. 

157
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,790
 We'll eventually part ways. You don't need to mind it. 

158
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,720
 The Asura Clan is ambitious. 

159
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,080
 They came to provoke us many times before. 

160
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,160
 That is why those immortals are suspicious. 

161
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,800
 Do not take it personally. 

162
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,000
 You care about the well-being of the world. 

163
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,060
 It makes sense for you to look at the big picture. 

164
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,040
 It's just that I often see you stay up all night discussing military matters. 

165
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,100
 I was thinking that... maybe I could give you a hand. 

166
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,820
 But that's not in our destiny. 

167
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,080
 If I can survive the war, 

168
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,840
 will you come to the Demon Realm to be my guest and name me? 

169
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,380
 All right. 

170
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,820
 It's a deal. 

171
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,800
 It's people from the Deity Clan. 

172
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,720
 Killing them can give us massive spiritual power. 

173
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,090
 We, the Asura troops, are stationed here. 

174
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,920
 Today, you'll certainly die. 

175
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,400
 Attack! 

176
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,060
 Are you all right? 

177
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,220
 Why did you take the hit for me? 

178
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,100
 You knew that with my divine power, they can't hurt me. 

179
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:58,120
 Even so, I'm still worried that they'll hurt you. 

180
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,900
 You saved me once. 

181
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,200
 I should repay your kindness. 

182
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,380
 Their troops should be around here. 

183
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,900
 Hurry and go. Don't worry about me. 

184
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,920
 Let me take you to heal your wounds. 

185
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,800
 Thank you. You saved me once again. 

186
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,720
 With the protection of the Seven Star Deity Jade, you'll be all right. 

187
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,480
 Just get some good rest here. 

188
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,500
 This is the place where I meditate. 

189
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,360
 Hundreds of flowers will blossom during the flowering season. It's very beautiful. 

190
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,100
 Unfortunately, I've been busy with political affairs for many years. 

191
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,660
 I've never properly enjoyed the flowers before. 

192
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,420
 Let me try it. 

193
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,480
 Maybe I can make the flowering period start sooner. 

194
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,540
 I was transformed from trees. 

195
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,520
 I can reverse the life cycle of flowers and plants. 

196
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,520
 Hundreds of flowers are in bloom. It feels like springtime. 

197
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,560
 Not bad. 

198
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,600
 The beauty of the blossom lies in the sincerity of a waiting heart. 

199
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,120
 If we don't experience the coldness in the winter, 

200
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,160
 it would be hard to understand the warmth of the springtime. 

201
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,900
 It's a beautiful view. 

202
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,160
 But unfortunately, I've got work to do. 

203
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,180
 I must leave now. 

204
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,600
 You always say that you're busy with work, and you haven't seen the flowers in a long time. 

205
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,600
 Why don't... you stay here and enjoy the moment? 

206
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,900
 Only after experiencing the coldness of the dusk 

207
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,820
 can you know the warmth of the spring. 

208
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,380
 I'll call you Mu Han. 

209
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,920
 How about it? 

210
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,680
 Cover the hot furnace when it's cold at dusk. 

211
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,160
 Shape the eyebrows on a warm spring day.
(T/N: it's a play on words using their names) 

212
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,340
 That's good. 

213
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,040
 Is it sweet? 

214
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,540
 Look. 

215
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,120
 I've stayed here for many days. 

216
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,640
 I don't dare keep bothering you. 

217
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,320
 Have you been happy during this time? 

218
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,360
 What do you mean? 

219
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,080
 Are you... going to leave? 

220
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,680
 The past is the past. 

221
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,500
 We can't dwell on it. 

222
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,540
 It's time for us to say goodbye. 

223
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,340
 What if I insist? 

224
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,200
 A shooting star is beautiful, 

225
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,480
 but it's fleeting. 

226
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,840
 I wonder if our happiness will be like this as well. 

227
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,160
 By the way, do you have a mirror? 

228
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,260
 Things in the world change. 

229
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,780
 Just like the rise and fall of the stars and the waxing and waning of the moon. 

230
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,180
 If one day you regret it, 

231
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,280
 at least you can look at the view in the mirror. 

232
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,880
 It'll look the same as before, 

233
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,140
 we will never part. 

234
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:09,160
 No matter how things change in the world, you'll always be my husband. 

235
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,860
 Always and forever. 

236
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,660
 What's wrong with the Jade? 

237
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,520
 Eternal Darkness? It really is you. 

238
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,420
 Xuan Ye. 

239
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,320
 Ran Qing. 

240
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,880
 I still like it better when you call me Mu Han. 

241
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,100
 You found something was wrong. 

242
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,040
 You must've used the fake Jade. 

243
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,160
 Then, are you hurt? That's why you used it? 

244
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,360
 Stop pretending. 

245
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,200
 Everything in the past was a sham. 

246
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,780
 You approached me just to steal the Jade and slaughter the helpless, 

247
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,486
 in order to achieve the Asura Clan's ambition of ruling the world! 

248
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:20,480
 My family has short lifespans. 

249
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,540
 Even if we have strong divine power, it'll be hard for us to subdue every clan. 

250
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,420
 So I borrowed the Jade. 

251
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,940
 But I'm in love with you. 

252
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,160
 There is no lie in that. 

253
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,480
 Whether it's the world 

254
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,780
 or my lover, 

255
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,140
 I'll never give them up. 

256
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,940
 Ridiculous. 

257
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,060
 I mistakenly trusted you once. 

258
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,380
 It won't happen again. 

259
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,340
 I failed to distinguish good from bad, and I fed the beast. 

260
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:11,340
 Today, I must personally eradicate the evil to atone for my sins. 

261
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,640
 It's useless, Ran Qing. 

262
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,760
 Now, I've obtained the Seven Star Deity Jade already. 

263
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,860
 My Eternal Darkness has already reached its peak. 

264
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,960
 The Moment-Turning Gear can even reverse time. 

265
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,440
 No matter what the outcome of this war is, you can never kill me. 

266
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,600
 Just let it go. 

267
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,500
 Or you'll get yourself hurt. 

268
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,960
 I was fooled by the enemy and betrayed by my husband. 

269
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,060
 Hasn't it hurt me enough? 

270
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:56,280
 Now that the truth has been revealed, why are you still pretending?! 

271
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,500
 When I become the ruler of the world, I'll still keep you company and wait for the flowers to blossom. 

272
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,140
 Then, you'll know that my heart is true. 

273
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,960
 Wait for me. 

274
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,840
 Ran Qing. Why are you here? 

275
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,980
 The Jade has been broken. 

276
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,440
 Just stop. 

277
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,300
 Stop? 

278
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,820
 I've extended my life for thousands of years already. 

279
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,480
 So what if you destroyed the Jade? 

280
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,240
 You can't die. 

281
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,840
 I want you to see with your own two eyes, when I unify all the clans and open up the Six Realms. 

282
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:46,300
 Killing me and obtaining the world, will you get what you want this way? 

283
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:51,480
 You said before... that we'll never part. 

284
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,160
 Now, 

285
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,220
 you broke your promise after all. 

286
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,220
 If I could go back in time... 

287
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,360
 I'd still want to meet you. 

288
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,780
 It's just that I don't want things like this to happen. 

289
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,980
 But... I won't have that chance anymore. 

290
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,150
 I've loved you. 

291
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,050
 I won't regret it. 

292
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,560
 I won't break my promise, Ran Qing. 

293
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,440
 Wait for me. 

294
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,360
 I can rewrite our ending. 

295
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,580
 Why didn't you avoid it? 

296
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,620
 Why are you staring at me like this? 

297
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,480
 Do we... know each other? 

298
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,660
 I've always admired the formidable reputation of the Greater God, Ran Qing. 

299
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,260
 Now that I get to meet you, I am stunned. 

300
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,940
 I knew that you 

301
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,100
 would definitely come to rescue me. 

302
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,740
 What's your name? 

303
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,000
 Why are you here alone? 

304
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,340
 Cover the hot furnace when it's cold at dusk. 

305
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,320
 Shape the eyebrows on a warm spring day. 

306
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,280
 My name is Mu Han.

♫   It seems too hard to profess my love, the words are caught in my throat   ♫

315
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:06,770
♫   I've wasted a millennium thinking about how to let go of my endless longing for you   ♫

316
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:13,470
♫   Love can only be redeemed if the deadline is forgotten   ♫

317
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:23,400
♫   Deep love is engraved in my heart with just one look, I'm willing to take the leap for you   ♫

318
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:30,400
♫   As epiphyllum withers, I'm willing to sink in deep and never let you down in this life   ♫

319
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:38,650
♫   I'm keeping the last glimpse of you, so I won't fear missing you after reincarnation   ♫

320
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:46,420
♫   Your heart is still beating in my chest   ♫

321
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:02,300
♫   Deep love is engraved in my heart with just one look, I'm willing to take the leap for you   ♫

322
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:09,200
♫   As epiphyllum withers, I'm willing to sink in deep and never let you down in this life   ♫

323
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:17,520
♫   I'm keeping the last glimpse of you, so I won't fear missing you after reincarnation   ♫

324
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:24,470
♫   Your heart is still beating in my chest   ♫

325
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:34,270
♫   The flowers bloom and fall, even though I say nothing and you hear nothing   ♫
