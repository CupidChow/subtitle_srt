 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,500
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai advises people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,820
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,170
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,350
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,220
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,000
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,440
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,020
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,820
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,770
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,570
   

15
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,950
   

16
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,020
Search this place!

17
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,660
Fairy Ying Deng, you secretly used Lovesick perfume in an attempt to seduce His Majesty.

18
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,880
Now that we have the evidence, what do you have to say in your defense?

19
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,520
Come and have a look! 
    

20
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,900
Come and watch the latest play of Lovely Theatre Troupe, "Rendezvous by Pear Garden"! 
    

21
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,320
- Come and watch it. 
 - Let's go. Let's check it out.

22
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,760
Young Master Wang. This way, please.

23
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,980
- Official Zhang. Official Zhang, come inside. 
 - All right.

24
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,480
Thank you for coming!

25
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,920
♪  The floating clouds don't know the weariness of the setting sun.  ♪

26
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,220
 - Nice! 
 - Bravo! 

27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,620
♪  The tall buildings don't know the worries of the running water.  ♪

28
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,160
 - Great. 
 - Nice! 

29
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,540
Amazing!

30
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,780
Marvelous! Today's performance is very good.

31
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,040
The best so far from Lovely Theatre Troupe, I dare say.

32
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,760
Indeed. I wonder who the scriptwriter is.

33
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,040
I wrote this play.

34
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
I wrote it.

35
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,220
- Move! 
 - Let me go!

36
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,300
- You stole His Majesty's jade buckle. 
 - I want to talk to His Supreme Majesty!

37
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,580
You concocted the forbidden perfume. We have the evidence.

38
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,400
- There can be no mistake. Move! 
 - Let me go!

39
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,160
Greetings, Curator of Magical Pavilion.

40
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,240
I'm here to see her off.

41
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,940
Can you give us some privacy?

42
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:03,620
You planned everything for this day, so you could rise in the ranks.

43
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,320
How cunning of you.

44
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,420
The truth regarding the collusion of the heavenly registry  official with other parties,

45
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,500
as well as his forgery of Night Forgetting River's registry, which has been made public.

46
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,300
He will receive forty-nine thunder strikes.

47
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,480
Before his title was revoked,

48
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,300
the last amendment he made to the heavenly record concerns your future.

49
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,340
The Pool of Eight Hardships.

50
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,340
If the water is clear, it means you can exercise your meditation mind as punishment.

51
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,740
If the water is murky, your immortal body will be destroyed, and you will be demoted to a mortal.

52
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,320
His Supreme Majesty decided that your divine status will be revoked, and your memory erased.

53
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,380
You will be demoted to Mortal Realm. You will never be a deity again.

54
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,020
His Majesty is just down there to go through the mortal trials. He will return one day.

55
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,500
But you?

56
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,080
You can never come back.

57
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,580
You'll go through the pain of being a mortal in Mortal Realm.

58
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,280
I accept my defeat.

59
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,040
Just do whatever you want.

60
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,160
I regret nothing.

61
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,880
However much I punish you now,

62
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,760
Yan Dan...

63
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,600
will never come back.

64
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,080
What did you make me swallow?

65
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,980
Memory-Retaining Pill.

66
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,220
I want you to remember you were once a fairy, so that you'll live with shame in the Mortal Realm.

67
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,260
I'm sure, for the pretentious Fairy Ying Deng, this is a fate worse than death.

68
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,900
You...

69
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,820
For the pain you inflicted on Yan Dan, I will make you pay a hundred or thousand times over!

70
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,520
Come out now.

71
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,500
Yan Dan.

72
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,780
I have done it.

73
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,520
I have avenged you.

74
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:48,010
So this is why you asked me to say that when Ying Deng submitted the divine tools.

75
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,180
Yan Dan... is actually alive.

76
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,600
I didn't tell you because I was angry with you.

77
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,280
His Majesty saved her and sent her to the Mortal Realm.

78
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,080
Yan Dan...

79
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,840
became a mortal?

80
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,120
His Majesty forcefully took Yan Dan out of Night Forgetting River.

81
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,420
Although her immortal spirit was gone, she could turn into a demon.

82
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,100
She must be living as a free flower demon now.

83
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:38,330
Yan Dan once told me she could never forgive you because you were the closest person to her.

84
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,520
However, she still hoped you could overcome your inner demon.

85
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,430
In her eyes, you have always been the stronger one.

86
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,810
Zhi Xi... live well.

87
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:59,650
Yan Dan never stopped hoping that one day, you could live for yourself.

88
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,420
All right?

89
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,960
Why are you frowning?

90
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,160
"Rendezvous by Pear Garden" has been played ten times consecutively. We've had a full house every time.

91
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,460
Troupe Leader asked me to stay here to compose the next play.

92
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,080
I might have no idea where I come from, but I know what I want.

93
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,620
I really love writing plays.

94
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,600
My goal is to rise to fame, as the best scriptwriter in the world.

95
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,060
While my ambition is bold, my inspiration cannot keep up.

96
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,840
I cannot think of or write anything.

97
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,700
You're a talented writer, but your characters' emotions are very rigid.

98
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,420
"Rendezvous by Pear Garden" moved the people because it's inspired by the author's own experience.

99
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,720
You're still young and inexperienced, so you don't how complicated humans can be.

100
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,560
Without having enough experience, naturally, you can't produce a good story.

101
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,760
Jiang Chen, can you tell me what should I do?

102
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,000
The nuanced feelings everyone has here cannot be put into words.

103
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,220
You have to experience it yourself. No one can describe it to you.

104
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,340
You have to travel a lot and endure many things.

105
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:06,460
Only by tasting the sweet and sour, the joy and sorrow, can you view life as it is, and find yourself in it.

106
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,980
You'll find out what it truly means to love and let go.

107
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,000
And then, you'll write a gut-wrenching, tear-jerking story.

108
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,860
"The sweet and sour,"

109
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,500
"the joy and sorrow."

110
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,120
Let's go!

111
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,400
As per your request, Mountain Chief, we have recalled all tribes that were exiled and bullied by Prison Lizard.

112
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,380
We have also allotted the food quota and living quarters based on each tribe's population.

113
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Most tribes were happy to oblige, except for the Tiger Clan, which has always prided itself as the head of all demons.

114
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,980
They want more territory.

115
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,400
In your opinion...

116
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,740
In my opinion, sure.

117
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,460
In my opinion, now that Yelan Mountain has new leaders, the rules here have changed.

118
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:27,920
We steer away from distributing resources based on tribal strength, so weaker tribes will not feel sidelined.

119
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,180
Tell the Tiger Clan that if they have any issues, they may ask for a duel.

120
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,670
If they can win against Zi Lin or me, I'll entertain their request.

121
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,800
I agree with Yu Mo.

122
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,420
When we were trying to kill Prison Lizard, they were nowhere to be seen.

123
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,000
And now they demand more territory.

124
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,540
Yes.

125
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,660
Any news?

126
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:59,420
Whether it's us, the Avian Clan, or the Aquatic Clan members you sent out... we've got nothing so far.

127
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,600
I know you're looking everywhere for her. Can we have more information?

128
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,400
For example, her appearance, her special traits, or her age.

129
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,960
She likes to eat. She can finish a chicken in one sitting.

130
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,120
She cares for her friends.

131
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,120
When her friends are in trouble, no matter what,

132
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,320
she'd be there immediately, even though her spiritual power is weak.

133
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,980
She's self-centered.

134
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,240
But that was her previous self.

135
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,280
 The mark she gave me still lights up. She must have escaped Night Forgetting River alive. 

136
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,540
 But whether she's a mortal, demon, or deity remains unknown. 

137
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:49,880
 Has her appearance changed? Or did she turn into another creature? 

138
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,580
Zi Lin, I'll leave this mountain for a while.

139
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,960
What? Yu Mo.

140
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,380
We need a leader to re-establish order here in the mountain.

141
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,760
If you leave, what should I do?

142
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,280
A hundred avian demons can search through all lands in a few days.

143
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,500
The Aquatic Clan has routes to all places. They can go through all water bodies in a few days.

144
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,480
They are far more efficient than you when it comes to looking for her.

145
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,420
But it's been a while, and I still haven't received news about her.

146
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:19,930
In this world, only I can recognize her, no matter what form or what appearance she takes.

147
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,040
"The floating clouds don't know the weariness of the setting sun."

148
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,080
"My father doesn't understand the sorrow of Dan Shu."

149
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,860
That's not what was written in the play.

150
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,420
I was training and watching plays in Mortal Realm.

151
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,260
I was enjoying myself, but you had to drag me into this forest!

152
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,780
You...

153
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,370
Greetings, Mountain Chief.

154
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,720
I'm Yuan Dan, the leader of the Wolf Clan.

155
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,860
You were kind to me, so I came to repay your kindness.

156
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,160
No need.

157
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,800
Can you recite those lines again?

158
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,040
Since you enjoy training, this dagger will suit you.

159
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,160
"Floating clouds don't know the weariness of the setting sun."

160
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,880
"Tall buildings don't know the worries of the running water."

161
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,660
"Birth and death. Good times have gone. When can one rest?"

162
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,980
Do you like plays too?

163
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,760
 The west wind blows softly. The sound of music stopped. 

164
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,320
 Floating clouds don't know the weariness of the setting sun. 

165
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,920
 Tall buildings don't know the worries of the running water. 

166
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,190
 Birth and death. Good times have gone. 

167
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,620
 When can one rest? 

168
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:33,460
 The setting sun illuminates the world only because the world is his beloved. 

169
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,200
 Even if no one understands him, he has no regrets. 

170
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,280
 Yu Mo. 

171
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:47,940
 Today, let Xuanxin Cliff rain for Immortal Lord. 

172
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:01,275
   

173
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,040
 Immortal Lord! Don't worry! 

174
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,840
 I'll take good care of Yu Mo for you! 

175
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,640
It's her.

176
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,800
It must be her!

177
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,920
Dan Shu, I will give you all the divine tools on this mountain.

178
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,340
Just tell me where you heard those lines.

179
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,200
Mountain Chief, the play is called "Rendezvous by Pear Garden".

180
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,160
It's a new critically-acclaimed play in Mortal Realm.

181
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,780
Many other troupes have performed it too.

182
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,960
She once said she wanted to become the best scriptwriter in the Six Realms.

183
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,780
That hasn't changed at all.

184
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:54,810
If she's waiting for me... then I will search all the performing troupes in this world.

185
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:12,039
♪  Floating clouds don't know the weariness of the setting sun  ♪

186
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:18,679
♪  Tall buildings don't know the worries of the running water  ♪

187
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:25,318
♪  Birth and death, good times have gone.  ♪

188
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,680
- Bravo! 
  - Bravo! 

189
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,500
Miss Jiang Chen.

190
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,660
Where is Prince Pei? I have been waiting for him.

191
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,660
His cough relapsed today, and he's been vomiting blood.

192
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,080
He's too ill to come.

193
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,740
- Let me see him! 
 - No need. All the physicians have checked him.

194
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,230
They said, no matter what they do, or whatever rare herbs they give him, he will not be able to live for more than two weeks.

195
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,860
His Highness told me to pass this message to you: "Destiny cannot be defied."

196
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:55,180
He cannot reciprocate your feelings. So... please forget him.

197
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,675
   

198
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,160
 Young Master Wang, mind your manners! 

199
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,720
- Come. 
 - Let go of me!

200
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,520
Young Master Wang, please mind your manners!

201
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,740
Don't play coy, Miss Jiang Chen.

202
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,140
Pei Luo is unconscious now.

203
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,340
He can't love you right now, so I shall instead!

204
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,140
Let go! Let go of me!

205
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,740
- Mind your manners! 
 - Get off her!

206
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,540
Are you all right?

207
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,520
Mon... Monster.

208
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,180
Monster!

209
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,960
You call me a monster?

210
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,540
You're a pervert!

211
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,440
That's all it takes? So weak!

212
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,080
Don't you know you're a demon?

213
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,280
How can you use your power in front of a mortal?

214
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,720
What if he summons a Demon Catcher here?

215
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,540
Jiang Chen, don't listen to him. I'm not a monster.

216
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,190
I gave him a light tap and he passed out like that.

217
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,380
I didn't even use any force.

218
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,580
I...

219
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,900
What was that?

220
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,560
I'm a demon too. I'm an Epiphyllum Demon.

221
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,040
To conceal my identity, I don't use my powers.

222
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,260
If we weren't in the same clan, why would I save you?

223
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,580
I... I'm a demon?

224
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,260
You're also a demon?

225
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,940
No wonder you made up nonsense when Troupe Leader inquired about your origin.

226
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,440
I thought you had another reason. So you truly know nothing about yourself?

227
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Your body has too much frigid energy. That's why you have those gray marks.

228
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,260
Your spiritual power is weak. I can't sense your demonic essence.

229
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,500
It is odd, to say the least.

230
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,500
This is too much for me. Let me digest it.

231
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,680
But when I was still a human, these gray marks were always there.

232
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,360
Now that I'm a demon, it's still there!

233
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,920
So being a demon did nothing? I'm still ugly.

234
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,740
Ugly, but heroic.

235
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,620
You injured Young Master Wang with your powers.

236
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,560
He'll be no different from a eunuch now.

237
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,440
You just freed all women of the Southern Capital from the terror of this pervert.

238
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,040
I'm quite powerful then.

239
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,400
He'll make a scene when he wakes up. You should leave.

240
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,300
Take this. Travel westward after you exit the city.

241
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,920
Look for Flower Clan's leader in the Hidden Flower Mountain forest.

242
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,960
When he sees this, he'll take you in, as a favor to me.

243
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,320
What about you? Come with me.

244
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,340
Or else, what will you do after he wakes up?

245
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,420
Wherever Pei Luo is, I'll be there.

246
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,340
He's very ill. He won't live for long.

247
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm too weak to save him.

248
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,340
If he passes away...

249
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,640
I will reunite with him eventually in the afterlife.

250
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,520
Humans are complicated, especially when in love.

251
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,560
You're still young, you won't understand now. But one day, you will.

252
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,540
Just go.

253
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,840
Jiang Chen, you're my first good friend in the Mortal Realm.

254
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,340
I will miss you.

255
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,920
After we part ways today, I will travel around.

256
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,360
I hope I can experience "the sweet and sour, the joy and sorrow," as you said.

257
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,060
I hope I can understand what true feelings are.

258
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,000
If one day, I can write a tear-jerking play...

259
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,630
"If"? I know you will.

260
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:03,810
And then, whenever it is or wherever you are, I will be there to perform it with you.

261
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:09,850
   

262
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,520
The horses began whining so early in the morning?

263
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,000
Stop sulking already.

264
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,600
Though we still haven't found her after visiting more than ten theatre troupes,

265
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,600
they said "Rendezvous by Pear Garden" came from Lovely Theatre Troupe in the Southern Capital.

266
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Once we're in the Southern Capital, we'll find something.

267
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,400
Let me check whether this inn forgot to feed the horses.

268
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,900
Stop eating.

269
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,400
Come with me.

270
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,500
Don't worry. I'm not here to kidnap you.

271
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,700
I just need some help now, so please lend me your strong legs.

272
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,600
I'm counting on you.

273
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,400
Thank you.

274
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,000
Horse thief!

275
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,900
An ugly one at that. How dare you steal my horse!

276
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,900
You're ugly. Your entire family is ugly!

277
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,500
You...

278
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,500
Humans and demons are different.

279
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,200
We're here to find someone. Don't cause trouble.

280
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,700
Let's go back. We can just buy another horse.

281
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,700
She cast a spell just now. She wields supernatural power!

282
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,600
But I still feel nervous. What should I do?

283
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,000
Don't worry. You can do this.

284
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,200
Just do what you normally do.

285
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
Rafflesia demon, Qian Qian. Please enter.

286
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,500
- Go ahead. 
 - Go now.

287
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,900
Just do your best.

288
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,600
Excuse me. Thank you.

289
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,800
- It sure is crowded here. 
 - Indeed.

290
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,600
Excuse me, is the leader of Flower Spirit Clan in there?

291
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,800
My friend told me to come here.

292
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,200
Many flower demons are waiting here.

293
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
We're all here due to our connections.

294
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,900
Judging from your looks, you won't be chosen.

295
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Does your appearance decide if you can be a demon now?

296
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,400
Stop!

297
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,400
I'm trying to present a beauty to Mountain Chief, not a pest remover!

298
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,600
Your talent is useless!

299
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,100
Don't worry, Tribe Chief.

300
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:40,900
Though she isn't very beautiful, we still have our treasure, the Yanbi Pill.

301
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,600
It is made from one hundred flowers.

302
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,400
Not only can it cleanse the yin in one's body, but it can also enhance one's beauty. 
  (T/N: "yin" - dark energy) 

303
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,900
If we present both this beauty and this pill, the new mountain chiefs will definitely acknowledge our sincerity.

304
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,400
 "Cleanse the yin in one's body"? 

305
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,900
 "Enhance one's beauty"? 

306
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,800
 This was tailor-made for me! 

307
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,600
Next.

308
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,700
Me!

309
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,600
Tribe Chief! Pick me!

310
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,000
Tribe Chief. I'm Bai Piaoliang, a lotus demon.

311
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,400
Jiang Chen recommended me here.

312
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,600
You...

313
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,000
My dear heaven, are you going to eliminate our Flower Spirit Clan?

314
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,900
That's enough. The beauty pageant stops here!

315
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,100
Tribe Chief, you can't judge a book by its cover.

316
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,400
You...

317
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,600
I want to present a beautiful concubine to Mountain Chief.

318
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,700
If I don't judge by appearance, what criteria should I use?

319
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,800
I have other talents.

320
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,500
Talents?

321
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,100
Hear me out.

322
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,200
Hear me, hear me, hear me out.

323
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,400
My wise chief.

324
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,200
I was living at the border of the Southern Capital, leading an anonymous life in a theatre troupe.

325
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,200
In order to make a living, I wrote and performed my plays.

326
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,500
But a Demon Catcher came after me!

327
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,000
He hit me on my face and marred my beauty.

328
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I shall avenge myself!

329
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
I heard Mountain Chief's power knows no bound.

330
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
He's strong enough to protect his home.

331
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,600
So I traveled far and wide to seek refuge.

332
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
I pray that you will take pity on me!

333
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,500
I will repay your kindness with my loyalty!

334
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,800
My loyalty!

335
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,800
Wonderful!

336
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,200
Your story has moved me to tears.

337
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,300
Now that's an interesting talent!

338
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,000
I see you wish to obtain Mountain Chief's protection.

339
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,300
I can do you this favor.

340
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,300
However, you will not be presented as a potential concubine.

341
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,000
Are you okay with that?

342
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,800
I will go through all hardships just to serve Mountain Chief!

343
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,800
The Flower Spirit Clan has two treasures.

344
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,600
The first one is Yanbi Pill.

345
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,800
And the second one is Zi Teng.

346
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,800
You will be Zi Teng's dowry maid. 
 (T/N: maid who accompanies a noble lady to her new husband's house) 

347
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,200
Once Zi Teng marries Mountain Chief, you will write some plays

348
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,400
and sing songs to entertain them.

349
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,300
Don't worry. With me by your side, whenever I have a meal, you can have the leftovers!

350
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,000
Miss Zi Teng, you sure have quite the appetite.

351
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,400
Grandpa.

352
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,100
 Even the leftovers will stuff me to death. 

353
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,200
What's so special about Miss Zi Teng?

354
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,700
She is the only granddaughter of our tribe chief.

355
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,800
We heard that the new Mountain Chief loves girls who eat a lot.

356
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,400
What unique taste.

357
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,800
Miss Zi Teng, you will definitely steal his heart!

358
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,400
Zi Teng.

359
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,400
None of the candidates today is as beautiful as you.

360
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,000
Zi Teng.

361
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
The future of our clan falls on your shoulders now.

362
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,600
Don't worry, Grandpa.

363
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,000
God has gifted me with unparalleled beauty.

364
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,800
This is my responsibility!

365
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,200
Grandpa.

366
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,400
 I hope Mountain Chief will fall in love with her straight away ,

367
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,000
 and they will become inseparable, so I can get my hands on the Yanbi Pill successfully. 

368
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,100
   

369
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,500
I can't believe the Flower Spirit Clan are good at singing and dancing.

370
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,300
I'm surprised.

371
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,400
Why don't you head back to Yelan Mountain with me?

372
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,800
You'll sing, and I'll listen.

373
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,000
Zi Lin, don't be rude.

374
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,100
Greetings, Mountain Chiefs.

375
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,700
I know I have violated the rules of Yelan Mountain, but I have my own reasons to perform with this theatre troupe.

376
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,600
I have not harmed any mortals.

377
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,100
May I know why you came here?

378
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,000
No need to be afraid, Miss.

379
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,200
I'm on a personal quest.

380
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,000
Zi Lin, please give us a moment.

381
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,200
I need to talk to her.

382
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,400
So she's the person?

383
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,000
So much for being your good friend.

384
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,200
Fine! I'll keep watch by the door.

385
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,500
Where is the author of this play? 
    

386
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,000
You are too late, Mountain Chief.

387
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,100
She attacked the nobleman, Young Master Wang, last night.

388
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,000
She used her demonic power, and is on the run now.

389
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,400
I questioned the troupe leader.

390
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,200
But he stuttered and refused to give me a clear answer.

391
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
I can guess what might have happened.

392
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,600
I have known this lady for a long time.

393
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,200
I know her mannerisms and behavior very well.

394
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,500
Young Master Wang must have forced himself on you.

395
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,400
And then, she intervened.

396
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,200
It went downhill from there.

397
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,300
I'm sure you directed her to a safe place.

398
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,400
Otherwise, the troupe wouldn't have waited till today to report the case to the local authorities.

399
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,800
What is your relationship with her?

400
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,800
She's the most important person in my life.

401
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,000
I have been looking for her.

402
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:56,000
Since you hold her so dear if I can help you locate her, how will you repay me?

403
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,200
I'm willing to give you everything I have.

404
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,200
But if I find out you lied to me...

405
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,200
She's a lotus demon with no memory. She isn't aware that she's a demon.

406
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,400
She has no background and no one to fall back on.

407
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,600
Her body is overflowing with cold energy, and her body is covered in gray spots.

408
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,100
Her demonic power is weak, and she doesn't know how to become stronger with healing spells.

409
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:26,200
Without anyone looking after her, she will run into danger sooner or later.

410
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,000
I considered her as a good friend and took care of her.

411
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,800
I want you to repay my kindness, not for any materialistic gain,

412
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,100
but because nothing in this world hurts as much as being unable to be with your beloved.

413
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:52,200
I will help you find your lover, but in exchange,

414
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,800
I hope you can save my beloved.

415
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,600
What happened to you?

416
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,400
It's like your power was damaged. You're weak.

417
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,100
It's okay.

418
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,200
I have to go to the Forest of Hidden Flower Mountain.

419
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,600
You don't have follow me.

420
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,800
I'll be back soon.

421
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,600
Why the hurry?

422
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,400
Is it a marriage proposal?

423
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,700
I hope so.

424
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,100
- Are you truly okay? 
 - Yes.

425
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 The Extraordinary Eye contains potent spiritual power. 

426
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,600
 It can save those who are about to die. 

427
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,200
 However, it doesn't belong to this realm. 

428
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,800
 Do not let Pei Luo's greed grow unchecked because of it. 

429
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:11,000
 It will only bring misfortune to you two and the Mortal Realm. 

430
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 You can make him consume it, but don't teach him any spells, in case he exploits it. 

431
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,200
 After twenty years, when his life is about to end, 

432
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,300
 I will retrieve it. 

433
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,800
 You're like me, Mountain Chief. 

434
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:45,100
 When we love someone, we will make sure that he or she is forever safe, no matter the cost or consequence. 

435
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,200
 If he lives to see another happy day, so will I. 

436
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,700
 Even though I'll lose him one day, I'll regret nothing. 

437
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:01,700
 If I can find her in this life, I'll show her all the joy there is in this world. 

438
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,600
 I won't let go of her. 

439
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,600
For half of my life, I've battled with my illness.

440
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Looks like the battle will end today.

441
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,400
 Though I am weak, I still can't escape from the fratricidal strife. 

442
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,600
 In my next life, I'll make sure you suffer twice as much humiliation. 

443
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,400
Jiang Chen.

444
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,100
Pei Luo.

445
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,400
You killed them.

446
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
But it won't change anything.

447
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,600
I won't live for long.

448
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Why did you come here?

449
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You're just going to feel worse.

450
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,800
I already said we should stop seeing each other.

451
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,600
I also said I wouldn't let you die.

452
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,800
I managed to refine this pill myself.

453
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,600
Just one pill is enough to cure all diseases.

454
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,200
Then, you can do whatever you want.

455
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,400
 One day in Flower Realm is several years in Mortal Realm. 

456
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,900
 After the reorganization of the Three Realms, mortals and demons coexisted within the same realm. 

457
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,400
 Tales of demons disturbing the mortals' peace come one after another. 

458
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:01,500
 Thus, the mortals turned to the Taoists, who kill nefarious demons and restore order. 

459
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,300
 Despite their mortal vessels, the Taoists carry out the task of deities. 
    

460
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,400
 They learn Taoist spells in their school, and exercise heroism with their swords. 

461
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,800
 Among all Taoist sects, the northern Lingxiao Sect is considered as the best. 

462
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,700
 However, the Lingxiao Sect prefers to hide in tall mountains and sharp cliffs. 

463
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,500
 They focus on training and rarely meddle in mortal affairs. 

464
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,600
 Being elusive is their nature. 

465
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:31,600
 Many have heard of them, but only a few have ever encountered them. 

466
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,800
   

467
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,000
Tribe Chief! Miss Zi Teng has an upset stomach.

468
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,200
She cannot travel at the moment.

469
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,900
If this continues, we'll miss the auspicious hour!

470
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,200
I won't be able to answer to the Mountain Chiefs!

471
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
Indeed.

472
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,700
Leader, you see,

473
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,300
there are many elixirs in the horse carriage loaded with tributes.

474
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,400
Maybe I can find something to treat Miss Zi Teng.

475
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,000
Sure. Go now!

476
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,200
Yanbi Pill.

477
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,800
Move aside! I'm in a hurry!

478
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,100
My tributes!

479
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,800
Watch where you're going!

480
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,600
How can you not apologize after you crash into others?

481
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,200
I slipped.

482
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,600
- I slipped. 
 - You slipped?

483
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,400
Get Zi Teng some medicine now!

484
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Tell her we'll be leaving in an hour.

485
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,800
- Right. 
 - Go now.

486
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,600
Oh, my tributes!

487
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,800
Mountain Chief.

488
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,800
After the change of Yelan Mountain's ownership, many flower demons went to the Hidden Flower Mountain forest to seek refuge.

489
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,400
All the lotus demons are here.

490
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,700
However, I can't find the one with gray spots that you want.

491
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,600
Do you fancy any other flower demons?

492
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,400
Like... this Rafflesia?

493
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,400
 So Yan Dan didn't turn to the Flower Spirit Clan? 

494
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,200
 Or was Jiang Chen lying? 

495
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,700
 If she isn't here, where can I find her, in this vast world? 

496
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:10,050

 ''Agarwood'' - Zhang Jie | Jane Zhang 

498
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:40,600
♫   My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves   ♫

499
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:47,600
♫   For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you   ♫

500
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:54,700
♫   If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go?   ♫

501
00:41:54,700 --> 00:42:01,800
♫   Turn around and become the delusion of my life  ♫

502
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:08,900
♫   The most beautiful destiny is hidden in the dark night, "love" is the word for everything   ♫

503
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:15,800
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

504
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:23,000
♫   I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust   ♫

505
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,200
♫   Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most  ♫

506
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:37,000
♫   You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers   ♫

507
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,400
♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

508
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:51,200
♫   You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine &lt; ♫

509
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:59,000
♫   In my dream, the one I loved is with me   ♫

510
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:19,400
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

511
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:25,600
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

512
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:33,500
♫   As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable  ♫

513
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:40,600
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

514
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:49,000
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫
