 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,600
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,920
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,070
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,120
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,040
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:01:02,420
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,920
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,220
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,400
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,680
   

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,350
   

16
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,000
 What's your name? 

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,260
 Why are you here alone? 

18
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,500
 Cover the hot furnace when it's cold at dusk. 

19
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,480
 Shape the eyebrows on a warm spring day. 

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,440
 My name is Mu Han. 

21
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,660
 Don't you remember me? 

22
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,560
 Ran Qing. 

23
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,860
 It turns out Mu Han and Xuan Ye are the same person. 

24
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,080
 You approached me just to steal Seven Star Deity Jade. 

25
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,120
 Why? 

26
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,320
 Ran Qing! 

27
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,500
 All immortals and gods have been wiped out, and the Six Realms are under my reign now. 

28
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,960
 Love and the world... I want them both. 

29
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,950
 Ran Qing. You can't kill me. 

30
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,000
 Quit being stubborn and be my queen. 

31
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,140
 When I hold your hand, I realize that I wish to be with you forever. 

32
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,860
 I won't make any mistakes again. 

33
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,980
 Let's indulge ourselves in the galaxy of stars, 

34
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,620
 and in the wheel of time, in days and nights for eternity. 

35
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,880
 Even though I've turned back the time over and over again, 

36
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,860
 I still couldn't be with you without destroying the world. 

37
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,160
 This time... I'll definitely live my life to the fullest with you. 

38
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,400
 The cloud is beautiful. 

39
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,440
 Xuan Ye said that I'm always busy, and I've missed the beautiful scenery. 

40
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,360
 I'll scoop this piece of cloud and take it back to admire it with him. 

41
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,360
 Your Majesty, we've received the report of victory from the southern battlefield. 

42
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,380
 Keep the army on their toes and go after the enemy troops. 

43
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,700
 We must conquer the Six Realms before Primordial Lord exits from the Unparalleled Mirror! 

44
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:03,380
 Conquer the Six Realms! 

45
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,980
 I made a great mistake by believing Xuan Ye would keep his word to go into seclusion with me. 

46
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,620
 I was trapped in the illusion of the Unparalleled Mirror for months. 

47
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,360
 The war is in full swing now. 

48
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,360
 I will leave this baby to you. 

49
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,800
 Evil grows from affection. 

50
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,860
 I was supposed to repay it with my life. 

51
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,040
 However, I was pregnant. 

52
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,480
 The baby is innocent. 

53
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,080
 Please grant him a new identity and never let others know who his parents are. 

54
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 I cast a spell on him. 

55
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,240
 As long as the Asura's mark doesn't show, 

56
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,440
 the Asura Clan won't discover his existence nor will they see his true countenance. 

57
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,680
 He's fully mastered both Universe Enchantment and Eternal Darkness. 

58
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,600
 Besides, with the Seven Star Deity Jade and Unparalleled Mirror, Xuan Ye's divine power is unrivaled. 

59
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,540
 Can you handle this alone? 

60
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,160
 No worries. I'm not who I used to be. 

61
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,380
 If I die, I'm counting on you to look after both Deity Clan and Divine Clan. 

62
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,820
 Remember. From today onwards, the prime abstinence of the Heavenly Rules is to be 

63
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,640
 the love abstinence of all gods and deities in Nine Heavens. 

64
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,120
 Whoever violates it will be sentenced to the punishment of love till they admit their fault. 

65
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,800
 Don't worry. 

66
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,780
 As for this baby and the Heavenly Rules, I'll protect and implement them for your sake. 

67
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,120
 I just created the Ranyue Move recently. 

68
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,580
 How are you able to resolve every move I launched? 

69
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,280
 It's like you've seen them before. 

70
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,240
 Xuan Ye, did you use Moment-Turning Gear on me? 

71
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,340
 Since you've guessed it right, I'm not going to conceal anymore. 

72
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,220
 Ran Qing. 

73
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,690
 If only one of us survives, the ending will always be the same. 

74
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,320
 Stop being stubborn. 

75
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,260
 Give in to me. 

76
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,560
 Come here. 

77
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,790
 You're even willing to turn back the time at the cost of your life in order to kill me every time. 

78
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,780
 I was trying to save you every time. 

79
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,040
 However, you always choose to sacrifice yourself for the world. 

80
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:51,220
 This time, I'll trap you in the Unparalleled Mirror and never let you die in front of me. 

81
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,360
 I'm Primordial Lord. 

82
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,020
 My mission is to protect all beings in the world. 

83
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,440
 No matter how hard you try to halt me, you can't change the ending. 

84
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,100
 Xuan Ye. You said you love me. 

85
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,220
 But why can't you give up on your ambition? 

86
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,360
 Quit saying all this! 

87
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:18,800
 Every time I turned back the time, I was forced to admit to my karma. 

88
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,360
 You refuse to let go of your mission, and I won't let go of my ambition. 

89
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,720
 Ran Qing. As long as you say yes... 

90
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,200
 we can share the world together. 

91
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,420
 If you give in to me just once, the ending can be rewritten. 

92
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,120
 Everything in the world can indeed be changed, but not the will of someone. 

93
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,900
 Both of us value the world more than our affection. 

94
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,260
 Admit it, Xuan Ye. 

95
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,360
 We're born to be enemies, and we never compromise till we die! 

96
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,040
 Ran Qing. 

97
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,700
 Again, I lost. 

98
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,380
 However, it's fine. 

99
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,680
 I can take you back to the beginning even at the cost of my life. 

100
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,940
 There will be one chance to trick you, 

101
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,420
 then  I can spend my whole life with you, and we'll rule the world together. 

102
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,180
 You've become stronger. 

103
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,720
 How come you can resist Eternal Darkness? 

104
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,400
 Because... 

105
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,420
 I carried the lineage of the Asura Clan. 

106
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,220
 Ying Yuan. 

107
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,720
 Remember this name. 

108
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,540
 This is the name of your son. 

109
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,880
 Ran Qing, why are you still so stubborn? 

110
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,180
After your mother died,

111
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,460
I cast a spell on Soul Ripping Sword to prevent him from revealing your parents' identity.

112
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,560
Then I sealed it in the Land Under the Horizon.

113
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,220
Let bygones be bygones. Don't dwell on the past.

114
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,640
Unexpectedly, those words have come true and became their karma in the end.

115
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,820
It's the karma for Xuan Ye only.

116
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,480
He's the only one who refused to admit his mistakes.

117
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,700
I didn't expect the heavenly rule forbidding deities from falling in love was actually set by my mother.

118
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,140
Your Supreme Majesty has been guiding me...

119
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,940
to abide by this rule strictly.

120
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,900
Thank you for telling me how I was born.

121
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,300
I will protect the Three Realms...

122
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,520
that my mother once protected.

123
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,060
I'll bring you back to life and debunk the conspiracy of Huan Qin.

124
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,080
No, you can't.

125
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,440
Huan Qin couldn't destroy my body because I've left a wisp of my primordial spirit inside you.

126
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,040
Therefore, Huan Qin can't really take away my life.

127
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,880
And he could only pretend to be me by using Puppet Spell.

128
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,780
Ying Yuan.

129
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,960
You inherited the Asura's blood from Xuan Ye.

130
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,580
If you fail to control yourself, the consequence will be devastating.

131
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,100
Only my primordial spirit can oppress it.

132
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,900
What Huan Qin has achieved today does not depend on him alone.

133
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,820
Don't ignore the power behind him.

134
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:06,580
The one who can restore peace to the Three Realms is none other than you.

135
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,106
Ying Yuan. I'm not afraid of death.

136
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:14,440
However, the War of Genesis was like hell on the world, which can never occur again.

137
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,080
How could I place my life above yours, Your Supreme Majesty?

138
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,260
As long as Emperor Ying Yuan is alive, the Three Realms won't collapse.

139
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,120
Ying Yuan, don't forget your mother's last will.

140
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,560
For the sake of me and your mother, protect everyone in the Three Realms.

141
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,820
I will remember this.

142
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,180
To Ying Yuan, His Supreme Majesty is like his father.

143
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,660
Now, he has learned that his dearest kin was murdered by his long-time friend.

144
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,020
He must be heartbroken.

145
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:20,120
Even the Greater God or Emperor... cannot escape from the caprice of fate.

146
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,770
Who are you?

147
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,700
I'm Ling Jiang, the Senior Priest of the Asura Clan.

148
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,720
Greetings, Young Lord.

149
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,640
Please pardon my late arrival.

150
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,160
I was deceived by Huan Qin for years about your true identity, Young Lord.

151
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,160
That hateful Huan Qin is a member of the Asura Clan.

152
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,620
Yet he plotted to frame the son of His Majesty.

153
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,960
What?

154
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,600
Huan Qin belongs to the Asura Clan?

155
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,260
However, I read that those of Asura Clan only have a spiritual pill but no divine root.

156
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,340
How did Huan Qin manage to obtain divine power and ascend to divinity?

157
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,420
Before the War of Genesis, we had known each other for hundreds of years.

158
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,400
I'd never found anything suspicious about him.

159
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,500
To His Majesty, Huan Qin was his most successful and...

160
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,900
most secretive pawn.

161
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,060
 Greetings, Your Majesty. 

162
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,480
 In order to plant the divine root in you, your spiritual pill must be crushed 

163
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,060
 and your blood drained off to be replaced with the blood of the God Clan. 

164
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,040
 You'll die if the process fails. 

165
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:00,080
 Even if you manage to cultivate your divine spirit, you'll still be useless. 

166
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,700
 I request to go to Nine Heavens because I'm ready to risk my life at any time. 

167
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,520
 For the plan of our clan, I'm willing to sacrifice my life. 

168
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,340
 Very good. 

169
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,220
I didn't expect Huan Qin to have such strong forbearance.

170
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,540
No wonder he could lie low in the Heavenly Realms for ten thousand years.

171
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,380
We've worked together side by side for years, and he never betrayed me.

172
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,140
I can't believe he was able to deceive all of us.

173
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:23,540
So after the Asura King perished, you've been governing the Asura Clan?

174
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,000
Yes.

175
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,580
Back then, our clan was defeated. But I was reluctant to accept the failure.

176
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,180
After calming all the members of the clan down, I went to see Huan Qin, hoping to restore our clan.

177
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,420
At that time, Huan Qin hadn't been promoted to Star Deity.

178
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,420
He kept rejecting my offer, claiming that he wasn't competent enough.

179
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,920
He then imprisoned me at a place and said he needs some time to consider my offer.

180
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,540
After a few days, he returned with the Refined Steel.

181
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,380
He said this object had helped him make up his mind.

182
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,600
"Refined Steel"?

183
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,500
It turns out he was brooding over that.

184
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,780
 The swamp of Luye penetrates your armor and devours your bone. 

185
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,920
 Huan Qin, regardless of your regal aura, we, the Asura Clan are still the winner. 

186
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,480
 I'll bring you back. 

187
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,060
 After you fainted, Ying Yuan risked himself and went to the Blood Hole Altar 

188
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,660
 of the Asura Clan to retrieve their treasure, Bone-Growth Stone. 

189
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,400
 This Bone-Growth Stone uses massive cultivation to heal one's body and limbs. 

190
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,620
 What a shame. 

191
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,000
 Due to my incompetency, I can't be of help. 

192
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,260
 It was Ying Yuan who used almost half of his cultivation base to mend your hand. 

193
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,460
 Ying Yuan. Thank you. 

194
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,460
 I thought I would be disabled for the rest of my life. 

195
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,700
 We've been fighting alongside each other for years, and you're my only friend. 

196
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,560
 Apart from that, you broke your hand while fighting the enemy. 

197
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,940
 Even if weren't friends, I'd still help you. 

198
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,720
 Anyhow, your broken limb may gain you some merits. 

199
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,280
 So far in our war with the Asura Clan, you're the first one to slay the elder of the Asura Clan. 

200
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,500
 It's said that His Supreme Majesty is going to grant the title of the fourth emperor. 

201
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,920
 And he'll take the four emperors to bring down the capital of Asura for the final battle. 

202
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,091
 I bet you'll be given this title. 

203
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:39,700
 Your name will go down in history. 

204
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,380
 Huan Qin, please accept the edict. 

205
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,220
 By the mandate of heaven, this decree is announced to the masses that Huan Qin, the immortal lord 

206
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,420
 who has led the heavenly army for thousands of years and possesses invincible courage, 

207
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,300
 has made a significant achievement in the war. 

208
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,060
 I'm beaming hearing this news, and so do the Six Realms. 

209
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,800
 From today onwards, you'll ascend as Star Deity Ji Du 

210
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,340
 and govern Star Setter Pavilion and all cosmic stars. 

211
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,580
 Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty. 

212
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,400
 I'll devote myself to my duty and never fail your expectation. 

213
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,720
 His Supreme Majesty is concerned about you and specially granted you a treasure. 

214
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,640
 Refined Steel. It can change from being very hard to very soft. 

215
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,120
 It can be smelted into divine tools that can change form. 

216
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,520
 His Supreme Majesty offered it to you because he cherishes you so much. 

217
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,240
 I'm delighted to be favored by His Supreme Majesty. 

218
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,100
 Why are you drinking alone? 

219
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,740
 You've wasted your divine power to fix my hand. 

220
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,680
 I reckon His Supreme Majesty won't assign me to lead the army in the future. 

221
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,720
 I heard that you were crowned as Emperor. Congratulations. 

222
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,220
 Your Majesty, may I have the pleasure to drink with you? 

223
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,460
 How come your body possesses the aura of the Asura? 

224
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,200
 Were you bitten by Asura Ghost-Faced Spider while in Blood Hole Altar? 

225
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,380
 It's impossible. 

226
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,680
 It's impossible. 

227
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,020
 If it were ordinary people, they would've died. 

228
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,020
 How come your blood can suppress the poison? 

229
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,300
 Are you a descendant of the Asura Clan? 

230
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,900
 Huan Qin. 

231
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,260
 Honestly, my mother... 

232
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,460
 was an innocent fairy who was bewitched by the Asura Clan. 

233
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,460
 You exposed your identity in order to save my life. 

234
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,700
 No worries. I won't tell anybody else about this. 

235
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,960
 However, during your inauguration ceremony, 

236
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,440
 you'll have to take an oath in front of everybody's eyes, 

237
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,700
 and your bloodline will be exposed then. 

238
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,900
 His Supreme Majesty is stern, so he'll definitely kill you. 

239
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,500
 Ying Yuan. You better leave now. 

240
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,980
 I'll escort you to leave the Heavenly Realm. 

241
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,500
 Huan Qin. 

242
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,500
 His Supreme Majesty is aware of my identity. 

243
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,780
 He already knows you belong to the Asura Clan? 

244
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,620
 But how could he tolerate your existence and crown you as Emperor? 

245
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,100
 His Supreme Majesty said... 

246
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,140
 since I possess this blood lineage, 

247
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,400
 I should devote myself... 

248
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,440
 to the Heaven Realm. 

249
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,900
After Xuan Ye died, he cut off connection with the Asura Clan.

250
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,300
Huan Qin had lost his master, and he became a useless pawn.

251
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,260
Perhaps he had thought about turning into a deity, and went on war expeditions for the Heaven Realm.

252
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,840
However, he was not His Supreme Majesty's favorite.

253
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,740
He had the ambition to be Emperor.

254
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,940
How could he endure the trivial duty of governing the stars?

255
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,000
Back then, he still treated me kindly even though he learned about my background.

256
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,780
I was indebted to him and regarded him as my confidant.

257
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,740
Looking back, he was born into the Asura Clan as well.

258
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,520
Perhaps he had complex feelings by then.

259
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,340
And all the feelings...

260
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,400
turned into hatred.

261
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,840
Young Lord. Huan Qin is nothing to be afraid of.

262
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,600
Since I've found you, it means

263
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,300
the Asura Clan that has been sleeping for ten thousand years will awake anytime now.

264
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,120
What's your plan?

265
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,340
As long as you neutralize Heavenly Emperor's primordial spirit that has been suppressing your blood

266
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,560
and release the Asura divine power inside you,

267
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,980
those who died in the War of Genesis will be resurrected.

268
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,220
You know of everything?

269
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,240
Yes. In the Divine-Devil War, Huan Qin crushed the divine power of the Heavenly Emperor,

270
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,000
but he still failed to kill him.

271
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,900
When I learned that you're the son of His Majesty,

272
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,040
I finally realized that you've done nothing all these years

273
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,220
because you were suppressed by the Heavenly Emperor.

274
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,520
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

275
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,140
Unexpectedly, His Majesty has left his lineage in this world.

276
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,700
Everything is destined.

277
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,720
Young Lord. Don't worry.

278
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,280
The entire Asura Clan will offer ourselves to you like we offered ourselves to His Majesty.

279
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,420
Very soon, your cultivation will improve by leaps and bounds, and you can restore honor to the Asura Clan.

280
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,260
Young Lord. What are you doing?

281
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,220
Listen up. I'll never be your Young Lord.

282
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,300
I'm Emperor Qingli, Ying Yuan.

283
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,360
The Puppet Spell is the secret skill of Devil Clan.

284
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,760
And it's rarely known to outsiders.

285
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,800
If we're going to uncover the fake Heavenly Emperor, we must find Liu Weiyang first.

286
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,100
Tao Ziqi said they were incarcerated in different places.

287
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,760
However, we have no clues at all.

288
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,500
She's willing to give up on her deity status to be with the Devil King.

289
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:51,140
However, she cherishes Purple Anser Hairpin given by the Heavenly Court, and she gazes at it every day.

290
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,920
You can see the obsession in her eyes.

291
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,260
However, I find something weird about her.

292
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,453
It's time to reveal her true identity.

293
00:30:01,453 --> 00:30:03,400
I have an idea.

294
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,660
Your Majesty.

295
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,040
What has happened? I heard that Brother Yu Mo and the rest are back.

296
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,480
Did something happen to them?

297
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,380
Your Majesty, you can't simply protect Yu Mo and neglect your people in South Sea.

298
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:26,340
You've used the barrier to shut all the passages, and we can't communicate with the outside world.

299
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,280
However, the kins of the Aquatic Clan are serving at the Heavenly Court.

300
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,140
If they don't receive letters from their family,

301
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,240
the Heavenly Court will discover that something has happened to the South Sea.

302
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,520
You're right.

303
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,520
But Yu Mo has no way out now.

304
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,800
I can't send them away.

305
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,780
How about this? Discreetly inform the Aquatic Clan who have kin

306
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:55,580
in the Heavenly Court to put their family letters on the Heavenly River at seven in the morning every day.

307
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,580
By then, I'll open up the barrier at the Heavenly River

308
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,200
and have the letters drift towards the Heavenly Court.

309
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,020
It'll cease the suspicion from the Heavenly Court.

310
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,540
Remember. You must do it in secret.

311
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,580
Find someone you really trust.

312
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,600
Understood.

313
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,060
Off you go.

314
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,400
Brother Yu Mo asked me to test you.

315
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,100
I didn't expect you to be this impatient.

316
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,280
You're indeed colluding with the Heavenly Emperor.

317
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,440
What are you up to?

318
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,020
Your letter can never arrive.

319
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,420
I'm anxious because I want to save Xuan Xiang.

320
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,580
So I sent a message to my sisters in the Heavenly Court asking for help.

321
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,960
Do you think we'll believe your words?

322
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,920
I don't care if you have excuses or reasons, or if you remain silent due to someone's threat.

323
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,880
If you really love Liu Weiyang and are worried about whether he's alive or dead,

324
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,020
why do you push us to the corner when we're the only ones who can rescue him?

325
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,920
I didn't mean to harm you.

326
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,080
Ever since we entered the South Sea, you've been casting me out in every discussion.

327
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,680
I understand, and I'm in no position to make requests.

328
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,440
However, my worries about Xuan Xiang are no less than yours.

329
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,340
No matter how you try to explain yourself, I won't believe you again.

330
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,880
I'm sorry, Sister Tao.

331
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,560
Now, we must lock you up.

332
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,300
Dragon Queen Zhao Lan.

333
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,600
We, the heavenly army, have surrounded the entire South Sea.

334
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,080
To avoid all Aquatic Clan in Four Seas being killed, surrender the traitors of the Heavenly Court!

335
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,320
Your Majesty. The heavenly army is here.

336
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,280
They sieged the entire Dragon Palace claiming to search for the traitors of the Heavenly Court.

337
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,040
How impressive. How did you manage this even though the letter was destroyed?

338
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,340
It wasn't me.

339
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,820
Stop pretending.

340
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,700
That letter isn't how you communicate with the outside world, right?

341
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,380
Our negligence gave you the opportunity to act.

342
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,680
It's not because we're deceived by your perfect disguise.

343
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,760
It's because you're not afraid of us suspecting you. You know we'll never harm you since we were once friends.

344
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,940
She won't admit her act easily.

345
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,960
We must leave here immediately.

346
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,840
I guess the heavenly army suddenly surrounded this place because they received news of our whereabouts.

347
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,440
They won't give up until they find us.

348
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,820
We must not drag the South Sea into trouble.

349
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,580
Zhao Lan. You're the Dragon Queen.

350
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,160
If they found us here, the Four Seas must be your priority of concern.

351
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,820
Got it?

352
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,300
Yes.

353
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,040
Brother Yu Mo. In the South Sea, there's a secret passage that connects to the outside world.

354
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,920
However...

355
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,880
Take her along.

356
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,400
Whether she works for the fake Heavenly Emperor or not, we'll lose our only clue if we leave her here.

357
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,660
You leave first!

358
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,730
Let's go.

359
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,340
Hold on.

360
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,400
What's wrong?

361
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,580
This path twists and turns.

362
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,600
Tao Ziqi. Tell me why the army can trace us.

363
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,340
If it weren't for Zhao Lan, who told us the right path, we'd be lost.

364
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,040
This doesn't make any sense.

365
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,180
Sister Tao. Why did you take the arrow for me?

366
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,920
My instinctive response.

367
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,580
Thank you.

368
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,160
But there is something suspicious about your injury.

369
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,760
I see. The arrow contains Tracking Incense that exposes our location.

370
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,320
Tao Ziqi. You've been in the Divine-Devil War.

371
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,640
You should know this, right?

372
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,520
Are you suspecting that I brought the army here?

373
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,900
If Yan Dan was shot with the arrow, she would be infected by the poison instead.

374
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,280
Why did I have to save her?

375
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,960
If you don't trust me, you can surrender me to the heavenly army.

376
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,500
I'd rather prove my innocence with my death.

377
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,420
You wish!

378
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,540
We won't grant your wish by letting you go.

379
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,580
You're the thread manipulated by the heavenly army.

380
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,840
Only if we kill you and cut the thread can we leave this place.

381
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,240
Stop.

382
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,220
She's the thread that connects to Liu Weiyang as well.

383
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,960
If we kill her, we can't explain to Liu Weiyang.

384
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,620
Besides, there are many mysteries left in the Divine-Devil War which need to be investigated.

385
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,200
She has experienced the war. She can't die.

386
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,460
As for now, we must find our way out as soon as possible.

387
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,740
It's Qingyi Cauldron!

388
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,000
It has been refining pills for ten thousand years, and it's immune to fire and water

389
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,460
and defends attacks from the deities.

390
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,060
It's not easy to deal with!

391
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,440
This fake Heavenly Emperor thinks highly of us.

392
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,160
He even created a divine tool to deal with us.

393
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:14,260
 If this continues, the boat will be damaged and torn to pieces. 

394
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,400
 Yan Dan! 

395
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,360
It's my turn to protect you this time. Go!

396
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,780
Come back! Yan Dan!

397
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,860
We must go back!

398
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,160
We have no time now.

399
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,160
After capturing Yan Dan, they'll report it right away.

400
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,080
I knew something was wrong with you.

401
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,720
I should've killed you.

402
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,780
If it weren't for you attracting the army, Yan Dan wouldn't have been captured.

403
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,780
If I could replace her with my life,

404
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,200
I'd jump off the boat without hesitation.

405
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:21,500
Yu Mo! It's useless even if you kill her.

406
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,640
You must calm down at this critical moment.

407
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,680
If you act rashly...

408
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,940
Yan Dan's safety will be compromised.

409
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,820
You're awake.

410
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,520
I hear that you outsmart the Three Realms with your GO skill, Miss Yan Dan.

411
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,280
Finally, I have a chance to compete with you today.

412
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,380
This is the last game in Ying Yuan's book of war.

413
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:08,420
You're using me as a pawn to break this game against Ying Yuan's strategy, right?

414
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:13,980
Judging by that tone, it seems you've taken me as your enemy.

415
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,220
People with different political dispositions become enemies.

416
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,800
You betrayed your master for your interest twice.

417
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,220
Plus, you slaughtered innocent beings.

418
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:28,000
You're the traitor to the Three Realms, Huan Qin of the Asura Clan.

419
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,720
True.

420
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,760
I, Huan Qin, am the traitor to the Three Realms.

421
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,600
What about Ying Yuan?

422
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,180
He's the hero of the Three Realms.

423
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,560
However, he turned his back on you twice.

424
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,400
He abandoned you when you were at the brink of death.

425
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,100
Who's better amongst us, the traitor or the hero?

426
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,120
I'm clear about what has happened between us.

427
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,020
He has never abandoned me.

428
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,940
I came here today by my own choice.

429
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,960
But look at you.

430
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,100
Who else did you benefit from besides yourself?

431
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,880
What methods did you use to threaten Tao Ziqiinto

432
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,460
into sacrificing her life to help you?

433
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,720
I've never threatened Tao Ziqi.

434
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,920
Enough.

435
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,560
Quit arguing.

436
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,780
Take a guess.

437
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,740
Who's the winner in this game?

438
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,360
How about this?

439
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,580
I'll have the Three Realms as the GO board, and your life as the pawn.

440
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,820
Ying Yuan will probably admit defeat willingly this time.

441
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,640
Interesting.

442
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,760
You want me to help you...

443
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,240
In your dreams!

444
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,500
How dare you frail lotus demon try to kill me?

445
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,400
You're asking for your death.

446
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,720
Although I'm an insignificant lotus demon, I still look down on you!

447
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,820
You killed my kin.

448
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,340
I'll never let you off the hook easily!

449
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,180
Were your kin killed by me?

450
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:08,520
The elimination of the Nine Fins Clan was conducted under the edict of the Heavenly Emperor.

451
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,980
Immortal Lord Bei Ming was sent to the battlefield by him as well.

452
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,860
As for Zhi Xi, if she hadn't helped Ying Yuan, why would I kill her?

453
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,660
You're just quibbling for your own benefit.

454
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,740
My benefit is to create well-being for the Three Realms.

455
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,580
See, you've admitted it.

456
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:44,620
Everything you did isn't for the sake of the Asura Clan nor the benevolence to the world.

457
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,080
Instead, it's merely for your ambition and status.

458
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,820
How about the benevolence Ying Yuan used to mention?

459
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,380
Isn't it also for his benefit?

460
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,320
True. I'm from the Asura Clan.

461
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,620
But don't forget that Ying Yuan is the Young Lord of the Asura Clan.

462
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,780
He's not like you!

463
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,200
Although he possesses the blood of Xuan Ye, he has never done anything evil.

464
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,000
How naïve of you.

465
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,300
Yan Dan. You're merely a lotus demon.

466
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,540
Why are you concerned about the well-being of the world?

467
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,760
Now, I determine how the world should run.

468
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,520
The benevolence of the world you said is merely nonsense.

469
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,880
Come on.

470
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,160
If you refuse to play or you deliberately play it wrongly, the thunder will strike you.

471
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,860
With three consecutive wrong moves, the GO board will be reset.

472
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:47,020
If the game remains unresolved, the thunder strikes won't stop.

473
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,840
Considering your cultivation, you can't take many strikes.

474
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,760
Listen, Huan Qin.

475
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,950
Every evil you've done so far will repay you handsomely sooner or later.

476
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,200
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

477
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,580
Now, I've prepared some tea in my palace,

478
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,500
waiting for Ying Yuan to watch how his lover is being tortured.

479
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,160
Back then, because of Ran Qing, his father caused the entire Asura Clan to perish.

480
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,560
Today, I'll use your life to end his future.

481
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,940
How satisfying.

482
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,940
How satisfying!

483
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:05,030

 ''Never Forget'' - Zhang Lei 

485
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:21,600
♫   The moment of our first meeting in Heaven and on Earth   ♫

486
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:27,480
♫   Even the star frost can't stop the fleeting time   ♫

487
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:35,750
♫   I once borrowed your eyes to warm the coldest moment   ♫

488
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:42,780
♫   I've traveled across the Night Forgetting River, but it's hard to forget this fate   ♫

489
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:49,850
♫   I followed you across the endless seas reluctant to leave you   ♫

490
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:55,700
♫   It seems too hard to profess my love, the words are caught in my throat   ♫

491
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:03,950
♫   I've wasted a millennium thinking about how to let go of my endless longing for you   ♫

492
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:10,650
♫   Love can only be redeemed if the deadline is forgotten   ♫

493
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:20,480
♫   Deep love is engraved in my heart with just one look, I'm willing to take the leap for you   ♫

494
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:27,480
♫   As epiphyllum withers, I'm willing to sink in deep and never let you down in this life   ♫

495
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:35,503
♫   I'm keeping the last glimpse of you, so I won't fear missing you after reincarnation   ♫

496
00:46:35,503 --> 00:46:43,000
♫   Your heart is still beating in my chest   ♫

497
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:59,380
♫   Deep love is engraved in my heart with just one look, I'm willing to take the leap for you   ♫

498
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:06,180
♫   As epiphyllum withers, I'm willing to sink in deep and never let you down in this life   ♫

499
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:14,500
♫   I'm keeping the last glimpse of you, so I won't fear missing you after reincarnation   ♫

500
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:20,950
♫   Your heart is still beating in my chest   ♫

501
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:31,450
♫   The flowers bloom and fall, even though I say nothing and you hear nothing   ♫
