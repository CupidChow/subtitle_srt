 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,540
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai advises people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,859
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,070
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,480
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,179
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:52,040
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,999
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:11,269
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:15,340
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,700
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,879
   

15
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,050
   

16
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:35,900
   

17
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,100
We agreed to frame Yan Dan for a small mistake and chase her out of Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

18
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,199
Why did you break your promise?

19
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:51,379
Are you out of your mind? This is Yuqing Palace!

20
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,099
You were the one who gave her the lotus root that harmed her.

21
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:58,780
Why are you pretending to be innocent?

22
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,280
Now you're telling me to act in good faith?

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,899
I was just worried that Yan Dan would make a big mistake in the future.

24
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,780
I wanted to lightly punish her so she would realize that.

25
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,440
I didn't intend to kill her.

26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,239
She just received the thunder strikes after losing half her heart.

27
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:13,919
If she is found guilty and sent to the Heavenly Gallows again,

28
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,679
even if she survives, she'll revert to her original form!

29
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,960
My intention was for her to disappear from this world.

30
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,340
Zhi Xi, no matter if the punishment is serious or not, you've already gotten your hands dirty.

31
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,140
Your sisterhood ties with her have been severed long ago.

32
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,620
This case has alerted His Supreme Majesty.

33
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,140
You had better keep quiet if you don't wish

34
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,500
to ruin both your career and life.

35
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,980
 Why? Why did everything end up like this? 

36
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,600
 What exactly went wrong? 

37
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,219
His Majesty has ordered us to move all these things away in two hours.

38
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:30,040
No delays are allowed.

39
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,950
   

40
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,380
What are you doing?

41
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,519
How dare you taint His Majesty's item with your terrible embroidery?

42
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,160
It's no wonder His Majesty couldn't wait any longer.

43
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,199
He has ordered his men to move all your wretched belongings out of the palace.

44
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,560
 Emperor Ying Yuan, do you hate me that much? 

45
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,460
You should enjoy the view while you can.

46
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:20,120
Now that you've stepped out the palace door, you won't be able to return again.

47
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,339
Looking at you now, I'm reminded of my past self.

48
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:30,340
However, I left the palace gloriously for a promotion,

49
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,200
while you're leaving in shame.

50
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,700
No matter if it's me, who was assigned to His Majesty by His Supreme Majesty,

51
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,840
or Zhi Xi, who sacrificed half her heart to save his life...

52
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,240
No fairy can stay in Yanxu Heavenly Palace forever.

53
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,199
His Majesty's heart only has space for the beings of the Three Realms.

54
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,500
His heart has no space for a single woman.

55
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,040
Is that so?

56
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,800
If that's true, why did you rack your brain just to transfer me from the palace?

57
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,780
I wasn't the one who chased you out and sent you to prison.

58
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,680
It was him!

59
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,879
So what if he played GO with you and taught you divine arts?

60
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,959
To him, you're nothing but an inferior attendant who's there to entertain him.

61
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,820
However, you're different from the others indeed.

62
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,060
Unlike all the fairies who left the palace, you're leaving in shame.

63
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,300
Do you know what His Majesty said about you?

64
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,880
He said you were a disgrace to Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

65
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,759
He has ordered his men to burn your belongings in the Soul Incinerator.

66
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,260
You should have seen this coming, from the day you harbored thoughts...

67
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,360
you shouldn't have had.

68
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,620
Take her away!

69
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,360
 Yes. 

70
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,720
   

71
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,680
You must have suffered.

72
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,240
Why?

73
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,560
Why did you do this to me?

74
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,300
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,680
I just wanted to frame you for a small mistake, so that you could leave Yanxu Heavenly Palace and His Majesty's side.

76
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,900
I don't want you to be trapped by love.

77
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,700
I didn't expect Ying Deng to use me as her pawn and land you in this state.

78
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:19,120
I know nothing I say matters now.

79
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,500
However, I truly did it for your sake initially—

80
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
For my sake?

81
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,499
If so, why didn't you speak up for me when Ying Deng framed me for the poison?

82
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,620
Do you know how you looked back then?

83
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,220
I felt like you were no longer the sister I knew.

84
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,740
I was a coward.

85
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:48,280
I didn't dare to admit my mistake in front of His Supreme Majesty and His Majesty.

86
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,520
Ever since I was little...

87
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,660
I always thought you were the dearest person to me.

88
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,320
I thought you would always protect and support me.

89
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,800
Even if everyone else betrayed me, I've always thought you wouldn't.

90
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,620
I even swore a secret vow that I would share joy and sorrow with you.

91
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,760
But now...

92
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,360
After all that has happened...

93
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,679
Now that I'm looking at the current you, I still don't understand what happened.

94
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,400
Can you please tell me why you did that?

95
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:40,130
Since we were little, you always thought I was strong and didn't fear anything, right?

96
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,570
It was because you didn't understand me at all.

97
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,659
You don't know how much I've suffered all these years!

98
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,420
You suffered?

99
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,119
Ever since we acquired our human forms, and after His Majesty said...

100
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,860
that I was the weaker twin,

101
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,680
I started training harder than anyone I knew

102
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,680
so that people would not take me lightly!

103
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,440
You understood the essence of the Xiaohan Scriptures just by copying it.

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,240
Something that's easy for you to attain was actually my lifelong wish.

105
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,660
I've never wanted you to be sent to the Mortal Realm for me.

106
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,940
However, you requested it in public.

107
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,640
People mocked my ineptitude.

108
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,000
I finally became Deputy Curator, yet you went and stole my job.

109
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,960
You eliminated devils and protected His Majesty.

110
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,140
Everyone took me lightly.

111
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,360
Even your fellow attendants mocked me behind my back!

112
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,540
I didn't expect you...

113
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,640
to be troubled over people saying that you were the weaker twin.

114
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,460
I actually didn't notice at all.

115
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,980
I know you didn't want to go to the mortal world.

116
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,640
You wanted to be promoted.

117
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,219
That's why I wanted to use my own ways to help you out as much as I could.

118
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,220
However, I've never thought about how you felt.

119
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,500
I've never asked you about it, causing you to hold a huge grudge against me.

120
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,240
I thought...

121
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,040
we could walk together, hand in hand, forever.

122
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,060
I thought... we would always be best sisters.

123
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,460
But I didn't expect that...

124
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,640
I didn't expect us to end up like this.

125
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,320
I'm sorry.

126
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,020
I'm a terrible sister.

127
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,680
I'm sorry.

128
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,080
Yan Dan.

129
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,580
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,440
I know. This is my fault.

131
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,540
I'm sure you've held this grudge for a century.

132
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,380
You may never let go of it...

133
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,380
as long as I'm around.

134
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,060
Maybe now, the best outcome for us...

135
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,460
is to never see each other again.

136
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,600
Zhi Xi.

137
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,800
Live well for yourself.

138
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,000
Leave now.

139
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,200
Yan Dan!

140
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,700
Leave!

141
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,300
Just go!

142
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:07,000
Your Majesty, although Yan Dan is mischievous, she has a kind nature.

143
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't believe that she's the culprit.

144
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,800
Should we really do nothing about it as she receives the punishment of fire?

145
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,900
Yan Dan isn't willing to speak the truth to protect the person she wants to protect.

146
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,800
However, I will not let her suffer for a crime she didn't commit.

147
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,200
I will find other evidence and prove her innocence.

148
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,600
Your Majesty, this is an immortal attendant from Qianyun Palace.

149
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,800
He's here to look for Yan Dan.

150
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,200
Why are you looking for her?

151
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,100
Your Majesty, Fairy Yan Dan told me to burn this agarwood incense burner with fire a few days ago.

152
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,800
However, the incense burner is blessed with divine arts. I couldn't burn it, no matter what I did.

153
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,600
I had no choice but to return it to her,

154
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,800
but I couldn't find her.

155
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,000
I will return it to her.

156
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You all may leave, for now.

157
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,800
 Yan Dan, since you were willing to burn this agarwood incense burner,  

158
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,100
 I'm sure you are thoroughly disappointed with me. 

159
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,000
 However, the only way for you to sever your emotions is to leave Yanxu Heavenly Palace. 

160
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,200
 By doing so, you will no longer be hurt or sad in the future. 

161
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,000
   

162
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,800
  Yu Mo! This is bad. Something huge happened! 

163
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,400
Didn't you tell me this yourself?

164
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,000
"We shouldn't panic, no matter what." Why are you panicking?

165
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,600
  For some reason, Yan Dan was arrested for poisoning the Curator! 

166
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,500
  Emperor Ying Yuan had sent her to Heavenly Prison! 

167
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,400
  We have to save her! 

168
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,800
Don't worry.

169
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,900
I will surely try everything to save her.

170
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,900
Brother Yu Mo. Brother Yu Mo!

171
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,000
Brother Yu Mo!

172
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,700
Brother Yu Mo, why are you trying to break the barrier, all of a sudden?

173
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,600
Did you know that Yan Dan was sent to the Heavenly Prison?

174
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,700
However, this barrier is connected to my immortal spirit.

175
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,600
Anyone can enter and exit at will, except for me.

176
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,000
This won't do.

177
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,600
I have to rescue Yan Dan as soon as possible.

178
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,000
Brother Yu Mo! Since Yan Dan is your friend, naturally, she's my friend as well.

179
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,600
I'll find the Marshal right now so that he can dispel the barrier.

180
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,800
Don't do that!

181
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,400
Marshal Huo De will never agree to it.

182
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,000
It's impossible for me to leave Yan Dan in the lurch.

183
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,900
I must save her, even if it means I have to sacrifice myself.

184
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,700
Lu Ming?

185
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't worry about me.

186
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm doing great over here.

187
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
  Do you even know the situation you're in? 

188
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,300
  Yan Dan, you have to tell His Majesty the entire truth now. 

189
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,500
  If not, you'll die! 

190
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,000
  I'd never believe that you were the culprit behind the poisoning incident. 

191
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,100
  Apart from you, Zhi Xi is the only Four-Leaf Lotus in the entire Heavenly Palace! 

192
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,200
  Are you keeping quiet because you want to protect her? 

193
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,800
  Even though Zhi Xi is your sister, she framed you for her crime. 

194
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,200
  I'll go explain everything to His Majesty now if you insist on keeping quiet! 

195
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,900
No!

196
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,800
You mustn't do that if you see me as your friend.

197
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,400
But why?

198
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,200
I've already discussed it with Zhi Xi.

199
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,500
She has her painful reasons.

200
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,700
I was the cause of her suffering.

201
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,900
She has been living in my shadow for the past century.

202
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,700
However, she still protected me during that time.

203
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,200
  Even so, she shouldn't just frame you like this! 

204
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,800
Her kindness and crimes have canceled each other out.

205
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Anyway, you shouldn't make it hard on her.

206
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,200
I'm willing to leave this place if Zhi Xi can be relieved of her suffering.

207
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,600
Anyway, she's still my sister, no matter what other people say about her.

208
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,400
  "Leave this place?" 

209
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,500
  Could it be that you're seeking death? 

210
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,300
How is that possible?

211
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:50,700
Emperor Ying Yuan promised he would keep me alive and send me to Mortal Realm.

212
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,100
  - Really?   
 - Really!

213
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,400
I didn't expect that either.

214
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,700
I guess this is a blessing in disguise.

215
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,800
In the past, I used to fantasize about how beautiful the Mortal Realm will be.

216
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,300
I wanted to visit it someday.

217
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,000
This time, I guess I can finally check it out myself!

218
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,300
  Since you've already decided to go to the Mortal Realm... 

219
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
 you may never be able to return again. 

220
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,300
  Why don't you take Yu Mo with you? 

221
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,600
  Emperor Ying Yuan is too far out of your reach. 

222
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,800
  So you should consider being with Yu Mo instead. 

223
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,600
You like him as a friend, right?

224
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,800
Can you not match us up randomly?

225
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,600
Yu Mo is the black fish I raised.

226
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,100
It's perfectly reasonable even if he regards me as his mother.

227
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,000
  I will bear the consequences myself. 

228
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,700
  There's no need to implicate other people. 

229
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,500
Anyway, I've already made up my mind.

230
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,600
You should stop persuading me.

231
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,900
If you can withstand my willfulness and still treat me as a friend,

232
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,600
from now on... stand by Emperor Ying Yuan for me.

233
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,600
   

234
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,900
 I do detect the scent of a soul-protecting elixir. 

235

♫   My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves   ♫

236

♫   For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you   ♫

♫   Turn around and become the delusion of my life  ♫

♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

241
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:57,400
 Your Majesty, I'm an immortal attendant from the Pavilion of Artifacts.  

242
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,400
 I didn't mean to intrude and bother you today. 

243

♫   Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most  ♫

 The play was so lovely. 

245
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,100
 Your Majesty might be less depressed after hearing about it. 

246
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,000
 What are you talking about? 

247
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,100
 You… 

248
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,900
 This is osmanthus cake, freshly made by the Heavenly Kitchen. It’s delicious. 

249
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,200
 Do you know what the Fire of Lost Rationality is? 

250
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,800
 Once the fire poison breaks out, it'll hurt others uncontrollably!  

251
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,900
 If you set me free, you won't be able to save me. 

252
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,000
 You will also hurt yourself! It'll bring chaos to the Three Realms! 

253
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,800
 Hurry up and leave! 

254
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
 Emperor Ying Yuan!

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
 Leave!

 No. I won’t leave!

 Hurry up! Go! 

258
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,900
 I’m not leaving! 

259
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,200
 Go!

 "House of Rascal"? 

267
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,000
 Only a person like her can come up with a crude name like this. 

268
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,100
 Only a person like her... is silly enough to stay by my side. 

269
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,700
 The petal of a lotus can quell one's inner demon, 

270
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,900
 leave some color behind after burning, and produce scent when burned. 

271

 Emperor Ying Yuan, the lotus pond is over there.

 The lotuses have bloomed.

 Although the Butterfly of Lucid Dreams’ cocoon can bring one into the dream realm, 

308
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,700
 only true love can transform the cocoon into a butterfly. 

309
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,800
 That night, Yan Dan appeared in my dream. 

310
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,100
 The person whom I spent the rest of my life with wasn't just an illusion. 

311
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,300
 It was Yan Dan’s real form. 

312
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,300
♫   You may choose to hate fate   ♫
♫   Your heart of patience allows me to grieve   ♫

313
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:51,100
♫   When the fog clears, I will still come carrying my secrets   ♫

314
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,600
I've completed the investigation.

315
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
You were concocting an elixir...

316
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,000
that could protect one's artifact spirit right before you were poisoned.

317
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,800
It would only be effective if you took it three days in a row.

318
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,400
You were the one who poisoned yourself.

319
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,600
Yan Dan wasn't supposed to be punished.

320
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,400
The person who should be sent to the Heavenly Gallows is you.

321
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,800
Yan Dan?

322
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,000
Yan Dan.

323
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,000
Your Majesty, you only have Yan Dan in your heart.

324
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:50,100
Even though I stood by you for a millennium, why have you never looked at me once?

325
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,400
  This is my firefly lamp. It never extinguishes. 

326
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,200
  Emperor Ying Yuan, you're occupied with the affairs of the Heavenly Court every day. You have worked hard. 

327
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,500
  I hereby grant you this lamp as a token of appreciation. 

328
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,400
  I assume the palace has an abundance of heavenly aura. 

329
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:46,900
  After a millennium, the wick of the firefly lamp actually became an artifact spirit and acquired a human form. 

330
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,100
  Emperor Ying Yuan, she kept you company for a millennium. 

331
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,400
You should take her back and let her serve you in Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

332
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,500
Your Majesty and I were fated to be together.

333
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,700
Do you really think I don't know?

334
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:22,000
You disrespected the Heavenly Rules and attempted to use a loving relationship to make me enlighten you

335
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,700
so that you could transform into an immortal spirit!

336
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,000
That's not it!

337
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I admit that I did have an ulterior motive for approaching Your Majesty back then.

338
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,400
But I did have feelings for you.

339
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,800
You had feelings for me?

340
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:40,589
I was already benevolent enough not to send you to the Heavenly Gallows back then!

341
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,400
Both Yan Dan and I...

342
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,400
were your immortal attendants.

343
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,800
I was cautious and loyal to my duties.

344
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,200
Not only did she lie, but she also made plenty of mistakes!

345
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,200
But Your Majesty defended her and chased me out of the palace instead!

346
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,400
Why?

347
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,800
Your Majesty, why can you never see me?

348
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,700
Because immortals should have no feelings.

349
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,060
"Immortals should have no feelings"?

350
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:38,260
If so, Your Majesty, why did you shed tears just now?

351
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,440
Your Majesty, if you do have feelings for Yan Dan…

352
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,080
no matter how severe the punishment of love is,

353
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:06,500
Your Majesty is immensely powerful, and you're protected by His Supreme Majesty. I'm sure you can escape unscathed.

354
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,480
But what about Yan Dan?

355
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,080
She's still injured and has to face such a severe punishment.

356
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,080
I'm afraid she will perish.

357
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,640
Are you trying to threaten me?

358
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,320
Your Majesty, I just hope you can spare me.

359
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,799
His Supreme Majesty has already given his verdict on the poison.

360
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:43,659
If you reopen the case again, His Supreme Majesty will surely get to the bottom of it.

361
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:47,699
The fact that Yan Dan was secretly helping you will be exposed.

362
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:50,379
His Supreme Majesty has never been lenient toward those who committed the crime of love.

363
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,280
If he uses the Uncoupling Cord to test her love for you,

364
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,099
I'm afraid she will face the punishment of love, instead of the punishment of fire.

365
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:01,900
Yan Dan might still survive the punishment of fire.

366
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,080
It's better than serving the fatal punishment that is the punishment of love.

367
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,440
Your Majesty, if you spare me right now, I will make a vow.

368
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,259
I will keep quiet.

369
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:21,000
I will never tell anyone about your relationship with Yan Dan.

370
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,000
I won't destroy this evidence.

371
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:39,880
If you dare to do something like this again, I will never spare you.

372
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

373
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,400
I will surely turn over a new leaf. I will never do this again.

374
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,460
You better keep yourself in check from now on.

375
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,080
 Ying Yuan, back then, you rejected me, using the Heavenly Rules as your excuse. 

376
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:14,460
 Now I will watch you as you send the person you love to the Heavenly Gallows. 

377
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:21,000
 She will misunderstand you, hate you, and will never know what you have done for her. 

378
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:49,759
Emperor Ying Yuan, you told your men to send her belongings here this morning.

379
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:55,099
Now, although it's getting late, you came all the way to Xuanxin Cliff to clean her room?

380
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,200
Marshal, I have a favor to ask of you.

381
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,820
Please help me.

382
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,820
   

383
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,940
Back then, I was the one who attacked you.

384
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,659
It's been ages since then.

385
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,959
Moreover, too many things happened in the Heavenly Court during that time.

386
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:26,340
I've long forgotten about it.

387
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:37,939
You and I were lucky to return from the battlefield alive.

388
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:42,440
Just tell me if you need any help.

389
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,160
Marshal, I hope that you can give me a Letter of Immunity.

390
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,820
A Letter of Immunity? But why?

391
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,900
Could it be that you've committed a grievous sin?

392
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,200
I'm not requesting it for my sake. It's for Yan Dan.

393
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,480
You mean that mischievous brat?

394
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,200
She will be punished at the Heavenly Gallows in three days.

395
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,880
She has already endured the punishment of thunder strikes.

396
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,260
I'm afraid her immortal spirit will perish if she receives the punishment of fire now.

397
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,860
Marshal, that's why I hope you can spare her from punishment with the Letter of Immunity.

398
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,339
What exactly has the little attendant done wrong for her to receive such heavy punishment?

399
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:26,760
It's inconvenient for me to reveal the reason to you.

400
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,320
However, Yan Dan is not a criminal.

401
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,659
You and I have competed for many years.

402
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,419
Your morality can be seen through the way you compete with me.

403
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,019
I know your personality well. I won't ask you why.

404
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:47,020
I'll do you this favor.

405
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,180
Marshal, I'm deeply indebted to you.

406
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,200
Besides that, I have another favor to ask of you.

407
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,600
Speak up.

408
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,120
After this, I will transfer Yan Dan back to Xuanxin Cliff.

409
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,779
Although she doesn't have much immortal power, she has extraordinary talent.

410
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:17,640
Marshal, I hope you can take her as your disciple and ensure her future.

411
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:26,480
Although that little attendant joined hands with you to beat me up, I love sassy brats like her!

412
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,559
She's witty and brave too.

413
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:32,300
She's good enough to be my disciple!

414
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,320
Emperor Ying Yuan, this is my first time

415
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,720
seeing you being this concerned about an immortal attendant after so many years.

416
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,419
You actually parted with your favorite GO manual because of her.

417
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:50,640
However, don't worry.

418
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,879
I know how much you adore this GO manual.

419
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:58,779
I will surely return it to you in perfect condition after reading it.

420
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:00,360
No need.

421
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,060
I've already solved all of the GO riddles in there.

422
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,680
From now on, I will stop playing GO.

423
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,879
Brother Yu Mo, I know you're a descendant of the Nine Fins Clan.

424
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:39,219
Nine Fins Clan members are born with extraordinary power.

425
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,259
But why can't we dispel the Marshal's barrier?

426
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,980
Don't worry.

427
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,880
I will keep this a secret.

428
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,800
Brother Yu Mo, you should try using my Heartseeker Bell.

429
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,360
Zhao Lan, I'm sorry.

430
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,100
The Heartseeker Bell was destroyed because of me.

431
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,799
I will surely make it up to you after I save Yan Dan.

432
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,019
It's fine. The Heartseeker Bell…

433
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,899
is just one of the random divine tools I carry with me.

434
00:43:58,899 --> 00:44:00,750
The Dragon Clan has plenty of other divine tools like this.

435
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,870
You should hurry and save her.

436
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,660
 The Heartseeker Bell has already rung. 

437
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,420
 Whether it will ring again no longer matters now.
