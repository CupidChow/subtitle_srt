 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,540
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai advises people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,960
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,080
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,479
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,180
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,000
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,270
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,439
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,600
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,780
   

15
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,050
   

16
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,220
In your next life, will you still appear before me?

17
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:25,409
♫   My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves   ♫

18
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:32,349
♫   For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you   ♫

19
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:39,459
♫   If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go?   ♫

20
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:45,639
♫   Turn around and become the delusion of my life  ♫

21
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,230
In my next life, I won't let you go.

22
00:02:53,679 --> 00:03:00,619
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

23
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:07,800
♫   I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust   ♫

24
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,959
♫   Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most  ♫

25
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:21,839
♫   You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers   ♫

26
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:28,039
♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

27
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:35,969
♫   You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine   ♫

28
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:44,009
♫   In my dream, the one I loved is with me   ♫

29
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:04,219
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

30
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:10,429
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

31
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:18,209
♫   As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable   ♫

32
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:25,329
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

33
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:33,389
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫

34
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,580
Breathe out.

35
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,820
Wife.

36
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,620
You... Who are you calling "wife"?

37
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,580
You.

38
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,340
I went through the proper rites and married you.

39
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,580
 This must be Emperor Ying Yuan's dream. 

40
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,840
 I snuck into his dream and took advantage of him like this. 

41
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,820
 If he finds out in the future, I hope he won't send me to the Heavenly Gallows. 

42
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,000
It's too late for you to regret it now, my wife.

43
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,239
In the outskirts of the Land Under the Horizon, it was you who made my heart flutter.

44
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,860
Do you...

45
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,680
truly love me?

46
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,620
When we were in the Land Under the Horizon,

47
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,440
if it weren't for you, I would have faded into nothingness.

48
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,300
Back then, death was my goal.

49
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,380
But I also told myself that...

50
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,080
if I ever survived,

51
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,240
I would give everything up and marry you.

52
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,640
Now I am no longer Emperor Ying Yuan.

53
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,460
I want to spend this life...

54
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,380
with you.

55
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,360
We will weave the yarn of love that will move mountains and rivers.

56
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,660
Today,

57
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,720
we shall swear to spend three lives together.

58
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,800
We will be inseparable.

59
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,740
We will grow old together, now and forever.

60
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,640
Emperor Ying Yuan, I have never seen you...

61
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,520
What did you call me?

62
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,740
I mean... H-Husband.

63
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,160
I was saying...

64
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,280
I have never seen you smile like this.

65
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,960
That was because I was an emperor.

66
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,000
It was unexpected.

67
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,680
Now I smile for you, at the cost of my carefully-nurtured image.

68
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,280
You must take full responsibility for me now.

69
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,080
Who would have thought that an Emperor could be cheekier than a lotus plant?

70
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,040
I can't believe this could happen to us.

71
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,120
What a wonderful dream.

72
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,360
More dreams will come true.

73
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,300
I just hope...

74
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,780
you will never wake up from it.

75
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,260
Make sure it's clean.

76
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,320
Yes, Wife.

77
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,740
Have some tea.

78
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,960
Careful. It's hot.

79
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,119
That spot.

80
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,860
Yes.

81
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,220
Is it good enough?

82
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,180
Harder, please.

83
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,400
How about this?

84
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,120
Over here.

85
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,940
Okay. Here.

86
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,780
What do you want to eat?

87
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,180
This one?

88
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,920
Okay.

89
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,540
What do you think?

90
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,660
It's not good.

91
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,060
It's not good?

92
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,120
Let's get you something else.

93
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,059
What else do you want to try? Try this.

94
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:05,520
Here.

95
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,940
How is it?

96
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,999
- What's wrong? 
 - It's too bland.

97
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,220
Too bland?

98
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,539
It's okay. Let's not eat them since they're unsavory.

99
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,600
The baby is most important.

100
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,480
Come here.

101
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,040
What for?

102
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,919
Honey-trapping won't work on me.

103
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,160
Cook it again. Now.

104
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,180
Wife!

105
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,800
- Gou Dan! 
 - No, Mother. I didn't do it.

106
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,180
I'll glue our neighbor Mr. Fu's mustache back.

107
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,000
Please don't tell my father.

108
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,640
I'm here to run away together with you this time.

109
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,819
How could father be this outrageous and dare to scold you?

110
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:06,999
It's not that.

111
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,759
It's just that every time you run away, your father would give me a hard time.

112
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,339
I think he's doing this on purpose, but I don't have any evidence.

113
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:16,759
What do you mean?

114
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,879
Did he hit your palm with a ruler?

115
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,079
Well... It's not that.

116
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,439
Anyway, this time, I won't let him have his way.

117
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,939
Let's go. Let's leave together.

118
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,299
Xiao Gou Dan! 
 (TN: "Xiao" = "Little" - term of endearment) 

119
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:33,219
Are you running away again?

120
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,079
You even took two bags with you.

121
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,760
If I didn't stop you here, you would be in great trouble!

122
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,920
Mother!

123
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,279
Enough. Drop the act.

124
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,800
Let's go home.

125
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,919
I'm serious. I am innocent.

126
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,560
Are you?

127
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,399
Don't set a bad example.

128
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,500
Otherwise, I might really hit your palm with a ruler.

129
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,879
When have you ever hit my palm with a ruler before?

130
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,540
The time you spread the rumor that I was giving you a hard time.

131
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,140
So you heard everything?

132
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,940
Our child is here.

133
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:17,159
♫   I blame time for the mortal world's woe is on your shoulder   ♫

134
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:24,490
♫   Like the surging tides of stars, I continuously ask where the origin of love comes from   ♫

135
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:31,659
♫   I'm afraid the tears brimming in the corner of my eyes will fall and blur your silhouette   ♫

136
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:42,020
♫   In my momentary childishness, I now understand that all living things wither away   ♫

137
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:51,329
♫   Counting the passing of the seasons, no matter which directions, everything moves towards you   ♫

138
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:58,099
♫   The beauty is in the burning agarwood incense, there's still hope when the ashes settled   ♫

139
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:05,629
♫   Hear the beautiful prose with a fine beauty and a picturesque view, they pair well together   ♫

140
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:09,090
♫   Sew two hearts together and a stem sprouts forth   ♫

141
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:16,350
♫   Understand the wind, think about the rain, and do not awaken from the dream   ♫

142
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:28,210
♫   Just let me linger all day and night   ♫

143
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,480
Emperor Ying Yuan. You're awake.

144
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,500
What did you make me drink last night?

145
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,800
"As You Wish," a wine I brewed myself.

146
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,920
I wanted you to have a sweet dream.

147
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,440
What did you dream about last night?

148
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,220
I did not dream of anything.

149
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,559
- You didn't? But I clearly... 
 - You what?

150
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,980
I clearly...

151
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,060
Nothing.

152
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,999
What's the matter, Emperor Ying Yuan?

153
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,580
Leave!

154
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,459
Emperor Ying Yuan?

155
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,220
Leave!

156
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,619
I won't!

157
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:07,859
- Leave! 
 - No!

158
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,300
Emperor Ying Yuan!

159
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
 Emperor Ying Yuan! 

160
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,019
Open the door, Emperor Ying Yuan!

161
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,079
Stop using your powers. Your body can't handle it!

162
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,219
 Let me in. I can help you, Emperor Ying Yuan! 

163
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:37,120
 Open the door! 

164
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,139
Open the door, Emperor Ying Yuan!

165
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:43,340
Open up! Open up.

166
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,740
Emperor Ying Yuan?

167
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,680
Emperor Ying Yuan.

168
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,590
Don't come near me.

169
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,540
You just had an episode. I need to cool you down.

170
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,400
Stop delaying the inevitable.

171
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,420
I have said it many times. We celebrated my birthday. You may leave now.

172
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,559
But we agreed on this yesterday.

173
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,519
After your birthday, it's your rebirth.

174
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,800
Why are you pushing me away?

175
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,040
- If you won't leave, I'll destroy my immortal spirit myself. 
 - Wait!

176
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,680
Ying Yuan.

177
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,860
After all this time...

178
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,300
Can you truly remain cold and unmoved?

179
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,459
Has it never occurred to you to let go of your obsessions and live properly?

180
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,740
Never.

181
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,460
Do it for me. Please?

182
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,540
Even more so, no.

183
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,680
I know why you are pushing me away.

184
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,439
Because you know you're about to die.

185
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,579
You're afraid of facing it yourself, and you don't want me to suffer with you. But it's okay!

186
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:42,379
We can go back to how it used to be. Please?

187
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,460
I merely took pity on you.

188
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,700
I'm sorry if I made you misunderstand.

189
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,380
So the times we shared together...

190
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,560
Was it just the result of a huge misunderstanding?

191
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,440
From now on...

192
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,520
we will not see each other anymore.

193
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,440
This is your farewell gift.

194
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:42,560
Have you been carving recently just to make me this censer?

195
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,300
It's all I can do now.

196
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,400
This censer represents my gratitude.

197
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,900
Thank you for taking care of me.

198
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,040
If I don't take it, you'll forever be indebted to me!

199
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,180
You're smart.

200
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,020
In a GO game, the best way to resolve a deadlock...

201
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,980
is to withdraw.

202
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,360
Otherwise, both parties will be hurt.

203
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,720
Just leave.

204
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,300
Fine.

205
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,320
I'll leave.

206
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,600
But I have one last question for you.

207
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,620
If you regain your eyesight one day,

208
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,340
will you be able to recognize me?

209
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,900
I will.

210
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,000
But that day will never come.

211
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,220
 It will. I will heal you. 

212
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,380
I don't care.

213
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,420
I'll take it as a promise, then.

214
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,180
If, one day, you can't recognize me, I'll throw you off the Bridge of Emptiness!

215
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,680
 We still reach a deadlock. 

216
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:10,160
 If I continue like this, she will be the one who inevitably gets hurt. 

217
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,280
She won't say anything this time.

218
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,000
Can you guess what she's after?

219
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,420
 Would you truly go to such lengths for him? 

220
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,479
 If the Lotus Heart Remedy truly exists, it must be a risky operation. 

221
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:12,500
 I have to obtain my Solar Form as soon as possible. 

222
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,340
 If you insist on taking the risk, I want to help as much as I can. 

223
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,479
 The records mentioned that, to carry out the Lotus Heart Remedy, 

224
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,080
 you need to refine half of a Lotus Heart in the Fuxuan Cauldron 

225
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,559
 on the day when the sun and the moon appear together. 

226
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,760
 I remember seeing the cauldron here. 

227
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,500
Yan Dan!

228
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,759
Do you know what you are doing?

229
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,499
Don't you know stealing a divine tool is a serious crime that will get you executed at the Heavenly Gallows?

230
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:13,340
I do.

231
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,120
- Come with me. 
 - I won't.

232
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,600
If I wasn't on duty today, you would have been in big trouble!

233
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,420
Zhi Xi, can you help me this one time?

234
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,879
This is very important to me.

235
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,140
Can you help me take this away from here?

236
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,220
What do you need this cauldron for?

237
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,120
If you won't tell me, I won't help you.

238
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,580
All right. I'll tell you.

239
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,920
But don't tell anyone else.

240
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,640
Sister, please keep this between us.

241
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,000
I need this cauldron to help Emperor Ying Yuan.

242
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,480
His Majesty?

243
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,820
Isn't he traveling around?

244
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,740
What happened?

245
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,200
It all began when I ran into Emperor Ying Yuan.

246
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,980
But you have spent such a long time in Yanxu Heavenly Palace. Didn't he recognize your voice?

247
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,020
I used a spell to change my voice. Therefore, he can't recognize it.

248
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,000
Sister, I'm running out of time.

249
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,240
Emperor Ying Yuan could die from the poison at any time.

250
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,900
I really need this cauldron to save him!

251
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,920
 Yan Dan is willing to take half her heart out. 

252
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,240
 She must have fallen in love with His Majesty. 

253
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,840
 It is against the Heavenly Rules. 

254
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,700
 If I can save His Majesty now, it will benefit my career. 

255
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,480
 Besides, His Majesty saved me once too. 

256
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,560
Sister, please help me.

257
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,280
You said gouging your heart out poses no threat to your life.

258
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,000
Is it true?

259
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,640
Yes.

260
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,160
- Then take it. 
 - Thank you, Sister.

261
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,560
Sister, I have another favor to ask for.

262
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,700
My Distance-Keeping Bracelet was broken into three parts.

263
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,100
I'm sure the talented and powerful deputy curator of Magical Pavilion can fix it for me.

264
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,360
Just help me this time, please.

265
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,919
Thanks, Sister. I should get going now.

266
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,080
 The sleeping powder in the censer can only make him fall asleep for a short while. 

267
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,540
 I need to concoct the antidote quickly. 

268
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:00,020
Emperor Ying Yuan, although you have been pushing me away,

269
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,540
I know you didn't mean it.

270
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,580
I saw your dream.

271
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,580
When you open your eyes again, you'll see me.

272
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,300
And when you realize I'm Yan Dan,

273
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,200
will you be surprised?

274
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,620
 The time is almost up. I should retrieve the Fuxuan Cauldron now. 

275
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,580
 After Yan Dan sacrifices her heart, she will be weakened. 

276
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,240
 She won't be able to take care of Emperor Ying Yuan. 

277
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,620
 If I stay by his side, he'll be grateful to me when he wakes up. 

278
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,700
Which deity are you trying to seduce this time?

279
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,860
Curator, I'm visiting Holy Deity Bai Lian to retrieve the divine tool he borrowed yesterday.

280
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,840
Is it the Fuxuan Cauldron?

281
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,520
You're bold, aren't you?

282
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,800
As the deputy curator of Magical Pavilion, you misappropriated the divine tool.

283
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,300
Did you think you could fool me?

284
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,960
Forgive me, Curator.

285
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,279
This is not for my personal gain.

286
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,960
It is to save someone.

287
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,200
The cauldron will be returned today.

288
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,120
Please make an exception.

289
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,000
An exception?

290
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,080
Do you want me to allow you to be His Majesty's savior?

291
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,080
You really are Yan Dan's sister.

292
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,080
Both of you are equally reckless.

293
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Do you think you're worthy of His Majesty's gratitude?

294
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,860
You don't have to go to the Heavenly Gallows.

295
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:14,380
I shall purge the Heavenly Court of its pest today.

296
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,680
The Heart-Piercing Drum?

297
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,799
When I was delivering the Heart-Piercing Drum back to the pavilion,

298
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,420
I accidentally saw Fairy Zhi Xi stealing a divine tool.

299
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,040
In an act to eliminate any witnesses, Fairy Zhi Xi ambushed me.

300
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,160
I was forced to retaliate with my divine tool.

301
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,199
Unfortunately, I shattered her Lotus Heart

302
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,300
along with her immortal spirit.

303
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,200
What do you think of this story?

304
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,440
Aren't you close to Yan Dan?

305
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,760
Your sister shouldn't be the only one to have her heart gouged out.

306
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,400
Did you lie in wait here so you could kill me?

307
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,940
 I can't die like this. 

308
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,000
Curator.

309
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,820
I know you're worried that His Majesty will favor other fairies over you.

310
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,040
That's why you antagonize me.

311
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,980
But you're mistaken.

312
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:46,860
The one who shares a special bond with His Majesty is not me.

313
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,060
It's Yan Dan.

314
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,560
Silence!

315
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,080
How dare you slander His Majesty's and my name before you die!

316
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,600
I am telling the truth.

317
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,840
Yan Dan and His Majesty spend day and night together.

318
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,820
Why else do you think I indulged her request despite the risk involved?

319
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:12,060
As for His Majesty's feelings, we can only know once he's awake.

320
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,400
Yan Dan went to the Land Under the Horizon early in the morning.

321
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:21,260
Now that I think about it, the Lotus Heart Remedy should be done by now.

322
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,140
 She's right. 

323
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,460
 Yan Dan is the one who has stolen Emperor Ying Yuan's heart. 

324
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,540
Where are you going?

325
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,440
I will deal with Yan Dan first.

326
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,340
Then, I'll deal with you.

327
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,840
 Sorry, Yan Dan. 

328
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,760
 Emperor Ying Yuan is with you. You will be safe. 

329
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,040
 And I will only be spared if I do this. 

330
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,820
Is Zhi Xi here?

331
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,980
 Curator Ying Deng of the Magical Pavilion reported you for misappropriation of divine tool. 

332
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,880
 You then fled here. 

333
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,180
 Surrender yourself now! 

334
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,600
 I stole the Fuxuan Cauldron. 

335
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,280
 I cannot let Sister take the blame for me. 

336
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,530
Are you Fairy Zhi Xi of Magical Pavilion?

337
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,140
Yes, I am.

338
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,250
Where is the Fuxuan Cauldron?

339
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,119
Since I'm a first-time offender, can you…

340
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,160
Even though you have returned the divine tool, by the Heavenly Rules, you will still be administered nine thunder strikes.

341
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,390
Now serve your sentence by the Heavenly Gallows.

342
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,140
Take her away.

343
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,400
   

344
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,800
After centuries, we are the only two from the Aquatic Clan on Xuanxin Cliff who managed to take on human forms.

345
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,179
Zhao Lan, we are destined to become the rulers of the Aquatic Clan.

346
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:45,160
The lotus pond outside is beautiful.

347
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,019
I stayed here for more than a century, but I didn't know this place was so big!

348
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:19,120
Zhi Xi, Deputy Curator of Magical Pavilion, stole the Fuxuan Cauldron. She shall be punished with thunder strikes.

349
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:42,260
 You used a transformation spell to disguise yourself as Zhi Xi and serve the sentence on her behalf. 

350
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,680
 I shall fulfill your wish, then. 

351
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,960
Great.

352
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,640
I can finally see you under the sun.

353
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,500
Oh, no.

354
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,659
You're a black fish. How dare you get a human form before I did?

355
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,060
Move aside.

356
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,139
How rude. Do you know who I am?

357
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:41,100
Ao Xuan!

358
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,559
- Ao Xuan! Ao Xuan. 
 - Did you just hit me?

359
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,200
You can't walk away like that!

360
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,320
Ao Xuan! Ao Xuan!

361
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,560
Stop fighting!

362
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,380
Ao Xuan, just stop already!

363
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,100
You won't be able to use it!

364
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,340
Thank you.

365
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,060
Stop!

366
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,720
- Ao Xuan. 
 - Don't block me!

367
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,999
He just assumed that form and has an unstable immortal spirit.

368
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:56,079
You are the future Dragon King. Show some sympathy, at least.

369
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,500
You sure have a powerful bell!

370
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,920
- Why won't it ring? 
 - How would I know?

371
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,760
That stupid black fish hurt me at Xuanxin Cliff.

372
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,820
I'm going to tell Marshal Huo De about this!

373
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,340
You...

374
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,620
So immature.

375
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,380
 Heartseeker Bell is the treasure of all female members in my clan. 

376
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,420
 Only my soulmate can make it ring. 

377
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,480
 The eighth strike. Sister. 

378
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,420
 Emperor Ying Yuan. Yu Mo. Lu Ming. 

379
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,940
 I hope I can still see you again. 

380
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,680
 She just gouged out half her heart. 

381
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,160
 And after nine thunder strikes, she's still alive. 

382
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,620
 What a resilient soul. 

383
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,120
 I know you're in there. 

384
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,540
 Whoever you transform into, I will still be able to recognize you. 

385
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,020
 You fool. 

386
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,140
 Why did you take the blame instead? 

387
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,240
 You have gouged your heart out. 

388
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,120
 I knew it. Someone is always there to protect Yan Dan. 

389
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,420
 But what about me? 

390
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,420
 Ying Deng is ruthless. She failed to kill Yan Dan. 

391
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:52,820
 She won't let me go easily. I can't return to Magical Pavilion. 

392
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,500
 Yan Dan. 

393
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,500
 Forgive me. 

394
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:15,000
