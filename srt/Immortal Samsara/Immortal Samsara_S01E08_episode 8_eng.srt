 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,439
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,759
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,970
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,379
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,179
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:52,000
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,420
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths   ♫

10
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,999
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:11,069
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,339
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:21,700
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,780
   

15
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,050
   

16
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,860
What are you doing?

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,399
- This is... 
 - The Heavenly Infirmary denied us a visit.

18
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,170
The immortal attendants of the palace are worried.

19
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,039
All we can do is hang the immortal bell as a blessing.

20
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:00,139
If His Majesty hears the bell ringing from Yanxu Heavenly Palace, he'll know we sent him regard.

21
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:02,940
Yan Dan, why don't you hang one too?

22
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,219
What kind of injury does His Majesty sustain? When will he be back?

23
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,199
The heavenly physician said His Majesty's injury is related to the peace of the Three Realms.

24
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,939
- Except for His Supreme Majesty, no one has the right to know. 
 - But we're not outsiders.

25
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:17,100
We're under his care and share his joy and sorrow every day.

26
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,650
Now that His Majesty is at the Heavenly Infirmary, don't we have the right to dress his wound and serve him some tea?

27
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,750
   

28
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,210
 If the poison seeps into the bone and damages the brain, There will be no difference between the Devils and I. 

29
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,239
 The Three Realms and I are something within one's grasp. 

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,800
 And now, I can't even find a place to bury myself. 

31
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:01,999
♫   My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves   ♫

32
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:09,169
♫   For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you   ♫

33
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:16,259
♫   If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go?   ♫

34
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:22,629
♫   Turn around and become the delusion of my life  ♫

35
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:30,419
♫   The most beautiful destiny is hidden in the dark night, "love" is the word for everything   ♫

36
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,270
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

37
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,310
Emperor Ying Yuan.

38
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,340
 Yan Dan. 

39
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,410
♫   I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust   ♫

40
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,549
♫   Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most  ♫

41
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,700
You vile man,

42
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,900
come back quickly.

43
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,900
When you're back,

44
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,460
I'll throw tiles with you.

45
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,420
And I'll lose to you on purpose to make you happy, okay?

46
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,780
And... And I haven't returned your cloak yet.

47
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,740
The play I wrote is going on stage soon.

48
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,300
You promised me you would come back and watch it.

49
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,820
You're the Emperor. You must not break your promise.

50
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:40,819
♫   You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers   ♫

51
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:47,149
♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

52
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:55,010
♫   You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine  ♫

53
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:02,379
♫   In my dream, the one I loved is with me   ♫

54
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,789
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

55
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:24,625
 Yan Dan, I'm sorry. 

56
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:32,399
 If I return to the palace and see you today, it will be harder for you when I die. 

57
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,880
 In the future, Emperor Qingli Ying Yuan will not exist. 

58
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,290
 No one will be there to protect you. 

59
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:52,579
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫

60
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,620
I'm Yan Dan, an immortal attendant of Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

61
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,819
I know His Supreme Majesty has ordered the heavenly physician not to say a word of Emperor Ying Yuan's injury.

62
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,179
But I'm willing to stay in the Heavenly Infirmary and serve by His Majesty's side.

63
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:13,759
Can you relay my message? His Majesty will surely agree if he knows about it.

64
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,299
Attending to the wounded is the responsibility of the Heavenly Infirmary.

65
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:20,319
We don't need your help. Just leave.

66
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,799
If there's any update, His Supreme Majesty will send someone to inform you.

67
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:28,839
After His Majesty returned to the Heavenly Realm, we have yet to see him and we don't know how injured he is.

68
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,599
All the immortal attendants of Yanxu Heavenly Palace are worried.

69
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,560
Even if I have to disobey the order today, I must see him.

70
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,866
You came at the wrong time.

71
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:40,747
Emperor Ying Yuan has just bid His Supreme Majesty farewell and descended to the Mortal Realm to recuperate.

72
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:43,451
Now, the various deities are returning to their palaces.

73
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:44,736
No one has the time for you.

74
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,479
What do you mean? Please make yourself clear.

75
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,400
 The deities? Immortal Lord Bei Ming has returned too? 

76
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,119
 He was also on the battlefield. He must know about Emperor Ying Yuan's injury. 

77
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,260
Yan Dan, what are you doing there?

78
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,500
Get the heavenly physician now.

79
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,119
Okay.

80
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,340
There's no need.

81
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,160
The heavenly physician with the military has concluded

82
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,860
that prescribing medicines will only prolong his pain.

83
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:40,640
Didn't Immortal Lord ride the immortal beast and command from the rear?

84
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,580
How did he... How did he sustain such a serious injury?

85
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,239
They were ambushed by the Devil Army.

86
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,400
When I reached there, he had already lost his immortality.

87
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,570
He was stabbed by the Devils' Soul Dissipating Sword.

88
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,900
It penetrated his bone, causing him to lose his soul.

89
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,019
The pain is akin to having countless poisonous insects moving throughout his body.

90
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,140
He will not survive.

91
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,960
Immortal Lord, do you have any final wishes?

92
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,499
Do tell us.

93
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,500
Put me...

94
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,540
Put me out of my misery.

95
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,100
Please kill me!

96
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,200
There must be a way.

97
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,999
You won't die just like this.

98
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,469
Yes. You won't die like this.

99
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:45,749
There must be a way. There must be a way.

100
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,340
The soul-returning pill.

101
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,339
The soul-returning pill! The soul-returning pill!

102
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,600
Master.

103
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,039
Immortal Lord! You will be okay after eating this.

104
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,140
Come on.

105
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,600
Kill me!

106
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,320
Kill me now!

107
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,640
- Kill me! 
 - Yu Mo. Yu Mo!

108
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,040
Master.

109
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,519
Master! Master.

110
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,019
- Kill me! Kill me!
- Master.

111
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:19,800
- Kill me now!
- Master!

112
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,840
Master!

113
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,199
Kill me!

114
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,159
Kill me!

115
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:30,019
 Within my lifetime, I'd like to see Little Black Fish transform into human form and call me "master". 

116
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:34,999
 It's not worth the wish. Obviously, it can be realized anytime. 

117
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,299
Have you gone mad, Yu Mo? What are you doing?

118
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:53,000
Yan Dan, since there is no other way to change the result, I can't bear to let Master suffer such misery!

119
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,939
But if Immortal Lord Bei Ming dies with regret, you'll be in pain your whole life!

120
00:09:56,939 --> 00:09:59,640
I've cultivated into human form not long ago.

121
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,540
Given my spiritual power, I can't save him.

122
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,740
I have an idea. Even if it's only for a moment, I can make you two see each other!

123
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,380
Yan Dan.

124
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,799
Yes, it's me. I'm Yan Dan, Immortal Lord.

125
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,610
It's me.

126
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,320
Yu Mo, hurry up! Hurry up!

127
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,460
You are...

128
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,540
Master.

129
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,940
Master, I've cultivated into a human form.

130
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,820
But I'm still late. I have a name now.

131
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,800
My name is Yu Mo.

132
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,140
Master.

133
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,620
You are...

134
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,060
from the Nine Fins Clan.

135
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,580
You're not late.

136
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,900
You're not late at all.

137
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,300
I can now die

138
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:54,960
without regret.

139
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,740
Immortal Lord!

140
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,440
Master.

141
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,480
Master! Master.

142
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,940
- Immortal Lord Bei Ming!
- Master.

143
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,340
Master.

144
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Master.

145
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,400
Master,

146
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,160
I'll do as you wish and live well.

147
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,960
Let my dragon scale stay with you forever.

148
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,460
Immortal Lord Bei Ming.

149
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,140
Immortal Lord!

150
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,660
They succeeded the throne in ancient times.

151
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,320
Now, they brought peace to the realms.

152
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,360
Emperor Zhao Sheng, the Greater God Purple Star,

153
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,940
Emperor Wan Yun of Pleasure and Virtue,

154
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,340
the Primordial Divine Emperor Chang Sheng,

155
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:12,130
Huan Qin, Star Deity Ji Du, and Immortal Lord Bei Ming have died under the hands of evil devils.

156
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,999
I am very heartbroken. I can't stop shedding tears.

157
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:20,219
After being bestowed as Star Deity Ji Du and Immortal Lord Bei Ming, they will enjoy the glory of the Greater Gods.

158
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:23,819
They will be buried in the Divine Cemetery Forest, living with the holy spirits of the martyrs.

159
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:26,559
Their loyalties will be passed down eternally.

160
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,980
And we will not forget that they are heroic spirits and will receive respect from every realm.

161
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,820
I came to the Divine Realm in my childhood.

162
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:56,720
Due to the distress in adapting to an environment that was a world apart from my homeland,

163
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,240
I suffered from many strange illnesses.

164
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,400
The dragon scales all over my body fell off.

165
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:08,080
When my life was hanging by a thread, it was Master who smashed his divine tool, Jade Bone Pestle,

166
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:16,080
into pieces to restore my dragon scales and preserve my true form.

167
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:24,560
After losing his divine tool, some Greater Gods continuously mocked him secretly.

168
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,360
They laughed at his incompetence.

169
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,280
Now I know what happened.

170
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,220
He hoped that I could live well.

171
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,860
I once read the script of a play from the Mortal Realm.

172
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,100
If a good man dies unjustly,

173
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,980
heavy rain will hit the Mortal Realm to wash away the grievances of the world.

174
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:57,580
The bereaved will gain some relief from the pain.

175
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,060
But in the Heavenly Realm,

176
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,520
there are heavenly palaces, divine tools, elixirs, and thousands of beautiful sceneries.

177
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,620
Yet, it has never rained once.

178
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,740
In the Heavenly Realm, there is no rain, snow, or thunder.

179
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,290
Neither do joy nor sorrow exist here.

180
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,720
This place may look holy and solemn.

181
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,000
In truth, it is very dull and indifferent.

182
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:37,900
My master was only bestowed with a false title "Greater God" and a coffin.

183
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,580
In the days to come, Xuanxin Cliff will surely change hands.

184
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,600
And the world will forget about him, just as they did to the Nine Fins Clan.

185
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,100
They'll forget about my master.

186
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,840
He made all these sacrifices, but to no avail.

187
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,800
It won't be.

188
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,100
As long as we're alive, we won't forget him.

189
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,800
The west wind blows softly. The sound of music stopped.

190
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,906
The flowing clouds don't know the weariness of the setting sun.

191
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,610
The tall buildings don't know the worries of the running water.

192
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:35,339
Birth and death. Good times have gone. When can one rest?

193
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:42,040
The setting sun illuminates the world only because the world is his beloved.

194
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,820
Even if no one understands him, he has no regrets.

195
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,940
Yu Mo,

196
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:56,660
today, let Xuanxin Cliff rain for Immortal Lord.

197
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,000
   

198
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,220
Immortal Lord! Don't worry! I'll take good care of Yu Mo for you!

199
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,340
Master!

200
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,300
I know you can hear me!

201
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,140
 Master, I've grown up. I'll make myself stronger. 

202
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,920
 I'll never let my loved ones leave me again. 

203
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:46,554
Come on. I'll lend you my shoulder.

204
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,320
 When I was born, I heard that the Four-Leaf Lotus brings auspiciousness. 

205
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,960
 But I lived a simple life. 

206
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,199
 I was often ridiculed. I've been an embarrassment to the Four-Leaf Lotus Clan. 

207
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,840
 Only after I met you,  
    

208
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,520
 I realized everything could be so different. 

209
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,840
 If what was said about auspiciousness is true, 

210
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,560
 I'm willing to give all my auspiciousness to you, 

211
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,200
 as long as you can return safely. 

212
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,720
 Please don't end up like Immortal Lord Bei Ming. 

213
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,279
This is my title token.

214
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,579
All right. This is mine.

215
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,579
What are you doing? Immortal Lord Bei Ming has just been buried.

216
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,659
And Emperor Ying Yuan is still missing. I have many things to attend to.

217
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,540
Why did you bring me here?

218
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,059
You look dispirited these few days. If you don't take a stroll, you'll turn mad soon.

219
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:20,520
I did this for your sake. It's better to step out and watch the fun than to stay in your room.

220
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,420
So many have come.

221
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,390
Yes. It hasn't been so lively for a long time.

222
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:30,639
So many immortals and fairies have dressed up. Is there a grand occasion today?

223
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:35,599
To celebrate the war victory, His Supreme Majesty holds a grand Jade Pool Festivity.

224
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,450
He invited the immortals from the Three Realms

225
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,290
and many of the immortal clans that cultivate in the Mortal Realm to attend the festivity.

226
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:43,119
Didn't you always feel it's boring in the Heavenly Realm?

227
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,279
Maybe you'll catch love at first sight and forget your sorrow.

228
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,750
With my law of enchantment and your little pretty face, you can easily...

229
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,299
Can easily cost me my life.

230
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:55,540
The first abstinence in the Heavenly Rules is love abstinence.

231
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,310
Those who are forbidden to fall in love and get married

232
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,199
are the Heavenly Immortals and the Greater Gods in the Nine Heavens.

233
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:03,459
These immortal clans are Earthly Immortals. They don't need to abide by the Heavenly Rules.

234
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:06,159
What do you think these immortals and fairies dressed up for?

235
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,270
All of them want to regain their freedom.

236
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,060
It's so lively today.

237
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,800
It'd be great if Emperor Ying Yuan were here too.

238
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,070
He promised he would watch my performance.

239
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,800
I wonder if he would show up on that day.

240
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,759
The Jade Pool Festivity is a heavenly occasion. Emperor Ying Yuan has never been absent.

241
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:28,339
By then, he'll definitely end his wandering and return to the Heavenly Realm.

242
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:32,920
Since His Majesty will be there to review it, you should pull yourself together and practice well.

243
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,260
Dragon King of the East Sea is here!

244
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,580
Your Majesty, you came from afar bearing exquisite gifts.

245
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,239
It shows that the Dragon Clan is prosperous and strong.

246
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,910
His Supreme Majesty has prepared a warm palace for you to rest.

247
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,690
Please follow me.

248
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,360
He brought so many exquisite gifts.

249
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,879
This kind of gift exchange is nothing.

250
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,559
I heard that all the guests of the festivity have brought along exquisite gifts for His Supreme Majesty.

251
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,839
The Treasure Pavilion must be full of treasures then.

252
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,519
After the festivity is over, the treasures will be transported down through the Heavenly River

253
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:13,760
to the mansions of the various Earthly Immortals.

254
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,880
The Treasure Pavilion?

255
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,820
It's a deserted place with slack security.

256
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,220
What are you planning to do?

257
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,899
You mean when His Supreme Majesty is bestowing the gifts after the festivity,

258
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:35,260
we'll take the opportunity to sneak into the Treasure Pavilion,

259
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,439
hide the little divine tortoise in the East Sea Dragon King's gifts, and take it to the Mortal Realm?

260
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:44,860
That's right. Heaven is helping me.

261
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,360
I almost forgot.

262
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,459
This is your invitation letter. Remember to come and watch our performance.

263
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:53,999
I've saved a good seat for you.

264
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,119
Before the show begins, you must come backstage to cheer us on.

265
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,899
Don't worry, Yan Dan. I'll definitely be there.

266
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,440
It's going to start at noon?

267
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,500
Yes. All festivities in the Heavenly Realm start at noon and end at sunset.

268
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,020
What's the matter? Don't tell me that you can't make it.

269
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,620
Well, actually...

270
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,819
To obtain this invitation letter, I've spent a lot of gold to create a fake identity, Black Fish Spirit, for you.

271
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:22,119
Don't worry. By then, it'll be a mess. No one will suspect your identity.

272
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,279
- Yes. Actually, I... 
 - What is it?

273
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,359
You're not from the Bat Clan. You're afraid of the light?

274
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,760
Anyway, if you don't show up, we won't perform.

275
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,380
I'll definitely be there.

276
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,820
There will be a surprise.

277
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,740
Are you saying the Snail Girl will be there too?

278
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,200
It would be great if he showed up.

279
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
But he has given me many inspirations.

280
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,200
I've made some changes to the ending.

281
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Yan Dan, are we going to rehearse or not?

282
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,500
The show is in three days.

283
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,200
You're so talkative. Just save it for your thank you speech.

284
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm coming!

285
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,500
Remember, okay?

286
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,000
 My immortal power is unstable. 

287
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,400
 I lost substantial power when saving Yan Dan. 

288
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,800
 If I step up in my practice day and night,  

289
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,300
 I wonder if I could transform into the human form during the day for the festivity. 

290
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,400
 All I can do is give it a try. 

291
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,200
We've been practicing for three nights.

292
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,000
The show will begin in eight hours.

293
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,700
You'll only finish lighting the lanterns at dawn if you do it one by one.

294
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,200
What else can I do? If I don't start lighting them now, I won't be able to make it.

295
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,800
Yan Dan, you've learned many magical spells.

296
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,700
Can't you just light them up all in one go?

297
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,900
I'm not Emperor Ying Yuan.

298
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,600
I'm not that capable.

299
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,900
Besides, I'm a lotus. Water is my strength.

300
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,200
I don't know any fire spells.

301
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,000
Yan Dan, your cultivation base has improved substantially. Just give it a try.

302
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,300
All right then. I'll give it a try then.

303
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,400
Calm down.

304
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,600
I... I'll try again.

305
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,000
What's going on?

306
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Impressive!

307
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,000
I lighted them up! Am I awesome?

308
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,600
You're awesome.

309
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
That was so close.

310
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Thank you.

311
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,800
I saw everything.

312
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,800
You have amazing immortal power.

313
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,600
It's all right.

314
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Let's carry on.

315
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,900
Yes.

316
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,100
The Asura Clan uses human bones as firewood and consumes immortals as food.

317
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,800
They slaughtered everything.

318
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,000
If we can only gain light and victory by letting the Asura Clan trample on our dignity and lives,

319
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,300
I'd rather extinguish it personally and fight to the end in this darkness.

320
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:01,500
In the ancient year 1358, the world's remaining five Greater Gods and Star Deity Huan Qin

321
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,600
shot out the Myriad-Bone Light that symbolized the rule of the Asura Clan.

322
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,700
And the War of Genesis began.

323
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,400
The Dragon Clan, the Nine Fins Clan, the Blood Eagle Clan,

324
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:19,100
the Four-Leaf Lotus Clan, and hundreds of immortal clans responded to the call and joined the battle.

325
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,400
They sustained a long battle, endless sacrifices, and prolonged darkness

326
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,100
just to prove that dignity was more important than life.

327
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Emperor Ying Yuan is still not back.

328
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,300
I guess he has forgotten about my performance.

329
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,500
Why isn't Yu Mo here either?

330
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,600
Why are you so late?

331
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,100
- Zhi Xia. 
- Emperor Ying Yuan must be still recuperating in the Mortal Realm.

332
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,600
Yu Mo must have been caught up with something.

333
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,200
Don't worry so much.

334
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,600
We're into the second act now.

335
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,200
It's almost my turn to go on stage.

336
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,000
Get yourself ready.

337
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,500
All right.

338
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,670
   

339
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,700
Immortal Lord Bei Ming. Star Deity Ji Du.

340
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,700
The war is over.

341
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,500
How come I can't feel the joy that arises from the end of a battle?

342
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,300
134 immortal clans have been wiped out due to the war.

343
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,900
This is the 135th clan.

344
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,400
I can't believe that there is a survivor.

345
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,600
This is the Four-Leaf Lotus.

346
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,800
When the flowers bloom, auspiciousness emerges.

347
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,400
It's suitable to be grown in the Jade Pool.

348
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,500
Your sister is really something else.

349
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,600
I, Yan Dan, an immortal attendant, presented "The Tale of The Genesis Hero"

350
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,000
to thank all deities and immortals for your efforts in the War of Genesis.

351
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,300
I hope for peace in the Three Realms and we shall never forget the martyrs.

352
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,200
Joy is like training, and sorrow is like a halberd.

353
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,400
The sophisticated and the weak will fall.

354
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:08,000
Looks like the name Emperor Ying Yuan has given you suits you well.

355
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,600
Four-Leaf Lotus has a girl like you.

356
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,600
Looks like you can make your clan proud again.

357
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,800
I am a foolish girl.

358
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,900
I'm fortunate to receive help from Emperor Ying Yuan to make this play possible.

359
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,800
Hopefully, I lived up to Emperor Ying Yuan's painstaking effort.

360
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,000
May wars cease forever in the Three Realms.

361
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,600
May all heroes be remembered eternally.

362
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,500
Look, the immortals feel joyful because of your play.

363
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,800
It's all because of your ingenuity.

364
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,400
Looks like...

365
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,100
Joyful?

366
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,100
It seems that Your Supreme Majesty has failed to understand the play.

367
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,600
The War of Genesis was a tough battle.

368
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,200
This play may seem to be filled with hope.

369
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,800
But in truth, it's a lamentation and a show of sympathy towards the lives we lost during the war.

370
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,400
The recently deceased Immortal Lord Bei Ming's appearance at the end of the play

371
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,400
was intended to provoke a sense of mourning in everyone here.

372
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:23,600
I can't believe that everyone only showed laughter, but no tears.

373
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,200
More than a hundred ancient immortal clans were wiped out just like that.

374
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,700
How could you all feel joyful?

375
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,000
Huo De, you're drunk.

376
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,600
Today is the Jade Pool Festivity.

377
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,200
Please get back to your immortal mansion.

378
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,000
Why lose your temper and spoil the joy?

379
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,400
We suffered as many casualties and injuries in the Battle of Devils as in the War of Genesis.

380
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,000
Three out of the Four Emperors have perished.

381
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,400
Star Deity Ji Du and Immortal Lord Bei Ming had lost their lives during the war.

382
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,900
This isn't the sorrow of one palace!

383
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,400
It's the funeral of the Three Realms!

384
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,600
Marshal Huo De, you're drunk.

385
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,500
Stop talking.

386
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,439
You, as the ruler of the Three Realms,

387
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:14,999
instead of presiding over the funeral and guarding the coffins in person

388
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:21,219
in the Divine Cemetery Forest, you're acting proudly and celebrating the victory here.

389
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,599
How could the heavenly army not feel bitterly disappointed?

390
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,779
How can this action convince the public?

391
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:28,850
Marshal, who is the one acting proudly here?

392
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,900
Is it you or me?

393
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,959
Marshal Huo De, His Supreme Majesty always respects you because you're the oldest immortal in the Three Realms.

394
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:42,739
Yet, His Supreme Majesty's tolerance has made you even more arrogant.

395
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:44,199
This is a crime of disrespect.

396
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,979
Come on. I've broken the Heavenly Rules.

397
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:51,320
Are you going to punish me immediately at the Heavenly Gallows?

398
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,470
Come on!

399
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,700
  Your Supreme Majesty, please calm down! 

400
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:10,539
As the reinforcements, Marshal Huo De must have put in a lot of effort in fighting the Devils.

401
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:15,860
Even so, you didn't have to force yourself to come here.

402
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,539
What Dragon King said is right.

403
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:24,299
The Heavenly Realm is not without places for recuperation.

404
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:28,679
Xuanxin Cliff, the former residence of Immortal Lord Bei Ming, is a scenic spot.

405
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:36,359
From now on, you will be relieved of command in the military and recuperate at Xuanxin Cliff.

406
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:40,640
You may grieve and resent there.

407
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,479
For a ruler like you, why should I continue to train and lead your army?

408
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:07,139
Instead of being buried with disappointment in the Divine Cemetery Forest alone one day,

409
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:13,559
I'd rather spend my time at Xuanxin Cliff to raise fish and water the flowers earlier.

410
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:15,980
Insolence!

411
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,750
  Your Supreme Majesty! 

412
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,939
Your Supreme Majesty, please calm down!

413
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:25,160
I have something to say that may calm your anger.

414
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,840
Speak.

415
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,740
Previously, Emperor Ying Yuan had watched this play once.

416
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,680
He said that everything he did wasn't to gain merit and fame.

417
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,779
He only hoped those who had not been affected by the war would enjoy eternal happiness.

418
00:37:41,779 --> 00:37:48,359
I think that both Your Supreme Majesty and Marshal Huo De are right.

419
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:52,440
To cherish prosperity is to commemorate the heroes.

420
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,590
Rise and speak.

421
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,079
Your Supreme Majesty, you and Emperor Ying Yuan have known each other for tens of thousands of years.

422
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,119
Your Supreme Majesty must understand Emperor Ying Yuan the best.

423
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,510
I believe Your Supreme Majesty will not hold Marshal Huo De accountable, right?

424
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,380
Definitely.

425
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:16,419
Yan Dan, the immortal attendant, has a pure heart and spirit and unique artistic talent.

426
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,179
This play deserves to be the winner.

427
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:25,719
I once said that the winner of the performances at the Jade Pool Festivity will be bestowed with one wish.

428
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:30,480
Yan Dan, speak your wish.

429
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,140
Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty.

430
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,790
My elder sister Zhi Xi and I are the only survivors of the Four-Leaf Lotus Clan.

431
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,719
As the Vice Curator of Magical Pavilion, she has passed the ascension examination.

432
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,199
After experiencing the hardship in the Mortal Realm, she'll be ascended in her divinity.

433
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,579
I hope I can take my sister's place to experience the hardship.

434
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:59,000
I'd like to wander and experience the Mortal Realm so that I could write better plays.

435
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,559
Is your sister the girl who was harmed by the Devils 500 years ago?

436
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:08,420
There's a saying that one may find a strong and a weak in twin lotus.

437
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,159
She's very smart.

438
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:14,919
Firstly, she was brought back by Emperor Ying Yuan to help subdue the traitor.

439
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,679
Now, she received praise from His Supreme Majesty.

440
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,080
Isn't it apparent who is strong and who is weak?

441
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,160
Congratulations, your ascension is just around the corner.

442
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:34,860
It's just that in the future, whenever you show up in the Nine Heavens,

443
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:42,340
your divine headpiece will remind the immortals of how Yan Dan makes herself stand out today.

444
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,139
I approved.

445
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:49,679
Discuss among yourselves the auspicious date and report to the Department of Heavenly Law

446
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,620
to descend to the Mortal Realm and experience hardship in her place.

447
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,560
Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty.

448
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,600
Your Supreme Majesty, Yan Dan has another request.

449
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,100
Proceed.

450
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,400
I'm Emperor Ying Yuan's servant.

451
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:14,279
When the Devils attacked the Heavenly Court, it was thanks to Emperor Ying Yuan for saving me that I'm alive today.

452
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:23,280
Emperor Ying Yuan left behind this item back then.

453
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,859
I have yet to return it to him.

454
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:28,730
Since he's not back yet, I can't bear to leave now.

455
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:36,059
May Your Supreme Majesty allow me to repay my master for his kindness before I descend to the Mortal Realm?

456
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,260
You're a loyal servant.

457
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:49,960
The three Emperors, including his best friend Star Deity Ji Du, have just passed away.

458
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,579
Emperor Ying Yuan was devastated and descended to the Mortal Realm to recuperate.

459
00:40:55,579 --> 00:41:01,180
I don't know when he'll let go of his guilt and return to the Heavenly Court.

460
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:06,359
Well... Does Your Supreme Majesty know how Emperor Ying Yuan's injury is?

461
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:09,259
His injury is fine. What about this?

462
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:16,699
When Emperor Ying Yuan returns to the Heavenly Realm, I'll inform you and allow you two to bid farewell to each other.

463
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:19,300
You'll descend to the Mortal Realm after that.

464
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,630
Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty, for your kindness.

465
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,160
Sister!

466
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,359
Did I do very well just now? Did you hear it?

467
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,999
His Supreme Majesty said you don't have to descend to the Mortal Realm.

468
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,559
I can do it for you.

469
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,499
For this play, I've been practicing for days without taking a rest.

470
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:42,670
Aren't you going to compliment me?

471
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,580
If you want to stand out, you don't have to use me as your reason.

472
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,980
What's wrong with you?

473
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,159
Didn't you say that you don't want to suffer in the Mortal Realm?

474
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:01,259
I said it was because I don't wish to, not because I can't do it.

475
00:42:01,259 --> 00:42:05,200
Wasn't your action today telling the Heavenly Realm that I'm incapable?

476
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,300
Or do you think that I'm destined to be the weak one of the lotus twins?

477
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,599
Then, why don't you just compete against me in front of the immortals?

478
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,479
She has once broken through my immortal power.

479
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:23,239
She could subdue Qianyun Palace's curator with a few moves.

480
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:26,940
It's too easy for her to beat you.

481
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:34,260
Zhi Xi, given your immortal power, Yan Dan may find it unworthy to fight against you.

482
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,720
Stop your nonsense!

483
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,180
Sister, have I done anything wrong?

484
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,439
Or did I say anything that hurt you?

485
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:48,499
Tell me, please. Or just hit me.

486
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,560
Everything I did was to make you happy.

487
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,680
You're not me.

488
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,380
How can you understand my worries?

489
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,260
Do you think this will make me happy?

490
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,490
Do you think I'll win you with pride if you don't fight back?

491
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,510
Your actions only embarrass me more.

492
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:18,500
Sister, didn't you say that we should protect each other?

493
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,639
I don't know what I've done wrong.

494
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,800
Did I do something wrong?

495
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,540
Please tell me what I did wrong.

496
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,959
Yan Dan, in the past, you relied on Emperor Ying Yuan's generosity and acted willfully and were deluded.

497
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:40,239
Now, you used what Emperor Ying Yuan had said and acted slyly at the festivity.

498
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:43,600
You're really adept at flattering.

499
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,879
But you must never forget your identity.

500
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:52,610
Making a racket at the festivity is a crime of disrespect.

501
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,580
I'm going to take a stroll by the lotus pond.

502
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:06,259
Are you going to stay to pester your sister and make yourself a joke?

503
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:09,270
Or are you going to go for a clear break?

504
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,420
Please make your decision.

505
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,860
Sister, don't go with her.

506
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:49,950

 ''Agarwood'' - Zhang Jie | Jane Zhang 

508
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:19,500
♫   My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves   ♫

509
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:26,510
♫   For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you   ♫

510
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:33,570
♫   If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go?   ♫

511
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:39,900
♫   Turn around and become the delusion of my life  ♫

512
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:47,790
♫   The most beautiful destiny is hidden in the dark night, "love" is the word for everything   ♫

513
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:54,800
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

514
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:01,959
♫   I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust   ♫

515
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:08,089
♫   Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most  ♫

516
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:15,969
♫   You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers   ♫

517
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:22,270
♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

518
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:30,160
♫   You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine  ♫

519
00:46:30,169 --> 00:46:37,570
♫   In my dream, the one I loved is with me   ♫

520
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:58,340
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

521
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:04,650
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

522
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:12,520
♫   As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable  ♫

523
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:19,470
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

524
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:27,240
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫
