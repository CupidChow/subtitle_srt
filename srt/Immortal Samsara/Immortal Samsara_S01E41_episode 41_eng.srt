 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,600
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,820
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,070
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,120
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths   ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,920
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,220
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,100
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,570
   

15
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,050
   

16
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,920
   

17
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,740
After a busy day, we finally got them together by raining flower petals.

18
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,020
You're the one who won the water lantern.

19
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,680
I wouldn't have thought the winner would bring all of us here to set the koi fish free.

20
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,680
In a good stage play, the protagonist needs a close friend who's willing to help and support them.

21
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,840
Besides, since I promised to back him up, I have to stay true to my word.

22
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,200
If we don't help Zi Lin find an opportunity, then Lin Lang will go crazy with anxiety.

23
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,820
If you had told me this earlier, they may have had a child Zi Yan's age by now.

24
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,880
Mountain Chief, the koi fish are still here and refuse to leave.

25
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,780
You're a fish too. Could you please reason with them, tell them to swim further away so people can't catch them?

26
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,120
Sure, no problem.

27
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
Come on.

28
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,980
Let's see.

29
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,460
Are they over there?

30
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,340
Zi Yan. Look over there.

31
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,420
Tang Zhou.

32
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,360
I wonder if me coming personally is enough to bring you back, Taoist Master Tang.

33
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,220
   

34
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,620
 "May there be peace in the world." 

35
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,140
 You wished for the Six Realms to be in peace when you were in Nine Heavens. 

36
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,300
 Things have changed with the passage of time, yet you never change. 

37
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,680
 You're still the emperor who only cares about the world. 

38
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,650
   

39
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,900
Do you regret giving them the lantern?

40
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,200
If you have another wish, I'll win another one for you.

41
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,360
No.

42
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,980
I made all my wishes on the day we watched the fireworks.

43
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,700
   

44
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,860
Tang Zhou, do you acknowledge your mistake?

45
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,120
I accidentally hurt my peers out of desperation.

46
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,360
I'll accept the punishment.

47
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,680
If you admit your mistake and make changes, cease your affections,

48
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,380
I'll be lenient on you considering your past contributions.

49
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,380
You've misunderstood, Sect Leader. I'll accept the punishment, but I did no wrong.

50
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,600
What did you say?

51
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,380
Previously, I held to your teachings and stayed away from desires.

52
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,480
I deemed affection as the absolute evil deep inside and the magical bracelet alerted me to cut it off.

53
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,080
I also feared that I'd fall into the abyss of evil.

54
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,740
However, feelings grow from within and my desire won't stop if my heart is still alive.

55
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,160
If it's wrong to have feelings,

56
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,540
then between the feelings of human beings or the righteousness of the world, which one is right?

57
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,040
I would rather suffer from deep feelings and love than be a heartless person.

58
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,380
So, if I'm not wrong, I naturally won't admit to it.

59
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,100
Absurd!

60
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,260
Since you're unrepentant, I'll punish you according to sect rules without showing mercy!

61
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,880
Men! Bring the punishment stake!

62
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,060
Sect Leader. Senior Brother is only temporarily confused,

63
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,280
please give him a chance. He'll repent for his mistake!

64
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,840
Fine.

65
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,980
Before I launch the punishment, I ask you once again.

66
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,060
Are you willing to cut off your feelings?

67
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,460
I'm not willing.

68
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,580
Tang Zhou is my successor, yet he failed to practice the abstinence of love!

69
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,920
Per the rules, all members of the Lingxiao Sect are responsible to get him back on the right track!

70
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,900
Starting from me, every disciple has to ask him that same question again!

71
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,320
The whip won't stop until he changes the answer!

72
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,420
Tang Zhou. Are you willing to cut off your feelings?

73
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,040
I'm not.

74
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,420
Qin Qi. Do you want to go against me too?

75
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,300
Junior sister. Do it.

76
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,260
Senior Brother. Are you willing to cut off your feelings?

77
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,040
I'm not.

78
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:22,010
♫   My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves   ♫

79
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:29,080
♫   For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you   ♫

80
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:36,070
♫   If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go?   ♫

81
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:43,170
♫   Turn around and become the delusion of my life  ♫

82
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:50,270
   
   

83
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:56,240
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

84
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,000
 "May there be peace in the world," 

85
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,040
 "a smile with dimples so deep, eyebrows so light." 

86
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,140
 "Yan Dan." 
 (T/N: last two words of each line make up her name) 

87
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,620
 Is his wish for me to be happy? 

88
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,020
How many whippings has he endured?

89
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,880
Sect Leader, it's been eighty-one whips.

90
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,000
Do you still persist in your answer?

91
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,900
Yes.

92
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,160
I'm not willing to.

93
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,820
You've gone crazy!

94
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,540
Enough! That's enough for today.

95
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,140
Lock him up in the Reflection Room!

96
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,860
We'll continue until he comes back to his senses.

97
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,380
Yes.

98
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,860
Is it Yan Dan the one who bewitches him?

99
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,970
   

100
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,180
Dan Shu.

101
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,700
Dan Shu, did you hurt your hand? Let me see.

102
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,900
Sister Yan Dan. I was practicing with the sword, and I accidentally hurt myself.

103
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,520
I'll treat your injury.

104
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,960
No need. I have medicine.

105
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,940
Where's Zi Yan? Why isn't he with you?

106
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,060
Zi Yan? He said Mountain Chief Zi Lin isn't as handsome as a brother-in-law.

107
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,420
The other foxes made fun of him so he's hiding in his room crying.

108
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,860
Those fox demons being judgmental about someone's appearance really isn't a good thing.

109
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,940
Don't learn this from him, okay?

110
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,560
Look, Sister Yan Dan. It's healed.

111
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,060
Where did you find such medicine in this mountain?

112
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,100
It's not from the mountain. I bought it from the temple fair yesterday.

113
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,240
 Thank you, Yu Mo. Although I'm not good enough to help remove your scars right now, 

114
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:38,200
 I believe that I'll find a better solution in this vast world to remove the scars one day. 

115
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,900
Where did you get this? Take me there.

116
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,340
Sure.

117
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,180
Sister Yan Dan. It's him.

118
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,400
You little demon, managed to even find me here.

119
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,040
So, you're a demon as well?

120
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,420
You...

121
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm a Chinese knotweed who lives in deep mountains. 
  (T/N: A plant used for Chinese herbal medicine.) 

122
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,220
I like to save people from sickness, so I came to the mortal world.

123
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,580
Chinese knotweed is one of the herbs used to concoct the Yanbi Pill.

124
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,040
I see now.

125
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,000
You know about the Yanbi Pill?

126
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,600
Are you a flower demon?

127
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,820
Senior, I saw the medicine you sold could heal any wound.

128
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,220
And there's an herb from the Yanbi Pill that can heal disfigured faces.

129
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,620
A friend of mine has old scars all over.

130
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,260
I wonder if you can concoct an antidote to remove the scars?

131
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,940
Well...

132
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,200
This medicine is enough to heal common scars.

133
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:45,460
However, to heal old scars completely, there's one more herb needed to remove them.

134
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,320
- Take this medicine. 
 - Thank you.

135
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,120
I'll write the prescription for you.

136
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,260
If you're a flower demon, then we could be considered distant relatives.

137
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,700
Let me give you some advice.

138
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,400
It's not easy to find such a rare herb.

139
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:13,120
My friend is very important to me. I'll willing to forsake my life for his sake.

140
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,080
Honestly, it's not that hard to find it.

141
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,260
 What I'm saying is that you can ask for some money from him. 

142
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,370
   

143
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:40,180
Miss Yan Dan. I finally know why Tang Zhou didn't want us to get married.

144
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,360
Tell me, had I persisted in my decision, would you have chosen me instead?

145
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,120
Did you all stop me here just to ask this one question?

146
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,680
Is there something wrong with you?

147
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,880
What do you want exactly?

148
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,760
We're here to take you to meet Tang Zhou.

149
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,140
There's nothing between Tang Zhou and I.

150
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,020
You should go back.

151
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,920
I knew it was his wishful thinking.

152
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,180
Very good then.

153
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,180
I'll support you before the Sect Leader and won't get you involved.

154
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,560
Sect Leader? Exactly who wants to see me?

155
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,420
What has happened to Tang Zhou?

156
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,060
That's none of your business, Miss.

157
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,000
Just come with me. I'll protect you.

158
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,740
What if I say no?

159
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,520
Miss Yan Dan, no one can disobey the Sect Leader's order.

160
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,880
In that case, pardon my rudeness.

161
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,980
- I won't allow you bully Sister Yan Dan! 
 - Dan Shu.

162
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,540
Isn't he the demon who ran away from the Demon Suppression Hall?

163
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,240
It was him! I remember, he's a wolf demon!

164
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,180
Why are you with a demon?

165
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,420
Don't tell me you were involved in the incident in Demon Suppression Hall.

166
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,740
Watch out!

167
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
   

168
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,400
- Are you all right, Dan Shu? 
 - I'm fine.

169
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,420
You're a demon too?

170
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,520
Senior Dao Yuan, the two of us are just powerless demons.

171
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,300
We have never harbored bad intentions or committed evil deeds.

172
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,060
You're a sensible man.

173
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,400
We knew each other from before, you should know that I'm not lying.

174
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,260
Could you please spare us and let us leave based on our past friendship?

175
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,300
I can't believe I was bewitched by a demon.

176
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,480
You... are malicious!

177
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,060
Sure enough.

178
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,200
This is the typical reaction we demons expect from demon catchers.

179
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,760
Form the formation and seize the demons!

180
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,600
Dan Shu, get out of here.

181
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,300
Sister Yan Dan. I can't move.

182
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,160
I performed the demon locking spell when he showed his tail just now.

183
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Crushing such little demons is as lifting a finger.

184
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,000
If you want him to live, then come with us.

185
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,960
We wolves are born tough.

186
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,660
Sister Yan Dan, leave now. Don't worry about me. Don't let them capture you!

187
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,900
Dan Shu, don't worry. I'll figure out a way.

188
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,740
We'll go with them first.

189
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,520
I'll come with you!

190
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,000
Previously, we lost track of the demons when we got to this area.

191
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,620
However, Lin Lang and I overheard that someone saw a demon here when we were walking around this morning.

192
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,740
We've been in the mortal world for more than half a month,

193
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,760
yet there's no sign of the demons after they went missing.

194
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,140
Only he was spotted by someone.

195
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,800
Let's search carefully.

196
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,060
We'll definitely discover something new.

197
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,360
More and more demons are going missing lately.

198
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,520
Those who live in Yelan Mountain are all nervous and agitated.

199
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,200
I think need to get back quickly and calm them down as soon as possible.

200
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,020
We'll head back right after the investigation.

201
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,880
We can't let them down and return empty-handed.

202
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,960
Don't be scared. Look carefully at us.

203
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,080
Mountain Chief Zi Lin. Mountain Chief Yu Mo. I'm finally saved.

204
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,720
Please take me back to the mountain, I beg you.

205
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,840
I'll never leave the mountain again!

206
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,540
Hurry, get up.

207
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,400
Are you all right, hurt anywhere?

208
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,450
In order to ensure no other demons get hurt,

209
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,350
I have a question I want to ask you.

210
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,320
You must have seen this before.

211
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,800
After I snuck out to play, I was captured by a Taoist in this outfit.

212
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,300
He locked me up in a pitch-black space.

213
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,760
It was so scary.

214
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,200
Do you remember where you were locked up?

215
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,320
I had no idea at first,

216
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,520
but I heard from the other demons say that it was the Lingxiao Sect.

217
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,500
Turns out it really is Lingxiao Sect behind this.

218
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,740
I've told you not to trust Tang Zhou.

219
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,260
We were tortured by those from the Lingxiao Sect.

220
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,920
They cut our skin and drained our blood.

221
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,630
One day, I had an opportunity and transformed into my real form and climbed out.

222
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,140
However, I broke into a place

223
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,100
and I saw a man they called "Sect Leader" throw a demon into an alchemy furnace!

224
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,440
Lingxiao Sect tends to claim they are righteous and just.

225
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,280
Never would've thought they would dare to kill demons to refine into pills!

226
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,260
Yu Mo. We, demons from the mountain never torment humans,

227
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,520
and our kindness has caused us trouble instead.

228
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,180
There are so many demons missing right now, they must've captured them!

229
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,700
Let's go.

230
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,540
We'll raze the Lingxiao Sect to the ground and get the children back.

231
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,400
No.

232
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,140
The Lingxiao Sect is powerful.

233
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,580
We need to plan meticulously before any decisions are made.

234
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,060
We mustn't act rashly.

235
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,120
Right now their safety is our top priority.

236
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,980
We can't put the mountain demons in danger again.

237
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,420
Do you remember how you escaped from there?

238
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,120
I didn't dare eat or sleep.

239
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,960
I hid in a crevice and managed to escape their grasp after a month.

240
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,300
I was planning to return to the mountain, but demons catchers were everywhere.

241
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,840
I was too afraid of them... so I kept hiding.

242
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,840
I'm sorry.

243
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,400
I saw so many demons who were being tortured,

244
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,400
but I wasn't brave enough to save them.

245
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,020
It's okay. You've already done well.

246
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,000
Don't worry. We promise to get you back safe and sound.

247
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,120
 Yan Dan. Yan Dan. 

248
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,920
Have you seen Yan Dan?

249
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,540
I've gone to the places she used to visit, but she's nowhere to be found.

250
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,800
This morning, the staff in the inn saw Yan Dan going out with Dan Shu.

251
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,500
But it's late already, why haven't they come back yet?

252
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,380
Come with me.

253
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,600
Dan Shu and Yan Dan were involved in a fight here.

254
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,200
The people they fought were in a group and they had a divine tool for catching demons.

255
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,100
Would it be those from the Lingxiao Sect, the ones who captured the snake demon earlier?

256
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,500
Yan Dan is shrewd and has no demonic aura.

257
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,100
Besides, she's just regained her memory lately and her demonic power is stronger than before.

258
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,600
Even if she encountered them she would've found a way to escape.

259
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,200
Could it be... because of Dan Shu?

260
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,060
Dan Shu?

261
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,760
What have you found?

262
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,920
   

263
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,400
   

264
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,040
This is the book that Yan Dan bought from the temple fair.

265
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,280
Yan Dan had a habit of bringing along a book that she hasn't finished reading.

266
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,000
She'll tear the corner of the book when she's in danger.

267
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,020
And it's the word "Tang".

268
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,760
- Tang Zhou. 
- Tang Zhou?

269
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,840
Why did he capture Yan Dan? What's wrong with him?

270
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,300
It's impossible.

271
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,920
Tang Zhou values promises a great deal.

272
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,700
Even if he really wanted to capture Yan Dan, he would've come alone.

273
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,200
Looking at all these foot prints, it was definitely more than one person.

274
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,980
I got it.

275
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,400
Yan Dan was trying to tell me that it wasn't an accident that the Lingxiao Sect seized her.

276
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,700
Instead, they seized her because of Tang Zhou.

277
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,200
All right. I know what's happening now.

278
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,080
The Lingxiao Sect is too outrageous.

279
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,860
We cannot sit by and do nothing.

280
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:24,300
Forget discussing things, it's more important to go to the Lingxiao Sect immediately to rescue them.

281
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,080
True, we can't wait anymore.

282
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,060
But I'll go by myself.

283
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,220
You two should go back first.

284
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,760
Demon catchers from Lingxiao Sect are everywhere.

285
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,780
I'm afraid something will happen.

286
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,760
Demons in the mountain need you two right now.

287
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,970
   

288
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,700
Senior brother.

289
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,880
I don't need your help.

290
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,020
The Sect Leader summoned the disciples to capture Yan Dan.

291
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,240
What did they do to her?

292
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,820
They found out her identity.

293
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,500
Senior Brother. You knew this all along.

294
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,700
Senior Brother. Why are you such a fool?

295
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,300
Although Yan Dan is a demon, after all is said and done, she saved my life in the past.

296
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,700
I can't bear to see her die in front of me.

297
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,250
   

298
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,420
Is this how the Lingxiao Sect treats their guests?

299
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,700
The this the only outcome when an evil being enters the Lingxiao Sect.

300
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:12,120
Little flower demon, you've got some tricks, managed to hide your demonic aura and deceive my disciples.

301
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,900
The mastermind behind the incident at Demon Suppression Hall must have been you, right?

302
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,960
I thought Tang Zhou wanted to see me.

303
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,920
You wanted me to come here to meet Tang Zhou.

304
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,400
Where is he?

305
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,260
You'll never see him again.

306
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,800
Had you been human, dealing with you would've taken longer.

307
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,400
Since you're a demon, that makes it easier then.

308
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:42,000
The demon execution mirror formation will devour you like an ant and crush your primordial spirit into ash.

309
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,070
This is the cost you have to pay for seducing the future sect leader of the Lingxiao Sect.

310
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:08,400
Although I'm a demon, I've never committed an evil deed or seduced anyone.

311
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,220
And I have absolutely nothing to do with Tang Zhou!

312
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,500
Is the Lingxiao Sect going to kill me indiscriminately?

313
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,620
Do you actually cultivate a bloodthirsty practice instead?!

314
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:27,190
You're indeed a powerful demon, no wonder you dare to utter nonsense here.

315
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,500
However, it ends here.

316
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,300
The practice of Taoism should be clean and pure.

317
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,400
Why does your power contain an intense heinous aura?

318
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,000
Were those missing demons captured by you?

319
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,000
Unbelievable! The sect leader of Lingxiao Sect secretly practices evil skills!

320
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,380
What's the difference between you and those malicious demons you mentioned!

321
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,760
How dare you spout nonsense when you're about to meet your end!

322
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
Stop trying to bewitch people!

323
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,900
All disciples, listen to my orders! Eliminate this demon!

324
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,480
Who released him?

325
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,960
Sect Leader. This has nothing to do with Yan Dan.

326
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,440
Please don't kill her!

327
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,880
Tang Zhou. Do you remember why we established the Lingxiao Sect in the first place?

328
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,540
To wipe out all demons, uphold justice and punish evil.

329
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:02,110
You've practiced Taoism since you were little, and you're always prudent and conscientious.

330
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,460
You were the role model for all the disciples.

331
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,400
However, because you were bewitched by her you've done such ridiculous things!

332
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,600
You keep a demon by your side and let her deceive your sect!

333
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,100
Have you forgotten how your master, Tang Jiang, died?

334
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,040
He trusted a fox demon who used him to steal the secret scripture

335
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,060
and then killed his entire family!

336
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:32,180
Sect Leader. There are good and evil amongst humans, it is the same with demons.

337
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,900
Yan Dan has a kind soul!

338
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,060
Don't make excuses for her!

339
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,400
She used you to harm the sect by setting free the demons in the Demon Suppression Hall.

340
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,590
She's just as malicious as that fox demon.

341
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:52,020
Are the grievous lessons from sacrificing the lives of one family not enough to wake you up?

342
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,300
Today, this demon... must be killed!

343
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,700
Since you're here, I'll give you a chance to turn over a new leaf.

344
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,000
Kill her with your own hands and I'll let bygones be bygones!

345
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,240
You can still be the next sect leader!

346
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,700
However, if you're unrepentant over your mistakes, I will take her life myself!

347
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,160
Make your choice.

348
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,760
Your silence has answered me.

349
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,360
I'll do it!

350
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,760
 Sure enough. 

351
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,120
 Be it Ying Yuan or Tang Zhou, you still insist on choosing responsibility and righteousness. 

352
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,000
 As for me, I'm always the one you abandon. 

353
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:51,580
 This time, Ying Yuan, I won't let you hurt me again. 

354
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,000
 Yan Dan. I've decided to give up the position of Sect Leader of Lingxiao Sect. 

355
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,600
♫   The most beautiful destiny is hidden in the dark night, "love" is the word for everything   ♫

356
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,500
 For your sake, I can give up on becoming an immortal. 

357
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,800
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

358
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:54,160
♫   I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust   ♫

359
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,660
 I want to ask you this. 

360
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,000
 As an emperor, 

361
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,600
 you've seen the ups and downs of the Three Realms for tens of thousands of years, seen eons. 

362
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,700
 In your heart, 

363
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:15,300
 was there really no one or nothing that moved your heart 

364
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,600
 that made you want to free yourself from the shackles of the Heavenly Rules? 

365
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,400
 Whether it was in Yanxu Heavenly Palace, or in the cottage in the Land Under the Horizon, 

366
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:31,000
 no matter the time, the location, or the nature of your feelings, 

367
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,240
 did you ever have me in your heart? 

368
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,100
 My heart is devoted to all beings. 

369
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,300
 There is no room for anything else. 

370
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:49,300
 I didn't fall for you in the past and I will never fall for you in the future. 

371
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,000
Taoist Master Tang,

372
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,200
I told you a long time ago not to promise what you can't deliver.

373
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,600
♫  my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable   ♫

374
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,600
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

375
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:19,600
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫

376
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,300
I thought this magical bracelet could constrain me.

377
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:23,000
It turns out that the bracelet breaks when I'm overwhelmed with affection.

378
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,200
I told you no matter what choice you made, my heart would never change.

379
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,100
Sect Leader. My apologies. But I can't let you hurt her.

380
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,800
Tang Zhou. Why do you continue to make mistake after mistake?

381
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,500
Do you really want to go against your master and destroy the whole sect?

382
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,200
I was an orphan adopted by my master

383
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,600
and raised in the Lingxiao Sect.

384
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,200
There's not one day where I dare to forget his kindness,

385
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,000
but I have no choice but to disobey the teachings today.

386
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,100
I know I have let the sect down.

387
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,400
I'm willing to drain off all my cultivation base and be expelled from the sect.

388
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:21,100
Sect Leader, please consider our past and allow me to leave with Yan Dan.

389
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,400
A cultivation base is the foundation of all skills.

390
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,500
Are you really willing to go to this extent for her?

391
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,100
Tang Zhou!

392
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,400
Are you out of your mind? Why did you do that?

393
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,200
Don't worry.

394
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:07,200
It's just that I can't bully you from now on anymore.

395
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,400
Rebellious disciple. Such a rebellious disciple!

396
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Tang Jiang shouldn't have taken you in back then and I've misjudged you for so many years!

397
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,800
My cultivation base was given by my master and the sect

398
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,600
and now it's all gone.

399
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,800
Lingxiao Sect... no longer has a disciple named Tang Zhou.

400
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,400
You can leave.

401
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,400
But I never agreed to let you take her away.

402
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,400
Lingxiao Sect never releases any demons!

403
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,400
I'll get you out of here.

404
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,300
You're all my peers.

405
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,600
Even if I still had my cultivation base, I wouldn't fight you.

406
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,900
If you want to kill me, then go ahead and come.

407
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,800
However, today,

408
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,900
no matter what, I will take her with me.

409
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,900
Stop it!

410
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,600
We've all grown up together since we were young.

411
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,400
Amongst you, is there anyone who has never received kindness from Senior Tang?

412
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,700
To us, he's our family!

413
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,700
Can you really bear to see him die?

414
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,400
Yu Mo!

415
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,200
I'm taking them.

416
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,400
However, Lingxiao Sect isn't rightful or righteous, I'll visit you again another day.

417
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,000
You will be fine soon.

418
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
Your celestial vest is practically gone.

419
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,200
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

420
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,100
You even drained off your cultivation base to save me.

421
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,600
Now that your cultivation base is gone, your body is really weak.

422
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,800
You'll regret this decision.

423
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,900
I only did what I had to do.

424
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,000
You don't need to feel bad.

425
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,000
Hurry and consume the flower petal I gave you before.

426
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It can help ease your pain.

427
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,400
What?

428
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,800
Did you already use that flower petal?

429
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:56,800
That flower petal is the last thing you gave me.

430
