 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,500
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai advises people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,820
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,070
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,120
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,000
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,920
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,320
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,800
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,580
   

15
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,950
   

16
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,480
In this lie, we deceived everyone else,

17
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,140
but we never deceived each other.

18
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,120
Our feelings... from the beginning until the end...

19
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,640
have been real.

20
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,720
You have true feelings for him...

21
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,660
What about you and me?

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,620
We loved each other for more than a thousand years.

23
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,420
Was it all an act?

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,480
Sister Tao! Stop being so foolish!

25
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,460
He did all this to achieve his ambitions by taking advantage of you!

26
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,460
Back then, you volunteered to sacrifice your life for me.

27
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,560
Today, that dilemma has come back again.

28
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,460
Xiao Qi... I'm the one who failed you.

29
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,780
 The Devil King, Xuan Xiang, is indifferent to fame and wealth. 

30
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,000
 It's hard to change his mind with external interests. 

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,760
 Only by tempting him with love can we have this glimmer of hope. 

32
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,360
 Since the elders of the Devil Realm have long been dissatisfied with the Devil King, Xuan Xiang, 

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,880
 it can increase their resentment if we work with Elder Shuo Hua. 

34
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,860
 Xiao Qi. You've sacrificed so much for my great cause. 

35
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,900
 Have you ever blamed me? 

36
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,600
 It's our great cause. 

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,020
 I've had enough of the rules and regulations of the Nine Heavens. 

38
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,220
 I only hope you can subvert the Six Realms and change the order of things. 

39
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,940
 Having already spent a millennium with you 

40
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,580
 I can already die without regrets. 

41
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,300
 Okay. 

42
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,100
 As long as the Divine-Devil War is provoked, 

43
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,400
 I'll definitely protect you and make sure you can leave safely. 

44
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,580
 One day, I'll hold your hand 

45
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,700
 and walk in the sunshine around the Jade Pool to let everyone know that you're mine. 

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,180
 During the last 900 years... 

47
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,120
 did you get what you wanted? 

48
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:00,460
 Although I succeeded, the years have been long and the loneliness unbearable. 

49
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,580
 That love... 

50
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
 and that face... 

51
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,060
 never appeared again. 

52
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,120
 Now that you're back. I have no more regrets. 

53
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,620
 Xiao Qi. Never leave me. 

54
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,860
Huan Qin...

55
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,180
From the very beginning, I knew you loved power more than me.

56
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,500
No!

57
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,900
Zi Qi!

58
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,780
Zi Qi...

59
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
You don't have to love me...

60
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,080
You can deceive me...

61
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,780
But why do you have to die in front of me again?!

62
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,600
I won't let you die!

63
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,360
Xuan Xiang!

64
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,540
Xiao Qi.

65
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,720
Huan Qin... Huan Qin...

66
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,700
Huan Qin...

67
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,640
Huan Qin...

68
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,240
As long as in your heart...

69
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,240
I really existed and had a place before...

70
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
then even if I die...

71
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,540
I would be willing...

72
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,020
Huan Qin...

73
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,380
You don't know...

74
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,540
how much I love you.

75
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,140
Ziqi!

76
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,080
Ziqi.

77
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:01,620
I want all of you... to die with Xiao Qi!

78
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,080
Watch out!

79
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,720
Yu Mo!

80
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,600
Are you all right?

81
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I have the peace and safety amulet you gave me. Of course, I'm all right. Don't worry!

82
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
You must be careful!

83
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,560
Be careful!

84
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,520
You haven't mastered Eternal Darkness yet. But you want to use it against me?

85
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,040
You're out of your depth.

86
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,080
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm fine.

87
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,160
The Dragon Pool Blade is for the martyrs who died in vain!

88
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,220
- Yu Mo!
- Yu Mo!

89
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,400
How dare you sneak up on me!

90
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,480
To deal with a despicable person like you, of course, we have to use methods like that!

91
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,820
I've known you for ten thousand years, but never really understood you.

92
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,400
Our friendship, from now on, will no longer exist just like that arm of yours!

93
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,440
Your life and mine shouldn't have existed side by side a long time ago.

94
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,620
I've... long wanted to return this arm to you.

95
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,620
Even without the Three Divine Tools, you're still no match for me.

96
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,960
Huan Qin absorbed the complete immortal spirits of the four Greater Gods.

97
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,200
With his years of cultivation,

98
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,730
if he can continue to seize demonic power from the Illusion of Devils, we can't kill him at all.

99
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,320
Only by cutting off the source... can there be a ray of hope.

100
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,760
What are you doing?

101
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,560
- Liu Weiyang.
- Liu Weiyang, what are you going to do?

102
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,680
- Liu Weiyang!
- Liu Weiyang!

103
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,800
Liu Weiyang!

104
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,140
- Liu Weiyang! 
 - Liu Weiyang!

105
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,280
Ziqi.

106
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,520
Even if the past was all a lie, meeting you

107
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,760
was still the best memory in my miserable life.

108
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,140
Liu Weiyang!

109
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,920
Hurry, we have to go!

110
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,820
The heavenly region where Jade Pool is located is about to collapse!

111
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,740
Protect the immortals!

112
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,260
Yan Dan!

113
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,680
I've been wronged!

114
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,400
- Stop the nonsense! Move! 
 - I want to see His Supreme Majesty!

115
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,560
- Let go of me!
- Hurry up!

116
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,280
I've been wronged!

117
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,560
Let go of me!

118
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,300
Let me see His Supreme Majesty!

119
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,780
I've been wronged! 
    

120
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,760
Huan Qin's spies and accomplices in the Nine Heavens have all been captured.

121
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,900
Those who fled from the Heaven Realm are now known to all the Earthly Immortals in the Mortal Realm.

122
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,520
Yu Mo, the head of the Demon Clan, and the Dragon Queen of the Four Seas have issued an ultimatum.

123
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,920
They're in full pursuit.

124
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,740
Those who disobey will be beheaded.

125
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,700
Now, the Three Realms suffered this great calamity.

126
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,400
More than half of the immortals in the Heaven Realm are dead or wounded.

127
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,183
Many places in the Heavenly Palace and the immortal pavilions were ransacked by rebels.

128
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:06,760
There is serious damage.

129
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,000
The fake Heavenly Emperor fled. He'll definitely make a comeback someday.

130
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,930
The Heaven Realm is in chaos and extremely low spirits.

131
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,420
You're the only Greater God left in the Nine Heavens.

132
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:22,180
I sincerely ask Your Majesty to take over the position of the Heavenly Emperor.

133
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,390
Please preside over the overall situation, bring order to the chaos, and revive our morale.

134
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,700
Your Supreme Majesty. Please accept this act of respect.

135
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:40,760
 Please preside over the overall situation, Your Supreme Majesty! 

136
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,880
There's a lot to be done in the Heaven Realm.

137
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,180
I would like to temporarily manage the Heaven Realm's affairs on behalf of the Heavenly Emperor.

138
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:56,770
After Huan Qin is arrested, the dead are comforted, and the Three Realms return to peace, I will leave.

139
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,600
I've made up my mind.

140
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,420
There's no need to try and persuade me otherwise.

141
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,040
You all may rise.

142
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,660
The Head of Heavenly Soldiers, Star Deity Tai You, is dead.

143
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,360
Kill the insiders and accomplices immediately.

144
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,680
Punish the unknowing ones with nine strikes of thunder and demote them to mortals.

145
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,260
If any of the innocent immortals with ranks were involved, remove their ranks and have them cultivate again.

146
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,360
If they have no immortal rank,

147
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,640
half of their cultivation base will be taken away.

148
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,860
Si Mu. You're the last descendant of the Three-Winged Raven Clan.

149
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,690
After the punishment of fire at the Heavenly Gallows,

150
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,640
your immortal spirit will be broken, and your immortal memory will be removed.

151
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,600
You'll return to bird form.

152
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,120
You've been trapped by hatred for ten thousand years. That's too long.

153
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,420
From then on, you'll be a happy and free bird.

154
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,600
Just forget the past.

155
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,340
The late Heavenly Emperor never loosened his control over you.

156
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,100
He was even stricter with you than with anyone else.

157
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,080
You clearly love Yan Dan so much.

158
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,840
But His Supreme Majesty forced you to give up your love and be someone without emotions!

159
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,740
Didn't you ever hate His Supreme Majesty?

160
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:24,566
If the late Heavenly Emperor had been half as merciful as you,

161
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:28,145
our Three-Winged Raven Clan wouldn't have been eliminated by the heavenly punishment during the War of Genesis.

162
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:30,820
What happened today wouldn't have happened!

163
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,180
All the tragedies were caused by the late Heavenly Emperor!

164
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,460
At the beginning of genesis, evil deeds were everywhere.

165
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,160
Only the harsher Heavenly Rules and laws could punish evil and promote good.

166
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,480
The late Heavenly Emperor did so to avoid more disputes and casualties.

167
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,920
His Supreme Majesty never abandoned public affairs for personal reasons.

168
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,460
You have no right to judge His Supreme Majesty's merits and reputation.

169
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,260
Huan Qin created chaos. It brought disaster to all beings.

170
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,100
All these brave spirits sacrificed their lives to help.

171
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,160
There is endless sorrow. Even mountains and rivers share sorrow.

172
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,960
Insurmountable grief is felt by all here at the memorial ceremony.

173
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,420
Fairy Zhi Xi shall receive the treatment of a greater god and be buried in the Divine Cemetery Forest.

174
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,740
May her acquaintances and family pray together.

175
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,820
The sun and the moon both witnessed her loyalty and sincerity.

176
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,620
May her spirit rest in peace.

177
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,040
We're are devastated by her passing.

178
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,780
The Nine Fins Clan was brave and sincere.

179
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,620
The remains of the Nine Fins Clan have been moved to the imperial tomb of the Dragon King.

180
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,000
Their ancestral hall shall be restored. The Heavenly Annals about them shall be rewritten.

181
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,760
The Deity Clan and the Aquatic Clan will hereby pay respects

182
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,480
to the deceased together so as to appease their souls.

183
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,520
The Nine Fins are dead, but their will shall live on.

184
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,940
They sacrificed their lives but did not regret it.

185
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,360
A white jade hero's tomb has been set up.

186
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,280
The names of martyrs have been engraved on them to set an example for their descendants.

187
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,840
Their benevolence will forever be remembered.

188
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,350
   

189
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,600
 Zhi Xi. What is this? It's so beautiful. 

190
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,200
 After the ceremony, I saw some uncollected starry dust. 

191
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,100
 I collected them in a bottle and secretly brought them to you. 

192
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,000
 Zhi Xi, you spoil me. 

193
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,300
 You're my sister. 

194
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,000
 If not you, who else should I spoil? 

195
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,600
 I've collected all the stars. 

196
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,000
 Your punishment is, from now on, 

197
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,300
 only death will do us part. 

198
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,300
 Sister. 

199
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,600
Don't worry.

200
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,100
I'll be fine.

201
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,820
   

202
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,000
Your Supreme Majesty. What's wrong?

203
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,200
Do you need me to call the heavenly physician?

204
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,400
It's all right.

205
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,000
Your Supreme Majesty. It consumed so much of your blood to save the immortals with broken immortal spirits.

206
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
How can your body endure it?

207
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You also lost your immortal spirit.

208
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,200
No matter how strong your immortal power is, you can't stand losing so much power.

209
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,100
Now that the spiritual blood is enough, please take care of yourself, Your Supreme Majesty.

210
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,400
I know how many people were injured.

211
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,300
There's no need to say more.

212
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,500
Send these spiritual needles to the Heavenly Infirmary immediately.

213
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,700
Ask the heavenly physicians to use them as soon as possible.

214
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

215
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,800
 He will have to give it his all to fulfill his duties throughout his life. 

216
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,000
 Ying Yuan once thought that the position of Emperor was a shackle. 

217
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,400
 He tried to get rid of it. But he still had no choice. 

218
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,800
 Now as His Supreme Majesty, his responsibilities are even greater. 

219
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,600
 He might not be able to lift it until he dies. 

220
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,900
I've been gaining experience all these years.

221
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,000
Your sneak attack failed.

222
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,700
Why is this so similar to the one you used to draw a turtle on my face with in the Mortal Realm?

223
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,500
How did you...

224
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,400
You vile man! You're always plotting against me.

225
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,600
That's because you always sneakily peek at others.

226
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,600
It's just an ordinary brush, isn't it?

227
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,200
What? Are you afraid I'll steal it?

228
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,800
If you're in a bad mood, then this brush will end up as ash like the agarwood hairpin.

229
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,200
What would I do then?

230
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,000
A vile person just loves to hold grudges.

231
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,900
So do you.

232
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:14,000
Actually, when I saw that Liu Weiyang didn't want to wake up from his mistakes even when he was dying,

233
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,800
I was glad I had already let things go.

234
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:23,700
When you were still Tang Zhou, the moment you disobeyed your sect for me, I had already forgiven you.

235
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,800
The one you had forgiven was the mortal Tang Zhou, not Emperor Ying Yuan.

236
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,000
You're now the head of the Heaven Realm.

237
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
How could I dare not forgive Your Supreme Majesty?

238
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,700
Just now, you've worked your heart out to save the others.

239
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,400
I wouldn't dare make you angry again.

240
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,800
What if anything were to happen to you?

241
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,000
I wouldn't be able to bear that responsibility.

242
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,600
I'd rather you be angry with me and blame me.

243
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,200
That at least means... you haven't let me go yet.

244
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,300
It's getting late.

245
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,800
Go to bed early so you can keep working your heart out.

246
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,300
I'm leaving, Your Supreme Majesty.

247
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,600
I knew you'd turn around.

248
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,200
You...

249
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,100
You didn't even notice that ink splashed onto your mouth.

250
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,600
After all these years, you still haven't improved.

251
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,700
Come. Let me wipe it for you.

252
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,600
It was rebuilt already?

253
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,000
That was too easy, wasn't it?

254
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,700
I just put the pieces of the heavenly region together with Chumo's Power of Rebirth.

255
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,200
These absorbed the immortal power of the Nine Heavens.

256
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,700
As time goes by, the spinal foundation of the heavenly region

257
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,000
can be transformed from something virtual to real.

258
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,300
Only in this way can the foundation be stable.

259
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
I see.

260
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,000
That could take hundreds or even thousands of years after it is built.

261
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I don't know if I'll be able to still see it at that time.

262
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,700
Although later, I'll also be leaving the Nine Heavens,

263
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,700
but when Jade Pool is rebuilt...

264
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,200
can I take you to revisit it, all right?

265
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,200
When that time comes, we still don't know what will happen.

266
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,700
Let's talk about it later.

267
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,800
Why are there flames over there?

268
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Let's go and take a look.

269
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,000
I didn't expect that the mortal's sky lanterns

270
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,300
would fly to the horizon between the Heaven Realm and the Mortal Realm.

271
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,300
Look. Everyone made so many wishes on the sky lanterns.

272
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,800
Shall we help these mortals realize some of their wishes?

273
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,000
Choose some.

274
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,000
Okay. Let me have a look.

275
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,200
Did you choose one?

276
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
Not a single one.

277
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,100
You've always been carefree.

278
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,000
How come you're sighing now?

279
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,400
It suddenly occurred to me that Sister Tao was sincere to Huan Qin.

280
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,500
But Huan Qin let her be by Liu Weiyang's side.

281
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,600
The emotional entanglement among the three of them

282
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,400
would be an incredible part of a Diary of the Mortal World.

283
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,700
The readers would find it interesting, but the actors would be heartbroken.

284
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,400
Then look at the wishes written by these mortals.

285
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,500
Most men wish to get top marks in the imperial examinations and have a brilliant career as an official.

286
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,700
But the women... all wish to win a man's heart,

287
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,100
have unwavering love, and hope their children can be safe and healthy.

288
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,400
Maybe it really is that difficult.

289
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,400
Those who truly live stable lives will live all their lives happily.

290
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,700
There's no need to make wishes on the sky lanterns or in general.

291
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,300
Don't think too much.

292
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:44,700
Just think what Lin Lang would do if Zi Lin did something wrong one day.

293
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,000
She'd probably remove his tortoise shell and chop off his tortoise feet to make soup.

294
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,920
Yan Dan.

295
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,560
There will always people who won't be let down.

296
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,880
Their love will last forever.

297
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:11,400
♫   I blame time for the mortal world's woe is on your shoulder   ♫

298
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:18,570
♫   Like the surging tides of stars, I continuously ask where the origin of love comes from  ♫
  

299
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,520
Then help me realize those two wishes first.

300
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,450
♫   In my momentary childishness,   ♫

301
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,380
Do you have a special sense of achievement in helping mortals realize their wishes?

302
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,000
When it comes to mortals' wishes, they have you, an immortal, to make them come true.

303
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,560
But who can help us realize our wishes then?

304
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,080
Of course, an immortal's wish must be realized by themselves.

305
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,020
But Yan Dan... only you...

306
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,460
can help me realize my wish.

307
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:10,420
♫   Understand the wind, think about the rain, and do not awaken from the dream   ♫

308
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:20,050
♫   Just let me linger all day and night   ♫

309
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
 His feelings towards me are sincere. 

310
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,800
 He's not taking advantage of me. 

311
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,080
 Uncoupling Cord. 

312
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,600
 How dare you break into my bedroom? 

313
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,220
 You're getting bolder and bolder. 

314
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,500
 Si Xuan. Qing Yun. Si Mu. 

315
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,800
 You have your spies around the most important immortals in the Nine Heavens. 

316
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,640
 You also fully control important pavilions like Tianji Pavilion and Magical Pavilion. 

317
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,580
 When it comes to being bold, you have me beat. 

318
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,960
 Come here. 

319
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,500
 You must have guessed already what I was planning. 

320
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,440
 You're not afraid to die? 

321
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,440
 We broke the abstinence of love together. 

322
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,980
 Why should I be afraid? 

323
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,400
 All right. 

324
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,840
 In this case, I'll change the Heavenly Rules and redefine the order of the Six Realms for you. 

325
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,960
 Since we've chosen to make mistakes, why don't... we make bigger mistakes? 

326
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:37,460
 The sea of love is boundless. 

327
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,560
 There is no hope, my love for you will never change. 

328
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,500
Years passed.

329
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,680
Only you fell in love with me.

330
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:02,260
When you died the first time, because of my ambition I didn't feel remorse.

331
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,400
This time...

332
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,440
I regret it.

333
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,820
Xiao Qi... don't worry.

334
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,240
I will definitely get revenge for you.

335
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,580
Supreme Golden Cicada inside and outside the Three Realms.

336
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,260
A body bearing the golden light. Taking in all kinds of spirits.

337
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,220
Break it down!

338
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:24,500
One day, I will kill all of you!

339
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,540
The Heaven Realm still belongs to us!

340
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,120
Huan Qin faced backlash from the Eye of Infinite Devils,

341
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,000
but when he recovers his immortal power, he'll make a comeback.

342
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,440
This person is treacherous. Please make a final decision as soon as possible, Your Supreme Majesty.

343
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,820
We must eliminate them thoroughly.

344
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,140
The immortal powers of the Earth Immortals are weak.

345
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,340
Even if Huan Qin is found, they may not be a match for him.

346
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,480
Emperor Ying Yuan, please let me lead the heavenly soldiers to the Mortal Realm to search for him.

347
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,280
I swear I won't return until I find him!

348
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,720
Take it easy, Marshal.

349
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,040
The Three Realms are vast, plus Huan Qin can change his face.

350
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,780
Searching for him is more difficult than looking for a needle in a haystack.

351
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,320
I was thinking, what if we set a trap for him, making him come to us voluntarily?

352
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,620
It's not difficult to set up a trap.

353
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,620
It's just that right now, Huan Qin's cultivation base is unfathomable.

354
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,220
No one in this world can fight him easily.

355
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,920
Unless the Four Emperors fight together, there won't be a chance of winning.

356
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,820
Unfortunately, the current situation is really unfavorable for us.

357
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,320
His Supreme Majesty's immortal spirit was seriously injured. The immortal power was destroyed.

358
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,960
And the Ground Block disappeared as well.

359
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,700
It would be better to risk it, despite the injuries and fight it out.

360
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,180
Once we find the Three Divine Tools, you'll be able to rebuild your immortal spirit.

361
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,900
Why don't we use a two-pronged approach?

362
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,140
His Supreme Majesty is benevolent. You weren't executed.

363
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,760
I hope you can remember the kindness of His Supreme Majesty when you descend from the Heaven Realm,

364
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,300
whether you're demoted to work in Night Forgetting River,

365
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,840
punished to be mortals or demons in the Mortal Realm. Repent and do good deeds.

366
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,940
It's spread all over the Nine Heavens already. In five days,

367
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,120
His Supreme Majesty wants to cast a spell to retrieve the Three Divine Tools to fight against Huan Qin.

368
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,380
You've been following His Supreme Majesty this entire time. Is it true?

369
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,060
It's true.

370
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,920
Now that Huan Qin lost the Eye of Infinite Devils. It's a desperate fight.

371
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,820
His Supreme Majesty will allow him to rest for a few days.

372
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:48,840
The day when His Supreme Majesty regains his immortal spirit is when Huan Qin will be eliminated.

373
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:31,980
