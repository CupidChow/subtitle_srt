 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,539
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,959
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:39,070
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,479
♫   True love can only enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,179
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams   ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths   ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,999
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:11,269
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:15,339
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:21,400
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,880
   

15
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,099
   

16
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:34,910
   

17
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,510
I'll put it here.

18
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,899
The Jade Pool Festival was a grand event.

19
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,019
I couldn't attend because I was on duty.

20
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:00,500
But you shined and achieved the goal you were hoping for.

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,299
Why aren't you celebrating, and returning books here instead?

22
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,999
The Pavilion of Books won't close down anytime soon.

23
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:09,380
Also, why did you come back alone?

24
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,540
Where are Yu Mo and Zhi Xi?

25
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,919
Didn't your backer, Emperor Ying Yuan, promise...

26
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,259
None of them came. It was just me.

27
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:18,700
I've returned the books, so I'll leave now.

28
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,159
Little Tortoise! Take it easy.

29
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,019
Yu Mo hasn't arrived yet. Let's wait a little longer.

30
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,759
Who's there?

31
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,600
How dare you break into Yanxu Heavenly Palace at night?

32
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,220
Who are you?

33
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,439
Who are you looking for?

34
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:47,359
I'm usually dutiful! I help the poor and those in need!

35
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,959
I've never done anything to harm anyone!

36
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,520
Have you mistaken me for someone else?

37
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,640
No.

38
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,300
You are the one I'm looking for.

39
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,260
I became like this... because you cursed me.

40
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,339
I've always treated you well.

41
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:12,000
I didn't expect you to be so ungrateful!

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,070
Now...

43
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,370
I want you to pay for what you did!

44
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,020
Ghost!

45
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,579
Which palace's immortal attendant are you?

46
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:30,520
How did you fall from up there?

47
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,439
This is Treasure Pavilion.

48
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,239
If the gift box hadn't been carried away, and the soldiers who guarded it hadn't withdrawn,

49
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:39,259
I'd suspect you of stealing artifacts. Leave now!

50
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,879
No, no. Brother Heavenly Solider.

51
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,500
You misunderstood. Misunderstood.

52
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,280
I'm just a low-ranking immortal attendant.

53
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,259
Did you see anyone else tonight?

54
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,499
Was there someone with hair like this? A man?

55
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,820
Who?

56
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,919
- Did you have an accomplice to commit theft with? 
 - No, not at all!

57
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,639
Shall I take you to the Heavenly Prison to search?

58
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,079
There's no need! I'll leave.

59
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,340
I won't bother you on your night duty.

60
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,320
Why did Yu Mo stand me up again?

61
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,240
 Is the Sacred Temple that effective? 

62
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,860
 Did I really hurt Emperor Ying Yuan? 

63
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,940
Little Tortoise, the reward for the Dragon King has already been carried away.

64
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,839
But don't worry. I'll find another way to get you out of here.

65
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,920
 Hopefully, I can make it. 

66
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,739
Yu Mo. Why are you so late?

67
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:43,960
The play is already over.

68
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,240
As long as the lantern is still on, the play isn't over.

69
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,739
 The Divine-Devil War is already over. 

70
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:49,620
 Are there still some spies left? 

71
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,080
Who are you?

72
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,760
Don't come over here.

73
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,439
This is a forbidden area. Leave quickly.

74
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,920
Do not spread what you've seen here today.

75
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,910
Your Majesty...

76
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,260
I'm an immortal attendant from the Pavilion of Artifacts.

77
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,790
I didn't mean to intrude and bother you today.

78
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,680
Don't worry. My lips are sealed tight.

79
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,840
I won't let this matter get out.

80
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,139
The sacred tree is dangerous. Let me save Your Majesty first.

81
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:23,740
You don't have to.

82
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,740
I am just a sinner.

83
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,600
I am no longer an Emperor.

84
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,720
I am responsible for the Divine-Devil War.

85
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,560
Now... I've already been infected with the Fire of Lost Rationality.

86
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,520
There's no cure for it.

87
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,299
I'm willing to constrain myself here.

88
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:47,620
You can save your breath.

89
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,880
Why would you think this?

90
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,180
Everyone is grateful for Your Majesty's contribution to the Heavenly Realm.

91
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,659
His Supreme Majesty even praised Your Majesty for being righteous at the Jade Pool Festival.

92
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,400
Did you attend the Jade Pool Festival?

93
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,480
Then did you see the play,

94
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,120
"The Tale of The Genesis Hero"?

95
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,140
I heard earlier that a bold immortal attendant...

96
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,520
wanted to re-enact the War of Genesis to ask for a favor from His Supreme Majesty.

97
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,740
How was her play?

98
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,120
Did she realize her wish?

99
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,500
The play was a great success.

100
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,980
It received a standing ovation.

101
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,940
All the celestial deities appreciated it very much.

102
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:01,320
If Your Majesty was present, I'm sure you would've liked it.

103
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,740
Good.

104
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,740
It's good that she realized her wish.

105
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,870
The way...

106
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,160
I look now will only sadden the people.

107
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,940
I have no more regrets this way.

108
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,200
You may leave now.

109
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,400
I know I have disrupted Your Majesty's cultivation.

110
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,600
I should make up for it.

111
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,200
It seems Your Majesty would've liked the play very much. You must be curious.

112
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,300
I have a very good memory.

113
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,400
Let me tell Your Majesty about it.

114
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,600
This play was so lively.

115
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,200
Your Majesty might be less depressed after hearing about it.

116
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,300
If that will give you peace of mind... do as you like.

117
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,800
- Lu Ming. 
 - You're finally here!

118
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
Hurry, tell me what happened at the festival.

119
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,100
It was the first time I saw Yan Dan so dejected!

120
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,200
Where's Yan Dan?

121
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,400
She left after returning a book.

122
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,000
She didn't say anything when I asked her.

123
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We promised to release the divine tortoise together.

124
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But I didn't see her after waiting for such a long time.

125
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,400
There's still time.

126
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,300
I'll go look for her.

127
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,400
Fortunately, it's not too late.

128
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,900
Emperor Ying Yuan, this scene is over now.

129
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,100
Let me play the next scene for Your Majesty.

130
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,200
 Emperor Ying Yuan? 

131
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,400
They're the genesis heroes of the Six Realms.

132
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,000
These heroes don't care whether they're remembered or not.

133
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This new world is a monument they have established.

134
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,900
The rain in the Mortal Realm is the ancient gods' mourning and gratitude for these heroes.

135
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,200
Is Immortal Lord Bei Ming, whom you mentioned

136
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,400
at the end of the play, also dead?

137
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,000
During the Divine-Devil War, the Devils made a surprise attack.

138
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,200
His immortal spirit has dissipated.

139
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,500
He passed away before the Jade Pool Festival.

140
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,800
So that's why she added this scene.

141
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,700
You should leave now.

142
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,000
Don't come here and make trouble again.

143
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,400
Thank you for your good intentions today.

144
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,300
Your Majesty, I acted so well just now.

145
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,000
Doesn't Your Majesty have any thoughts after listening to it?

146
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,200
The opinion of a sinner isn't worth mentioning.

147
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,700
Since Your Majesty doesn't want to talk about it, I'd like to boldly comment on it.

148
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,900
In my opinion, the war was very brutal.

149
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:42,600
Winning or losing isn't the sin of an individual or a clan.

150
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,800
Your Majesty created this world.

151
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,600
Doesn't Your Majesty want to see the new world you've established?

152
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't you have any affection for it?

153
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:03,200
May I boldly ask Your Majesty to untie yourself from the sacred tree and return to the palace to calm everyone down?

154
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,600
There's no need.

155
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,800
No!

156
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,300
Don't you know what the Fire of Lost Rationality is?

157
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,200
Once the fire poison breaks out, it'll hurt others uncontrollably!

158
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,300
If you set me free, you won't be able to save me. You will also hurt yourself!

159
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,200
It'll bring chaos to the Three Realms!

160
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,700
Hurry up and leave!

161
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,100
How could that happen?

162
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,600
Your Majesty is the Emperor!

163
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,100
There are many excellent physicians in the Heavenly Infirmary.

164
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
They can definitely cure you!

165
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,800
I am no longer an Emperor!

166
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,200
Stop calling my name!

167
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,800
Leave!

168
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,740
Leave now!

169
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,700
I'll find a way. I'll find a way!

170
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,300
Go!

171
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,000
 All my comrades are dead. 

172
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,500
 I've committed an unforgivable crime. 

173
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,500
 Please help me end this miserable life. 

174
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,400
 I tried my best to turn into a human. 

175
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,500
 Now it seems it would've been better to stay a fish. 

176
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,900
 Then I'd be unconfined by joy and worry, and more carefree. 

177
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,500
Are my son and Zhao Lan having a good time here?

178
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,000
The heavenly aura of Xuanxin Cliff is extraordinary indeed.

179
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,600
You two will soon be transformed.

180
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,700
Ao Xuan, I'll teach you another set of Qi-gathering methods.

181
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,800
Practice it well with Zhao Lan. She's your future wife.

182
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:08,600
I hope you two will transform soon and become a much-told tale of our Dragon Clan.

183
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,100
   

184
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,800
 I also had this beautiful scene of a happy gathering once. 

185
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,800
 However, the best days have passed in the blink of an eye. 

186
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
 Master has died. 

187
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,200
 Everything has gone back to what it was. 

188
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,800
 I'm still just a lonely, little black fish. 

189
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:17,200
 Master. If you were still here, would everything be different? 

190
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
 Am I being too greedy? 

191
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:48,100
 I only found it an ordinary sight, watching you chatter and joke around me. 

192
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,900
 Now... seeing you treat others well like this... 

193
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,500
 Why does it make me feel so sad? 

194
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,940
   

195
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,400
   

196
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
   

197
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,200
  "Fire of Lost Rationality." 

198
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
 That vile Emperor had always been so majestic. 

199
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,600
 How did he end up suffering so miserably? 

200
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
   

201
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,700
All gods and lords, I was joking before.

202
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,600
I just wanted to teach him a lesson.

203
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,500
I didn't mean to harm him.

204
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,800
Please be merciful. Let bygones be bygones.

205
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,200
I'll make a new wish.

206
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,600
I hope Emperor Ying Yuan recovers from his injuries, regains his sight, and continues being the Emperor who awes the Three Realms.

207
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,300
My Pavilion of Books isn't some forbidden place.

208
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,500
Why do you only come after dark every time?

209
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,100
Stop looking.

210
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,700
Yan Dan isn't here.

211
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,800
I'm not looking for her.

212
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,600
- I'm here to– 
 - Come on.

213
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,200
As long as she's not here, it'll be like you're out of your mind.

214
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,800
The book says that it's called lovesickness.

215
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,400
"Lovesickness"?

216
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,800
What is "lovesickness"?

217
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,000
You asked the right person.

218
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,400
Lovesickness... is when you want to be with her all the time.

219
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,400
If she smiles, you're delighted.

220
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,000
If she cries, you feel anxious.

221
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,900
If she cries or laughs for others, you feel extremely miserable.

222
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,100
As the mortals say, "I may never have known what lovesickness was my entire life..."

223
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This poem once appeared in Yan Dan's play.

224
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,800
"I may never have known what lovesickness was my entire life."

225
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,900
"I just learned what it is, but I suffer from it already."

226
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,200
Yu Mo, are you going to get yourself killed?

227
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,700
Falling in love is an offense against the heavenly law!

228
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,500
Could it be that Yan Dan rejected you?

229
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,100
I stood her up. She also stood me up.

230
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,000
But she doesn't care whether I was there or not.

231
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,800
You make it sound so miserable.

232
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,500
Did you two quarrel?

233
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,400
I think it's a quarrel only when it involves two sides.

234
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,800
But these are all only my own thoughts.

235
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,300
Yan Dan doesn't know anything. Hey.

236
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,100
Promise me. You mustn't tell her about this.

237
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,800
Hei Tu!

238
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,840
Why didn't you attend the Jade Pool Festival?

239
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,720
I...

240
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,939
He did attend. He was just late.

241
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:14,319
You came late...

242
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,359
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

243
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,300
Then where did you go after the play?

244
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,600
I...

245
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,080
I can't say because I promised someone else.

246
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,299
And we promised to release the tortoise together.

247
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:31,259
I waited for you for a long time at Treasure Pavilion.

248
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:32,940
Why didn't you come?

249
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,500
I...

250
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,160
When the Dragon King of the East Sea taught his son Qi-collecting methods at Xuanxin Cliff last night,

251
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,619
I secretly learned it on the side.

252
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:47,930
I was so immersed in learning that I didn't notice the time.

253
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,440
Yan Dan, be the nobler person.

254
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,380
Please forgive me.

255
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,779
I'm a broad-minded person. I don't mind.

256
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:01,160
But what about Little Tortoise?

257
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,279
The Dragon King of the East Sea has an old illness.

258
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,119
Whenever he goes to the Heavenly Court, he'll brings along some divine medicine.

259
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,179
His immortal jar is full of divine medicine.

260
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:11,939
We can find a chance to put the tortoise into the immortal jar.

261
00:24:11,939 --> 00:24:14,099
Then he can take it down to the Mortal Realm.

262
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:15,919
Okay. Then it's settled.

263
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,119
We'll release Little Tortoise together tomorrow.

264
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:21,000
Remember to show up then.

265
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,479
You may continue chatting.

266
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:24,320
I have something else to take care of.

267
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,120
Why didn't you tell her the truth?

268
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:49,200
If I tell her, we might not even be friends anymore. Right?

269
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,700
Why don't you take any initiative at all?

270
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,320
"Soldiers who don't want to be generals aren't good soldiers."

271
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,100
"Friends who don't want to be husband and wife..."

272
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,080
What are you talking about?

273
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,020
Don't talk nonsense.

274
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,240
I just want to protect her my entire life.

275
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,240
I don't want my feelings to become trouble for her.

276
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,620
As long as she lives a happy life... I'll be content.

277
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,620
  "Fire of Lost Rationality. Most poisonous." 

278
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,799
 "One who's poisoned either dies or gets possessed." 

279
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,520
 "No cure." 

280
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,260
 His injury... really will kill him. 

281
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,779
 I obtained another unsolved GO game recently. 

282
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,099
 Your Highness, come see if you can solve it. 

283
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,700
 Ying Yuan. 

284
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,440
 The troops will be personally led by you. 

285
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,659
 The Divine Realm will return triumphantly. 

286
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:42,440
 I can rest assured. 

287
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,840
 Take care. 

288
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,520
Wait a little longer.

289
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,680
Soon... we can all be together.

290
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,120
 Emperor Ying Yuan. 

291
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,899
 Emperor Ying Yuan. Wake up. 

292
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,440
 Emperor Ying Yuan. 

293
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,440
Emperor Ying Yuan.

294
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,079
Emperor Ying Yuan.

295
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,620
Didn't I ask you not to come again?

296
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,699
I didn't want to.

297
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:07,400
But I had a nightmare last night.

298
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,280
I dreamed that you became a ghost to take my life.

299
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,659
I thought that if I didn't come here to solve this matter, I'd probably have nightmares for the rest of my life.

300
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,179
There are no ghosts in the Three Realms. Don't talk nonsense here.

301
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:21,300
Just because you haven't seen a ghost, does that mean there really are no ghosts?

302
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,380
Who should I turn to if you really become a ghost one day?

303
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,360
Did you have a good dream?

304
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,139
A dream... of your beloved girl?

305
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:39,140
What are you talking about—?

306
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,540
You...

307
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,019
This is osmanthus cake, freshly made by the Heavenly Kitchen.

308
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:46,980
It's delicious.

309
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,600
 Why does this immortal attendant have the fragrance of lotus? 

310
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,440
 Could she be Yan Dan? 

311
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,620
What's wrong? You don't like it?

312
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,779
Looks like the cook at the Heavenly Kitchen should be changed.

313
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:07,280
 Her tone and voice are all like Yan Dan. 

314
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,740
 It must be her. 

315
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,139
 But now that I'm in this situation, I can't ask to keep her. 

316
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:16,420
What exactly will it take for you to leave?

317
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:22,380
If you mess around like this again, and if I become a fierce ghost, your life is the first one I'll take.

318
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,960
Didn't you just say there weren't any ghosts in the Three Realms?

319
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,460
This talk of ghosts is just nonsense.

320
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,920
But it's all caused by anxiety.

321
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,500
You look so depressed.

322
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,760
It really worries me.

323
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,719
How about this? I'll bring a pillow to keep you company in the Land Under the Horizon. So I can feel at ease.

324
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:46,679
I bet I won't have nightmares then!

325
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,860
 She's as unruly as usual. 

326
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,400
 The poison could burst out at any time. How can I protect you? 

327
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,360
If you're really worried, I'll give you something.

328
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,160
Hold out your hand.

329
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,259
It's a Distance-Keeping lock I created.

330
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:09,440
When there's danger, it'll break.

331
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,620
Then you can feel at ease.

332
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:20,239
I know you gave me this bracelet because you might hurt me when the fire poison bursts out.

333
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:22,710
It's to stop you from approaching me, right?

334
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,159
But the bracelet can guard against people, not ghosts.

335
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,239
How can you be such a rascal?

336
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:31,960
Do you think I don't dare to hurt you?

337
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,159
Don't worry. You won't be able to hurt me.

338
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,539
I brought a dagger to protect myself.

339
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:38,320
If you dare approach me, I'll...

340
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,879
Anyway, I've made up my mind already.

341
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:46,919
I must take care of you, so I feel at ease.

342
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,500
Even if you were the Devil King Xuan Xiang, I'm not afraid.

343
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,700
Xuan Xiang.

344
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,380
Emperor Ying Yuan.

345
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,920
Emperor Ying Yuan!

346
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,520
Emperor Ying Yuan!

347
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,680
Emperor Ying Yuan!

348
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,700
Emperor Ying Yuan!

349
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,040
Leave!

350
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,419
No. I won't leave!

351
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:52,199
Hurry up! Go!

352
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:54,160
I'm not leaving!

353
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,800
Go!

354
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,600
Leave!

355
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,890
♫   A thousand rivers provide water, but one can be intoxicated in it   ♫

356
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:28,020
No. No.

357
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,859
♫   To distinguish between man, immortals, and demons, I'm not afraid to let go of my ego and fear   ♫

358
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:36,559
Emperor Ying Yuan.

359
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,699
♫   Even if one day, there is no return   ♫

360
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:39,979
How can I save you?

361
00:32:39,979 --> 00:32:42,319
♫   Bury my sincerity and allow me to sleep soundly alongside the world of mortals   ♫

362
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:45,420
What must I do to save you?

363
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:56,439
♫   Bones can be crushed, ashes can be scattered   ♫
♫   The wind becomes the monument for lovers   ♫

364
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,100
   

365
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,260
The Heavenly Infirmary is rich indeed.

366
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,180
A Centennial Spiritual Bug.

367
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,620
Millennial Dark Ice.

368
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,140
And a lingzhi mushroom as big as a basin.

369
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,080
 Should I take them all to Emperor Ying Yuan and let him try them? 

370
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,560
 If it can slow down the toxicity of the poison, that would be good too. 

371
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,780
Yan Dan.

372
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,059
Look. This must be the medicine jar the Heavenly Court gave the East Sea King.

373
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:43,700
That's great.

374
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,920
Little Tortoise, your wish is coming true.

375
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,280
No one will flip you over randomly when you get to the Mortal Realm.

376
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,479
We saved your life today. You have to remember us.

377
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,320
I'll miss you.

378
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,720
Come on.

379
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:16,479
It's written clearly in the medical book that the Fire of Lost Rationality can only be cured by the Four-Leaf Lotus' heart.

380
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:19,000
Why do we have to find another way?

381
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,319
All the lotus flowers in the Jade Pool have been picked clean.

382
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:22,839
We've already ground so many giant jars of it.

383
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:24,720
It still doesn't work.

384
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,079
Taking the heart to save people is a very dangerous method.

385
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,689
The one who gouges out the heart will be in grave agony, and their immortal power will diminish.

386
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:31,679
If there is any mistake, even their primordial spirit will be destroyed.

387
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,780
An immortal life will have been lost for nothing.

388
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,179
His Majesty is merciful, so he refused this method early on.

389
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:41,500
But now, there really is nothing we can do.

390
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,010
 The heart of the Four-Leaf Lotus? My heart can save him. 

391
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,799
You cut me off with an isolation spell.

392
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,280
But sound can't be cut off.

393
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,379
Emperor Ying Yuan, you've locked yourself up in the Land Under the Horizon for so long.

394
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:30,819
Hasn't it been a long time since you last heard anything about the outside world?

395
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:32,880
Would you like me to tell you?

396
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,779
Do you want to hear about military affairs, politics, or gossip?

397
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,499
I know. It must be gossip, right?

398
00:35:44,499 --> 00:35:47,640
What a coincidence. There happens to be a new rumor.

399
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,519
A few days ago, a pair of divine officials who were secretly in love were found out.

400
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,699
They jumped off the Bridge of Emptiness so they wouldn't be separated.

401
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,879
This heavenly law is really old-fashioned and rigid.

402
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,020
A pair of lovers had to die because of it.

403
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:07,040
Jumping off the bridge without permission is a severe violation of the Heavenly Rules.

404
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,119
Those who jump will fall out of the Three Realms. Their immortal spirits will be ruined.

405
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,820
They may not die, but the survivors can't be immortal anymore.

406
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:21,299
They can only forget the past, turn into mortals, and go through all the Mortal Realm trials.

407
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:24,899
Even if they don't die, they'll be greatly hurt?

408
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:30,179
If an immortal attendant with low spiritual power like me jumped off the bridge, I'd definitely turn into ash and disappear.

409
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:32,180
Don't talk nonsense.

410
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,800
If you abide by the Heavenly Rules and never fall in love...

411
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,200
it'll never happen.

412
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,399
In my opinion, if you greater gods are so old-fashioned, how can you help the Nine Heavens develop?

413
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,420
What is this?

414
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,799
No way.

415
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,260
I simply teased you a little bit, Your Majesty.

416
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,980
Why are you scaring me with all this?

417
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,820
What is this?

418
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,980
Stop chasing me!

419
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,840
They're the ghosts of the Asura Clan.

420
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,740
After the War of Genesis, they were sealed here for ten thousand years.

421
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,480
What exactly did you do to them?

422
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,779
Get away!

423
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:27,399
I wanted to dig a tunnel to deliver medicine to you!

424
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,140
Who knew the seal was so weak?

425
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,080
Here it comes again!

426
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,840
Who's so unlucky?

427
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,320
The day when my Soul Ripping Sword reappears in broad daylight is that person's death day.

428
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,359
Xuan Ye, the Lord of the Asura Clan, harmed the Six Realms and therefore was killed.

429
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,680
You, the spirit of his sword, were sealed here.

430
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,619
You also committed the crime of slaughter. Behave yourself!

431
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,159
I only listen to my master and never bow to others

432
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,040
unless the sword is broken, and my soul is banished.

433
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,579
You're seriously injured. I don't think you can beat him.

434
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:44,460
I'll ask the heavenly soldiers for help.

435
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,180
Emperor Ying Yuan. What's wrong with you, Emperor Ying Yuan?

436
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,120
This blood...

437
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,340
You're...

438
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,420
You're a descendant of our Asura Clan.

439
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,679
Why are you hiding in the Heavenly Realm?

440
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,140
You go along with the immortals and harm our clan.

441
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,279
Do you think you're worthy of the Asura blood that runs in your veins?

442
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,879
 Wasn't Ying Yuan born as an immortal, practicing to become an Emperor in the Heavenly Realm? 

443
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:40,319
 How could he be one of the Asura Clan? 

444
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,039
The people of the Asura Clan killed the innocent. Their sins are unforgivable!

445
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:47,340
They must be gotten rid of to comfort the common people!

446
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,419
This girl knows your identity as an Asura. Yet, you still want to keep her alive.

447
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:56,520
Being of Asura blood is my sin.

448
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,600
I won't get others involved.

449
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,019
You're already like this, but you're still so stubborn.

450
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:11,720
You bear the sin of taking away thousands of lives in the Genesis War, so you're full of anger and violence.

451
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,300
You should be convicted of this.

452
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,320
Heaven and Earth are changeable.

453
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,760
Good and evil take turns.

454
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,640
I've had enough sleep.

455
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,400
I, the spirit of the Soul Ripping Sword, will break away from my old owner...

456
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,460
and submit myself to you today.

457
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,300
Emperor Ying Yuan, are you all right?

458
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,740
I'm all right.

459
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,840
I'm dying anyway. I can just die with this sword.

460
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,940
There will be no more trouble from the Asura Clan in this world again.

461
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:32,200
Just now, the sword spirit said you're a descendant of the Asura Clan, which perished in the Genesis War.

462
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,040
Is that true?

463
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,679
Do you know your identity?

464
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,260
This isn't something you should ask about.

465
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:42,119
 I didn't expect an Emperor to have such a tragic past. 

466
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:43,959
 He must have blamed himself for his background. 

467
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,240
 That's why he's so restrained and follows the rules so strictly. 

468
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,979
W-What's wrong with the sacred tree?

469
00:42:52,979 --> 00:42:55,180
Why are so many leaves falling?

470
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,319
The sacred tree will wither and die in five days.

471
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,519
You can't stay here for long. Leave now.

472
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:02,440
How could I leave you behind?

473
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,040
Go!

474
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,920
Emperor Ying Yuan!

475
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,420
Emperor Ying Yuan.

476
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,319
Oh, no! The poison is taking effect again.

He must have lost too much immortal power from saving me just now.

478
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,820
He's burning hot!

 ''Agarwood'' - Zhang Jie | Jane Zhang 

481
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:34,549
♫   My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves   ♫

482
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:41,600
♫   For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you   ♫

483
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:48,520
♫   If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go?   ♫

484
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:54,650
♫   Turn around and become the delusion of my life  ♫

485
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:02,750
♫   The most beautiful destiny is hidden in the dark night, "love" is the word for everything   ♫

486
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:09,899
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

487
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:16,909
♫   I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust   ♫

488
00:45:16,909 --> 00:45:23,039
♫   Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most  ♫

489
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:30,820
♫   You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers   ♫

490
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:37,230
♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

491
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:44,970
♫   You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine   ♫

492
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:51,750
♫   In my dream, the one I loved is with me   ♫

493
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:13,270
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

494
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:19,400
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

495
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:27,399
♫   As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable  

496
00:46:27,399 --> 00:46:34,620
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

497
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:42,040
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫
