 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,500
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,800
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,200
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,400
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,300
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,500
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths   ♫

10
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,000
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,400
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,400
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,600
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,800
   

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,900
   

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,100
I never expected that us, father and son, would finally meet each other.

17
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,900
Ying Yuan. You're incomparably powerful.

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,600
Why didn't you make good use of my Asura blood?

19
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,200
By that, you can overturn the Three Realms and rule over all sentient beings.

20
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,600
As well as restore the Asura Clan.

21
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,000
You've traveled back in time hundreds of times.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,300
Yet the first thing you say when you were awakened is about your ambition to rule the world and the past.

23
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,000
Have you still not figured it out?

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,200
You're an exact duplicate of me in terms of appearance.

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,800
However, your personality resembles your mother's.

26
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,600
We, the members of the Asura Clan, are born with divine power,

27
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,100
and our cultivation base is a hundred times stronger than other clans'.

28
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,500
Yet we're cursed with a short life span.

29
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Since Heaven treats us unfairly, then I'll rescue myself at the cost of others' lives.

30
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,800
As long as we can live for eternity, I couldn't care less if some weak clans have to be sacrificed.

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,700
Life and death coexist. Perpetually.

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,000
The Asura Clan could have lasted for many generations to come.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,900
However, due to your ambition, the Asura Clan was attacked by the Six Realms and was annihilated!

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,400
This was the consequence of your pursuit for longevity.

35
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
That was because I fell in love.

36
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,300
If I didn't have to save your mother, how could I have failed?

37
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,400
How could you have failed?

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,600
After I witnessed what Huan Qin did, what you did and what others refrain from doing,

39
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,200
I finally realized that righteousness can only be achieved by enlightenment, not through cultivation.

40
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,300
Only when you let go of the obsession with longevity will you attain a transcendent state.

41
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,500
The Deity Clan claims that they're rightful and righteous.

42
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,400
But all they want you to do is surrender to the Law of Heaven so that they can remain the ruler!

43
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,700
Why am I born to be inferior to them?

44
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,600
The Law of Heaven values equality amongst sentient beings.

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,000
However you... only think of conquering the world alone.

46
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,700
Before Mother perished together with you,

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,400
she told you my name.

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,600
Did you feel a shred of regret at all?

49
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,000
You kept using the time and lives you stole to bring Mother back to life.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,400
Because you wanted to indulge yourself in your happiest moment with her.

51
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,800
If the meaning of life is longevity, then why did you lose to Mother over and over again?

52
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,100
So what even if you possess eternal life, unparalleled cultivation, and overwhelming supremacy?

53
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,000
All that's waiting for you...

54
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,400
is just everyone you care about perishing for you...

55
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,800
leaving only endless loneliness.

56
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,600
Finally.

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,900
Finally... I have a father.

58
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,700
Back then,

59
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,000
I always thought I was born a sinner.

60
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,600
But when I saw your past with Mother,

61
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
I finally knew

62
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,000
that I was born because of love.

63
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,300
And this love surpassed your ambition and longing for power.

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,800
Which is why I can stand before you now.

65
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Mother killed you with my blood.

66
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,200
But that wasn't because she truly hated you.

67
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,400
She died to save others...

68
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,400
While I was born to save others.

69
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,100
You are the one who gave me the opportunity

70
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,800
to become the person... who can bring this endless cycle to an end.

71
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,300
Let it go, Father.

72
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Living an endless life isn't the meaning of life.

73
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Only when there is a limit... an end...

74
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,600
will we develop an attachment

75
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,800
and learn to cherish what matters to us.

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,700
My son.

77
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,000
My good son.

78
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,600
All of the mania came from my resentment.

79
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,600
It turns out I attained longevity a long time ago.

80
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:18,000
I've always... been living inside the heart of the one I love.

81
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,200
Xuan Ye.

82
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,800
Yuan'er.

83
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,900
Ran Qing.

84
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,800
Is it true that you don't hate me?

85
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,200
I've never hated you.

86
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,100
Yuan'er. Thank you.

87
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,300
My son.

88
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,800
Everyone will be parted by death eventually.

89
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,000
My dearest son.

90
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,400
Farewell.

91
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,400
Mother. Father.

92
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,000
In our next life...

93
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,400
In our next life... we'll still be family.

94
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,480
My son.

95
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,020
This is our farewell.

96
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,460
Even if you've overcome the evil inside you, so what?

97
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:58,180
The Asura blood in your body is doomed to bring catastrophe to the Three Realms.

98
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,380
Ying Yuan. You can never escape from this destiny.

99
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,228
Now that the barrier that used to divide the Heaven Realm and the Devil Realm no longer exists.

100
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:25,260
I'd like to see what choice you decide to make.

101
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,880
Are you going to stay in the Illusion of Devils and keep trying to kill me

102
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,400
or go to protect the sentient beings of the Three Realms that you care so much about?

103
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,380
 The Asura King summons thunder strikes from the universe. 

104
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,860
 The arrival of Eternal Darkness manifests my power! 

105
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:46,480
Today, you... will die by my hand!

106
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,600
As for the Three Realms... I will also protect it!

107
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,420
The Illusion of Devils will weaken without the power of Devil King,

108
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,040
if we keep on launching spells here it will only tear it apart.

109
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,680
Do you want to die here?

110
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,800
I definitely won't let you leave the Illusion of Devils. Don't even think about it!

111
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:59,040
The more you want to take me down with you, the more I won't let that happen!

112
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,120
- Ying Yuan.
- Ying Yuan.

113
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,600
Yan Dan. Yan Dan!

114
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm fine.

115
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,780
Why did you come in here?

116
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,320
I told you before we would stick together in life and death!

117
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,660
With our help, we might stand a chance to win.

118
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,800
Block Huan Qin's way! We must leave before the entrance disappears!

119
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:29,420
I have no regrets now that I've fought alongside the Three Emperors.

120
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,220
And I'm very happy to have been your friend.

121
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,640
Huan Qin is no match for you.

122
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,740
Why must you sacrifice your life here?

123
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,380
My Asura blood has been awakened.

124
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,160
Without the primordial spirit of His Supreme Majesty suppressing it, I can't predict what will happen!

125
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,320
Perishing with the Illusion of Devils is the best choice for me.

126
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,160
What about me? Are you going to abandon me again?

127
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm sorry, Yan Dan.

128
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,820
Yu Mo. Take her and leave!

129
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,840
I won't leave!

130
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,560
Yan Dan. Hurry, go!

131
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,140
Yu Mo. Leave now!

132
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,760
Go!

133
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,760
- Ying Yuan!
- Yan Dan!

134
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,800
Yan Dan!

135
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,340
Yu Mo. I'm sorry.

136
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,020
Please forget me.

137
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,640
Yan Dan!

138
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,960
You're merely a flower demon.

139
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,580
You're like a bug going up against a cart.

140
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,060
If you want to live, then you better leave now.

141
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,780
Otherwise, I'll make you disappear right now.

142
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,420
Clans and ability have never mattered when you're protecting the ones you love.

143
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,980
Evil can never overpower righteousness.

144
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,840
Regardless how good your schemes or great your spiritual power,

145
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,440
you would never have imagined that you would be defeated by a Four-leaf Lotus!

146
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,560
Today, I'll personally avenge my sister!

147
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,100
Why didn't you leave?

148
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,680
You protect the Three Realms, so let me protect you.

149
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,360
In the past, all we would see is the other's back walking away.

150
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,500
But this time...

151
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,240
we'll never be apart again.

152
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,020
All right.

153
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,100
This life was enough.

154
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,020
Not even death can pull us apart.

155
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,120
 Congratulations on your triumph, Your Supreme Majesty. 

156
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,300
Both of you...

157
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
made it back alive.

158
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,800
We, Team One Good Deed A Day, is invincible indeed.

159
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,300
Come.

160
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,360
Your Supreme Majesty, the barrier set by the Primordial Lord has been broken.

161
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,880
The Asura Army of the Dead is on its way to attack the Three Realms.

162
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,860
Marshal Huo De is protecting the Heaven Realm.

163
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,420
However, the other two realms are weak.

164
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:40,080
Your Supreme Majesty, please decide how to deploy the rest of the heavenly army.

165
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,280
You and Yu Mo go back first.

166
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,860
After everything is over, I'll come find you.

167
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,860
No. I'll stay to help.

168
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,300
Yu Mo. You should go back to Yelan Mountain first.

169
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,060
If catastrophe hits the Three Realms, the demons in the mountain will need you.

170
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,700
Yan Dan.

171
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,400
If there's danger, call me at any time.

172
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,920
You two must return safe and sound.

173
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,600
What is it?

174
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,320
Your Supreme Majesty.

175
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,840
This is bad. He must be struggling to control the Asura blood inside him.

176
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,660
We must figure out a way to suppress it then!

177
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,300
- His Supreme Majesty has been possessed by evil! 
 - Ying Yuan!

178
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,320
Yan Dan! Don't move!

179
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,440
If this keeps going, you'll be completely destroyed.

180
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,260
Yan Dan!

181
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,720
Ying Yuan. I'm Yan Dan...

182
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,160
I'm Yan Dan!

183
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,140
Ying Yuan. I'm Yan Dan.

184
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,920
Open your eyes.

185
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,120
Look at me carefully.

186
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,880
I'm begging you. Don't let it take over.

187
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,680
No matter whether we're in the Heaven Realm or the Mortal Realm,

188
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,900
whether you're Tang Zhou or Ying Yuan, you won't forget me.

189
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,840
After the war ended,

190
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,940
didn't we promise each other

191
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,660
that we would be carefree and travel around the world?

192
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,340
Ying Yuan...

193
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,600
My whole heart is inside you.

194
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,720
I'm begging you, don't let it consume you.

195
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,160
I'm begging you, don't forget me.

196
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,260
I begging you. Look at me.

197
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,240
Don't let it take over you.

198
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,760
I'm begging you...

199

238
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,900
- Yan Dan. 
- Ying Yuan.

239
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,700
Ying Yuan.

240
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,760
- Ying Yuan!
- Ying Yuan!

241
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,480
- Ying Yuan!
- Your Supreme Majesty!

242
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,780
- Your Supreme Majesty.
- Your Supreme Majesty!

243
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,760
Ying Yuan, come down here. What are you doing?!

244
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,420
Come down here, Ying Yuan!

245
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,520
Ying Yuan! No!

246
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,420
Your Supreme Majesty.

247
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,400
In ancient times, Ran Qing, the Primordial Lord, saved the sentient beings

248
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,240
by turning her primordial spirit into the barrier to restore peace to the world for good.

249
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,820
Now, Heavenly Emperor Ying Yuan, her son, made the same decision.

250
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,460
- No, Your Supreme Majesty!
 -No, Your Supreme Majesty! 

251
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,380
- Your Supreme Majesty!
 - Your Supreme Majesty! 

252
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:45,130
The primordial spirit that used to control my Asura blood has already returned to the Heavenly Emperor.

253
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:52,920
I hope you will all wait for His Supreme Majesty to awaken and let him know

254
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,200
that I have the same wish as my mother.

255
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,860
We hope for peace in the Three Realms and no more war.

256
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,220
From now on, gruesome punishments will be removed!

257
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:11,000
And the rule that forbids immortals to fall in love should be abolished!

258
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,020
I hope His Supreme Majesty

259
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,740
will govern the Three Realms with benevolence and justice.

260
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,020
Yes, Your Supreme Majesty. I won't let you down.

261
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,880
There must be a way to oppress it!

262
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,780
Don't give up!

263
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,440
Yu Mo.

264
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,820
The Asura blood has activated and the barrier has disappeared.

265
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,400
There's no other way to suppress the Asura blood.

266
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,640
Only when the barrier is established, can it prevent evil from surging again.

267
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,300
Ying Yuan!

268
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,000
Ying Yuan, come down here!

269
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,300
Ying Yuan, come down here! Please!

270
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,720
I beg you, come down here.

271
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,220
I beg you, come down!

272
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,680
Yan Dan.

273
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,200
If the world is destroyed,

274
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,320
you'll perish too.

275
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,020
So, this time, I want you to live happily.

276
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,140
I must protect this world.

277
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,180
Because only if the Three Realms remain, can you continue to exist.

278
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,900
Yan Dan.

279
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,200
Don't be sad for me.

280
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,440
Please. I beg you, come down, please.

I'm coming to keep you company.

311
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:21,880
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

312
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:28,960
♫   I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust   ♫

313
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,680
Yan Dan!

314
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:43,120
♫   You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers   ♫

315
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:49,400
♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

316
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:56,220
♫   You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine   ♫

317
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,320
 Farewell to Heavenly Emperor Qingli, Ying Yuan. 

318
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,320
Farewell to Heavenly Emperor Qingli, Ying Yuan.

319
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,840
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

320
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,360
Yan Dan...

321
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,200
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

322
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,220
Yan Dan!

323
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,970
Ying Yuan!

324
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:25,370
♫   As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable   ♫

325
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:32,600
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

326
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:41,000
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫

 ''Never Forget'' - Zhang Lei 

329
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:19,180
♫   The moment of our first meeting in Heaven and on Earth   ♫

330
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:25,860
♫   Even the star frost can't stop the fleeting time   ♫

331
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:34,260
♫   I once borrowed your eyes to warm the coldest moment   ♫

332
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:41,260
♫   I've traveled across the Night Forgetting River, but it's hard to forget this fate   ♫

333
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:48,360
♫   I followed you across the endless seas reluctant to leave you   ♫

334
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:54,200
♫   It seems too hard to profess my love, the words are caught in my throat   ♫

335
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:02,360
♫   I've wasted a millennium thinking about how to let go of my endless longing for you   ♫

336
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:09,160
♫   Love can only be redeemed if the deadline is forgotten   ♫

337
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:18,940
♫   Deep love is engraved in my heart with just one look, I'm willing to take the leap for you   ♫

338
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:25,920
♫   As epiphyllum withers, I'm willing to sink in deep and never let you down in this life   ♫

339
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:34,120
♫   I'm keeping the last glimpse of you, so I won't fear missing you after reincarnation   ♫

340
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:41,980
♫   Your heart is still beating in my chest   ♫

341
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:57,780
♫   Deep love is engraved in my heart with just one look, I'm willing to take the leap for you   ♫

342
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:04,660
♫   As epiphyllum withers, I'm willing to sink in deep and never let you down in this life   ♫

343
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:13,000
♫   I'm keeping the last glimpse of you, so I won't fear missing you after reincarnation   ♫

344
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,040
♫   Your heart is still beating in my chest   ♫

345
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:30,160
♫   The flowers bloom and fall, even though I say nothing and you hear nothing   ♫
