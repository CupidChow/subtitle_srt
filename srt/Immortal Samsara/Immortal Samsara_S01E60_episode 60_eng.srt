♫   You always light up the long night like the stars and moon   ♫

18
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,840
♫   Your smile melts my cold heart   ♫

19
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:41,320
♫   No matter how the world changes, you're always by my side   ♫

20
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:50,820
♫   If time is the wilderness, you're a flower field planting memories   ♫

21
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:59,140
♫   I've never said I miss you and I wonder when I fell in love with you   ♫

22
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,900
♫   We're entangled like agarwood intertwined into flames   ♫

23
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,660
♫   It doesn’t extinguish and I've forgotten the cold wind and snow along the way   ♫

24
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,540
♫   I've experienced the ups and downs of the world alone   ♫

25
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:23,240
♫   Finally, I can rest in your heart   ♫

26
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,100
♫   We've been together for a lifetime and gone through all the trials   ♫

27
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,280
♫   We won't complain as time will turn our hardship into sweetness   ♫

28
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:40,400
♫   I won't ask how long forever is, but we'll smile and laugh together   ♫

29
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,860
♫   Let the past be the past   ♫

30

♫   We're entangled like agarwood intertwined into flames   ♫

31
