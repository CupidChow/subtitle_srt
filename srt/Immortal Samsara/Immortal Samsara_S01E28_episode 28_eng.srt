 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,400
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,820
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,170
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,120
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,000
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths   ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,020
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,320
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,500
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,570
   

15
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,950
   

16
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,600
The poison is receding, but her demonic essence was damaged.

17
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,900
She can't regain her human form for a while.

18
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,500
The array Yan Dan fell into was unearthly.

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,080
It wasn't made by a normal human.

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,000
From now on, we will go our separate ways.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,140
I'm taking Yan Dan with me to get treated.

22
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,580
You can't.

23
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,190
Why not?

24
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,240
You came here for your mission. It has nothing to do with Yan Dan.

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,300
You have no reason to stop me from taking her back.

26
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,880
Yan Dan's assailant probably caused the unusual incidents in the palace.

27
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,460
Many women in the capital city are missing.

28
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,700
Everyone fears for their lives. People aren't leaving their homes.

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,340
Perhaps that was when Yan Dan was targeted.

30
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,440
Spare me your theories.

31
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,980
Your duty is to capture demons.

32
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,780
My duty is to keep Yan Dan safe.

33
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,960
As for the assailant's identity, it doesn't really matter to me.

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,560
I believe the Yelan Mountain hot spring can help her recover.

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,140
 I got into this mess because I wanted to stay away from your bickering. 

36
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,140
 I was transformed to my original form. And now, you're at it again! 

37
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,840
 Please work together, for once. 

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,020
 Yu Mo, we left the mountain to do a good deed every day. 

39
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,720
If evil demons are tarnishing our good name, we must stop them.

40
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,940
 Show them who's the king of all demons! 

41
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,400
 Prove yourself to the Lingxiao Sect. Find out who's behind all of this. 

42
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,600
Besides, if we get to the bottom of this mystery,

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,280
 I can use it for my book, "A Mortal World Diary." 

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,800
Not only will it be entertaining, but it will also serve as advice.

45
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
What about you?

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,600
 Relax. I know enough about my demonic essence. 

47
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,200
 I'll be fine. 

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,540
 Besides, I plan to endure mortal trials and write inspiring stories. 

49
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,340
Stop hesitating!

50
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,440
I believe that, with our combined ingenuity, we can find the culprit.

51
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,240
Then I'll be able to remove this poison.

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,180
You're the king of all demons. Surely you're wiser than a lotus demon.

53
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,580
I'm only willing to overlook this for Yan Dan's sake.

54
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,580
I'm going after the evil demon. Don't get in my way.

55
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,260
The evil demon is in the palace. Please help us now!

56
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,400
Jiang Chen!

57
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,780
That's right. I killed those women!

58
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,760
This is all my fault.

59
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,540
Vile demon! How dare you bewitch His Majesty and harm innocent people!

60
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,360
I will cleanse this palace of your evil for the good of the people!

61
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,660
-  My beloved consort! 
 - Your Majesty , stay back!

62
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,180
Her demonic power hasn't been drained. Don't come any closer!

63
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,200
She is full of grudges. She might harm you!

64
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,500
Jiang Chen?

65
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,020
Pei Luo...

66
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,460
I... I wish I could turn back time... to the day where we first met.

67
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,100
 You are just as frail and delicate as I am. 

68
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,580
 You, too, are alone in this world. 

69
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,000
 We have a lot in common. 

70
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,140
 Would you let me keep you company? 

71
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,140
 Umbrella for sale. Buy your umbrella here! 

72
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,640
 Sir, check out these umbrellas. 

73
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,160
 That's a nice one. 

74
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,940
 Sir, I'll buy this umbrella. 

75
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,840
 Is this yours? 

76
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,580
 Thank you. 

77
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,080
Who would have thought...

78
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,480
this is how it all ends?

79
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,400
But I regret nothing.

80
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,800
I'll always remember that umbrella.

81
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,260
But from now on...

82
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,400
no one will be there to hold an umbrella for you in the rain.

83
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,620
Take care of yourself.

84
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,620
Pei Luo.

85
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,400
Could you hold me in your arms one last time?

86
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,440
If I can die in your arms...

87
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,240
I shall have no regrets.

88
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,820
Your Majesty.

89
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,580
Your Majesty gave orders slay this demon. She likely hates you.

90
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,980
Do not fall for her deceptive words!

91
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,400
Jiang Chen.

92
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,640
Our memories will always stay in my heart. I won't forget them.

93
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,180
But you committed great sins and left me with no choice.

94
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,400
Please do not resent me for this.

95
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,290
"The sky above and the depths below,"

96
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,810
"the heart lingers as tears run dry,"

97
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,800
"this is the end, love of mine."

98
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,720
Your Majesty. Her demon essence was crushed.

99
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,160
She will perish soon.

100
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,540
The aura of resentment is strong and will infect your body.

101
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,820
Please leave the vicinity.

102
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,140
Your Majesty. What he said is right.

103
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,340
We will alleviate her grudge.

104
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,480
Miss Jiang Chen.

105
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,640
Jiang Chen!

106
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,040
Miss Jiang Chen.

107
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,360
You had the Extraordinary Eye. What happened to you?

108
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,060
The flower demon Yu Mo can't seem to forget is actually Jiang Chen.

109
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,900
I’m sorry.

110
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,280
The Extraordinary Eye...

111
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,620
Miss Jiang Chen...

112
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,040
 Jiang Chen! 

113
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,460
 Jiang Chen! 

114
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,280
We agreed... that when I finished the script...

115
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,780
you'd be the actress in my play.

116
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,440
 I've held on to my end of the promise. 

117
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,320
I just completed the prologue...

118
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,820
but you broke your promise.

119
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,640
Jiang Chen!

120
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,060
 Unexpectedly, the frail prince Jiang Chen loved became King of Andu. 

121
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,620
 The Flower Spirit Clan is always true to their nature. 

122
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,580
 They would never harm anyone. 

123
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,140
I secretly examined her demonic essence.

124
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,340
She didn’t have any demonic power left.

125
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,680
It seems that she didn't cause the unusual events in the palace.

126
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,140
 In that case, why did those Taoist Masters still act like it was her? 

127
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,700
 Why work so hard to build a massive demon-trapping array? 

128
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,740
Evil demons always work in secret so nothing will be traced back to them.

129
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,570
 I recognize Jiang Chen's spells. She wasn't the one who hurt me. 

130
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,370
 Jiang Chen was a close friend. 

131
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,680
We must figure out a way to clear her name.

132
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,180
Taoist Master Tang, your mission here is to capture evil demons.

133
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,060
Jiang Chen is dead. She wasn't your friend.

134
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,540
You should get your reward and leave as soon as possible.

135
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,720
Epiphyllum typically blooms for a very short period of time.

136
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,000
But these epiphyllum in the palace are always blooming.

137
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,260
The flowers are catalyzed by demonic spells to ward off evil demons.

138
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:09,360
Therefore, as long as the real culprit is here, I can't leave.

139
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,380
But you are a demon catcher.

140
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,560
Why would you sympathize with a demon?

141
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,220
Some demons are kind.

142
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,680
If Jiang Chen wasn't the culprit, we shouldn't let her die without justice.

143
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,460
 You are both very kind. Why must you fight each other? 

144
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,380
 Yu Mo. 

145
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,640
Yu Mo!

146
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,200
 That's more like it. 

147
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,560
Shake hands and make peace. Solve the case together.

148
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,840
We must prove Jiang Chen's innocence.

149
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,620
I never said I'd let him go.

150
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,520
When the work is done, we'll settle our dispute.

151
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,060
No problem.

152
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,300
You did a great job catching the evil demon.

153
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,000
I hereby reward you with ten thousand taels of gold.

154
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,260
Starting today, a notice will be posted.

155
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,420
The threat was neutralized. The people can now live in peace.

156
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,040
 Much thanks, Your Majesty. 

157
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,720
Your Majesty.

158
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,120
My junior once worked with Consort Jiang Chen in a troupe outside the palace.

159
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,120
She didn't know Consort Jiang Chen was a demon.

160
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,660
But she knew Consort Jiang Chen had a kind heart.

161
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,440
She would never commit such heinous crimes.

162
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,020
I suspect there is more to this case.

163
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,320
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

164
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,360
That is a very bold claim!

165
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,300
Since your junior befriended a demon, are you two—

166
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,980
He is actually my—

167
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,840
Taoist Master Tang. Don't waste your time on them.

168
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,380
We are both from the Lingxiao Sect.

169
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,420
I am his senior and he is my junior.

170
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,100
The Lingxiao Sect is a prestigious sect.

171
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,260
Lesser sects such as yours have no right to smear our name.

172
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,480
Watch yourself out here.

173
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,660
You mentioned that your junior knew Jiang Chen.

174
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,820
Since you are defending her, I can tell you are an honorable person.

175
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,600
But I've drawn my own conclusion on the matter.

176
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,140
You shouldn't interfere.

177
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,480
Your Majesty,

178
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,740
I overheard the poem Consort Jiang Chen was reciting.

179
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:00,780
I speculate that her words had a hidden meaning.

180
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,100
Perhaps... she left some clues behind in the palace.

181
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,600
Of course, only Your Majesty can know for sure.

182
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,360
"The sky above and the depths below."

183
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,660
She has descended into the afterlife.

184
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,520
So the sky above...

185
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,620
   

186
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,840
Your Majesty. Let me give it a try.

187
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,860
   

188
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,540
Your Majesty, a special spell was cast on this wooden case.

189
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
A normal spell can't open it.

190
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,020
We might need another way to open it.

191
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,940
Since you found this case, I believe you can also open it.

192
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,840
This is the last keepsake from my beloved consort.

193
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,120
I'll wait in the back garden, at midnight.

194
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,620
 He saw right through the hidden meaning of Jiang Chen's poem. 

195
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,820
 Perhaps the rumors are true. 

196
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,780
Yu Mo proposed to Jiang Chen but was rejected.

197
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,840
It seems Yu Mo really loves and cares about Jiang Chen.

198
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,260
   

199
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

200
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,200
My beloved consort is no longer in this world.

201
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,040
I buried some of her clothing here.

202
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,240
I built her a tomb.

203
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,280
She used to love plum wine.

204
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,280
I ordered several jars made just for her.

205
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,960
I'll pay tribute to her tonight.

206
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,660
May she find peace in the afterlife.

207
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:20,220
If Your Majesty loves her so... why did you order her execution?

208
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,180
There were things I couldn't tell anyone.

209
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:35,180
But since you mentioned that your junior knew Jiang Chen, I wanted to have a word with you.

210
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,360
Jiang Chen and I loved each other.

211
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,980
She always cared about my well-being.

212
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,340
But I suffered from a strange illness.

213
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,560
She developed the plan to sacrifice humans to make the medicine to cure me.

214
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,020
Even though she did it for me, she still committed great sins.

215
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,200
She cannot be absolved of her crimes.

216
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,580
The women who lost their lives deserved justice.

217
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,280
Your Majesty's love for her runs deep.

218
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,140
Many innocent women died, but the epiphyllum are still blooming.

219
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,720
If we don't purify the palace, it will be haunted by vengeful souls.

220
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,730
Please let us stay for some time so we can drive off the vengeful souls and alleviate their grudges.

221
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,360
I'll leave the task to you.

222
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,840
Consort Jiang Chen was a famous actress in Liyuan. She knew alchemy.

223
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,560
Your Majesty suspected nothing.

224
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,080
That means Your Majesty knew she was a demon.

225
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,260
Correct.

226
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,160
I knew her true identity.

227
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,440
I was recuperating in the southern capital.

228
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,180
People were coming after my life.

229
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,380
She once showed her true form to save my life.

230
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,900
♪  The blue collar you wear  ♪

231
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,760
♪  Your image has been lingering in my heart   ♪

232
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,440
♪  Though I couldn't go and meet you   ♪

233
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,400
♪  Why don’t you ever write to me again?  ♪

234
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,280
♪ The blue waist band you wear   ♪

235
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,400
 I didn't tell you my true identity in the past. 

236
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,000
 I lied to you. 

237
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Do you resent me for it? 

238
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,200
 I am a demon. 

239
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,500
 Aren't you afraid? 

240
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,700
 Did you know that... in my eyes, you look more like a fairy? 

241
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,600
 Whatever you are... you saved my life... and kept me company. 

242
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,600
I believed her heart was pure and innocent.

243
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
It didn't matter whether she was human or a demon.

244
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,900
After I became King of Andu, I made her my consort.

245
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,600
But in the end, her love clouded her judgment.

246
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,700
She committed murders to treat me.

247
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,700
I failed her.

248
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,500
Consort Jiang Chen and I... knew each other.

249
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,400
Knowing that she passed away... brings me great grief.

250
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,800
Could I use the plum wine you prepared...

251
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,600
to pay tribute to her and pray that she finds peace in the afterlife?

252
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,500
 He does have the Extraordinary Eye. 

253
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,100
 Why does he wear an amulet that wards off demons? 

254
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,800
 As long as he wears it, I can't retrieve the Extraordinary Eye. 

255
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm glad to have you here... to mourn her passing... with me.

256
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,400
She is in a better place now.

257
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,000
You have my condolences.

258
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,200
It wasn't easy to take you away from Tang Zhou.

259
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,000
This is a reunion for both of us.

260
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Would you like some tea?

261
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
What's wrong?

262
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,800
You seem lifeless today.

263
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,300
Are you upset? Is something troubling you?

264
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,900
Would you like... to talk about it with me?

265
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Yu Mo! How did you get inside here?

266
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,500
You shouldn't have sneaked out. Now you know how much I care about you.

267
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,000
This is blossom dew. It can nourish your demonic essence.

268
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,400
Drink it up.

269
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,400
I didn't think Jiang Chen's passing would be what reunited us.

270
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,700
Yu Mo, how are you doing?

271
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,900
I found you. I feel great.

272
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,600
 Yu Mo gave his most precious Extraordinary Eye to Jiang Chen. 

273
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,400
 He must really love her. 

274
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,400
 Now that Jiang Chen is gone, I doubt he would tell anyone his grievance. 

275
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,600
 I shouldn't bring it up again. It'd only hurt him even more. 

276
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,100
Yan Dan?

277
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,600
The wood case you found earlier bears the emblem of Flower Spirit Clan's Heart-Twining Vine.

278
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,400
Each vine plant unlocks in a different way.

279
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,700
- You must learn as much as you can to find a way to open it. 
 - Yes.

280
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,000
One more thing. I know how important the Extraordinary Eye is to you.

281
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,600
Don't worry. I will surely help you find it.

282
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,800
I already know where it is.

283
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,700
It's just that I can't retrieve it for now.

284
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,600
When the time is right, I will get it back.

285
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,000
The Extraordinary Eye can help you regain your human form.

286
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,200
Then, we can go home together.

287
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,300
Where is Yu Mo? Why isn't he here to be your bodyguard?

288
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,800
 Mountain Chief just lost his loved one. 

289
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
 He needs some time alone to mourn her passing. 

290
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,100
 Give him some time. 

291
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,800
He liked Jiang Chen?

292
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,200
 Yu Mo once gave his most precious belonging to her. 

293
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,200
But in the end, Jiang Chen chose someone else.

294
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,400
After all these years, Yu Mo still hasn't forgotten her.

295
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,800
But the day they reunited was the day he lost her for good.

296
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Of course, Yu Mo would be upset.

297
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,800
 If he ever rubs you the wrong way, please show some tolerance. 

298
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,000
 What is this? 

299
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,300
This is a cleansing talisman used to purify vengeful souls.

300
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,200
That wicked consort must be powerful.

301
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,000
Not even a Demon Catcher from the Lingxiao Sect can get rid of these flowers.

302
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
- What should we do now? 
  - What should we do now? 

303
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
Taoist Master Tang.

304
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,800
May I know when these flowers first appeared?

305
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,500
On the fifth of this month, many women in the capital, who were born at midnight, went missing.

306
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,100
It struck fear into everyone.

307
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,100
On the tenth, these flowers began to appear outside Consort Jiang Chen's palace.

308
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,000
She must have consumed those women alive.

309
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,800
That's why their souls won't leave.

310
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,900
Were these flowers the first unusual incident?

311
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,200
What about the river of blood and the crows?

312
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,100
After the epiphyllum began to grow, His Majesty summoned the demon catchers the following day.

313
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,200
But Consort Jiang Chen wasn't scared at all.

314
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,100
She even became more aggressive.

315
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,200
A few days later, the city moat suddenly turned blood red.

316
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,400
The foul smell attracted flocks of crows.

317
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Then, more epiphyllum began to bloom.

318
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,100
The whole palace was covered in these flowers.

319
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,600
They were terrifying.

320
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,000
That's enough. Let's go.

321
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:44,100
 If the King of Andu summoned demon catchers right away, why did more unusual incidents keep happening? 

322
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,000
 Even if Jiang Chen wanted to make medicine for His Majesty, 

323
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,400
 why would she do it so blatantly in front of the people?

Consort Jiang Chen has left us.

Your Majesty. The clue for opening the case... must be inside Consort Jiang Chen's chamber.

But it's inappropriate for me to come and go from her chamber.

But you indulge yourself in wine and plays.

Therefore, a few more drinks won't hurt.

Quickly sit down. Don't spoil the fun. Drink up.

366
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,720
We must purify the vengeful souls.

Besides, I was the one who found the wooden case.

Of course! Your little tricks could fool Pei Luo, but not me.

388
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,040
 The King of Andu seems suspicious. 

389
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,140
 We must pretend to fight each other so he'll let his guard down. 

390
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,700
 Get it? 

391
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,080
 Only a cunning demon would resort to tricks. 

392
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,260
 We're not on Yelan Mountain. 

393
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,600
 I'm not a lesser demon that you command. 

394
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,320
 Come on. 

395
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:31,120
 Don't forget, the king trusts me and not you. 

396
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,800
 See this? This is a token from the King of Andu. 

397
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,360
 With this token, you can come and go as you wish. 

398
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,940
 What do you want? Just say it. 

399
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,400
 How smart. 

400
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,340
 The King of Andu wears a millennium peach wood amulet. It wards off demons. 

401
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,740
 I can't get close to him. 

402
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,040
 So why would you want that? 

403
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,140
 I want to take back what's mine. 

404
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,800
 If I lied, we could have a final showdown. 

405
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,440
 - Deal. 
 - Smart move. Take it. 

406
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,340
 One more thing. Yan Dan can't join you in the investigation. 

407
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,460
 You're too weak. I'm worried about her. 

408
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,420
 She must come with me. 

409
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,000
 I can deal with the amulet, but Yan Dan stays. 

410
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,080
 If I find solid proof, I'll signal you. Then, you can come. 

411
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:23,660
Besides, based on what I know about you two,

412
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,540
you wouldn't change your mind, now that you've agreed to investigate this case together.

413
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,120
 Not to mention, you two wouldn't argue over an imaginary junior. 

414
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,760
If you ask me, you're not even qualified to go on stage with your bad acting.

415
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,980
 Maybe I could be your master. 

416
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,200
In my sect, arrogant demons are sealed inside the demon-trapping bottle.

417
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,120
By the way, I need a flower to decorate my calabash.

418
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,400
Are you fit for the job?

419
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,820
   

420
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:33,720
Ever since she became a consort, His Majesty decorated her room every year for her birthday.

421
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,940
He stopped doing so a few years back.

422
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,660
 Here's the record. 

423
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,560
 In the first month of the 29th year, she requested to be punished. 

424
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,780
 The King of Andu agreed. 

425
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,560
 Her palace finances were cut in half. 

426
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,260
They were estranged from each other for a long time.

427
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,760
Miss, please wait.

428
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,840
Miss, where did you get this flower? Where are you taking it?

429
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,380
His Majesty and Consort Jiang Chen planted this flower together in the garden.

430
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,460
Consort Jiang Chen passed away. No one cares for the flower.

431
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,480
His Majesty ordered to have it thrown away.

432
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,380
Pei Luo claimed that he loved Jiang Chen.

433
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:37,620
But now, he's throwing away the flower they planted together. Something is off.

434
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,200
Insolence! How dare you block the path of Secondary Consort Sheng De!

435
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,140
Move aside now!

436
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,880
Why is a concubine surrounded by Taoist priests dressed in white?

437
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,260
Insolence! Who are you to question us?

438
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,900
Kneel down and apologize!

439
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,880
Hold on.

440
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,140
Emperor?

441
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,580
 Do you know each other? 

442
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,780
 What's an emperor? 

443
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,320
Your Highness mistook me for someone else.

444
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,780
I am Tang Zhou, from the Lingxiao Sect.

445
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,720
King of Andu summoned me to dispel the vengeful souls.

446
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,500
On our first encounter... I displeased you.

447
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,300
I ask for your forgiveness.

448
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,400
 His Majesty descended to the Mortal Realm. 

449
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,780
 He must have forgotten his life in the Nine Heavens. 

450
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,420
Halt.

451
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,040
I wasn't mistaken.

452
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,080
I also practice Taoism.

453
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,520
When I was training and studying under my master,

454
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,420
I learned divination.

455
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,480
I can see a person's past and present.

456
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,680
I could sense your heavenly aura.

457
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,560
I'm certain you were once an immortal of the Nine Heavens.

458
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,440
Therefore, I addressed you as such. I meant no offense.

459
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,500
 You're actually an immortal? 

460
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,320
 One's success should be shared. 

461
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,320
 When you become an actual immortal, don't forget about me. 

462
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,820
 Yan Dan, you're still alive. 

463
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:48,740
 Even in the Mortal Realm, you're still with His Majesty. 

464
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,420
Your Highness?

465
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,280
Your Highness?

466
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,420
Since you're a Taoist priest, how did you become a concubine?

467
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,640
Why do you carry a cleansing talisman?

468
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,660
It's a long story.

469
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,860
This is not the place to discuss it.

470
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:14,020
You were ordered to dispel the vengeful souls, yet you are here.

471
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,720
Have you encountered some issues?

472
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,360
There are over a thousand buildings here.

473
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,020
There are countless clues to find.

474
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:24,640
Since I ran into you today, we were meant to meet each other.

475
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,420
Why not come to my palace?

476
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,040
Perhaps I could offer you some assistance.

00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,400
 The lust potion is a great aphrodisiac. 

478
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,680
 It worked on the King of Andu. 

479
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,340
 Now, His Majesty is mortal. 

480
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,220
 He won't be able to resist. 

481
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:25,600
 If I can bewitch him and absorb his heavenly power... who cares about being a concubine? 

482
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:31,000
 Even the King of Andu won't be a threat to me.

00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:22,280
♫   My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves   ♫

486
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:29,240
♫   For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you   ♫

487
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:36,340
♫   If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go?   ♫

488
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:43,440
♫   Turn around and become the delusion of my life  ♫

489
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,580
♫   The most beautiful destiny is hidden in the dark night, "love" is the word for everything   ♫

490
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:57,520
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

491
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:04,620
♫   I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust   ♫

492
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:10,920
♫   Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most  ♫

493
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:18,700
♫   You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers   ♫

494
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:24,980
♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

495
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:32,900
♫   You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine   ♫

496
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:41,560
♫   In my dream, the one I loved is with me   ♫

497
00:44:53,300 --> 00:45:01,040
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

498
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,320
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

499
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:15,140
♫   As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks,  my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable  ♫

500
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:22,320
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

501
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:30,940
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫
