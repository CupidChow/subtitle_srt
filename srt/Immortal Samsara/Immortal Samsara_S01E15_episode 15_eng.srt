 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,439
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai advises people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,860
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,070
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,479
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,179
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams&nbsp;   ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,220
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths&nbsp;   ♫

10
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,799
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,170
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,339
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:21,700
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,679
   

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,950
   

16
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,420
 Yan Dan, I know it was you... 

17
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,660
 who kept me company in the Land Under the Horizon. 

18
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,040
 It was you who gouged your heart out to save me. 

19
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,120
 And the one in my heart... 

20
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,120
 is also you. 

21
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,160
 You can blame me. You can resent me. 

22
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,840
 But I can't watch you die from the punishment of love. 

23
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,800
 Yan Dan... 

24
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,400
 Forgive me. 

25
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,300
Who's there?

26
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,480
Yu Mo!

27
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,020
Yan Dan.

28
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,679
Why are you here? Weren't you grounded?

29
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:28,760
Yan Dan. How did you get this badly hurt?

30
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,140
It was Zhao Lan.

31
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,760
It was Zhao Lan who helped me dismantle the barrier set up by Marshal Huo De.

32
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,539
No one's here right now. Let's hurry and get out of here.

33
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:42,560
Are you crazy?

34
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,799
You would dare break me out of the Heavenly Prison? Do you want to die?

35
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,039
I remember you told me that I should serve you until you are old.

36
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,439
Now that you're in distress and badly injured, I can't just sit by and do nothing.

37
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,720
Yan Dan. You were seriously injured before.

38
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,719
You should know how much the sight of it pained me.

39
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:07,079
So, even if it's just a minute possibility, I will still take it so that no harm will ever come to you again.

40
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,780
I can't run away.

41
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,240
If I flee now, I'll be seen as guilty.

42
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,900
It would be like admitting I really did poison her.

43
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,499
Only by staying here can I prove my innocence. That's why I can't leave.

44
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:22,119
- But... 
 - No more buts.

45
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,480
Don't worry.

46
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:35,600
Emperor Ying Yuan has already promised that he'll send me to Mortal Realm and protect my life.

47
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,980
I can safely leave the Heavenly Court.

48
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,379
Did he really promise you that?

49
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,630
Of course!

50
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:46,420
Didn't His Supreme Majesty also give me his word that I could go through the Mortal Realm hardships on behalf of my sister?

51
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,672
Yu Mo, I've never been to Mortal Realm.

52
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:52,819
How about this? Why don't you go to Mortal Realm first for me?

53
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,700
Find me a beautiful place with green mountains and blue water.

54
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,919
Once I'm in Mortal Realm, I'll meet up with you. Okay?

55
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,739
No.

56
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,559
After three days, wait for me at the Heavenly Gallows.

57
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:08,779
No matter what, I won't let them hurt you again.

58
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:13,339
Once you've fully recovered, let's visit Mortal Realm together.

59
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:20,200
Just like you wrote in your scripts, we'll be two traveling heroes who bring peace to all beings.

60
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,830
What do you think?

61
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,860
Sure.

62
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,440
Oh, right.

63
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,880
Yan Dan.

64
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,400
Egg fried rice?

65
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,440
We ate this when we first met.

66
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,940
I see you've learned how to make it.

67
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,140
Doesn't matter if it was the first time, or the ones after that, even the 100th one...

68
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,740
I won't forget any of the midnight suppers we've had together.

69
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,840
Yu Mo. I'm really happy to have fed a loyal black fish like you.

70
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,260
I'm also really happy to have become your friend.

71
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,860
Me too.

72
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,440
Hurry. Try it.

73
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,299
What do you think? Is it delicious?

74
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,580
 Yu Mo, I'm sorry. 

75
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,460
Your Majesty. Even though Yan Dan is a lowly immortal attendant, she has committed a serious crime.

76
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,200
We should keep a close watch on her.

77
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,430
If there are any mishaps...

78
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,059
I will escort her there myself. There will be no mishaps.

79
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,600
The time has arrived.

80
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,140
Bring Yan Dan to the Heavenly Gallows.

81
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,540
Anyone else not needed will be dismissed.

82
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,760
I really didn't poison her.

83
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't care if others believe me or not.

84
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,120
But can you believe me?

85
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,299
 Yan Dan might still survive the punishment of fire. 

86
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,439
 It's better than serving the fatal punishment that is the punishment of love. 

87
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,080
Since things have come to this, knowing how strict the Heavenly Rules are,

88
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,240
you are to serve your punishment.

89
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,260
So you threw all my belongings out of Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

90
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,920
And today, you'll personally watch me serve my sentence.

91
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,340
Not only do you not believe me,

92
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,840
but do you really hate me this much?

93
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,460
Only law prevails in my heart.

94
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,820
There is no fondness or contempt.

95
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,860
I am merely enforcing the rules today.

96
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,840
You will understand once you step onto the Heavenly Gallows.

97
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,520
Do not resist anymore.

98
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,660
 It seems... 

99
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,959
 what I did in the cottage and in the Heavenly Palace was all for nothing. 

100
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,640
 Not only did you fail to recognize me, but I also failed to discern your true character. 

101
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:34,080
   

102
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,340
 If you regain your sight one day, 

103
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,680
 will you be able to recognize me? 

104
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,180
 I will. 

105
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,320
 But that day will never arrive. 

106
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,040
 I don't care. 

107
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,040
 I'll take it as a promise then. 

108
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,630
 If one day you can't recognize me, I'll throw you off the Bridge of Emptiness! 

109
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,360
This is the Bridge of Emptiness.

110
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,700
The fire sanction is a minor punishment.

111
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,180
It won't put your life at risk.

112
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,899
But if you jump from here, your soul will shatter.

113
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,580
It's not worth it.

114
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,700
You think those who jumped from here were trying to escape the punishment of love.

115
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,940
They jumped from here because they believed there was nothing wrong with their love!

116
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,260
Yan Dan.

117
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,160
Dishonoring the Heavenly Rules is a serious crime.

118
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,540
Do I not carry enough sins as it is?

119
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,480
I did not poison anyone, but I was found guilty of it.

120
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,720
And now...

121
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,480
I'm also guilty of falling in love, guilty of being unwilling to let go, and guilty of showing sympathy.

122
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,440
I want to ask you.

123
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,180
Am I the worst offender ever, or are the Heavenly Rules absurd and abominable?

124
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,300
She fell in love?

125
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,820
You are but a young immortal attendant.

126
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,000
What do you know of love?

127
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,320
Stop talking nonsense.

128
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,420
That's right.

129
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,760
I'm just a little lotus plant.

130
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,319
But I know more about love than a lofty emperor like you.

131
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,480
You once said...

132
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,780
that one day, if I fell in love,

133
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,080
you would kill me yourself.

134
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,240
I've fallen in love already.

135
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,360
So why haven't you ended my life yet?

136
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,019
Your Majesty, this woman has gone mad and violated the Heavenly Rules. This cannot be tolerated!

137
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,579
Do not touch her!

138
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,520
Save whatever you want to say...

139
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,460
until after you've served your sentence.

140
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,620
I want to ask you this.

141
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,000
As an emperor,

142
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,720
you've seen the ups and downs of the Three Realms for tens of thousands of years, seen eons.

143
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,120
In your heart, was there really no one

144
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,420
or nothing that moved your heart?

145
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,160
That made you want to free yourself from the shackles of the Heavenly Rules?

146
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,200
Yan Dan. The answer you seek...

147
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,580
isn't as important as your life.

148
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,819
Do you not understand?

149
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:38,960
But I want that answer right now!

150
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:49,040
Whether it was in Yanxu Heavenly Palace, or in the cottage in the Land Under the Horizon,

151
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,380
no matter the time, the location, or the nature of your feelings,

152
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,200
did you ever have me in your heart?

153
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,920
My heart is devoted to all beings.

154
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,620
There is no room for anything else.

155
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:42,340
 Ying Yuan, I stood on the Heavenly Gallows for you once before. I won't do it a second time. 

156
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:51,200
 The agarwood ember flickered wearily, the ash scattered endlessly. 

157
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,060
The throes of my previous life were all in vain.

158
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,840
And further longing...

159
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,980
has no meaning.

160
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,800
 If I knew it would end like this, 

161
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,100
 I wish the lotus never had bloomed. 

162
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,200
What a fool.

163
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,650
   

164
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,220
Where is Yan Dan? Where is Yan Dan?!

165
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,700
She jumped off the Bridge of Emptiness.

166
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,600
For those who jump from this bridge, in the best-case scenario, their immortal spirit will be shattered.

167
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,319
Their immortal connection will be severed, and they can never be a deity again.

168
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:52,920
In the worst-case scenario, their soul will disintegrate and disappear into emptiness.

169
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,840
Yan Dan!

170
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,359
What exactly happened?!

171
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:20,179
After His Supreme Majesty learned that Emperor Ying Yuan jumped off the bridge too, he set this barrier up in a fit of fury.

172
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:24,640
He ordered that no one is to set foot in this place.

173
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,480
It's all my fault.

174
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,919
If I had noticed something unusual about you earlier and have left with you...

175
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,240
none of this would have happened.

176
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,860
 Yan Dan, don't worry. 

177
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:09,520
 Whether you're in the far corners of the world or in the depths of hell, I will find you. 

178
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,440
Emperor Ying Yuan?

179
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,740
I preserved some of your immortal power for the time being.

180
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,220
Your immortal spirit has completely shattered.

181
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,740
I'm afraid it can never recover.

182
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,000
On the bridge just now... you made yourself clear.

183
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,200
Why did you follow me here and save me?

184
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,940
You need not go through this hassle for me.

185
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:32,880
I know. You didn't tell me you saved me in order to protect your sister.

186
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,440
So...

187
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,120
you knew it was me all along.

188
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,540
You remembered our promise.

189
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,840
You know everything.

190
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,259
Then why did you say those hurtful words on the bridge?

191
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:07,560
Now that your immortal spirit and connection are gone, you will not be able to return to the Heavenly Court.

192
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,520
We'll have to bid farewell to each other here.

193
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,180
Night Forgetting River.

194
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,560
So... you didn't come for me.

195
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,740
You're here to send me off.

196
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,280
Immortals aren't allowed to fall in love.

197
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,640
This is the destiny of those in the Heavenly Realm.

198
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,480
No one can escape from it.

199
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:59,040
Even though I recognized you, the sacred Heavenly Rules... must be upheld.

200
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,980
All right, then.

201
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,020
If that's true...

202
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,240
Why did you jump off the Bridge of Emptiness with me?

203
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,100
Why did you risk your life to save me?

204
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:21,620
Why do you give me hope over and over again, just to destroy it in front of me?

205
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,740
I owe my eyes and half of my heart to you.

206
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,680
I can't possibly repay you.

207
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,080
You owe me more than that.

208
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,060
And this.

209
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,780
The Butterfly of Lucid Dreams is forbidden in Heavenly Realm.

210
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,420
It should never have existed.

211
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,820
In the Land Under the Horizon, you used agarwood embers to persuade me to live.

212
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,240
Yan Dan.

213
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,220
Do you know that it is symbolic of something else?

214
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,580
It has a tangible form and emits a formless fragrance.

215
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,060
This is it's essence.

216
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:46,700
In other words, it both has a form and doesn't have a form.

217
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,540
When it takes shape...

218
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,920
it's time to meet.

219
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,580
When it turns formless...

220
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,900
it's time to part.

221
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,460
I finally understand.

222
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,700
It's time for us to go our separate ways.

223
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,660
It's time to let go.

224
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,059
The living have their world and so do the dead.

225
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,080
The land of the deceased is called the Night Forgetting River.

226
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,200
I'm Yi Zang, the guide here.

227
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,999
Miss, you trespassed into this place and your soul is damaged.

228
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:42,639
Only by traversing the Night Forgetting River and erasing your previous life can you take the Afterlife Path and leave this place.

229
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:45,359
You will become a mortal and enter the Mortal Realm.

230
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,400
I will guide you across this river.

231
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,320
And if I can't?

232
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,080
I've held this position for millennia.

233
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,600
Most can cross this river within a day.

234
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,860
But there are some who might want to remember their previous life a little longer.

235
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,979
If you cannot traverse the river today, you can rest in the inn and try again the next day.

236
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,400
Every passenger carries a lantern.

237
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,220
This lantern contains your memories.

238
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,779
When you step into the Forgetting River, the lantern will light up.

239
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:29,500
And when you let go of your memories, your lantern will extinguish.

240
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:03,520
The moment I jumped off the Bridge of Emptiness, I was ready to die.

241
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:12,660
But if I have the chance to live, I'll forget about you, forget about us.

242
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,940
I will start over.

243
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:24,020
What you're too afraid to admit... I'll make sure it's seared in your mind.

244
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,900
You owe me.

245
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:35,300
As my compensation, I want you to watch me as I enter the Night Forgetting River

246
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,540
and witness how I forget you completely.

247
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,880
 Yan Dan. I'm sorry. 

248
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,180
 Forgive me for having pulled a sleight of hand with the cocoon. 

249
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,900
 Only by doing this... 

250
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,080
 will you give up completely. 

251
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,080
Your Majesty, you aren't a passenger.

252
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,539
The hellish aura here will harm your health. Please return.

253
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,000
I will... once I see her off.

254
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:56,760
Passengers will have to let go of their previous life to enter the Afterlife Path.

255
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:03,220
If you keep standing here, she might not be able to let go of you.

256
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,260
 This is the only thing... I can do for you. 

257
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,020
Your Supreme Majesty.

258
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,659
What an eventful day today.

259
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,220
First, the heavenly soldiers came with bad news.

260
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,280
Then the Heavenly Prosecutor came to ask questions.

261
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,179
Other immortals submitted memorials too.

262
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,380
You must be here for the same thing, right?

263
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,720
I violated the Heavenly Rules and entered the Night Forgetting River.

264
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,639
I'm here to accept my punishment.

265
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,940
So you know there's a punishment?

266
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,359
The war just ended, and there are a thousand things to get done.

267
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:14,339
As the Emperor, you should set an example for the Three Realms.

268
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,920
But instead, you violated the Heavenly Rules.

269
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,180
Do you admit your guilt?

270
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,040
Yes, I do.

271
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,300
I've let you down, Your Supreme Majesty.

272
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,860
Enough. Get up.

273
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,260
Get up!

274
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,019
Enough already.

275
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,260
Thankfully, you came back before this got out of hand.

276
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,180
As for this matter, I'll have someone take care of it.

277
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,140
Go reflect upon yourself.

278
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,020
There's no need to show me leniency, Your Supreme Majesty.

279
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,720
I wish to be punished.

280
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,980
Please agree to my request.

281
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,780
 Greetings, Your Supreme Majesty, Your Majesty. 

282
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,880
Emperor Ying Yuan you are extremely powerful.

283
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,359
Who wounded you like this?

284
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:21,300
Do not worry, Marshal. I'm all right.

285
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,180
I'm glad to hear that.

286
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,659
So what is happening?

287
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:31,339
I waited next to the Heavenly Gallows for a long time, but the criminal is yet to be seen.

288
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,920
Sorry for the long wait, Marshal.

289
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,920
The criminal is here.

290
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,220
   

291
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,420
Ying Yuan, are you aware of the implications of choosing the punishment of love?

292
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,939
The war just ended.

293
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,420
The number of immortals in the Nine Heavens has dwindled.

294
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,460
You're the only emperor left.

295
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,700
Worry not, Your Supreme Majesty.

296
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,000
I survived the war, and I shall cherish my life.

297
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,960
However, I did commit this crime, so I shall be adequately punished.

298
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,759
I will preserve enough immortal power to keep myself alive so that I can serve the Heavenly Realm.

299
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,940
Please punish me, Your Supreme Majesty.

300
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:30,300
Your Supreme Majesty, I have served His Majesty and I can attest to his selfless dedication to the people.

301
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,530
I'm sure His Majesty didn't intend to violate the Heavenly Rules.

302
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,540
Please... Your Supreme Majesty, pardon him.

303
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,719
Your Supreme Majesty, Emperor Ying Yuan didn't commit the most heinous of crimes.

304
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,199
Besides, I promised I would give him the Letter of Immunity yesterday.

305
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,040
Your Supreme Majesty, let's just end this here.

306
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,580
No need to plead on my behalf, Marshal.

307
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,420
I made a mistake.

308
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,760
I failed His Supreme Majesty's education and let my colleagues down.

309
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,480
I also did her wrong.

310
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,760
I wonder which one is more painful.

311
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,360
This punishment, or the act of gouging one's heart out?

312
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,800
Your Supreme Majesty, His Majesty was merely affected by Yan Dan.

313
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,579
Please remove her from His Majesty's memory.

314
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:18,159
If the root of the problem is eradicated, he won't commit the offense again and there'll be no need for further punishment.

315
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:24,780
Your Supreme Majesty, His Majesty has served the Heavenly Realm for many years.

316
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,460
Please don't subject him to more torture.

317

I have taken out some of your memories.

318
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,219
Once they disappear, you'll forget about this woman.

Why must you remain so adamant?!

339
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,420
Your Supreme Majesty.

340
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,480
I'm not willing to forget her.

341
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:44,260
From now on... I'll remove all distractions.

342

I'll devote everything to protecting the peace of the Three Realms.

How could Emperor Ying Yuan be as stubborn as Yan Dan, that girl!
