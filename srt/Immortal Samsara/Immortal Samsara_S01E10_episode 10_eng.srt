 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,540
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai advises people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,860
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,170
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,479
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,180
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,000
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,900
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,270
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,340
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:22,000
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,679
   

15
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:30,050
   

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,359
 Fortunately, I found some Millennial Dark Ice from the Heavenly Infirmary. I wonder if it'll work. 

17
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:03,880
 Back then, in Yanxu Heavenly Palace, I hoped you would lose all your powers one day, so that I could make fun of you. 

18
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,640
 Now that it has happened, I do not feel the least bit happy. 

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:15,419
 If possible, I rather go back to when you were the know-it-all vile Emperor who teased me every day. 

20
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,979
Oh, no! Why is he freezing?

21
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,829
♫   My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the yellow ground at dusk   ♫

22
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:30,829
♫   For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you   ♫

23
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:37,769
♫   If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go?   ♫

24
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:44,979
♫   Turn around and compose a delusion for me   ♫

25
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:52,019
♫   The most beautiful destiny is hidden in the dark night, "love" is the word for everything   ♫

26
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:58,959
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

27
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:06,230
♫   I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust   ♫

28
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:12,309
♫   Life&nbsp;after life, this is the longing I missed the most   ♫

29
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:20,229
♫   You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers  ♫

30
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:26,499
♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

31
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:34,339
♫   You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine  ♫

32
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:43,240
♫   In my dream, the one I loved is with me   ♫

33
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:03,059
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

34
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:09,120
Even before I realized my sentiments, my feelings for you were already deeply entrenched.

35
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,760
So this is what "falling in love without knowing it" feels like.

36
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,419
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

37
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:28,140
 You once said that if I ever fell in love, you wouldn't show mercy in delivering my punishment. 

38
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,440
 And now, it has become reality. 

39
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,720
 If you know these feelings of mine, will you kill me to uphold the Heavenly Rules? 

40
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,280
Emperor Ying Yuan. You're awake.

41
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,659
Do not move. Lie down. Lie down.

42
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,040
What have you done?

43
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,799
These are hot water bottles. They're to keep you warm.

44
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,440
The cold bath might damage your body.

45
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,119
If not for these hot water bottles keeping your body warm, the cold air would penetrate your body and it’d be hard to recuperate.

46
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:11,359
You won't even be able to walk by then. You'd become a cripple!

47
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,440
Nonsense.

48
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,460
Be careful. See?

49
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,419
What did I tell you? Now you're a cripple.

50
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:21,460
That shows you should stay put.

51
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,879
You're still recovering. Do not move around.

52
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:32,100
If you're bored, let's give this house a name.

53
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,120
I heard you're quite well educated.

54
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,960
And I happen to be an avid poem lover.

55
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,900
Why don't we have a match?

56
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,920
   

57
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,940
Emperor Ying Yuan will gladly take on this challenge!

58
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,680
If you can't think of anything now, it's okay.

59
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,740
I'll start first.

60
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,100
 This handwriting... 

61
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,150
   

62
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,560
 I was right. It really is you. 

63
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,519
I got it. Let's call it "Deity Origin Hall."

64
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:49,600
It means that whoever lives here can eventually ascend to divinity.

65
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,470
   

66
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,260
Your turn now.

67
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,120
 In the Nine Heavens, only you are this bold and genuine. 

68
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,600
What's the matter, Emperor Ying Yuan?

69
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,640
Are you okay?

70
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,260
Why are you injured?

71
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,819
Nothing. When I was having dinner last night, I accidentally bit my lips.

72
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,540
 Before I passed out, she tried to transfer her lotus energy to me. 

73
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,580
 Did I cause that injury? 

74
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,880
 I'm about to die. 

75
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,160
 Even though I know who you are, it serves no purpose. 

76
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,040
 I shouldn't hurt you again. 

77
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,419
Why are you so kind today? You healed my wound.

78
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:35,839
When I was fighting with the sword spirit, I broke your hairpin.

79
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,020
Consider this as your compensation.

80
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,220
This is an agarwood hairpin, made from million-year-old mystic wood.

81
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,940
It can heal wounds.

82
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,460
Come closer.

83
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,000
Wear it, and it will heal all your injuries in the future.

84
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,180
We just met a few days ago.

85
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,460
You gave me a bangle and a hairpin.

86
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,740
Are you...

87
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,460
in love with me?

88
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,860
Where are you going? We haven't named this house yet.

89
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,760
The sacred tree has been damaged.

90
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,280
The Land Under the Horizon is in desolation.

91
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,200
With this bleak sight, how can I have the will to live?

92
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,250
    

93
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:31,199
   
 (T/N: "Goudan" sounds like "dog egg", used as a children's pet name) 

94
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Which name did you pick, in the end?

95
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,700
I took one character from both our propositions and combined them.

96
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,480
Which two characters?

97
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
It's best you don't know.

98
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,800
 Emperor Ying Yuan, I won't let you die. 

99
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,100
 From now on, you will protect all living creatures. 

100
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,400
 And I will protect you. 

101
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:41,200
 If someone with a death wish views all the beauty of this world, perhaps he will learn to love his life again. 

102
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,659
 They say a lotus flower can cleanse one's soul and cure everything. 

103
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:49,400
 Not only can it extract fragrance, it can also suppress toxicity. 

104
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,920
 He'll like it, won't he? 

105
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,620
   

106
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,100
 The Land Under the Horizon is dark and cold. 

107
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,900
 It's not good for the training of a plant-based deity. 

108
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,620
 Staying here for too long will be detrimental to her health. 

109
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,700
 I will disappear eventually. 

110
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,900
 I can only leave this light for you. 

111
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,839
Emperor Ying Yuan, how odd.

112
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,319
A lotus pond appeared here overnight.

113
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:09,000
It's filled with lotuses in full bloom.

114
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,619
It was quite dark in the room. And now, it's all lit up!

115
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:13,999
This is a good sign.

116
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,200
The atmosphere here is too cold for plants to grow. There's no way lotuses can bloom here.

117
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,199
It's true! If you don’t believe me, come smell it.

118
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,740
Come. This way.

119
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,340
Let's go.

120
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,860
Careful.

121
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,000
It's such a pleasant fragrance.

122
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,319
It's as good as the lotuses in the Jade Pool.

123
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,440
Even better than them.

124
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,900
Emperor Ying Yuan.

125
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,100
Have a look, such a good-quality lotus can grow in the Land Under the Horizon.

126
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,700
You have to have faith.

127
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,280
Such overwhelming fragrance will only distract people.

128
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,700
Then... I'll take you back inside.

129
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,900
It's suffocating inside. I need some air.

130
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,919
 Acting tough. I know you like it. 

131
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,020
Come with me.

132
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,500
The lotus pond is in front of you.

133
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,800
Emperor Ying Yuan. Sooner or later, plants will grow here.

134
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,620
It'll be lively.

135
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:36,100
If you can see and feel the beauty of this view, you will feel revitalized.

136
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,699
I cannot see anything. Don't waste your time.

137
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:44,000
It's okay. I have ways to show you its beauty.

138
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:18,700
Though you can't see it, but you can feel it by touching it.

139
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,700
Imagine there's a lotus pond in front of you.

140
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,900
The lotuses are in full bloom.

141
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,319
On the left, you have some pink lotuses.

142
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:33,719
On the right, you have some golden ones.

143
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:39,199
And in the corners, some little ones are so shy that they refuse to show their faces.

144
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,700
You might not able to see with your eyes, but you can see me.

145
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,980
 My heart belongs to you. 

146
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,472
 I only want to stay by your side. 

147
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:11,000
♫   At times, the tenderness eases my heart   ♫

148
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,680
♫   Unexpectedly, I can't help but share what I thought was off-limits   ♫

149
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,720
Emperor Ying Yuan.

150
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,100
Do you see the flowers?

151
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,100
 A sinful person is one step away from death. 

152
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,200
 I no longer have freedom. How can I give you hope? 

153
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,780
No.

154
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,880
All my senses have faded.

155
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,680
I cannot see what you drew.

156
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,300
Do not waste your time.

157
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,660
Careful.

158
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,380
We have arrived.

159
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,800
The sacred tree will wilt soon.

160
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,600
Why did you bring me here?

161
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,199
It hasn't wilted yet.

162
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:09,000
Besides, I made a swing for you.

163
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,360
Come.

164
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,300
If you just want to make fun of me, I shall head back.

165
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,900
You have lived for several millennia.

166
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,480
Have you ever truly been happy?

167
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,519
Forget about being an emperor now. Be a child, for once.

168
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:41,290
♫   That is the worst outcome   ♫

169
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:47,060
♫   I have experienced the intertwined threads of love like a brocade   ♫

170
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:54,190
♫   Yet I'm lost in my vulnerability   ♫

171
00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:02,230
♫   Only if there's a sigh of relief in the ruthlessness   ♫

172
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,889
♫   I can see how tenderness can ease only half my heart   ♫

173
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:12,310
♫   Even more so, I can't help but share what I thought was off-limits   ♫

174
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:19,900
♫   I blame time for the mortal world's woe is on your shoulder   ♫

175
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:26,900
♫   Like the surging tides of stars, I continuously ask where the origin of love comes from   ♫

176
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:34,209
♫   I'm afraid the tears brimming in the corner of my eyes will fall  and blur your silhouette   ♫

177
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:43,760
♫   In my momentary childishness, with everything that I am, my path all leans towards you   ♫

178
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:53,849
♫   Counting the passing of the seasons, no matter which directions, everything moves towards you   ♫

179
00:19:53,849 --> 00:20:00,600
♫   The beauty is in the burning agarwood incense, there's still hope when the ashes settled   ♫

180
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:08,319
♫   Hear the beautiful prose with a fine beauty and a picturesque view, they pair well together   ♫

181
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,790
♫   Sew two hearts together and a stem sprouts forth   ♫

182
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:18,900
♫   Understand the wind, think about the rain, and do not awaken from the dream   ♫

183
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:28,800
♫   Just let me linger all day and night   ♫

184
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,160
Emperor Ying Yuan.

185
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,940
Emperor Ying Yuan.

186
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,700
Emperor Ying Yuan, you won't die.

187
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,380
You'll live.

188
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,000
I'll save you.

189
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,160
I'll find a way to save you.

190
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,740
I...

191
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,060
I...

192
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,960
 I was able to spend some time with you in this cottage. 

193
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,220
 I have... no more regrets. 

194
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,860
What are you doing?

195
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,600
I went to pray for you in a temple.

196
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,500
They say it'll be more effective if I can get the hair of the one I pray for.

197
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,779
Hair has so many uses, you know.

198
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:10,600
In the Mortal Realm, there is a myth that when a couple in love

199
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,680
tie a knot with both of their hair, they will remain together for three lives.

200
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,800
I do not believe in this superstition. Give me back my hair.

201
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,420
What have you lighted?

202
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,640
Why doesn't the fire poison within me take effect frequently?

203
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,920
It's just normal agarwood.

204
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,260
What kind of agarwood?

205
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,140
How does it suppress the fire poison?

206
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,240
Why have I never heard of it before?

207
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,539
This is my area of interest.

208
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,139
Since you don't pay attention to this, you naturally don't know as much as I do.

209
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,619
You can learn a life lesson from it.

210
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,639
It wilts as it provides fragrance. When it dies, new agarwood will sprout.

211
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:04,560
As you can see, life and death are not absolute.

212
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:10,800
Even a small piece of agarwood will go through the cycle and continue to release fragrance.

213
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,240
The same applies to you.

214
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,080
Emperor Ying Yuan, you will survive this trial and be reborn anew.

215
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,360
There's no need to waste more time on me.

216
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,260
Even though you can delay the toxins, the Fire of Lost Rationality has no antidote.

217
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,300
What if I tell you there is an antidote?

218
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,700
What do you mean?

219
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,660
I heard from the Heavenly Infirmary...

220
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,720
that there's something called "Four-Leaf Lotus—"

221
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,440
Enough!

222
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:59,760
The fact that I didn't die in the Divine-Devil War is already a grave sin.

223
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,147
We all have our own destinies.

224
00:24:02,147 --> 00:24:09,780
If the trial I suffer now can only be relieved by someone else's life, I would rather die a thousand times!

225
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,079
Do not do anything stupid! Do you hear me?

226
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,600
Why are you so angry?

227
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,360
Promise me!

228
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,479
A-All right. I promise.

229
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,340
Can you calm down now?

230
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,480
Please calm down.

231
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,700
I am calm.

232
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,259
Emperor Ying Yuan.

233
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,940
Do not follow me.

234
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,580
 This tree still has its vitality. 

235
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:28,380
 After the Sealed Spirit spell was cast, the sacred tree should have wilted in five days. 

236
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,880
 Why is it still alive? 

237
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,220
 It's Yan Dan. 

238
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,299
 Emperor Ying Yuan. Sooner or later, plants will grow here. 

239
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,000
 It'll be lively. 

240
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,100
 If you can see and feel the beauty of this view, you will feel revitalized. 

241
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,420
 How foolish are you?  

242
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,440
You should just let this tree wilt.

243
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,900
Why spend your divine powers to keep it alive?

244
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,680
  Emperor Ying Yuan, you found out about my little trick! 

245
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,100
 Even though the sacred tree is fake, my wish remains sincere. 

246
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,900
 I wish you a speedy recovery and great health. 

247
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,600
 Do not seek death anymore. 

248
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,980
 Yan Dan. 

249
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,940
 What should I do with you? 

250
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,160
 What should I do with myself? 

251
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,760
 The first law of the Heavenly Court forbids falling in 
love. 

252
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,360
 Do not repeat your mother's mistake! 

253
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,900
 The three other Emperors are dead, and I cannot fight any longer. 

254
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,660
 Ying Yuan, where are you? 

255
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,860
 Vile Emperor, live for me. Won't you? 

256
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,020
 I don't want you to die. 

257
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,620
You must be dreaming about the Divine-Devil War again.

258
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,680
Emperor Ying Yuan.

259
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,599
We have won. Don't be afraid. Don't worry.

260
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:28,779
I'm here. We have won.

261
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,520
Don't worry.

262
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,820
   

263
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,360
Lu Ming!

264
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,219
I told you to look for information on the Four Emperors.

265
00:27:50,219 --> 00:27:52,320
Have you found it?

266
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,620
Why are you studying them all of a sudden?

267
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,590
Do you want to write a new play?

268
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,680
   

269
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,300
Wait, no.

270
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,400
You're sulking.

271
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,340
Are you in trouble again?

272
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,219
Now I know that the willingness to be rescued is also a kind of mercy.

273
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:24,460
You once told me you had a pet moth that could bring its user into someone else's dreams. Is it true?

274
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,260
What pet moth? It's called the "Butterfly of Lucid Dreams."

275
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:33,380
It's also an ancient creature like you. It's very precious.

276
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,660
Unfortunately, I could never get it to metamorphose, even after nurturing it for several centuries.

277
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,940
Is it that hard to take care of?

278
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,360
It's not just picky. It's meant to live in the Ninth Heaven.

279
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,040
Why do you ask?

280
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,860
Can you lend it to me?

281
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,139
Don't worry.

282
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,339
I studied under Immortal Lord Bei Ming.

283
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,220
I raised Yu Mo myself!

284
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,800
A moth is nothing, after all that.

285
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,380
Just lend it to me.

286
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,499
Someone's been having nightmares.

287
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,539
I want to protect him in his dreams. Lend it to me, please.

288
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:07,740
All right.

289
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,300
Thank you.

290
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,700
Emperor Ying Yuan!

291
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,879
Emperor Ying Yuan! I made a huge discovery.

292
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:44,719
You're as fussy as always.

293
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:49,719
Your birthday is in three days. Let's celebrate it!

294
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:53,079
I am immortal. I don't celebrate birthdays.

295
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:59,260
If you want to celebrate my birthday, just light an incense during my funeral after I retreat into the void...

296
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,520
Okay, that's enough. You started mumbling again.

297
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,379
This might be your last birthday.

298
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,820
If you do not oblige, I will keep pestering you.

299
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,739
What do you think? Isn’t this a thoughtful gift?

300
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:23,299
It's too big. What a waste of resources.

301
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,640
I wanted to give you a taste of luxury.

302
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,960
That way, you won't have to sleep in a small coffin!

303
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,499
Besides, I'll accompany you.

304
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:38,540
You won't want to leave alone!

305
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,779
What the heck?

306
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,820
Don't overexert yourself if your power is dwindling!

307
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,280
Your hand.

308
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,700
Shameless.

309
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,120
Emperor Ying Yuan, I made a small red paper cut-out of you.

310
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,739
It looks exactly like you.

311
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,540
Touch it.

312
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,420
Don't crumple it!

313
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,240
Give it back to me.

314
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,020
Give me a moment.

315
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,600
We'll take this as your funeral.

316
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,560
The red paper cut-out died for you, and now you have been reborn.

317
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,240
I know you haven't celebrated your birthday in the past million years.

318
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,160
You will take today as the day of your rebirth!

319
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,140
Where did you learn all this from?

320
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,300
Emperor Ying Yuan. Happy Birthday.

321
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,799
Maybe this birthday is no different from your previous birthdays.

322
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:59,320
But for me, this is the first birthday I can celebrate with you.

323
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:07,779
Others might see you as the prominent protector of the Three Realms.

324
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:16,040
But in my eyes, you are... a stubborn coward

325
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,240
who would rather die than live a meaningful life.

326
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:27,580
However, this Emperor Ying Yuan is more genuine,

327
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,960
compared to the high and mighty Emperor Ying Yuan on his throne.

328
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:41,760
Emperor Ying Yuan, my only wish is that you can let go of all your shackles.

329
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,240
You're not someone's hero nor the descendant of any bloodline.

330
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,520
You're just you.

331
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:53,260
I want you to be a carefree, ordinary person called Ying Yuan.

332
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,700
Today is an unusual day.

333
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,340
For the past ten millennia, I spent my birthdays

334
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,080
at work, or on the battlefield.

335
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,160
This is the only exception.

336
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,440
Thank you.

337
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,280
Don't move.

338
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,400
How dare you!

339
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,000
It wasn't a prank.

340
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,530
In the Mortal Realm, they say that if you make a wish with a deity's eyelash, it will come true.

341
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,340
I'm serious!

342
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,040
Is that so?

343
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,300
Then let's try it together.

344
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,979
 I surrender to my fate and am willing to look past life and death. 

345
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:25,200
 With my grave sins, I have no other wish but to see Yan Dan spend her life in happiness, unharmed by woes. 

346
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,339
 Gods and deities, please lend us your aid so that Emperor Ying Yuan can vanquish the fire poison and make a full recovery. 

347
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:33,400
 No matter how much he wishes to die, please ignore him. 

348
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,380
 I am counting on you! 

349
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,200
Emperor Ying Yuan, what wish did you make?

350
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,500
What's the matter?

351
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,740
Emperor Ying Yuan?

352
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,380
Emperor Ying Yuan? Are you okay?

353
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,559
 Didn't I say those two girls hold spectacular mystic potential? 

354
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:33,339
 Not only did they make all the lotuses in the pool bloom, they also attracted Emperor Ying Yuan, who doesn’t like to socialize. 

355
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:36,640
 Emperor Ying Yuan can finally take a break. 

356
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,239
 After you said that, he will have to head back to work again soon. 

357
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,560
 Emperor Ying Yuan. The Six Realms are at peace now. 

358
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,940
 Nothing bad is happening. 

359
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,460
 You can finally let go of your burdens. 

360
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,580
 Look! The North Sea is over there. 

361
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,099
 The East Sea is there! 

362
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,520
 The ones in the middle are the mountains and the rivers in the Mortal Realm. 

363
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,880
 I have never been to the Mortal Realm. I want to visit it! 

364
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,520
 When you are no longer an Emperor, why don’t you become a wandering deity like me? 

365
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:49,560
 Then we'll visit the Three Realms and all the seas, see all the beauty there is in the world, and have a taste of mortal life. Okay? 

366
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,040
 Sure. 

367
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,220
 We shall take our time to travel and explore. 

368
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,219
 So you can actually smile genuinely like that. 

369
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,480
 I wonder what you're dreaming of. 

370
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,780
Emperor Ying Yuan?

371
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,419
Oh, no. The fire poison is acting up again.

372
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:46,980
I cannot wake him up now and disturb his sweet dream.

373
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,820
The poison has spread this far.

374
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,220
How did you endure it?

375
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,490
This can’t be it!

376
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,380
Emperor Ying Yuan.

377
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,380
 For thousands of years, 

378
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,740
 I have never been like this, letting down my guard in front of others. 

379
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,780
 But you're different. 

380
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:39,673
 You made me see that I could be a free man. 

381
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:49,493
 There's a mountain over there. It contains various sceneries. 

382
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,000
 Let's go have a look together. 

383
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,620
 I have never been this happy before. 

384
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,100
 Even though you try to hide it, 

385
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,380
 I've always known. 

386
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:11,930
