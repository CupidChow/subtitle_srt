 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,600
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,820
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,070
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,120
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,020
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,320
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,900
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,570
   

15
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,950
   

16
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,540
Why do you need to dress up as a man? Don't mess  around.

17
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,020
Should I really go there dressed as a lady?

18
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,440
Am I there to steal their business? We're here to find clues.

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,960
We have to keep a low profile, and doing that in a man's outfit is way more convenient.

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,040
Yan Dan is right.

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,870
You'll never find out what's truly on your mind if you refuse to fully experience the mortal world.

22
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,920
I'm not going.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,540
- Quit acting. Just go.  
 - Let's go.

24
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,775
   

25
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,300
- Young Master, have some wine. 
 - Thank you.

26
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,020
Young Master, here is some wine for you.

27
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,440
Tang Zhou. Drink it.

28
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,200
Who is this?

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,780
She's the most beautiful lady here, Miss Fu Shuang.

30
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,380
 Bravo. 

31
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,020
Bravo. Well done, Miss Fu Shuang!

32
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,620
You're such a great dancer, Miss Fu Shuang.

33
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,560
If you could spend a night with me...

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,760
Young Master, please behave yourself.

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,320
I'll pay you 1,000 gold pieces.

36
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,760
We're dancers, not prostitutes.

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,980
That's inappropriate!

38
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,400
Xiao Qi is known for being a womanizer.

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,820
Fu Shuang is really unlucky to be this man's target.

40
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,370
Why do you say so?

41
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,490
In town, people know Xiao Qi as the rich man, but he's actually a sexual predator.

42
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:34,800
He takes advantage of girls with sedative incense.

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,420
Many girls have fallen victim to him.

44
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,620
The local government backs the Xiao family.

45
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,460
No one can do anything to him.

46
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,660
Look. This is the clue we're looking for.

47
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,760
Thanks, Young Master Xiao, for the invitation.

48
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,140
However, I think there's a misunderstanding on Young Master Xiao's part.

49
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,440
Indulgence House  is a dance hall, not a brothel.

50
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,120
The ladies here earn their living by performing.

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,060
If Young Master Xiao wants someone to spend a night with,

52
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,940
I'm afraid you can't fulfill that wish at Indulgence House.

53
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,320
Fu Shuang. Here, have a drink with Young Master Xiao.

54
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,400
Wait a minute. This glass of wine is worth 1,000 gold pieces.

55
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,080
She can't drink it just like that.

56
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,060
We need to cross our arms.

57
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,820
Am I right?

58
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,640
What a scoundrel.

59
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,750
If he's not afraid of the government, I guess I'll have to teach him a good lesson.

60
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,600
Where did this stupid bird come from?

61
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,380
Even a parrot knows how to read the situation and enjoy the performance quietly.

62
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,840
However, a certain shameless man here is not even aware that he has ruined everyone's mood.

63
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,660
This bird knows how to behave better than this man.

64
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,040
Little bird. Am I right?

65
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,520
Bad man! Bad man!

66
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,460
Thank you, Young Master Liu.

67
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,460
I wouldn't be able to perform well today if you weren't part of the audience.

68
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,800
Who are you?

69
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,460
I'm offering the lady 1,000 gold pieces to drink with me. It's none of your business!

70
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,990
Stay out of this if you can't pay, or I'll beat you up!

71
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,560
I will teach you a lesson today.

72
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,980
I'll show you how to treat a beautiful lady with respect.

73
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,520
Miss Fu Shuang. I can offer you 1,000 gold pieces as well.

74
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,260
I wonder if you would like to drink with me.

75
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:04,200
I would do it even if you offer nothing.

76
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,960
Fine. What a shrew!

77
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,900
I didn't know Indulgence House was a place full of liars!

78
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,280
Just wait! I'll tell the government to shut this place down!

79
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,540
Just you wait!

80
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,400
Young Master Xiao, I'm so sorry.

81
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,580
I have an idea. Listen.

82
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,140
Why don't you question Xiao Qi?

83
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,020
I'm sure Liu Weiyang is hiding something.

84
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,140
I'll find out what he knows.

85
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,940
Yan Dan. He is a very powerful man.

86
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,700
Be careful.

87
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,020
I've got this.

88
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,220
You can always count on me.

89
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,600
What are you doing?

90
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,980
It's been a while since I last used it.

91
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,160
You're punishing the wrong person.

92
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,320
Quit acting.

93
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,980
Please find the right person if you're seeking revenge.

94
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,160
I, Xiao Qi, swear on my life that I've never used this drug on men.

95
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,860
You only bully helpless women.

96
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,680
Aren't you ashamed of that?

97
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,980
Since you're so good at using drugs, do you recognize this one?

98
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,020
I never intended to hide this from you.

99
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,200
Those men are the only ones who dare use a sedative like this.

100
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,320
I dare not upset them!

101
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,760
- Who are they? 
 - People from Shenxiao Palace.

102
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,680
This narcotic is an ecstasy powder made by the people of Shenxiao Palace.

103
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,180
Stop lying.

104
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,060
I've never heard of Shenxiao Palace before?

105
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,960
He's not lying.

106
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,140
It hasn't been long since you left the mountain, so you haven't heard about it yet.

107
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,820
There is a secret organization in the mortal world named the Shenxiao Palace.

108
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,960
Shenxiao Palace is very secretive.

109
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,060
No one knows where it is located, and who the master is.

110
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,560
The disciples of Shenxiao Palace are also known as the elusive bunch.

111
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,580
I didn't expect that we would ever be targeted by them.

112
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,540
Young Master, you're really knowledgeable.

113
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,120
That's exactly what happened.

114
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,680
Plum blossoms are Shenxiao Palace's symbol.

115
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,170
All disciples of the palace wear a tattoo of a three-petal plum blossom.

116
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,580
They don't easily expose their tattoo.

117
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,660
I studied the medicine made by Shenxiao Palace.

118
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,240
Most of the herbs are harvested from Zhucui Mountain.

119
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,510
I'd assume Shenxiao Palace is not far from Zhucui Mountain.

120
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,650
I once smelled a very strong scent of sweet flags

121
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,640
when I was in the backyard of Indulgence House.

122
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,580
If I ever see you doing anything wicked again, I'll kill you.

123
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,320
I'll leave now. I'll leave now!

124
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,920
We'll spend a night here and visit the backyard of Indulgence House later at night.

125
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,000
Then we'll find out what exactly is going on, and if he was telling the truth.

126
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,420
What's going on?

127
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,020
I thought Liu Weiyang was an honest person.

128
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,260
Little did I know he is also an evil man.

129
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,380
Let me teach you a lesson.

130
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,600
Why are you acting all secretive?

131
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,120
Young Master!

132
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,080
It's the itching spell.

133
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,680
Young Master...

134
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,820
Miss Fu Shuang, don't worry.

135
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,300
This pervert won't dare do anything inappropriate to you again.

136
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,740
But...

137
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,580
Don't worry. There's no need to defend him.

138
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,500
I saw him stabbing you with a needle!

139
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,000
From now on, I'll have your back. Don't worry.

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,100
Young Master, there must be a misunderstanding.

141
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,460
All the ladies of Indulgence House love wearing tattoos of plants or animals.

142
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,300
The butterfly tattoo on my arm is fading.

143
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,800
That's why I asked Young Master Liu to help touch up the tattoo with a needle.

144
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,280
Young Master Liu is a regular here.

145
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,420
He's a very good friend to all the ladies in the house.

146
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,020
He always helps us chase away rude men.

147
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,460
We can't even thank him enough, let alone see him as our enemy.

148
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,340
You... You just made the atmosphere really awkward.

149
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,400
Young Master Liu, it's just a misunderstanding.

150
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,860
With your lousy skill and judgment, are you really trying to play the hero?

151
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,500
Please... It's just a misunderstanding.

152
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,520
What a coincidence. You carry the scent of a lotus.

153
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,700
My pets love lotus seeds the most.

154
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,260
You actually know how to manipulate birds?

155
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,520
Conflicts often occur at Indulgence House. I need to know a few skills.

156
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,210
Otherwise, the beautiful ladies of the house will get bullied by those shameless men

157
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,940
when they run into incidences like what we witnessed today.

158
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,800
Help me!

159
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,980
Bad thing!

160
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,320
It's just a misunderstanding!

161
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,540
- Young Master Liu. I think Young Master Yan meant well. 
 - It's a misunderstanding!

162
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,020
Since it's just a misunderstanding, why don't you just let him go?

163
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,780
Since Miss Fu Shuang has interceded for him,

164
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,220
I'll let him go.

165
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,620
What's happening?

166
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,840
You're lucky that Liu Weiyang let you go.

167
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,600
You do look a mess, but at least your face is intact.

168
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,700
Although Young Master Liu is discourteous, he's quite hilarious.

169
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,900
Do you really trust him? I don't!

170
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,280
He's considerate and smart and is not greedy for power and fame.

171
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,420
He's the perfect man. So is he paying for his misdeeds by protecting the girls here?

172
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
I don't trust him.

173
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,140
Either there's something suspicious about Liu Weiyang,

174
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,780
or Indulgence House is hiding something from the people.

175
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,640
What are they hiding?

176
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,720
The dance hall has its own apothecary?

177
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,053
And they even stock  a wide variety of drugs?

178
00:13:20,053 --> 00:13:22,040
This doesn't look normal.

179
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,060
Why are you in the apothecary?

180
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,680
Are you sick?

181
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,860
Sweet flags?

182
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,640
You know the name of this herb?

183
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,340
Young Masters, what's going on here?

184
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,560
Nothing much. They're hungry and just asked me to stir fry some sweet flags for them.

185
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,420
Sweet flag is a unique herb found only on Zhucui Mountain.

186
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,280
It has a crispy texture and tastes refreshing. It's a perfect dish for cooling down in the heat.

187
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,080
Most people in town pair it with wine.

188
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,960
It's one of the local delicacies.

189
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,460
Try some.

190
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,420
It seems like you hate beating around the bush, so I'll cut to the chase.

191
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,440
If it is a food ingredient, why did you keep it with the other medicinal herbs?

192
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,540
Also, it's my first time seeing an apothecary in a dance hall.

193
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,880
You're no doubt from the same circle.

194
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,560
You don't trust people easily.

195
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,260
The ladies in the house spend most of their time dancing.

196
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,820
They'll certainly get a few wounds here and there.

197
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:59,480
Moreover, if there are patrons who intend to drug them, it's better for us to prepare the cure in-house.

198
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,800
Sweet flags is also used as medicine to eliminate phlegm and cure chest stuffiness.

199
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,320
You've only spoken about the use of sweet flags as a medicine.

200
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,060
Do you know any other ways of using it?

201
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,440
Did you run into anyone from Shenxiao Palace?

202
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,160
There are only two ways to use sweet flags.

203
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,620
You either use it to eliminate phlegm and cure chest stuffiness, or use it as a sedative.

204
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,840
The people of Shenxiao Palace are the only ones who know how to make the sedative.

205
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,640
Do you know anything else about Shenxiao Palace?

206
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,840
Shenxiao Palace is extremely secretive.

207
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,120
I've lived in Indulgence House for a long time, and I've certainly heard a thing or two about them.

208
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,820
It's said that the palace master of Shenxiao Palace has been looking for a divine tool named Truth Duster.

209
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,280
I heard that Truth Duster is a divine tool.

210
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,640
In the hands of someone who doesn't know how to use it, it becomes nothing more than a normal duster.

211
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,280
- Young Master Tang, are you— 
 - Young Master Liu.

212
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,200
This is our personal grudge against Shenxiao Palace.

213
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,780
That's all we can say.

214
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,880
We kindly ask for your understanding.

215
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,420
Understood.

216
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,860
Relationships between clans are really complex.

217
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,820
I also don't want to interfere in other people's business.

218
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,590
However, since fate brought us together, let me remind you of this.

219
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,580
If I'm not mistaken, you were targeted by the members of Shenxiao Palace

220
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,760
the moment you set foot in Zhucui Town.

221
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,240
There's no need to keep looking for clues.

222
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,100
If what the palace master wants is Truth Duster, he'll approach you sooner or later.

223
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,540
Make sure you're prepared to face him by then.

224
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,140
It seems I'll have to enjoy this plate of sweet flags by myself.

225
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,540
Is he a friend or an enemy?

226
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,140
I'm so confused.

227
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,710
This place is a mixed bag.

228
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,580
If we stay here a few more days, we might  learn more about Shenxiao Palace.

229
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,500
Even if they do find us here, we'll be ready to face them by then.

230
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,610
This is a nice and picturesque place.

231
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,080
It has all of the Six Senses of the Mortal Realm that affect the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.

232
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,160
You can find all of them here.

233
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,850
If we stay here a few more days, not only can we find clues, but we can also gain some life experiences.

234
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,710
I'm totally up for it!

235
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,600
Liu Weiyang knows Shenxiao Palace very well.

236
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,630
However, his answers were really vague when he was asked crucial questions.

237
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,540
I'm worried that he was trying to learn more about us.

238
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,920
That's not necessarily true. It could be the other way around.

239
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,710
You mentioned those men of the Shenxiao Palace have a three-petal plus blossom tattoo.

240
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,900
Yes.

241
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,920
Liu Weiyang knows how to tattoo.

242
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,140
Isn't it suspicious?

243
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,160
What a coincidence.

244
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,760
Do you want to join us for a GO game?

245
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,860
Young Master Liu just won a game.

246
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,840
I only captured ten pieces from you.

247
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,600
It was quite a tight match.

248
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,680
Fu Shuang, you've only been learning GO for the past two weeks, your progress is tremendous.

249
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,360
You're indeed a smart lady.

250
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,160
I owe it to you, Young Master.

251
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,940
Indulgence House has many visitors each day, but none of them has ever beaten you in a GO game.

252
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,360
Young Master Liu, you're a skillful martial artist

253
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,300
and are also good at tattooing, taming animals, and playing GO.

254
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,700
You're such an all-rounder.

255
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,080
Why would a talented man like you live with a group of ladies?

256
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,680
Those are just my hobbies.

257
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,400
If you also like GO, why don't we play a game?

258
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,040
Sure.

259
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,180
I'll send my associate to play a game with you.

260
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,720
Go!

261
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,187
Don't you come from a renowned sect?

262
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:49,440
I'm sure you're really talented. It's your time to shine!

263
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,680
I don't know how to play GO.

264
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,160
I'm counting on you.

265
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,720
What a coincidence. I don't know how to either.

266
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,700
- Why don't you do it? 
 - I can't do this.

267
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,340
Then what should we do now?

268
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,980
You've always been a smart lady.

269
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,020
I'm sure you can beat him even if it's your first time playing.

270
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,660
Does that even make sense?

271
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,180
Let's make a bet!

272
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,100
If you can't beat him, I'll be the one in charge of late suppers from now on.

273
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,040
Just do it.

274
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,880
Fine. I guess I have to do it myself.

275
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,140
All right. Let's play a game.

276
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,620
Wait a minute.

277
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,040
I play GO with these ladies because they hired me as their GO instructor.

278
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,820
If we're playing a game, what's your wager?

279
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,660
What about this? Gold and silver are just meaningless items.

280
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,620
It's no fun using them as a wager.

281
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,420
Whoever wins the game gets to ask the loser a question.

282
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,820
The loser has to answer it honestly. What do you say?

283
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,400
Deal.

284
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,660
 Why do I keep feeling like I've seen this scene before? 

285
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,580
 It's as if I've once played GO with someone I know. 

286
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,500
We're here to find clues about Truth Duster.

287
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,240
It won't do us any good if we accidentally let that slip.

288
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,000
This is the best way to find out everything we want to know about Liu Weiyang.

289
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,940
I'm positive that Yan Dan will win the game.

290
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,740
Why are you so sure about that?

291
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,260
She can be quite smart, but I don't think she can win her first game.

292
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:03,340
I'm worried we'll expose ourselves before she's able to get any clues from him.

293
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,020
I just know it'll happen.

294
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:11,700
Moreover, Liu Weiyang won't be able to score within the first three sets.

295
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,380
Just watch.

296
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,920
I won.

297
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,760
I was too careless!

298
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,660
You have to admit your defeat.

299
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,760
What's the most powerful spell you've ever seen in your life?

300
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,040
This one. Distance Keeping Lock.

301
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,920
It can turn a human into a puppet.

302
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,900
You can control the person all you want.

303
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:47,260
I think we should get rid of a vicious spell like this.

304
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,720
If that's what you think, I should start learning the bird-taming spell.

305
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,980
Perhaps you'd like that spell more.

306
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,840
How despicable!

307
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,340
Again!

308
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,920
I won.

309
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,320
It's my turn to ask questions.

310
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,880
I can easily tell that you come from a wealthy family.

311
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,580
Why don't you go home? Why do you reside in Indulgence House?

312
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,240
I come from a family with many rules.

313
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
I prefer living a carefree life here.

314
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,680
Surely I would hate to leave this place.

315
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,240
Where does your family live? What do you do for a living?

316
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,900
You need to win another game to get the answers to your questions.

317
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,460
Sure.

318
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,660
My master was a homeless hero. He was the best at training birds.

319
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,160
He had no ambition and just let the days pass.

320
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,480
Wait a minute!

321
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,720
We don't have the right number of GO pieces.

322
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,900
You captured one piece from me, and there are still 180 pieces on the board.

323
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,760
That means I should have one white piece left.

324
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,810
But it's not here.

325
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,350
According to the rules, when there's a missing piece,

326
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,900
we should each do a body search to prove our innocence.

327
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm always an honest man. You can search all you want.

328
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,060
You can't slander me. Come on.

329
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,800
You can't do this!

330
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,200
Seriously? Again?

331
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,200
I didn't expect you to be a lady.

332
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,000
However, if you don't allow me to search you,

333
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll suspect you of cheating.

334
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
According to the rules, if one gets caught cheating at Indulgence House, their hand shall be chopped off.

335
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,600
Do you own Indulgence House?

336
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,200
Why do we have to listen to you?

337
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,300
I've never heard of such a rule.

338
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,200
Can you repeat it again?

339
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,000
My apologies.

340
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,400
I made a mistake. There's no need to chop off her hand.

341
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,800
All she has to do is to perform on stage to lighten the mood.

342
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,700
 Good job. 

343
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,700
 Liu Weiyang seems indifferent, but he definitely has a hidden agenda. 

344
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,800
 There must be something fishy going on. 

345
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,700
What is this?

346
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,000
This is our Red Flower Embroidered Ball.

347
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,600
Every lady of the house has one.

348
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,800
We throw it at the man we're interested in to validate our love.

349
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,910
Finding a life partner by throwing the flower ball.

350
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,200
It seems like a great chance to experience the fun of the mortal world.

351
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,000
Young Master Tang. Please be grateful for this opportunity.

352
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,600
The flower ball fell right in front of you.

353
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,400
Obviously, it belongs to you.

354
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,900
I dare not steal it from you.

355
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,000
If you've always followed this rule, then you should also know

356
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,400
that there are things you should've let go of a long time ago.

357
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,400
 Good job! 

358
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:46,000
Young Master Tang. You received the flower ball from Miss Fu Shuang, so you have to marry her.

359
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,400
 With the magical bracelet in hand and conviction in the heart, 

360
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,800
 from now on, you shall be bound to your devotion and reject all mortal affairs. 

361
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,400
 Has Tang Zhou fallen for Fu Shuang? 

362
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Miss, I'm afraid that you need to find another man.

363
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,300
You're injured.

364
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,400
I thought so, but I didn't know it was this bad.

365
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,600
I saw the bracelet on your wrist when we first met.

366
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
However, I didn't know what it was.

367
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,700
Why is it hurting you?

368
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,600
The future chief of the Lingxiao Sect

369
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,500
is required to always wear this bracelet and practice celibacy.

370
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,400
I'll get stabbed by the cone spikes... whenever I break the rule.

371
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,700
Then are you...

372
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,400
It's fine.

373
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,000
Cultivators should avoid distractions at all costs.

374
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,400
It's your first time at a dance hall.

375
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,800
It's normal that you got distracted.

376
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,600
Don't be too hard on yourself.

377
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,800
I'm sure you'll recover soon.

378
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,000
You'll get used to it one day.

379
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,700
Young Masters.

380
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,100
Sorry to interrupt.

381
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,600
I witnessed the amazing sword performance by the two of you, and I was really impressed.

382
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,400
I am a performer at Indulgence House and often get teased and bullied by others.

383
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,000
I would like to learn a few skills and spells to defend myself when necessary.

384
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,200
I wonder if I can learn a thing or two from you.

385
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,400
It's our pleasure.

386
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,500
Young Master Tang is more than willing to teach you.

387
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,000
 Young Master Tang, this is your chance to get used to it. 

388
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,200
I have never practiced martial arts.

389
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,500
I really wish to learn something from you, Young Master.

390
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,300
If you haven't practiced martial arts before, we need to start from the basics.

391
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,400
You need at least half a year to master this.

392
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,500
But... some of my patrons are skilled in martial arts.

393
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,400
I don't think basic skills are not enough for me to protect myself.

394
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Could you teach me any special skills that I can use as self-defense.

395
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,510
It's our sect's secret skill. We teach it only to members of the sect and never to outsiders.

396
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:48,200
I gave my flower ball to you today, and that shows my intention to marry you.

397
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,800
If I marry you, can you teach me the skill?

398
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,300
Tang Zhou!

399
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,300
Are you busy? Am I interrupting?

400
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,800
No.

401
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,400
Miss Fu Shuang wishes to learn some self-defense skills.

402
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
I see.

403
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:15,300
Since you've received Miss Fu Shuang's flower ball, it's your duty to protect her from now on.

404
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,200
There's no need to explain it to me. And you don't have to be shy.

405
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,000
I understand.

406
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,900
 It turns out you're the only person who can distract him. 

407
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Since Miss Yan is here, I will get going.

408
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,400
I'll drop by Young Master Tang's place later.

409
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,800
I'm here to bring important news.

410
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,100
I was observing Liu Weiyang, and he seemed very interested in your sword performance.

411
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,300
He set up a trap so that he could study your sword skills.

412
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,200
Then he sent Miss Fu Shuang here to learn martial arts from you.

413
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
I think they have a hidden agenda.

414
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
We need to stay extra alert.

415
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
I agree with you.

416
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,000
Fu Shuang came to us with a purpose. I should keep her around.

417
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,800
Hopefully, I can learn something from her.

418
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,200
Taoist Master Tang, you're obliged to remain celibate.

419
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,400
While she's around,

420
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,500
please remember not to be too harsh on her and let your secret slip.

421
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,500
Yu Mo. I heard there's a storyteller in the town

422
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,800
who loves telling "The Legend of Shenxiao Palace".

423
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,000
Let's go later.

424
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
We might learn something from him.

425
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,800
Sure.

426
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,300
Let's go there early in the morning tomorrow.

427
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,600
Sure. I'm fine with that.

428
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,400
The cone spikes can scar your wrist and even break your muscles.

429
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,000
You can't keep enduring the pain.

430
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,200
Soaking in a cold bath can calm you down.

431
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,000
You should try it.

432
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,200
Where did you learn this tip?

433
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Just like you, I once felt confused.

434
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,800
In the past... whenever I saw the person I loved

435
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,400
being intimate with someone else,

436
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,900
the heartache I experienced was as painful as being stabbed by cone spikes.

437
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,400
It wasn't something I could control.

438
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,000
Later, I learned that soaking in a cold bath...

439
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,400
can numb my body and calm my mind.

440
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,600
"The person you loved"?

441
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,900
How do you know...

442
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,200
that it's really love you're feeling?

443
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,600
The Three Realms... have different characteristics.

444
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
The only similarity they share is life and death.

445
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,600
When you're gradually losing consciousness, you'll think of the person you love.

446
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,800
At that moment, you'll have no choice but to face your true feelings.

447
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,100
No one can escape from that.

448
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,300
I'm telling you to get drunk... not to drown yourself.

449
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,800
So... who was on your mind?

450
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,600
If you now know your true feelings...

451
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,400
will you... listen to your heart?

452
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,500
The heir of the Lingxiao Sect must practice celibacy.

453
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,800
If he ever gets distracted, he'll set a bad example for the disciples of the sect.

454
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
To not disgrace the sect...

455
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,100
I must not get distracted.

456
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,100
 Master. 

457
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,800
 I was killed by a demon, 

458
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,400
 but you're now falling for a demon. 

459
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,800
 You should stop calling me your master! 

460
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,400
 I didn't mean to break the rules. 

461
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,600
 She's not an evil demon. 

462
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:22,100
 Master... is it really wrong to fall for someone? 

463
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,400
 Everyone else can fall in love, but not you! 

464
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,200
 And even worse, she is not a human, but a demon. 

465
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,200
 Did you forget who killed your master? 

466
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,000
 Are you going to betray the Lingxiao Sect and stop doing the right thing? 

467
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,900
 Tang Zhou, are you awake? 

468
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,200
 We're heading out for the investigation. 

469
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,000
 If you remain in bed, I'm afraid Yan Dan will be here soon to drag you out of the bed. 

470
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,260
 Get up now. 

471
00:35:00,793 --> 00:35:03,000
   

472
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,020
We said we would do this together.

473
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,240
This Tang Zhou, how can a Taoist Master fall into the water?

474
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,780
And now he's caught a cold.

475
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,740
What a rare scene!

476
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,240
Trust Duster is obviously something that can save his life.

477
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,800
How could he be so careless?

478
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,700
He's really something.

479
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,300
If you were really upset with him, you wouldn't be packing all the snacks for him.

480
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,500
He lost the divine tool while trying to stop us from drinking too much.

481
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,560
He might not be loyal to his friends, but we can't make the same mistake.

482
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,120
Am I right?

483
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,680
These snacks are more than enough for him.

484
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,180
This is your favorite.

485
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,280
Why don't you save it and have it later?

486
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,100
You bought these.

487
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,560
You should eat more. Here.

488
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,940
I don't like these.

489
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,860
The Shenxiao Palace Master is a nine-foot tall man.

490
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,480
He has sharp eyebrows and sparkling eyes.

491
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,020
He carries an overwhelming and intimidating aura.

492
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,260
He is the true hero.

493
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:59,000
I heard the Shenxiao Palace Master is a short man with a scarred face.

494
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,180
Nonsense!

495
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,400
The Shenxiao Palace Master is an agile martial artist. He is definitely not a chubby man.

496
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,420
You're making no sense.

497
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,020
I met the Shenxiao Palace Master before.

498
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,160
He's an old man and was limping as he walked. There's no chance he can practice martial arts.

499
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,760
The Shenxiao Palace Master is a woman.

500
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,960
I once smelled her scent.

501
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,000
It seems like he has many faces.

502
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,800
We were at a tea house,

503
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,360
and so many of them claimed that they'd met the Shenxiao Palace Master.

504
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,720
And they all described the palace master differently.

505
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,020
Who do you think is saying the truth?

506
00:36:34,977 --> 00:36:36,600
   

507
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,820
It's time to bury the body.

508
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:43,100
You will both go and pack Young Master Xiao Qi's clothes and bring them here.

509
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,880
 Yes, sir. 

510
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,480
We got some information from him two days ago, and now he's dead.

511
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,780
There must be more to it.

512
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,660
Something fishy must be going on.

513
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,460
Let's see if we can find anything at the manor.

514
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,440
Just watch.

515
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,840
Make sure everything is in the right place.

516
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,780
My husband...

517
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,620
Why did you pass away all of a sudden?

518
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,320
Who are you?

519
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,360
I'm a dancer from Indulgence House.

520
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,880
Young Master Xiao and I fell in love at first sight.

521
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,520
We decided to live the rest of our lives together.

522
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,220
He was supposed to get me out of the house today,

523
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:31,640
but little did I know... he passed away before I got to see him.

524
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,140
Although we were not bound by an official engagement,

525
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:39,300
I had already taken him as my husband.

526
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,340
Can you just do me a favor and let me take a final look at him?

527
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,700
Just a few minutes will do. Please!

528
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,760
Please I'm begging you!

529
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,020
Please don't do this.

530
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,460
Sir. I guess you haven't heard about this.

531
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:00,540
My younger sister is really loyal to Young Master Xiao.

532
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,180
Can you just do us a favor?

533
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,660
Do us a favor, please.

534
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,740
Come with me.

535
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,040
We've consulted a physician.

536
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,480
Young Master choked on his food when he was drunk and eventually died of suffocation.

537
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,080
Young Master had always enjoyed drinking, but no one would have expected a tragedy like this to happen.

538
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,640
Young Master Xiao!

539
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,180
Young Master Xiao!

540
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,460
 There's a wound here. 

541
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,060
 It's not an accidental death. 

542
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,440
Did Young Master Xiao meet anyone yesterday?

543
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,200
 - Young Master... 
 - Young Master came home at dawn. 
   

544
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,160
 He ran into an old lady who was selling wine at the front gate. 

545
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,380
 She was asking him to buy some of her wine. 

546
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,480
 I sent a servant there to chase the old lady away. 

547
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,340
 Then Young Master went straight to his room. 

548
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,640
Later, a maid went to his room to help prepare the bath.

549
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,060
The moment they opened the door, they saw Young Master on the floor, dead.

550
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,100
Do you remember what the old lady looked like?

551
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,920
"What did she look like"?

552
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,680
There was nothing special about her.

553
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,380
But she was wearing a silver hairpin in the shape of a plum blossom.

554
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,340
Young Master Xiao!

555
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,940
I'm really sad that we can't get married.

556
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:55,240
Can I get a strand of your hair as a keepsake?

557
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,060
The shape of the wound looks a lot like a three-petal plum blossom.

558
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,480
It must have something to do with Shenxiao Palace.

559
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,900
She was wearing a hairpin in the shape of a plum blossom and was selling wine.

560
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,760
She might be the old lady from the inn who stole Trust Duster.

561
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,520
Let's go.

562
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,620
 Desires will always bother our minds. 

563
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:48,440
 If I can let this desire go, will I attain peace of mind? 

564
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,920
 Is Young Master Tang around? 

565
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,180
I'm here to learn some self-defense skills from you.

566
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,460
I'm not feeling well and am not in my best shape to coach you today.

567
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,180
Please drop by some other day.

568
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,040
What part of your body is not feeling well, Young Master?

569
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,660
I studied some medicine.

570
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,900
I might be able to help.

571
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,340
What a pretty hairpin.

572
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,040
Put it down!

573
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,960
I like it a lot.

574
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,920
Can you give it to me?

575
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,580
You care a lot about this item.

576
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,480
Does it belong to the woman you love?

577
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,640
You said that you've never practiced martial arts.

578
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,640
How did you get the calluses on your hands?

579
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,340
It's a misunderstanding.

580
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,280
I got these calluses from playing the pipa. 
  (T/N: Traditional Chinese instrument) 

581
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,120
Tang Zhou.

582
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,560
Yan Dan, don't get us wrong.

583
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,740
My apologies.

584
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:42,520
Young Master Tang told me that he wasn't feeling well, so I was trying to help him.

585
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,380
He agreed to teach you martial arts yesterday, and you've now become his physician.

586
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,820
That's great progress.

587
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:52,570
The only downside is you're giving her someone else's belonging as a token of love.

588
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:56,989
How lovey-dovey.

589
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:00,120
I brought you some snacks. Enjoy them.

590
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,120
I'll leave you alone.

591
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,240
-Yan Dan. 
 -Yan Dan.

592
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,260
Does this belong to Miss Yan?

593
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,600
I caught her staring at this hairpin just now.

594
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,360
She has probably misunderstood.

595
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,800
I'm afraid she will throw a tantrum tonight.

596
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,440
You should go and comfort her.

597
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,880
I will get going now.

598
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,180
Yan Dan was worried about you and brought you some snacks.

599
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,640
She didn't expect to be welcomed by that scene.

600
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,620
Don't worry. Yan Dan is a smart girl.

601
00:43:54,620 --> 00:44:00,980
I'm sure she can see Fu Shuang's intention and will feel better very soon.

602
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,640
Yan Dan is right.

603
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,740
Fu Shuang only approached me because she wanted to learn my secrets.

604
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,900
I just noticed the calluses on her hands that come from many years of sword practice.

605
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,920
She's acting very suspiciously.

606
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:44,990

00:46:59,505 --> 00:47:06,625
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

625
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:13,945
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫
