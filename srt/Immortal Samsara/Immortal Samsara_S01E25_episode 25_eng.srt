 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,500
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,920
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,170
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,220
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,000
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths   ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,020
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,320
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,600
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,560
   

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,950
   

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,960
Aside from the bodies of those who went down into the tomb with us, the rest belong to some pretty strong men.

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,440
They haven't been dead long either.

18
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,000
If a lot of able-bodied men disappeared in Qingshi Town in a short period of time, it would naturally cause a stir.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
Therefore, their disappearance is caused by...

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,580
The Consort's Tomb!

21
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,900
The tomb is a complete trap.

22
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,640
There's no treasure in there at all.

23
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,860
Groups of treasure hunters just rushed in to their death.

24
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,720
I finally understand why greed is placed first in the Five Sufferings.

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,820
Do you think Miss Shen killed them all?

26
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,730
Don't you think that, after we came to the Shen Residence, all the clues came too easily?

27
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:18,250
Miss Shen is suspicious. But all the evidence that points to her comes from Master Shen.

28
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,020
Hearing isn't everything. Seeing is believing.

29
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,140
All right. Let's go and meet Miss Shen.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,020
It's so pretty!

31
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,680
Miss Shen is quite cute.

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,960
You can't tell she's playing dumb.

33
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,580
Do you really think she is pretending?

34
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,880
Haven't you noticed that Miss Shen looks childlike?

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,300
She plays until she has mud all over her body, except for her face, which is completely clean.

36
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:03,620
When I first saw her outside the tomb, I noticed that trees ripped her dress while running the whole way.

37
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,060
Except for her face... It stayed nice, clean, and pretty.

38
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,360
Makes one unable to resist touching it.

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,780
You are a girl... a demon...

40
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,560
Why do you use such frivolous words?

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,620
Please! "Frivolous"?

42
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,980
This is a normal reaction when you see a beautiful woman.

43
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,160
Master Shen wants you to marry his daughter, but you are uninterested.

44
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,380
Looks like you're destined to be a bachelor in this lifetime.

45
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,980
No problem. I'll just pass my lifetime with a noisy demon, then.

46
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,800
I was just kidding! I was just kidding!

47
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,080
Go away! Go away right now!

48
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,940
I don't want to play with you! Quickly! Go away!

49
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,820
Go away!

50
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,260
Tang Zhou! Give me an explanation!

51
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,480
   

52
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,980
Wifey, calm down!

53
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,600
I knew it. I just knew you would come looking for her!

54
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,100
You can't resist what the Shen family is offering you, right?

55
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,220
Tang Zhou! We've been together since we were sixteen.

56
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,160
How many promises did you make to me?

57
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,240
But now...  now you want to be with her!

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,940
I won't accept this!

59
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,160
Let me explain!

60
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,580
"Explain," my foot!

61
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,460
Thank you.

62
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,180
Miss Shen, you're quite agile. You don't look dumb.

63
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,940
Dad said that I'm not dumb.

64
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,520
I know... a lot of words.

65
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,940
I can also recite the Three Character Classic.

66
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,320
“Men on earth, good at birth.”

67
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,340
- "Good..."
- Once is enough. If you continue to pretend, you won't be able to dodge my strike.

68
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,100
Madam Hu will be back soon.

69
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,600
If you two want to know the truth, come to my room tonight.

70
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,580
We're safe.

71
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,440
Tell us. Why did you pretend to be crazy and dumb?

72
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,920
Did my father tell you?

73
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,500
He still won't let me go... and wants to kill me.

74
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:44,300
Actually, when I was very young, I personally saw him kill my mother.

75
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,600
I was afraid he would kill me too. So I pretended to be traumatized.

76
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,460
My father spread rumors about the Consort's Tomb and killed many people with traps.

77
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,160
I've always wanted to do something. However, Madam Hu is always watching me.

78
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,640
I could only pretend to be psychic.

79
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,620
I ran to the Consort's Tomb to warn the treasure hunters.

80
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,960
No wonder you kept rejecting our offer to exorcise your house.

81
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,300
"Bone collecting burial ritual."

82
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,540
It sounded familiar when I heard Master Shen mention it before.

83
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,200
I read a journal before called "Strange Tales of Clans."

84
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,040
It states that the bone collecting burial ritual is a closely guarded technique of the Duoxi Clan.

85
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,640
It's protected by a saintess.

86
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,120
But the last saintess eloped with a man ten years ago.

87
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,820
Since then, the Duoxi Clan has disappeared.

88
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,560
If you do not mind, let me guess.

89
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,400
Was your mother that saintess?

90
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
Yes.

91
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,200
My father killed her just to get the clan's secret technique.

92
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,000
He has already practiced it for many years.

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,260
No ordinary practitioners can fight against him.

94
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,800
I beg you two. You have to save me.

95
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,660
This is Master Shen. This is Miss Shen.

96
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,940
Master Shen's fear looks real.

97
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,240
Miss Shen's tears feel sincere, too.

98
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,640
But the only one who can testify is already a skeleton.

99
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,400
Who do you think is the actual murderer?

100
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,700
It doesn't matter. It's important that we just wait patiently.

101
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,340
Makes sense.

102
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,620
The real murderer will rack his brain as long as we're here.

103
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,940
Let's see who has more patience.

104
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,540
But are you really sure you can catch the murderer when he appears?

105
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,240
As long as you stay out of my way.

106
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,300
Don't underestimate me.

107
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,280
Sometimes it's useless to fight and kill like you do.

108
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,060
The most important thing...

109
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,510
is to use this. Wisdom. Understand?

110
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,100
Is it?

111
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,220
Yes.

112
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,540
   

113
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,140
So sneaky and mysterious.

114
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,140
Taoist Master Tang! Save me! Save me!

115
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,940
What's wrong? What is the matter?

116
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,180
Taoist Master Tang. You were born with good looks.

117
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,300
Any woman who meets you, likes you.

118
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,980
Actually, I don't want to turn you into a shriveled skeleton either.

119
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,920
But I have no choice.

120
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,140
You know too much.

121
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,000
You are a mortal who can turn people into skeletons.

122
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,920
Is it the Seven Star Deity Jade?

123
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,460
You even know about this?

124
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,600
I'm really don't want to kill you now.

125
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,770
Actually, what I want to know is... Is Madam Tang prettier...

126
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,140
or am I prettier?

127
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:47,070
If you were given another chance to choose, would you choose her or me?

128
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,500
Just kill me. I do not have time to chat with you.

129
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Do you despise me that much?

130
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,800
All right, then.

131
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,840
Men do not know what is good for them.

132
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,900
Shen Xiangjun! Are you seducing my husband behind my back?

133
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,700
Didn't you fall into the well?

134
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,880
You think a cheap move like that can trap me?

135
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,240
You underestimate me.

136
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,340
   

137
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,700
Master, it's time to eat.

138
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,800
   

139
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,240
You went to the attic?

140
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,120
Yes.

141
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,800
If it wasn't for you, how would I have discovered that Master Shen was so handsome when he was young?

142
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,760
He also could paint well. Can you see what it says here?

143
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,450
"On the 3rd day of the 3rd month, Yijun and I went for an outing with my sister-in-law, Xiangjun."

144
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,840
So it seems you and Master Shen are brother-in-law and sister-in-law.

145
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,980
Then why do you claim to be father and daughter?

146
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,320
Just because your sister died, did you blot out her face?

147
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,040
This doesn't concern you!

148
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,820
Calm down. How does it not concern me?

149
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,760
The old master already promised me that if I kill you, he'll regain his youth, and I can stay young forever.

150
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,380
This way we'll never have to part.

151
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,080
Do you think I should agree to it?

152
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,160
He wants to be with you?

153
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,240
That's right.

154
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,060
You killed your sister, the one he loved most.

155
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,460
If not me, who else? Should he be with you?

156
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,980
I'll kill you!

157
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,640
She isn't what we thought. Neither are you.

158
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,420
You were just going to lie there and watch the show?

159
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,700
This isn't the first time you've played dumb to take advantage of others.

160
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,020
Before, you tricked the thieves at the inn. Now you tricked Miss Shen.

161
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,880
I just wanted to see what she's capable of.

162
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,760
You knew, yet you still came in.

163
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,040
I was afraid that you'd fall into her trap.

164
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,060
If you turned into a skeleton, I'd have to suffer too.

165
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,180
You're quite self-aware.

166
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,540
Did Master Shen tell you everything?

167
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,220
Of course... not.

168
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,540
I just played a little trick and stole this painting.

169
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,400
Everything else was guesswork.

170
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,780
When acting, it has to be according to the situation.

171
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,720
Master Shen misses his late wife so much that he uses the painting to help him remember her.

172
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,600
How could he blot her face out?

173
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,200
A woman would blot out her own sister's face for only one reason.

174
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,600
Jealousy.

175
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,880
The sister-in-law fell in love with her brother-in-law.

176
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,040
This is too old-fashioned.

177
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,980
Bai Piaoliang, you are indeed amazing.

178
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,240
I am all right.

179
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,060
Taoist Master Tang, hurry and save me! She's insane!

180
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,700
If you come any closer, I'll kill him!

181
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Why?

182
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,520
I love you so much, yet you still won't forget Shen Yijun.

183
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,020
Do you know how painful that is for me?

184
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,320
For you, my sister gave up the chance to live forever as a saintess.

185
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,840
She left her whole clan behind and eloped with you.

186
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,280
Yet you killed her in the end!

187
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,880
And you think you have the right to miss her?

188
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,100
That's because you forced me to do it!

189
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,120
Back then, you stole the jade and drained the whole clan's essence and blood.

190
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,040
After your spiritual skills improved, you caught up to  Xiao Yi and me.

191
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,740
I begged you for mercy, to let me go.

192
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,760
But you insisted that I kill Xiao Yi first.

193
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,440
My goodness.

194
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,700
At first, I thought Master Shen was quite pitiful.

195
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,960
To my surprise, no one is innocent.

196
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,260
Now Xiao Yi is dead.

197
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:54,000
You still won't let me go and keep me locked up here.

198
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,940
You turned me into this...

199
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,500
while you keep yourself young forever.

200
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:08,930
I thought that, by making you old, you'd never fall in love with another woman.

201
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,240
Originally, it was you who knelt and said that you loved me.

202
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,660
That was why I spared your life. Did you forget that?

203
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,620
You liar!

204
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,220
Woman, what's wrong with your brain?

205
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,060
You forced him to kill his beloved, and then made him old and senile.

206
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,240
How could he fall in love with a selfish and terrifying person like you?

207
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,760
Xiangjun, listen to me.

208
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,760
Xiangjun, don't you like my paintings?

209
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,760
I was going to draw you a painting with only you and me in it.

210
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,400
The two of us will never be separated in life or death. All right?

211
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,780
Xiangjun, please let me go.

212
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,400
Believe me.

213
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,020
Xiangjun, you must not listen to their provocations.

214
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,620
They forced me to tell them about Xiao Yi.

215
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,780
Don't you know they want the Seven Star Deity Jade?

216
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,580
I'm not lying to you.

217
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,040
Believe me.

218
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,720
Xiangjun.

219
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,320
It's you two.

220
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,890
You really are stupid.

221
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,820
You would believe such nonsense from an unfaithful man?

222
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,400
Tang Zhou!

223
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,080
Why?

224
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,320
Why did you have to do this to me?

225
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,380
Didn't you say you loved me?

226
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,760
You said...

227
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:55,680
that... we'll be together forever.

228
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,860
I just realized today that human greed and obsession...

229
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,960
are more terrifying than demons.

230
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,140
Don't drag us demons into this!

231
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,740
Demons' feelings are the purest.

232
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,300
The two of them were too crazy.

233
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,900
There are Eight Sufferings in the Mortal Realm.

234
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,440
Birth, old age, sickness, death, being apart from those you love,

235
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,700
being with those you hate, not obtaining what you want,

236
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,620
and the raging blaze of the 5 skandhas. 
   (T/N: 5 components creating body and mind) 

237
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,280
Master Shen first tried to avoid death by parting with the older sister.

238
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,380
Then he ended up staying with the younger sister he hated,

239
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,860
and became old and senile.

240
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,500
There's no harsher punishment than this.

241
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,700
Miss Shen suffered the five skandhas and became obsessed.

242
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,180
In the end, Master Shen never loved her.

243
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,640
Both tried to avoiding suffering,

244
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,700
yet they endured the Eight Sufferings in the end.

245
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,740
Your memory is quite clear.

246
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,180
You're different from others.

247
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,080
You're a demon... yet you love mortal things.

248
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You didn't expect demons like me to have lofty ambitions, right?

249
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,360
Seven Star Deity Jade.

250
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,620
You came to the Consort's Tomb for this, didn't you?

251
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,020
It was only a question. I'm not trying to take it. You're so petty.

252
00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:00,880
Qi Hu, Qi Niu, Qi Bao, Miss Jin, and other unsung brothers, rest in peace.

253
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,960
Your murderer is dead.

254
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Tang Zhou and I have already destroyed all the magical arrays in the Consort's Tomb.

255
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,080
No one will ever die there again.

256
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,560
In the next life, please don't risk your life for money again.

257
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,820
Just live a good life and be worry-free.

258
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,260
I have another wish!

259
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,260
I hope Taoist Master Tang can hear my heartfelt words!

260
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,860
In the past, I never hurt a human!

261
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,620
I have always been a very good demon!

262
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,420
But I hope I can strive to be an even better demon in the future!

263
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,720
Why don't you speak louder so all the gods and Buddha in heaven can hear you?

264
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,880
All right, Sir.

265
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,260
Take care.

266
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,200
Why did you buy jewelry?

267
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,700
Do you really have a fiancée? Will you give this to her?

268
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,400
Give me your hand.

269
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,000
Why?

270
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,700
I am called "Bai Piaoliang" because I am both fair and beautiful.

271
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,800
People do find it hard to resist me.

272
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
However, humans and demon are not the same.

273
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,800
Also, you're a demon catcher.

274
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
I am just a little demon.

275
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,400
- I shouldn't...
- Shut up.

276
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,000
Shut up.

277
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,000
You may leave now.

278
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,800
Really?

279
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,500
I'm free to leave?

280
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,300
Taoist Master Tang, you really do live up to your name.

281
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,200
You have an extraordinary demeanor! Farewell!

282
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,600
Three.

283
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
What happened? What did you do to me?

284
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,400
Save your energy. Stay within three steps from me.

285
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,600
I used my Distance-Keeping Lock on this bracelet.

286
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
You can only take the steps I dictate.

287
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Don't even think about removing it. It's no use.

288
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,200
I don't believe you.

289
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,600
I do now.

290
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,000
Why are you doing this?

291
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,400
Didn't you just say you would set me free?

292
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,600
I thought about it. You are right.

293
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,000
In the future, you can set an example for more demons.

294
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,700
So you have to stay by my side a little longer to learn from me by example.

295
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,700
No! I don't want to! I don't like this.

296
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,600
Based on your daily performance, I'll adjust the number of steps.

297
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
Conduct yourself well.

298
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,560
   

299
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,100
Your Highness.

300
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,100
Your Highness, the elites we sent all perished.

301
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,400
But we did obtain this.

302
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,800
Incompetent fools!

303
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,200
I apologize.

304
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,000
I can't delay anymore.

305
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I must go there myself.

306
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,700
Living Deity! Living Deity!

307
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,600
I was wrong. Really, I was wrong.

308
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,200
I definitely won't ever badmouth you behind your back again.

309
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,100
Consider my hard work. Please have a heart.

310
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,400
Ten steps.

311
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,800
Can I have ten steps?

312
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,200
If not ten, how about eight steps? Eight steps is okay, right?

313
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,000
How about this?

314
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Let's seal the deal. Five steps.

315
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,700
Five, okay?

316
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,300
The little girl is hardworking. She simply wants to read some books.

317
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,600
You should agree.

318
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,800
I'll buy it for her if you won't.

319
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
Thank you, Sir. But there's no need, really.

320
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,500
I wouldn't be able to reach it anyway.

321
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,200
Do you like reading that much?

322
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,000
Then copy the "Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment."

323
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,400
If you do it well, maybe I'll consider changing the number of steps.

324
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,100
No problem.

325
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,400
Sure. Copy a book?

326
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
I can even do it ten times!

327
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,800
Here. Please have some water.

328
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,400
Enjoy.

329
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,000
 Go ahead and torture me. 

330
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,200
 I'll make you taste that pain in your heart. 

331
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,400
 Even though I can't defeat you, 

332
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,300
 I know that you keep the Seven Star Deity Jade that you desire in here. 

333
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,400
Felt enough?

334
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,800
You naughty little demon.

335
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,900
It'll be hard to indoctrinate you in merely three to five years.

336
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,300
Are you a human or a demon?

337
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,000
How do you know how to do astral projections?

338
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,600
Wait.

339
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,200
Taoist Master Tang, this is a misunderstanding.

340
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,000
It's all a misunderstanding.

341
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,300
Just now, I... I didn't want to steal from you.

342
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,800
I only want to see how amazing this treasure is.

343
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,300
Plus, it won't take that long to indoctrinate me.

344
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,000
At most, three to five months.

345
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,500
I'll definitely improve and mend my ways.

346
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,000
When this thing leaves my body...

347
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,000
the scars really will reappear.

348
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,600
Were you poisoned or hurt somehow?

349
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,800
How can this treasure heal your scars?

350
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,400
My injury makes my soul unstable.

351
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,700
Occasionally, my soul leaves my body at night.

352
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,200
Someone told me before... that I'm not me.

353
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Only if I find the four divine tools... can I become my true self again.

354
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,800
Who on earth are you?

355
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Could it be that you were a demon in the past?

356
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,000
Would you believe that I was a divine deity?

357
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,600
If you were a divine deity, then was the Queen Mother of the West.

358
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,400
If you're just healing your wound, heal it.

359
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,600
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

360
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,900
I carry the burden of the Lingxiao Sect.

361
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,900
My master and Sect Leader were kind to me.

362
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,000
I can only repay my sect if I stay alive.

363
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,600
You have the world and your sect in your heart.

364
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
You have to banish demons and devils and also look for divine tools.

365
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,300
After that, you have to find yourself too.

366
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Aren't you tired?

367
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,800
I feel tired just listening to you.

368
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,700
It's true. As a human, what's most important is happiness.

369
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,500
It's useless to think too much about the past, present, and future.

370
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,400
I didn't expect there to be a day where a little demon would lecture me on how to be human.

371
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,500
"Little demon"?

372
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,400
You look like you're in your early twenties.

373
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
You're only a young man.

374
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,800
Don't judge me by my youth and beauty.

375
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,200
I'm definitely older than you.

376
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,400
I definitely have more experience than you too.

377
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,200
Listen to the advice of an older sister.

378
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
The future is like a dream.

379
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Follow your destiny and let it be.

380
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,600
As a human, you can't torture yourself.

381
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Let it go when you need to.

382
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,800
How about you set me, this cute lotus demon, free?

383
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,200
It's not time yet.

384
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,000
What's the hurry?

385
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:15,000
   

386
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:26,000
Even if you won't let me go, you don't have to take me back to your sect to risk my life.

387
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,800
You don't have a demon aura. Whether you live or die is up to you, my sworn sister.

388
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
What did you say? "Sworn sister"?

389
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,300
What about it?

390
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,800
The Sect Leader's birthday is approaching.

391
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,300
You'll get to experience the honorable sect practice and cleanse your demon heart.

392
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,300
If someone asks you anything after you go inside, you better act your part.

393
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,000
If something goes wrong, I won't be able to save you.

394
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Senior Brother, you're finally back.

395
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,800
I know you love to eat crabs.

396
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,800
So I specially kept a few big, fat ones for you.

397
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,800
Senior Brother, who is this?

398
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,000
This is my sworn sister, who I met during my journey.

399
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,600
My name is Qin Qi. What about you?

400
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,800
Yan Dan.

401
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,100
What are you chatting about?

402
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,600
Eldest Senior Brother, how come you're back too?

403
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,000
Eldest Senior Brother.

404
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,800
The Chief will celebrate his birthday three days from now.

405
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,100
I came back especially for that.

406
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,400
It has been several days since you both left the mountain.

407
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,800
Having both of you back will definitely make the Sect Leader very happy.

408
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,000
 - Senior Brother Tang!
 - Senior Brother Tang. 

409
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,400
Senior Brother Tang.

410
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
The sect brothers have missed you.

411
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Please stay a little longer this time.

412
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,900
I want to ask you about a few spells.

413
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,000
 Eldest Senior Brother. 

414
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,000
Friendly feelings in the sect really make people blind.

415
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,900
- We finally have a girl on this mountain.
 - Hey!

416
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,600
Aren't we girls too?

417
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,200
Actually, all these years, we only thought of you as our junior brothers.

418
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,400
I...

419
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,000
This is Miss Yan Dan.

420
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
She's Senior Brother Tang Zhou's sworn sister.

421
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,200
I advise each of you not to get any funny ideas.

422
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,200
I'll be taking care of her while she is here.

423
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,300
They'll accept anyone.

424
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,300
Be careful. Don't be deceived by them.

425
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,200
- I heard that Senior Brother Tang stays away from women.
 - That's right.

426
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,600
Why did he accept you as his sworn sister?

427
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,400
How did you two meet?

428
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,460
It's a long story.

429
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,140
You can't tell by looking at me, but I was the oldest daughter of an influential family.

430
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,000
We encountered a mountain bandit. My whole family was killed.

431
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,420
The bandit thought I was pretty and wanted to keep me.

432
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:22,510
Just when heaven and earth had stopped listening, 
 (T/N: everything was hopeless) 

433
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:26,440
who knew... Those bandit turned out to be a toad demon!

434
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,660
That toad was powerful.

435
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,760
My sworn brother fought long and hard to defeat the toad.

436
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,940
He sent coal during a snowstorm. 
  (T/N: timely help) 

437
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:42,920
I wouldn't be able to repay his great kindness even if I worked like a horse! 
 (T/N: Work extremely hard) 

438
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,900
Correct. That's how it happened.

439
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:52,000
Senior Brother, after you saved her, why didn't you find her a place to stay, instead of bringing her here?

440
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,520
After I bid farewell to him, that toad's remaining followers fancied me.

441
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,700
I was afraid they would seek revenge and never let me go.

442
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,700
So I begged my sworn brother to take me with him.

443
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,190
He saw that I was alone and helpless, with no one to rely on. So he agreed.

444
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,840
I became his sworn sister, and so he brought me to the sect.

445
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,620
You and Senior Brother Tang Zhou share a very similar fate.

446
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,720
No wonder he sympathizes with you.

447
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,580
 Were Tang Zhou's parents killed by evil demons? 

448
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,020
 I made up a story randomly. Any similarity is purely coincidental. 

449
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,400
Fate is unfair. You have suffered, Miss.

450
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,180
However, you can relax now.

451
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:46,420
Now that you are in the Lingxiao Sect, we will all protect you.

452
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,580
Thank you, Eldest Senior Brother.

453
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,900
Eldest Senior Brother, it's getting late.

454
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,440
Let's go and visit the Sect Leader.

455
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,840
He has been practicing in seclusion lately and will be out in three days.

456
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,180
That being the case, we should just leave the demon-trapping bottles here.

457
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,800
- Let's not disturb his practice. 
 - All right.

458
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,500
   

459
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,140
Why the temper tantrum?

460
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,420
Are you venting your anger on a tortoise?

461
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,800
What kind of hero are you?

462
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,220
 Vile person. No wonder Zi Lin sleeps in a coffin. 

463
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,420
 How did I manage to bump into a weirdo who loves to flip tortoises? 

464
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,020
 In the scripts I write in the future, I'll definitely have to add a villain who flips tortoises. 

465
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,080
Weren't you going to "work like a horse" to repay your savior?

466
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,920
Go on. It's time to repay me.

467
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,900
We're only acting.

468
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,480
If you get too immersed in the act, you'll go crazy.

469
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,620
We must do the full play. Otherwise, how can anyone believe you? Right?

470
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,400
Yan Dan.

471
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,940
Wash it well!

472
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,400
Eldest Senior Brother, I will cook the crabs for my sworn brother.

473
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,620
Hurry up! Go have your dinner with the others.

474
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,600
It's fine.

475
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,900
Give it to me. You have worked hard.

476
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,780
Miss Yan Dan, you're the guest.

477
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,190
My junior brother makes you cook.

478
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,840
As your eldest senior brother, I can't be that rude.

479
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,300
- Let me do it. 
 - Really, it's all right.

480
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,630
- Let me do it. 
 - Yan Dan.

481
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,880
Senior Brother Tang Zhou saved you and escorted you here. You were together day and night.

482
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,000
Are you in love with him?

483
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,540
That's absolutely impossible!

484
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,660
Kindness and love are two different things.

485
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,800
Yes, yes, yes. Older brother's spells are amazing.

486
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,340
But his character is hard to describe.

487
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,460
I believe you know that too.

488
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,060
You've misunderstood older brother.

489
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,220
You two have a lot in common, but his past is more tragic than yours.

490
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,280
He‘s kind, but looks aloof because of that.

491
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,700
What happened to him? Does he have a story?

492
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,480
Tell me.

493
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,400
Senior Brother was an orphan ever since he was little.

494
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,980
His master brought him here to raise him when he was young.

495
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,600
They were master and apprentice, but they were like father and son.

496
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,840
But later, his master was murdered by a demon.

497
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,220
No one in the family was spared.

498
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,800
Since then, his temperament changed drastically.

499
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,960
He swore by his master's coffin... that he'd get rid of all evil demons.

500
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,440
He would punish evil and promote good without mercy.

501
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,480
He'd protect the Lingxiao Sect his whole life.

502
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,800
 So this is what caused his deep prejudice against demons. 

503
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,900
 Fortunately, I don't remember anything from my past. 

504
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,780
 If I had such a miserable life, I wouldn't be able to live such a carefree life. 

505
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,360
Miss Yan Dan, actually, the disciples of the Lingxiao Sect can get married.

506
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,680
Only the Sect Leader must uphold justice and be free of human desires.

507
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,720
He can't have feelings of love and needs to accomplish what others cannot.

508
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,200
So he must do what others can't.

509
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,860
Although I am the most senior one here, I'm not as hard-working as Junior Brother Tang.

510
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,520
Plus, he's very talented.

511
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,620
So everyone in the sect knows that he's the sect leader's successor.

512
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,780
No wonder he always stays away from women and is immune to flattery and coercion.

513
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,680
So that's how it is.

514
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,920
However, being your sect leader is way too difficult.

515
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,540
He's a mortal... except he is required to be like a divine deity.

516
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,600
One has to make sacrifices to uphold the right path.

517
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,460
It's ready. The duck soup is ready.

518
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,580
I'll go take it over to the Sect Leader.

519
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:59,100
Eldest Senior Brother, why don't we taste two crabs first before we send any to my sworn brother?

520
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,740
All right.

521
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:15,720
You have to dip the crab in ginger and vinegar to stay healthy even if you overeat.

522
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,520
You're so considerate, Eldest Senior Brother.

523
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,280
You and Tang Zhou don't seem like brothers at all.

524
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:27,820
Junior Brother Tang has great ambitions, while I feel at home wherever I am.

525
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,740
Isn't that a coincidence? Me too! Me too!

526
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,880
- Is it tasty? 
 - Delicious!

527
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,500
Have one more.

528
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,280
You scared me standing there!

529
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,880
You think you won't interact with girls when you become the sect leader.

530
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,680
You don't know how to be kind to women.

531
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,460
A lotus demon is in the Lingxiao Sect.

532
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,560
Pay attention to what you say and do.

533
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,440
Don't deceive and mislead my senior and junior brothers.

534
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,240
Who deceived them? Who misled them?

535
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,560
Don't cruelly judge the heart of a demon, all right?

536
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,520
Eldest Senior Brother is warm and concerned about me.

537
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,500
Of course, I'll respond warmly.

538
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,480
I won't be like you. You're aloof and disappoint people who have good intentions.

539
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,500
You must not get too close to them.

540
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,080
They do not know your identity.

541
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,900
Can you bear the responsibility if they misunderstand?

542
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:58,900
Speaking about being "too close", should we deal with that issue too?

543
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,020
So noisy. Peel your crabs.

544
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,460
Did I say you can eat?

545
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,380
Can't I pick my teeth?

546
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,580
   

547
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,920
 I wonder what Yu Mo is doing right now. 

548
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,540
 I've been missing for so long. He must be worried sick right now. 

549
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,100
Eldest Senior Brother caught the fish for you.

550
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,220
Why are you just staring at it and not eating?

551
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,480
To be honest, my good friend's real form is a fish.

552
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,720
I was with him for so long that I stopped eating fish.

553
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,840
When you leave the sect, you'll miss them.

554
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,540
I have been away from my friend for so long. I miss him a lot too.

555
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,000
Plus, he doesn't know where I am right now.

556
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,580
He must be very worried about me.

557
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,600
Aren't you a flower spirit? Why do you have a fish friend?

558
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,320
Don't even think about escaping.

559
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,020
After you eat, bring in the books that are drying outside.

560
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,860
You ungrateful, vile person.

561
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,720
Since you said I'm ungrateful, don't expect me to set you free.

562
