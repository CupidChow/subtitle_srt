 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,600
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,820
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,070
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,120
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,000
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,450
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,920
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,220
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,140
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,850
   

15
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,950
   

16
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,980
It's you?

17
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,840
You already gave it to me.

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,940
Why are you taking it back?

19
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,700
What about you then?

20
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,830
Will you one day... also leave me?

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,040
Why aren't you saying anything?

22
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,340
Could it be...

23
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,300
Could it be that I'm in another dream?

24
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,300
That's good too.

25
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,600
So this is what it feels like when the characters in plays don't know what to do with love.

26
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,460
Yan Dan, calm down.

27
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,500
What on earth are you thinking about?

28
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,660
You're a demon. He's a demon catcher.

29
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,490
It's impossible between you two.

30
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,670
Moreover, that person already has someone in his heart.

31
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,260
In terms of how unforgettable his love is, you can't even compare.

32
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:32,060
No matter if it's the past, present, or when he returns to the Heaven Realm, you two will be separated eventually.

33
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,100
Calm down. Return to your right mind, okay?

34
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,080
This might be what Jiang Chen meant by a personal experience.

35
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,680
Anyway, you cannot behave like those silly girls who sacrifice everything for love.

36
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,000
Remember what you're feeling right now.

37
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,500
With this experience, I'm sure you can write a better and more touching story.

38
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,820
Ying Yuan...

39
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,160
In the past...

40
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,560
my happiest moment...

41
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,480
was when I became your attendant.

42
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,640
Even when I was a lowly attendant...

43
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,740
have you ever... even glanced at me?

44
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,740
From now on...

45
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,700
I will never bow down to you again.

46
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,900
Where is he?

47
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,980
 He didn't drink the As Desired Wine. 

48
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,500
 He transformed into the person I saw in my dream. 

49
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,900
Liu Weiyang is so strange.

50
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,500
Since he was suffering because of an unfulfilled dream, why didn't he drink any As Desired Wine, if he had it?

51
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,300
We shouldn't trust him.

52
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,540
I'm sure he's hidden parts of the truth.

53
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,720
Also, he only wanted to use us to obtain Paper and Ink.

54
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,320
He said all those words on purpose.

55
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,820
I'm afraid he's related to the Devil Clan, he's definitely a part of this.

56
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,930
I didn't expect to be able to see Heavenly Lord Zhao Sheng's divine tool in my lifetime.

57
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,520
The three of us are superior deities of the Heaven Realm.

58
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,240
We're making a private visit this time.

59
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,720
Hurry and show us the chronicle. Don't waste our time anymore.

60
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,940
But... Everyone said that the Four Divine Tools were lost in the Divine-Devil War.

61
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,880
How did the three of you get your hands on them?

62
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,040
How could His Supreme Majesty allow the emperors' divine tools stay in the Mortal Realm?

63
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,660
We've already found them. It's just that we haven't told anyone.

64
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,600
It's normal for you not to know.

65
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,320
I was ignorant before this.

66
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,580
The chronicle is right here. Please read it as you like.

67
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,400
We superior deities will hold a discussion. You should leave.

68
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,740
Oh right, get us a pot of excellent tea.

69
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,180
Go on.

70
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,300
I'll go right now.

71
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,320
What do you think?

72
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,550
Wasn't my acting great?

73
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,330
Let's take a look.

74
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,760
   

75
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,360
"In order to kill Devil King, Emperor Chang Sheng sealed away the Illusion of Devils with Paper and Ink"

76
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,380
"and cut off his power source."

77
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,520
Since this Liu Weiyang could draw the Power of Devils from the Illusion of Devils,

78
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,340
why did he steal Paper and Ink in the first place?

79
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:22,860
The divine official who saved me said that Paper and Ink could provide life to all things.

80
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:29,820
When we were in the Devil King Hall, we watched it restore withered plants to life.

81
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,520
I'm sure Liu Weiyang intends to use Paper and Ink to revive the Devil King.

82
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,400
He might also try to revive all of the devils that perished in the Divine-Devil War.

83
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,420
Look at this.

84
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,560
Do you see that?

85
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,040
The Eye of Infinite Devils is passed down from generation to generation.

86
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,940
It complements the Illusion of Devils.

87
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,660
It can absorb the Power of Devils and embed itself in  the Devil King's body.

88
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,460
It is only removable after death. Only the blood of Devil King can dispel its power.

89
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:11,375
   

90
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,525
   

91
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,960
This is definitely the same the mark on Liu Weiyang's chest.

92
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,760
Look.

93
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,520
You're right. He's definitely the Devil King.

94
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,060
Superior deities, please have some tea.

95
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,600
Soil Guardian, I have a question for you.

96
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,560
Why does it only show half of the Devil King's face?

97
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,220
Do you have his complete portrait?

98
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,120
I don't. Before he was defeated in the war, he pretended to be a recluse. His disguise was perfect.

99
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,140
Only a few people have seen his face.

100
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,740
That's why we only have this incomplete portrait of him.

101
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,100
There's no need to ask any further.

102
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,690
I'm sure he doesn't want to be concerned with the past anymore.

103
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:19,780
Soil Guardian, could you please tell us everything you know about the Divine-Devil War?

104
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,800
All right.

105
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,920
The Divine-Devil War started because of the death of a fairy.

106
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,240
Her name was...

107
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,530
Her name was... Tao Ziqi!

108
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,060
She was a superior deity.

109
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,740
She was the envoy of the Heaven Realm.

110
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,840
She traversed regularly between the Divine and Devil Realms.

111
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,700
Therefore she got to know the Devil King.

112
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,880
The Devil Clan was always a cunning clan.

113
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,200
The Devil King made Tao Ziqi fall in love him.

114
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,000
He kept lying to her that the Devil Clan had no intention of staging a rebellion.

115
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,540
Love between a deity and a devil?

116
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,460
This is such an interesting story!

117
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,380
Continue. What happened after that?

118
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,600
How is that love?

119
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,360
It was obviously a plot.

120
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,440
When the time was right, the Devil King

121
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,520
announced to the world that Tao Ziqi was trying to assassinate him.

122
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,080
He said that the Divine Realm took the lead in braking the promise to maintain peace in the Six Realms.

123
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,860
That's why they retaliated.

124
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,800
That was the beginning of the Divine-Devil War.

125
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,740
Then did Tao Ziqi attempt to assassinate him or not?

126
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,000
That was what Devil King said.

127
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,220
Just an excuse to turn on the Divine Realm.

128
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,020
However, the entire Devil Clan watched him slay Tao Ziqi personally.

129
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,760
 The Immortal Clan is fatuous and incompetent. 

130
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,780
 They have always feared our power. 

131
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,980
 For the sake of our clan, I've always endured and avoided them. 

132
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,200
 Even so, the Heavenly Emperor still wishes to eliminate our clan. 

133
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,120
 Using a peace negotiation as an excuse, he sent Tao Ziqi as a divine envoy to assassinate me. 

134
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,280
 In order to save me, Elder Shuo Hua was seriously wounded. 

135
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,360
 Backing off won't give us peace! 

136
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,820
 It'll only make the Deity Clan push their luck even further. 

137
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,800
 My generals, as all of you will see, 

138
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:48,260
 Today I'll slay the divine envoy and bid farewell to our past humiliations. 

139
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:55,540
 For the sake of our peace and glory, we'll eradicate the Deity Clan and rule over the Six Realms! 

140
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,820
 We won't cease until the Divine Realm is destroyed! 

141
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:09,760
  "We won't cease until the Divine Realm is destroyed!" 

142
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,680
 Tao Ziqi, what else do you have to say for yourself? 

143
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,740
 There's nothing... 

144
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,620
 left to say between us. 

145
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,920
I heard that all devils that were involved in the war were banished into the Life and Death Arena after the war.

146
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,650
And they can't leave the Night Forgetting River. Is that true?

147
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,320
So many years have passed already.

148
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,620
All of their skeletons have formed Bone Mountain, whose peak can never be seen.

149
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,960
After the Devil Clan was defeated, they suffered a huge blow.

150
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,720
Although they have some territories left, they no longer pose a threat.

151
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,520
 Who seeks the power of the dark forces? 

152
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,680
The ex-curator of the Magical Pavilion of Heaven Realm.

153
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:24,040
I seek the Fire of the Flaming Heart and the power of the dark forces

154
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,740
to restore my divine object spirit.

155
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,800
 You're half human and half spirit. 

156
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,860
 If you receive this power, will you be able to withstand the devouring of the dark forces? 

157
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,960
I need to seek revenge.

158
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,940
I won't regret it even if I die.

159
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,900
I have no fear of being devoured.

160
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,340
 You have a sincere heart. 

161
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,380
 However, you only have ordinary powers! 

162
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,920
 Do you have any worthy tools that you can use as your offering? 

163
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,140
I'm here for His Majesty's immortal spirit.

164
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,680
If I succeed, I'm willing to offer half of my immortal power.

165
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:07,000
If I fail, you can devour my entire being.

166
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,680
I shall die with no regret.

167
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,720
 Excellent! 

168
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,360
Yan Dan, Ying Yuan,

169
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:48,940
I will make both of you suffer 100 times more than what I've suffered.

170
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,660
Eat up.

171
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Such scrumptious dishes. What's the matter?

172
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,320
Are you worried that we might die when we face off against Liu Weiyang tomorrow?

173
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,900
Yan Dan, if Liu Weiyang is truly the Devil King, I'm sure he stole Paper and Ink in order

174
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,960
to gather the souls of the dead devils and attack the Heaven Realm once again.

175
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,740
Tang Zhou and I already discussed it.

176
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,680
This trip is perilous.

177
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,840
So you should stay here and wait for our news.

178
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,580
I was wondering what you two were up to this afternoon.

179
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,340
So, you two want to ditch me?

180
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,360
Listen up, that's not happening!

181
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,500
If we go, we go together. If we die, we die together.

182
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,800
Among the three of us, you have the weakest power.

183
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,640
If we get into a fight, you'll be the one to drag us down.

184
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,380
Hey, what are you saying!

185
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,260
I'm no longer the lowly follower that I used to be.

186
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,620
I'm training every day right now. I can already cast fire spells.

187
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,740
I'm much more powerful than before. Really!

188
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,420
Fine. You're the strongest, okay?

189
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,000
But of course.

190
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,560
Yan Dan, the Devil King is as powerful as a superior deity.

191
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,140
Yu Mo and I might not be able to defeat him even if we work together.

192
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,460
Since we're trying to stop him, it's highly likely that we won't return alive.

193
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,040
That's why we need your help to report this to the Heaven Realm.

194
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,600
If he starts another war... the Three Realms might be in great peril again.

195
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,780
I knew this was a farewell banquet.

196
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,560
But I'm just a mere lotus demon.

197
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,120
How can I ascend to the heavens?

198
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,060
What about the Soil Guardian? He's a deity.

199
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,380
You both should entrust the task to him. He can report it to them.

200
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,720
- Yan Dan. 
 - At least all the parts of my body are precious.

201
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,160
I can heal you two if you get injured.

202
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,940
Aren't we friends?

203
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,180
If we're friends, we go through thick and thin together.

204
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,660
If you don't want to bring me along, that's fine.

205
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,620
Just tell me that you don't think of me as your friend.

206
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,620
Yan Dan, we'll follow your will.

207
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,120
That's more like it. Let's eat until our heart's content today.

208
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,380
We can depart early tomorrow morning.

209
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,780
Here.

210
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,780
I gave you my flower friends already.

211
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,420
Here's some for you, too.

212
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:23,080
When she wakes up and finds out that we've gone, she's going to yell at people again.

213
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,060
As long as she's safe, she can do what she wants.

214
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,920
 You suffered in the Night Forgetting River for eight centuries. 

215
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,620
 I won't let you return to that decrepit place again. 

216
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,780
Yan Dan? Stop causing trouble.

217
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,500
I just knew you two scoundrels would team up and ditch me.

218
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,560
But I'm smart. If you want to ditch me, it won't be that easy.

219
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,200
How could you leave me out when you two are going to go save the world?

220
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,380
Buddies, let's go!

221
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,640
You actually used my magic against me?

222
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,500
Too cunning.

223
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,900
I'm only cunning towards despicable people like you two.

224
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,520
Once the evil spirits outside Yinyang Pass detect the living, they'll attack those who try to go through.

225
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,960
At this time, you must remember to hold your breath.

226
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,520
If not, they'll discover you.

227
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,020
Yu Mo, don't worry. You and I aren't human.

228
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,480
Those evil spirits won't attack us.

229
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,080
But you? Tang Zhou, you're a sitting duck. You better watch out.

230
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,120
- Who are you calling a sitting duck? 
 - You.

231
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,420
I...

232
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,300
- Yu Mo, I can subdue those evil spirits when we enter the pass. 
 - You mustn't.

233
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,070
Although these evil spirits are obstructing us, they're also obstructing

234
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,120
the evil forces that are trying to escape from the Night Forgetting River.

235
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,220
Therefore, we cannot subdue them.

236
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,020
Did you all hear me?

237
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,580
We heard.

238
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,440
Watch out!

239
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,160
Don't breathe! Hold it in!

240
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,620
Don't move!

241
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,780
Are you holding your breath?

242
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,860
Are you looking to die?

243
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,620
I told you not to breathe! Hold it in!

244
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,240
Don't move!

245
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,800
 Wearing the magical bracelet will put a restriction on your heart. 

246
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,600
 From now on, you'll experience no love in life and practice celibacy. 

247
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,220
 Tang Zhou's magical bracelet is reacting to me? 

248
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,160
Yu Mo, hurry, come and help us!

249
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,800
Bone Mountain should be up ahead.

250
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:44,010
The Soil Guardian once said that an emperor once split the mountain to save a fairy.

251
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:49,020
After the mountain was reattached, it left behind a faint scar.

252
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,220
I would guess that this is it.

253
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,340
They say deities aren't supposed to be in love.

254
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,360
I didn't expect this emperor to be that romantic.

255
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,360
I wonder what kind of soul-stirring love story they have?

256
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,260
The Heavenly Rules are strict. It was nothing more than a tragedy.

257
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,240
It's fine even if it remains unknown.

258
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,000
Our current priority is to save the world. Let's hurry and ascend the mountain.

259
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,660
Let's go.

260
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,080
I've been waiting here for a long time.

261
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,640
You all really didn't disappoint me. You came so quickly.

262
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,640
Since you all are here, I assume you know who I am.

263
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,160
Are you truly Devil King Xuan Xiang?

264
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,160
How I wish I wasn't.

265
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,160
After I left the Illusion of Devils, my powers as Devil King have completely awakened.

266
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,900
However, I don't want to be shackled by the past again.

267
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,760
Some people are born as deities.

268
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,680
However, some are born as devils.

269
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,080
My people revered me as the leader of my clan.

270
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,720
However, no one ever asked me if I was willing to be their leader.

271
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Then why did you steal Paper and Ink?

272
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,980
I didn't steal it to revive my dead soldiers and restore my clan.

273
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,660
I'm just here to summon a certain girl's soul.

274
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,040
Is it Tao Ziqi?

275
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,680
You killed her and now, you're trying to revive her.

276
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,580
Do you want to threaten the Heaven Realm by using her as your hostage?

277
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,020
How could I possibly kill her?

278
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:51,980
She was the only person who didn't see me as the Devil King and only treated me as Xuan Xiang.

279
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,080
Your clan saw you slay her yourself.

280
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,580
Stop lying.

281
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,860
That's because Shuo Hua impersonated me using the puppet spell.

282
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,860
Puppet spell?

283
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:19,100
We might be able to lie with our words, but our memories cannot lie.

284
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,340
 I inherited the throne due to my family's legacy. 

285
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,360
 However, I had no intention of declaring war against the other clans. 

286
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,820
 Eventually, the elders of the clan turned me into a figurehead. 

287
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,820
 I thought my own inaction could bring peace to my people. 

288
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:42,440
 In the end, it emboldened the elders and their ambitions instead. 

289
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,680
 There was internal strife in the Devil Clan. 

290
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,000
 - All the elders establish their own rules. 
 - What are you doing? 

291
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,070
 To build up their power to engage in war. 

292
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,460
 Let's go! 

293
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,340
 Why are you disfiguring the statue of your leader? 

294
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,840
 The Devil King is the leader of your clan. You must never destroy his statue. 

295
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,180
 I hate him! 

296
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,900
 My father was taken away to fight in a war! He never returned home! 

297
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,140
 Yesterday, my brother was also taken away! 

298
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,960
 My mother is terminally ill and my brother was worried about her. 

299
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,540
 That's why he came back to visit her in secret. However, they arrested him as a deserter. 

300
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,040
 Deserters are executed. I don't want my brother to die. 

301
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,200
 Disfiguring the Devil King's statue is a serious crime. 

302
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,660
 Wouldn't your mother be even more heartbroken if you were arrested because of this? 

303
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,040
 Miss, you're pretty bold, aren't you? 

304
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,720
 Who are you? How did you recognize me? 

305
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,660
 You come from the Divine Realm. 

306
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,840
 Why did you protect the statue of the Devil King? 

307
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,880
 I wasn't trying to protect the Devil King. I was taking pity on the children. 

308
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,180
 It's a serious crime to disfigure the statue of their leader. 

309
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,660
 I don't want him to be punished because of his recklessness. 

310
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,960
 He's a devil child. You're a divine deity. 

311
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,080
 Evil and good do not belong together, but you're here to save his brother. 

312
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,580
 All living beings in the Six Realms are equal. There were never any differences between us. 

313
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,500
 Good and evil were formed due to teachings. 

314
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,000
 The children are innocent. 

315
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,380
 In troubled times, all people suffer. 

316
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,640
 I will try to help every single person I can. 

317
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,760
 With that said, you're putting a devil like me to shame indeed. 

318
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,720
 You must be a virtuous man yourself if you're here to save him too. 

319
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,520
 You mustn't belittle yourself. 

320
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,620
 Saving him is our priority. 

321
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,900
 So, the envoy of the Divine Realm is here. 

322
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,760
 Why did you come here in secret to save people? 

323
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:30,160
 Could it be that the Divine Realm is itching to wage war against our clan? 

324
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,870
 Elder Shuo Hua, this is my private affair. 

325
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,720
 It has nothing to do with the Divine Realm. 

326
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,560
 For karma's sake, when it comes to this soldier who made a mistake, 

327
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,340
 I wonder if Elder Shuo Hua could do me a favor and let me take him away? 

328
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,460
 You don't have any evidence. 

329
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,320
 All these soldiers of mine have witnessed 

330
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,800
 that you were provoking the Devil Clan. 

331
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:19,400
 If that's the case, it seems like we cannot end this peacefully. 

332
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,800
 You all should leave quickly. 

333
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,280
 I've been the Devil King for 10,000 years. 

334
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,350
 I've never been protected by a girl before. 

335
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,700
 She wanted to save all the beings of the world. 

336
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,800
 I wanted to fulfill her wish for her. 

337
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,940
 No matter how much I plead for leniency for you, 

338
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,400
 His Supreme Majesty isn't willing to believe that the Devil Clan doesn't intend to rebel. 

339
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,660
 The Divine Realm is already preparing for war. 

340
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,060
 I'm caught in the middle. 

341
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,140
 Every day it feels like I'm walking on fire. 

342
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:55,360
 Xuan Xiang, if you aren't lying to me, you should prove your loyalty to the Divine Realm. 

343
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,060
 Even if you are just using me to deceive the Divine Realm, 

344
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,280
 I won't blame you. 

345
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:12,300
 Having been able to get to know you in this lifetime, I can die without any regrets. 

346
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,420
 Ziqi, I've never deceived you. 

347
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:30,840
 As long as I'm the Devil King, I won't let the two realms go to war or let you be caught in the middle. 

348
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,880
 If only you weren't the Devil King and I wasn't a superior deity, 

349
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,830
 we could've found a quiet spot in the Six Realms. 

350
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,320
 Never letting any trouble come into our home. 

351
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,260
 How nice would that be? 

352
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,280
 If the Devil King vanishes, if the Illusion of Devils loses its power, 

353
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,060
 Shuo Hua cannot wage war against them no matter what he does. 

354
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,100
 What are you doing? 

355
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,760
 Are you out of your mind?! 

356
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,780
 The Eye of Infinite Devils is the source of the Devil Clan. 

357
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,780
 It can never be removed from the devil king. 

358
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,980
 If you remove it by force, not only will you lose most of your devil power, 

359
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,840
  you'll become like a mortal and only be able to use basic spells because of the backlash. 

360
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,060
 No one can use the Illusion of Devils without the complete Eye of Infinite Devils. 

361
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:49,400
 Ziqi, tomorrow, I will bring this necklace to the Nine Heavens and propose to you. 

362
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,580
 Divine envoy Tao Ziqi, are you willing to marry the devil Xuan Xiang 

363
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:03,300
 and establish a marriage alliance between the two clans? 

364
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:18,920
 We ming geese are the most loyal immortal beings. 

365
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,220
 We only love one person in our lifetime. 

366
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,600
 If we cannot be born together, we shall die together. 

367
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,640
 Our love shall last for an eternity. 

368
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,700
 Ziqi, 

369
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,740
 I will definitely protect you. 

370
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,040
 Ziqi? 

371
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,600
 I really have to thank that seductive Tao Ziqi. 

372
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:24,400
 Without her, I wouldn't have been able to get my hands on the Eye of Infinite Devils this easily. 

373
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,060
 What have you done to her? 

374
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,280
 You were the chosen Devil King. 

375
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,000
 However, you only have eyes for your petty relationship! 

376
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,860
 What a joke. 

377
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:44,600
 The Devil Clan will be destroyed if you continue to be our ruler! 

378
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,860
 Now, I have the Power of the Devils! 

379
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,540
 I shall be the next Devil King! 

380
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,560
 There's no need to fear the Divine Clan! 

381
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,120
 Since you like the position that much, you can take it if you like. 

382
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,960
 However, if you dare hurt Tao Ziqi, 

383
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,600
 I will never let you off. 

384
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,100
 Your Highness, you just need to be a good boy and stay here. 

385
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,340
 After I massacre the Deity Clan and unite the Six Realms, 

386
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:29,740
 I'll naturally let Your Highness and that divine deity 

387
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,140
 go as far away as you want. 

388
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:44,340
 After that, I was locked up in the Devil King Hall by Shuo Hua. 

389
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:49,200
He impersonated me using the puppet spell and initiated the Divine-Devil War.

390
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,280
After a few months, I received news of the Devil Clan's defeat.

391
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,540
Emperor Chang Sheng used Paper and Ink to suppress the Illusion of Devils.

392
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:03,000
Most of the Devil Clan's territories became wastelands.

393
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,080
I looked with all my heart for Ziqi.

394
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,880
I was rescued by my clan members after nine deaths. 
 (T/N: nine deaths and still alive is an idiom for a narrow escape) 

395
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,600
Right before I lost my memory,

396
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,340
I found out that Ziqi

397
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,320
was sacrificed as a tribute to our war flag.

398
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:26,080
Even until death, she didn't know that I wasn't the one who killed her.

399
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,800
I'm sure she was heartbroken before she died.

400
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:40,540
I must tell her personally that although I'd let down the Devil Clan,

401
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,560
I never let her down.

402
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,180
So, this was the truth behind the story of the heartless man.

403
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,880
What a touching and tragic story.

404
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,280
Although your story sounds logical, you deceived us many times before.

405
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,800
We can't determine if your memory is true or not.

406
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,420
I expected this to happen a long time ago.

407
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,400
What are you doing?

408
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,500
With my powers alone, I can't revive her by using Paper and Ink.

409
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,666
That's why I set up a sacrificial array awhile ago.

410
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:23,740
The array was already activated when all of you were watching my memories.

411
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,920
If you assist me, we can leave the array together.

412
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,960
If you stop me, we shall die together.

413
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,320
You must be out of your mind!

414
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,500
I even chose to believe your crazy story!

415
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,580
I truly only want to save my beloved.

416
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,500
I had no choice but to resort to such underhanded methods.

417
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,140
I think that we can trust him one last time.

418
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:52,480
Even if he was lying to us, if we stop assisting him, he won't be able to get what he wants.

419
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,500
If he was speaking the truth, we can fulfill his wish for him.

420
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,500
By then, the Devil Clan will fall into ruins as they lose their leader forever.

421
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,080
Fine then. I'll agree to it then.

422
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,860
When a deity perishes, if his or her immortal spirit doesn't perish completely,

423
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,940
Paper and Ink can be used to summon the soul and reconstruct the flesh.

424
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:19,940
To activate the revival array, the activator needs to offer their soul and spirit as tributes for Paper and Ink.

425
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,980
Besides that, it requires two highly-skilled individuals to use their immortal powers

426
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,920
to prevent the activator from losing himself completely.

427
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,060
This won't do.

428
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:34,280
I once read this in a book. The Three Souls and Seven Spirits form one's source.

429
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,940
If you remove them by force, you'll experience excruciating pain.

430
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,080
If your immortal power goes berserk, you will die from it.

431
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,140
If the person I'm trying to revive isn't Tao Ziqi, you may interrupt me at any time.

432
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,920
At that time I'll lose my soul and spirit.

433
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,360
You can do whatever you want to me.

434
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,600
Fine. We'll give it a try.

435
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,400
But if you deceive us, I'll immediately destroy Bone Mountain.

436
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,580
So, it's best if you don't deceive us. Otherwise, I'll do what I say.

437
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,280
However, Bone Mountain doesn't have a peak we can see.

438
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,800
There are countless bones here.

439
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,120
How are you going to locate her soul?

440
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,740
Ziqi always wore her Ziyan Hairpin.

441
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,980
It was a reward from the Heavenly Court.

442
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,300
The Ziyan Hairpin is made from the strongest and most beautiful materials.

443
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,760
It will never disappear.

444
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,680
The Ziyan Hairpin meant a lot to her.

445
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,880
She was always playing with it.

446
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,840
As long as we can find that hairpin, we can surely gather her soul and spirit.

447
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,100
Hurry, let go of me.

448
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,000
If not, your wound will worsen.

449
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,700
It doesn't matter.

450
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,720
 Why would you risk your life for me time and time again if you don't have me in your heart? 

451
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:20,030

♫   I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust   ♫

460
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:37,180
♫   Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most  ♫

461
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:45,050
♫   You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers   ♫

462
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:51,250
♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

463
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:59,250
♫   You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine   ♫

464
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:07,730
♫   In my dream, the one I loved is with me   ♫

465
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:27,500
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

466
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:33,700
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

467
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:41,480
♫  As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable  ♫

468
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:48,700
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

469
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:57,020
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫
