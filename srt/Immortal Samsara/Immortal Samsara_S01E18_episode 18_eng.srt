 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,600
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai is advising people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,820
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,170
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,450
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,120
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams   ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths   ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,920
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws  ♫

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,020
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,320
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,100
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,770
   

15
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,050
   

16
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,220
Only what?

17
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,400
Why did he leave without finishing the sentence?

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,100
Only...

19
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,220
Only when the Butterfly of Lucid Dreams...

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,780
detects that there's no attachment or love remaining...

21
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,120
When the root of love is severed, it breaks its cocoon and becomes a butterfly.

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,840
Even if it's crushed to death, it can be reborn, as it carries no emotional resentment.

23
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,680
Night Forgetting River... is full of beings without emotions...

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,100
and those who have given up on love.

25
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,840
So it's not strange for the butterfly to appear here.

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,320
Back then, in the thatched cottage...

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,660
in that butterfly dream, he had no feelings for me.

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,240
Turns out that he never loved me, from the very beginning.

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,300
Since that's the case...

30
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,680
you should stop dwelling on it.

31
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,580
You'll definitely succeed...

32
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,260
in crossing the river today.

33
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,940
 Yan Dan, you kept failing to cross the river. 

34
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,980
 I can only try to create an opening in the river and send you directly to Mortal Realm. 

35
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
 It's just that you'll retain your memories this way. 

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,280
 So I can't face you in my real form and increase your pain. 

37
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,980
 I only hope this view of the blossoms can become a beautiful memory in the future. 

38
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,140
Take care.

39
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,440
Who are you?

40
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,620
River crossers who don't wish to be implicated or die should get lost.

41
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,520
Capture that woman there alive for me.

42
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,320
 Underworld King? Why does he want to capture Yan Dan? 

43
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,380
You don't know what's good for you.

44
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,340
Kill him!

45
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,140
I've been to Bi City, the northern capital, Mount Yan,

46
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,300
the Wushui region, and Diling Town.

47
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,660
Yan Dan...

48
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,120
it's been almost 900 years now.

49
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,260
I've searched every corner of the mortal world...

50
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,760
and met tens of thousands of people.

51
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,680
But why can I still not find you?

52
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,540
Where on earth are you?

53
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,060
 I will not give up. 

54
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,280
Ao Xuan?

55
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,080
Yu Mo, we were in the Heavenly Realm together for so long.

56
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,120
Yet I never realized who you were. You hid it very well.

57
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,840
It's too bad that I have your scale.

58
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,030
As long as you cast spells, I can follow your trail of spiritual power and kill you.

59
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,640
Your Dragon Clan gathered such a large army to catch me.

60
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,920
Aren't you afraid that the rest of the Aquatic Clans will find out about my identity?

61
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,960
If I kill you, no one will find out.

62
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,640
Attack!

63
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,060
Trying to escape? It won't be that easy!

64
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,600
Yi Cang, hurry and leave. I'm his target. Go!

65
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,560
Underworld King has been unreasonably ruthless. I want to teach him a lesson.

66
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,920
Don't worry. Nothing will happen to me. Wait here for me.

67
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,540
You're the great Underworld King. Why do you want to capture a river crosser?

68
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,820
Who do you think you are?

69
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,010
How dare you question me like this?

70
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,010
I've been here for more than 800 years.

71
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,880
No one has ever tried to capture me.

72
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,690
This is strange. Someone must be behind this.

73
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,520
You should leave quickly!

74
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,230
As expected, you have an accomplice.

75
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,700
The Sonic Bat belongs to Heavenly Realm.

76
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,820
Who exactly in Heavenly Realm are you colluding with?

77
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:58,830
 Underworld King only uses his left hand to attack because he's afraid someone will see the counter effects of the spell in his right hand. 

78
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,980
So this is the reason you're after Yan Dan.

79
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,880
 This body will soon be mine! 

80
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,680
Give me the Four-Leaf Lotus now!

81
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,300
If you make another move, you'll succumb to your internal demon.

82
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,660
 He's actually Emperor Qingli, Ying Yuan? 

83
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,240
Yi Cang, what just happened?

84
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,300
What's going on right now?

85
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,100
I'm fine. Don't worry. Wait for me.

86
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,100
You're the master of Night Forgetting River.

87
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,840
You abuse the power of the dark force to kill living beings.

88
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,020
Today, I shall destroy you and punish you for your crime.

89
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,060
The Golden Seal of the Seven Planets?

90
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,780
Your Majesty, I only acted so foolishly because I was tricked.

91
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,640
Your Majesty, please spare me this time.

92
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,760
The Golden Seal of the Seven Planets is a divine tool that belonged to Emperor Wan Yun.

93
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,980
You've never sparred with him before.

94
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,500
Tell me! How did you get these injuries?

95
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:54,440
During the Divine-Devil War, Emperor Wan Yun seriously injured me.

96
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,300
Did Your Majesty not know about this?

97
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,160
 Your Majesty, the Devil Clan told us to provide reinforcements here. 

98
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,060
 But they haven't arrived yet! 

99
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,160
 Could the battle up ahead be unfavorable to them? 

100
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,500
 Did they abandoned us and flee? 

101
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,500
 I always felt Elder Shuo Hua couldn't be trusted when he said we'd reap the benefits. 

102
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,830
 There's no such thing as a good deal in the world. 

103
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,580
 Maybe they're sending us to die in their stead! 

104
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,000
 So you're colluding with the Devil Clan in this battle too, Underworld King. 

105
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,560
 I will report this to Divine Realm and ask His Supreme Majesty to punish you! 

106
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,280
 Devil King is dead! All of you rebels and traitors should surrender now! 

107
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,400
 Devil King is dead? 

108
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,440
 Emperor, please have mercy! 

109
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:37,380
 I was confused because Devil King bewitched me! 

110
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,280
 I've always been loyal to the Divine Realm. 

111
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,840
 I never thought of betraying the Divine Realm for tens of thousands of years. 

112
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,280
 Please, Your Majesty, spare me! 

113
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,120
News of the battle spread all over the Divine Realm.

114
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,300
His Supreme Majesty also made it clear that it was Devil King Xuan Xiang

115
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,420
who led the army into the Illusion of Demons, catching the three emperors and Star Deity Ji Du off guard.

116
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,360
If the three emperors really had killed the Devil King,

117
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,340
the Devil Realm would have been in chaos without a leader.

118
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,260
Then why would the three emperors have died in battle?

119
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,680
I don't know!

120
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,120
After our defeat, I was imprisoned... imprisoned in the Heavenly Prison by the heavenly soldiers.

121
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,660
After the battle ended,

122
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,380
His Supreme Majesty considered the fact that it was my first offense, and that I didn't cause a huge problem.

123
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,220
So he only punished me by draining 10,000 years of my cultivation and exiled me to Night Forgetting River.

124
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:42,420
Since then, I've doubled my annual tribute and have the utmost respect for the Heavenly Realm.

125
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,560
I would never dare to deceive you, Your Majesty!

126
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,200
 If what Underworld King said is true, why is it different from what is written in the Heavenly Annals? 

127
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,200
 Was there something else behind the heavy casualties suffered by the Divine Realm back then? 

128
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,200
When I'm done with my business, I will return to question you again.

129
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,980
Yan Dan.

130
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,200
Let go, Yi Cang.

131
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,080
The Underworld King wants to kill me.

132
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,500
If you try to stop him again, your life will be in danger.

133
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,060
I can only go to the river to meet my death.

134
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,860
This way, you will be safe.

135
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,880
Yan Dan, don't worry.

136
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,520
I know a way to cross the river...

137
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,920
and send you directly to Mortal Realm.

138
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,980
Don't tell me you're willing to die here...

139
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,480
instead of going to Mortal Realm.

140
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,240
Yes.

141
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,620
Either I forget.. or I die.

142
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:56,220
Otherwise, no matter where I go, it's all like Night Forgetting River.

143
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,380
 I really am useless. 

144
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,360
 All that person took was half of your heart. 

145
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,960
 Yet you can't forget him even if you turn to ash? 

146
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,140
Yan Dan, you won't be able to endure this pain.

147
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,680
I've endured all sorts of pain in this world.

148
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,100
The pain from having my heart gouged out, the punishment of thunder strikes,

149
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,620
having my body ripped apart below the Bridge of Emptiness,

150
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,600
and having my heart burned by the scorching fire in the Underworld Realm...

151
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,110
It can't even compare to the pain of a broken heart.

152
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,480
I must forget him.

153
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,160
I will never turn back.

154
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,060
Yan Dan, do you really want to forget everything?

155
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,760
Yes.

156
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,080
I've been heartbroken over him for too long.

157
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,480
This time, I only wish to be free from this torture.

158
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,380
I haven't fulfilled...

159
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,840
the promise I made.

160
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,240
This time, the last thing I can do for you...

161
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,000
is to fulfill your wish.

162
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:16,980
 No one has ever been successful in erasing memories because of the strict rules since ancient times. 

163
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:24,220
 If you insist on forgetting everything, I'll do everything I can. 

164
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,600
 "Water from Night Forgetting River wipes out all feelings and love." 

165
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,880
 "Anyone who fails to cross the river because of one's obsession..." 

166
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,040
 "can use this method instead." 

167
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,980
 "Refine a bone from the Life and Death Arena." 

168
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,060
 "Collect water from Night Forgetting River." 

169
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,440
 "Gather ash from the Afterlife Path." 

170
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,380
 "Refine it into a sleeping pill." 

171
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,400
Consecrated Dark Force, I request the Fire of the Flaming Heart to finish this pill.

172
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,650
You're not Underworld King!

173
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,510
Who are you?

174
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,620
I come from the Heavenly Realm.

175
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,020
It's a matter of urgency.

176
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,840
So I borrowed Underworld King's identity to request the Fire of the Flaming Heart from the Dark Force.

177
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,340
What will you sacrifice?

178
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,500
Very good.

179
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,080
You're more useful than that useless man.

180
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,700
Those who borrow such fire must undergo a sincerity test.

181
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,280
For what reason do you make this request?

182
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,880
An old friend is trapped in Night Forgetting River.

183
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,520
I want to borrow this power so I'll feel at ease.

184
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,260
Insincere heart.

185
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,740
I have let this person down.

186
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,020
It's hard to repay her kindness.

187
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,320
I only ask for help,

188
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,020
so I'll feel more comforted.

189
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,400
That's not true!

190
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,000
This person...

191
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,640
This person is the one I love.

192
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,140
However... we aren't fated to be together, despite our deep affection.

193
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,200
We eventually had to part ways.

194
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,600
I only wish...

195
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,480
for her memories of the past to be erased.

196
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,740
So she can live happily...

197
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,600
for the rest of eternity.

198
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,500
This is your sincere heart!

199
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,600
 Erasing your memories by force will cause physical pain. 

200
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,940
 But the Agarwood Hairpin has healing effects. 

201
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,800
 If you wear it, you'll feel less pain. 

202
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,780
   

203
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,120
 "With the Fire of the Flaming Heart, burn the token of love before the one who wants to forget everything." 

204
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,760
 "Then the love and memories of the past life can be forgotten." 

205
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,760
 Give it back to me. 

206
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:09,140
♫   I want to be the star that leads you to all corners of the world   ♫

207
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:16,180
♫   Heaven is tedious, let's go to the mortal world to experience all kinds of emotions   ♫

208
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,460
♫   We should learn to be a fish that swims around the world   ♫

209
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,220
 It's hard to stay together after love has ended. 

210
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,100
♫   Joy and sorrow can easily be forgotten instantly when the dust washes over   ♫

211
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,460
 I can't even keep my last memory of you. 

212
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:36,860
♫   I have experienced the intertwined threads of love like a brocade   ♫

213
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,620
♫   I'm still engrossed in the moment of flowers blooming   ♫

214
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,940
I didn't know it would be this heart-wrenching...

215
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,380
wanting you to forget me.

216
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,840
♫   Sometimes I'm just overwhelmed with sadness   ♫

217
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,460
♫   At times, the tenderness eases my heart   ♫

218
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:02,900
♫   Unexpectedly, I can't help but share what I thought was off-limits   ♫

219
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,680
♫   I blame time   ♫

220
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,440
♫  for the mortal world's woe is on your shoulder   ♫

221
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,720
♫   Like the surging tides of stars,   ♫

222
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,900
♫   I continuously ask where the origin of love comes from    ♫

223
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,900
 Emperor Ying Yuan, the stars are beautiful! 

224
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,800
♫   I'm afraid the tears brimming in the corner of my eyes will fall and blur your silhouette   ♫

225
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,500
♫   In my momentary childishness,   ♫

226
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,060
  Emperor Ying Yuan, don't go!  

227
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,940
♫   Even after all that, my path all leans towards you   ♫

228
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,700
♫   Counting the passing of the seasons,   ♫

229
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,340
♫   no matter which directions, everything moves towards you   ♫

230
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,700
♫   The beauty is in the burning agarwood incense,   ♫

231
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:56,880
♫   there's still hope when the ashes settled   ♫

232
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,640
♫   Hear the beautiful prose with a fine beauty and a picturesque view, they pair well together   ♫

233
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,580
♫   Sew two hearts together and a stem sprouts forth   ♫

234
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,260
♫   Understand the wind, think about the rain, and do not awaken from the dream   ♫

235
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,940
   

236
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,580
 If you stop me, you'll have to suffer another heartbreak. 

237
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,720
 Let go. 

238
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,560
 I can't! 

239
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,020
 We are strangers, after all. 

240
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,140
 What are you so obsessed with? 

241
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,240
 In this life, I've loved and been heartbroken before. 

242
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,060
 That's already enough. 

243
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,460
 But have you ever shown me your true feelings? 

244
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,820
 Your love is so deep that it's hard to erase the old memories. 

245
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:14,060
 Only by burning the root of your affection for me... 

246
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,800
 can your memories be completely erased. 

247
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,640
 I've already shown you my feelings. 

248
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,500
 Let go of your obsession. 

249
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:04,600
♫   The moment of our first meeting in Heaven and on Earth   ♫

250
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:10,540
♫   Even the star frost can't stop the fleeting time   ♫

251
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:18,480
♫   I once borrowed your eyes to warm the coldest moment   ♫

252
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,900
♫   I've traveled across the Night Forgetting River, but it's hard to forget this fate   ♫

253
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:32,880
♫   I followed you across the endless seas reluctant to leave you   ♫

254
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,740
♫   It seems too hard to profess my love, the words are caught in my throat   ♫

255
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:46,660
♫   I've wasted a millennium thinking about how to let go of my endless longing for you   ♫

256
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:53,820
♫   Love can only be redeemed if the deadline is forgotten   ♫

257
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,720
 In the past, you wished you could be a mortal who lived freely. 

258
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,500
 But you can only be reincarnated as a human if you cross the river. 

259
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:16,440
 I burned off your root of love, your feelings, and memories of me by force today. 

260
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,000
 Without spiritual power to protect your body, I'm afraid you won't be able to endure the pain. 

261
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,320
 I can only let you leave here... 

262
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,720
 as a demon. 

263
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,360
Demons live freely and unrestrained.

264
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,260
When you're in the mortal world...

265
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,040
you will be a flower demon who lives a carefree life.

266
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,940
I can no longer be with you in the future.

267
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,820
I only wish this Agarwood Hairpin will always keep you safe...

268
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,580
when you're in the mortal world.

269
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:46,140
♫   I followed you across the endless seas reluctant to leave you   ♫

00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,520
 The past is gone. 

272
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,180
 They shouldn't stay in the world anymore. 

273

282
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,180
You won't remember anymore.

283
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,920
But I...

284
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:21,120
♫   The flowers bloom and fall, even though I say nothing and you hear nothing   ♫

285
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,770
can never forget.

286
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,820
 There are many mysteries surrounding the seal on Underworld King. 

287
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,140
 I must return and question him as soon as possible. 

288
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,680
 He could actually damage my divine power. 

289
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,040
 This person is by no means simple. 

290
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,280
 He's stalling for time. 

291
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,660
 Is he trying to divert my attention? 

292
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,040
 They actually crushed his internal core? 

293
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,500
 They did something this ruthless just to silence him. 

294
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,520
 There must be some secret behind the Divine-Devil War. 

295
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,540
 Now that the Sonic Bat is dead and the Underworld King eliminated, this person must have gone into hiding. 

296
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:57,400
 If I want to find out the truth and expose his identity, I need to start investigating it through Devil Clan. 

297
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,300
Zi Lin, you attacked the Mountain Chief and caused damage to the mountain area!

298
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,000
Why do you still refuse to surrender?

299
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,900
You've become Qiu Xi's lapdogs and harmed your own tribesmen.

300
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,000
Look at yourselves! Are you even demons?

301
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Nice one. I'll remember your kindness.

302
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,000
Don't go after him!

303
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,500
The Soul-Crushing Hook has damaged his dragon core.

304
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,000
He will surely die.

305
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,200
Let me tell you,

306
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,400
if it weren't for my ten thousand-year-old golden armor, we would have died already.

307
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,800
Brother! Hey, Brother!

308
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
He's seriously injured.

309
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
You saved my life today.

310
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,700
I won't let you die.

311
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,400
   

312
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,200
Is that so?

313
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
Royal Father!

314
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
Ao Xuan.

315
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,000
Zhao Lan? What brings you here?

316
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,500
Zhao Lan came with the South Sea Dragon King to discuss the wedding date.

317
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll go and entertain your future father-in-law in the inner hall.

318
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,400
You two should have a good talk.

319
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,800
"Wedding date"?

320
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,800
So, you're willing to marry me now?

321
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Where's my thing?

322
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,100
It's been 900 years, and the first time you willingly come to see me is only for that scale?

323
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,500
You said you'd return it to me the day I was willing to marry you.

324
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,600
As a dignified Crown Prince, don't go back on your word.

325
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,000
I threw it away.

326
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,600
What?

327
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,000
When and where did you throw it away?

328
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,300
I don't remember.

329
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,400
I never cared about insignificant objects like that.

330
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,100
Ao Xuan, if you go back on your word, consider our wedding canceled!

331
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,400
So you refuse to marry me?

332
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,600
The person in your heart is already dead.

333
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,800
I'll see how long you can hold on for.

334
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,800
 My dragon core was damaged, 

335
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,000
 but I was still able to recover. 

336
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,200
 What is this place exactly? 

337
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,900
You're finally awake!

338
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,800
This hot spring is indeed magical!

339
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,600
It can even save a dying person.

340
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,400
Where am I?

341
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,500
Enough. Stop asking questions.

342
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,400
We can't stay here for too long. This is Qiu Xi's private stronghold.

343
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,700
If he finds out we're using it secretly, he'll definitely take revenge.

344
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,400
Since you're already here, why rush to leave?

345
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,700
It's Qiu Xi.

346
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,400
I didn't expect to capture a tortoise.

347
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,000
Do you like my territory that much?

348
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,800
These are the accommodations I prepared for you.

349
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,000
Stinky lizard.

350
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,400
Do you think you can imprison me here?

351
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,700
You're getting ahead of yourself!

352
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,100
 - Let me go! 
 - Move! 

353
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,300
Your beauty is pointless. You'll still end up as the Mountain Chief's meal.

354
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,000
Move! Move it!

355
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Bai Ling?

356
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,200
- Hurry up! Move it! 
 - Don't try anything funny.

357
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
- Come over here!
 - Move!

358
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,200
Mountain Chief, we've already caught the demons who escaped yesterday, and the lark who delivered the message.

359
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,000
Stinky lizard.

360
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,000
You're so beautiful.

361
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,800
You would be a nice concubine.

362
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,300
Why seek your own death by sending a message and showing this traitor the way?

363
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,400
You massacred hundreds of our avian clans' demons.

364
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,200
I hate you more than you know!

365
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
All right.

366
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,500
Then I'll fulfill your request and let you reunite with your tribesmen!

367
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,300
Stop!

368
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:23,000

♫   My most bewildering memory is the moonlight falling like frost on the ground full of fallen leaves   ♫

371
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:01,600
♫   For a single teardrop, I'm drowning myself in sorrow, obsessing with forgetting you   ♫

372
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:08,600
♫   If we'd have to walk till we separate, to where would you want to go?   ♫

373
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:15,800
♫   Turn around and become the delusion of my life  ♫

374
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:22,800
♫   The most beautiful destiny is hidden in the dark night, "love" is the word for everything   ♫

375
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,800
♫   My loneliness and longing for you leaves a mark like fragments of the moon   ♫

376
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:37,000
♫   I still have an image of you imprinted in my mind even after washing away the fine dust   ♫

377
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,200
♫   Life after life, this is the longing I missed the most  ♫

378
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:51,000
♫   You are the breeze of a fallen flower in the world of flowers adding to the mound of fallen flowers   ♫

379
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,300
♫   Will you shed tears over the truth of the mortal world?   ♫

380
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:05,200
♫   You're like the unattainable Autumn Moon in the vast sky, don't dare to shine bright yet not hesitate to shine  ♫

381
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:13,000
♫   In my dream, the one I loved is with me   ♫

382
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:33,400
♫   After bidding farewell, when Spring becomes Autumn, where can I find my heart in this world?   ♫

383
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,600
♫   Several lifetimes will not be enough for our parting   ♫

384
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:47,600
♫   As I watch lovers enjoying fireworks on the riverbanks, my love and longing for you makes my pain unbearable  ♫

385
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:54,600
♫   There will be a time when the world is beautiful   ♫

386
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:03,400
♫   When the lotus blossoms again, you and I will be together   ♫
