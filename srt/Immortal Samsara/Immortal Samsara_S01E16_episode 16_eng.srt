 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,540
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai advises people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,860
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,170
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,379
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,179
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:52,000
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,520
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,899
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:11,270
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,339
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:22,000
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,780
   

15
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,350
   

16
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,004
Go ahead.

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,740
Guard of Underworld, how wide is Night Forgetting River?

18
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,180
If you still have deep convictions, the distance is infinite.

19
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,920
If you can let go, it'll be just step away.

20
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,400
I've walked a hundred thousand steps.

21
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,099
Every step I take, I tell myself that I'm going to forget soon.

22
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:13,760
But until now, I still can't forget.

23
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,680
Ever since I started working here, the longest time a person takes to forget the past is merely seven days.

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,880
You may stay in the inn first.

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,880
You'll get over it in a few days.

26
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,560
 Can I really get over this? 

27
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,525
   

28
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,860
What should we do with these old garments?

29
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,339
They're damaged. Why don't we burn it in the Soul Incinerator?

30
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:58,699
- Go. 
 - Yes.

31
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,780
Should we get a heavenly physician?

32
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,259
His Majesty received a punishment of love. We should hide it.

33
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:06,800
What should we do?

34
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,979
His Majesty's divine power is diffusing! Should we just do nothing?

35
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,440
Your Supreme Majesty.

36
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,120
Take good care of His Majesty.

37
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,799
After he's exposed to the cold, don't let him get close to heat. Otherwise, his vital essence will be disturbed.

38
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,079
He might end up in a coma for a hundred years or even die.

39
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,059
It's very dangerous. Please be extra careful.

40
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:01,180
 Yes, Your Supreme Majesty. 

41
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,940
Thank you for the guidance, Your Supreme Majesty.

42
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,480
Don't tell him that I was here.

43
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:55,725
   

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

45
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,860
Did you burn the wrong thing?

46
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,679
No. Those were all damaged items.

47
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:31,940
-  Your Majesty!  
 - I checked them.

48
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,440
-  Your Majesty!  
 - Where's His Majesty?

49
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,000
His Majesty jumped into the Soul Incinerator!

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,999
Your Majesty! You can't be exposed to heat!

51
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:41,559
Your Majesty, no!

52
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
The fire of Soul Incinerator can't be put out.

53
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,480
 Your Majesty! 

54
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,020
 Your Majesty! 

55
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,500
 Your Majesty. 

56
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,459
He lost his vital essence. His primordial spirit is diffused.

57
00:06:54,459 --> 00:07:01,699
Your Majesty, you barely regained some divine power. Your Majesty, come back to the palace with us.

58
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,960
I'll get a heavenly physician.

59
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,340
No need.

60
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,540
What I'm suffering now... is what I deserve.

61
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,260
Yanxu Heavenly Palace... is a place everyone in the Heavenly Realm longs for.

62
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,240
But to me...

63
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,180
it's just a cage.

64
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,640
I've lived for tens of thousands of years...

65
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,260
yet I never had such happy memories.

66
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,580
From today onwards...

67
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,040
I will leave the palace.

68
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,760
I'm no longer Emperor Qingli.

69
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,440
 Your Majesty! 

70
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,660
 Your Majesty! 

71
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,040
Your Majesty.

72
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:53,925
   

73
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,980
 You always waited for me with the lights on. 

74
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,960
 Now... it shall be me who waits for you. 

75
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,440
 Emperor Ying Yuan. 

76
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,819
 You promised me that when your eyes are cured, you'll enjoy the flowers with me. 

77
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:19,880
 Don't break your promise. 

78
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,200
 I shall make you remember what you never dare to admit. 

79
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,300
 You owe me love. 

80
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:43,100
 I want you to witness me going into Night Forgetting River, and witness how I forget you. 

81
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:50,480
 I guess you must have forgotten me entirely by now. 

82
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,800
 Yan Dan. Don't go, Yan Dan! 

83
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,940
 I can't pay back what I owe you. 

84
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,079
Are you insane? You want to express your Nine Fins Clan identify?

85
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,680
Look, the light is still on.

86
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,259
Ying Yuan must be here.

87
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,899
Yan Dan gouged out her heart and jumped off the bridge for him.

88
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,179
Her life is in danger.

89
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,019
Yet, he's living in peace and solitude here.

90
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,780
How can I stand a heartless person like him?

91
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,939
That's not true.

92
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,079
Before Yan Dan got to the Heavenly Gallows, His Majesty got her the Letter of Immunity.

93
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:12,050
His Majesty never meant to hurt Yan Dan.

94
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,850
Just because he's the Emperor, do we have to be grateful for whatever he awards us with?

95
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,060
Don't forget. He was the one who forced Yan Dan onto Heavenly Gallows.

96
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,870
If His Majesty was a hypocrite, why would he violate the Heavenly Rules and jump off the bridge to find Yan Dan?

97
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,139
Look at the mark on your wrist.

98
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,800
You had a slim chance in Life and Death Arena.

99
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,860
How could Yan Dan survive with her divine power alone?

100
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,640
His Majesty must have saved Yan Dan.

101
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,680
Look. There are lotus seeds in the water.

102
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,880
His Majesty is planting lotuses for Yan Dan.

103
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,300
There are many types of pain.

104
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,200
Do you think being separated is painful?

105
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,979
He is left with regret and can't pay off his debts.

106
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,120
Don't you think that's painful?

107
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,660
He's no different from you.

108
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,240
Stop it.

109
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,000
Since Yan Dan was saved by His Majesty, she must have crossed the Night Forgetting River and arrived in Mortal Realm.

110
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,339
It's more important to find Yan Dan, instead of causing trouble here and getting trapped in Xuanxin Cliff.

111
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,500
If he hadn't let Yan Dan down, she wouldn't be at this stage.

112
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,580
I don't care.

113
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,440
I have to find a way to the Mortal Realm.

114
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,520
I must save her.

115
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
 From Immortal Lord Bei Ming at Xuanxin Cliff. 

116
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,980
 From the vile emperor at Yanxu Heavenly Palace. 

117
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,140
 My favorite gift from my beloved sister. 

118
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,900
 Prepared for the divinity ascension of Zhi Xi. 

119
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,840
 Yan Dan also wants to protect Zhi Xi. 

120
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,240
 Zhi Xi, don't be afraid. I'm here. 

121
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,480
 I'm not afraid. Because I want to protect you forever. 

122
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,180
Yan Dan.

123
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,640
I'm sorry.

124
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,820
Please come back.

125
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,680
Can you?

126
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:51,060
I, Zhi Xi, wish that my little sister, Yan Dan, can go through everything smoothly

127
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,240
and turn misfortunes into blessings, no matter where she is.

128
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,960
I offer my divine power to the Greater God.

129
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,160
I hope the Sacred Temple can grant my wish.

130
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,140
What a hypocritical and fake sisterhood.

131
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,800
Your despicable sister seduced His Majesty.

132
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,560
She deserved to have her soul taken away.

133
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,180
By praying for her, you tarnished this Sacred Temple.

134
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,260
The Sacred Temple is holy.

135
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,499
Curator,  you're being malicious and speaking ill words here.

136
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,299
Aren't you afraid of sin and karma?

137
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,620
How dare you talk back to me?

138
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,900
Let me tell you. Even if you've ascended to divinity, you're still below me!

139
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,890
Even if I turned your sister into ashes, you still have to obey my orders and work for your enemy forever!

140
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,860
You will be subjugated forever!

141
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,300
How dare you steal the divine power?

142
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
No!

143
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:09,460
Remember. If you don't watch your mouth, you'll end up like this bottle.

144
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:20,059
It's said that Four-Leaf Lotus is an ancient bloodline which is high and noble.

145
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:26,490
It seems that the elder sister is good at scheming, while the younger one is naïve and clueless.

146
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,220
You two are an embarrassment to the Heavenly Realm.

147
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,820
 Yan Dan, I was wrong in the past. 

148
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,500
 I shouldn't have listened to the provocation of the wicked. 

149
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,040
 I shouldn't have blamed my incapability on you. 

150
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,740
 Don't worry. This time, I'll surely avenge you. 

151
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:14,700
   

152
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,419
Zhi Xi begged the heavenly official and obtained the registry of the passengers at Night Forgetting River.

153
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,840
Zhi Xi is timid, but she values the hierarchy of divinity.

154
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,859
She even dares to bribe.

155
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,739
She's eager to save her sister, so she lost her mind.

156
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,919
She doesn't know the heavenly official is your person and will report to us.

157
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,459
Bribing a divine official is a serious crime.

158
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,699
Curator, how would you like to punish her?

159
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:53,840
If I punish her now, I can't guarantee that she won't find another way to save herself.

160
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,600
I heard that His Majesty also checks the registration book every day to find out about Yan Dan’s status.

161
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,540
Since they care about that lowly immortal attendant so much,

162
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,540
I shall send them some good news.

163
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,920
Ask the heavenly official to prepare a fake registration book

164
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:21,019
that says Yan Dan has crossed the river and arrived safely in the Mortal Realm.

165
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:22,580
Yes.

166
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:36,500
When Yan Dan fails to cross the river and turns into ashes,

167
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,940
I would love to see the look on their faces.

168
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,300
You shouldn't be here. 
    

169
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,800
Please leave.

170
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,420
Has Your Majesty been staying up for heavenly duties?

171
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,260
Your Majesty is still injured.

172
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,820
This heavy workload will worsen your injuries.

173
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,100
I'm here to inform Your Majesty of something.

174
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,180
Yan Dan has crossed the river successfully.

175
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:04,725
   

176
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:11,339
Ever since Yan Dan jumped off the bridge, I've begged the heavenly official to let me check the registration regularly.

177
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:15,860
Today, I found Yan Dan's name on the River Passenger Registry.

178
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,940
 From now on... she should have nothing to do with me anymore. 

179
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,960
 I shouldn't keep this longing for you in my heart. 

180
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,600
I just want to make up for the mistakes that I made.

181
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,040
That’s the reason I came to console Your Majesty with this registration.

182
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,899
Since Yan Dan has crossed the river successfully,

183
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:45,560
Your Majesty should stop worrying and put your duties aside to recuperate.

184
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,240
This is also what Yan Dan would hope for.

185
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,859
The Devil Clan has no leader after the war.

186
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,419
The Three Realms are in chaos.

187
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,020
The people are not living in peace.

188
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,260
I have to bring peace to the world.

189
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,400
Your Majesty is just trying to numb yourself with work.

190
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,179
Does being tired and hurt ease the pain of losing your loved one?

191
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:02,540
That's enough!

192
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,139
I have my responsibilities.

193
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,740
It has nothing to do with others.

194
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,620
You may leave.

195
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,340
 Since we have forgotten each other, I only hope that you're safe. 

196
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,900
Please show the approval from His Supreme Majesty.

197
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,000
Approval from His Supreme Majesty?

198
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,100
This is the gate to the Mortal Realm.

199
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,900
Without approval from His Supreme Majesty, no one shall pass.

200
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,000
We need your identification.

201
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,500
 The path to the Mortal Realm will reveal my real identity. 

202
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,400
 If my Nine Fins Clan identity is exposed, there will surely be trouble. 

203
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,000
 It may be even harder for me to leave to find Yan Dan. 

204
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,400
 I need to find another way. 

205
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,000
   

206
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,200
 Yan Dan, how can I enter the Mortal Realm? 

207
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,600
 Are you well in the Mortal Realm? 

208
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,000
   

209
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,000
   

210
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,000
 The restriction was just lifted. 

211
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,400
 Brother Yu Mo has been looking for a way to go to the Mortal Realm non-stop. 

212
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,800
 I'm sure he hasn't had a proper meal. 

213
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,000
Brother Yu Mo!

214
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,800
Brother Yu Mo. Brother Yu Mo!

215
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,000
Brother Yu Mo, have you lost your mind?

216
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,200
A Nine Fins Clan without a horn is like a person without a limb!

217
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
Why did you do that?

218
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The ancient book says that the dragon horn of Nine Fins Clan is indestructible and can destroy everything.

219
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:42,500
Hence, I cut off this horn so I can open the sky portal and go to Mortal Realm.

220
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,000
"The person who uses the horn as a blade. It disappears after being used."

221
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,400
"Those who cut their horn will die from losing their spiritual power."

222
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,400
"This is an act when all others fail."

223
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,200
"Do not use unless in desperation."

224
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,900
Brother Yu Mo, you're risking your life.

225
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,600
It's okay.

226
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
I must find her.

227
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,099
You're badly injured.

228
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,200
If you break the barrier forcefully now, you may die before you reach Mortal Realm.

229
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,700
How will you find Yan Dan, then?

230
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,000
Zhao Lan.

231
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,800
Zhao Lan. Help me.

232
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,400
Break the barrier for me, okay?

233
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,100
No, I won’t.

234
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,900
Brother Yu Mo.

235
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,400
Brother Yu Mo.

236
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,700
I'll find a way to restore your divine power.

237
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,300
When one's divine power is lost and they are reverted to their original form, only Pill of Nine Refinements can save him.

238
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,800
But that is His Supreme Majesty’s favorite item.

239
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,200
It was obtained from an ancient beast after years of conquests.

240
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
There is only one of it.

241
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,700
I'm just a nobody. I won't be able to get it.

242
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:59,900
Therefore, I've decided to try to steal it from Yuqing Palace tonight.

243
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,400
If I'm caught and sentenced to death,

244
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,600
please be sure to bring Merfolk Orb back to the North Sea.

245
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,000
This is the only thing I leave behind.

246
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,400
Don't fight against overwhelming odds.

247
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,600
I have another way.

248
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,600
Cheers.

249
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,800
Zhao Lan. Although we're engaged, Royal Father would like me to get married soon.

250
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,200
He isn't rushing it considering we just transformed into human forms recently.

251
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,600
Today, I didn't expect you to take the initiative and have His Supreme Majesty be our witness.

252
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,800
You read my mind.

253
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,779
Since this is your wish, I will not let you down.

254
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,800
I'll give you a grand wedding ceremony.

255
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:35,700
Fellow immortals, today's gathering is regarding a wedding in Dragon Clan.

256
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,700
The son of Dragon King of the East Sea, Ao Xuan, and the Princess of Dragon King of the South Sea, Zhao Lan,

257
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,100
came to cultivate in the Heavenly Realm a thousand years ago.

258
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,200
Today, they have succeeded and taken human forms.

259
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,100
They should go back to Dragon Palace to start a family and continue their bloodline.

260
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,400
Today, I shall agree to their marriage.

261
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,700
Let's celebrate together.

262
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,600
Thank you for your goodwill, Your Supreme Majesty.

263
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,500
It's our honor.

264
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,400
I'm grateful for your love, Your Supreme Majesty.

265
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,800
I venture to ask Your Supreme Majesty for a wedding gift.

266
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,200
Zhao Lan.

267
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,000
There has never been a wedding in the Heavenly Realm.

268
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,400
It's quite interesting to grant gifts and rejoice.

269
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,200
What would you like? Speak up.

270
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,500
I heard that Your Supreme Majesty has a Pill of Nine Refinements, which can improve divine power.

271
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,000
I just took on a human form and lack spiritual power.

272
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,600
I would like to have it by my side.

273
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
All right.

274
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,600
You're young, yet you often think about your cultivation.

275
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,500
I am pleased.

276
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,800
Thank you, Your Supreme Majesty.

277
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,000
Your Majesty.

278
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,600
His Supreme Majesty held a festivity at Jade Pool, yet Your Majesty didn't attend.

279
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,800
Why is Your Majesty here suddenly?

280
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,600
Seeing how Your Majesty looks, Your Majesty must have been to Devil Realm to settle the remnant of the battle.

281
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,000
Such tough duties should be given to the subordinates.

282
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,600
Why did you do it yourself?

283
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,000
When the Devil Clan invaded us, did they damage the Pillar?

284
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,500
There were just some cracks.

285
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,300
I've repaired it with the heavenly soldiers.

286
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,800
However, the crack is large.

287
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,200
Xuan Xiang must have hit it with Nine-Tailed Hydra during the Divine-Devil War.

288
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:32,600
An unknown immortal covered the Pillar with their divine power, hence it wasn't discovered.

289
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,500
 It's the spiritual power of the lotus, Yan Dan. 

290
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,400
Report this matter and investigate which immortal did this so they can be rewarded by His Supreme Majesty.

291
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,000
There's no need.

292
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,800
She is no longer in the Heavenly Realm.

293
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,800
She's not interested in the glory of the Heavenly Realm.

294
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,800
She surely doesn't want her name to be recorded in the Heavenly Register.

295
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,900
Tell the officials of the Heavenly Annals...

296
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,000
to record this matter as such.

297
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
During the Divine-Devil War, the Devils wanted to destroy the Pillar of the Sacred Temple.

298
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,600
An unknown immortal, with a deep sense of righteousness, risked her life to protect it.

299
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:38,100
Although her name is unknown, fellow immortals of the Heavenly Realm respect her righteousness and are grateful for her.

300
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:05,300
 Hopefully, everything goes well for her in the future. 

301
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,000
   

302
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,500
Be careful.

303
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,100
This is great!

304
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,800
Your original form has faded. You're finally all right.

305
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,600
Where is Zhao Lan?

306
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,400
Don't be reckless again.

307
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,200
Your sudden decision made Zhao Lan and I suffer.

308
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,300
Do you know how much we've done to save you?

309
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,100
I don't know what you did for me.

310
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,200
 After receiving this wedding gift from the Supreme Majesty,  you can never back out of your marriage with Ao Xuan . 

311
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,000
 Have you thought it through? 

312
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,200
 My father arranged this marriage a long time ago. 

313
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,800
 I have to marry him sooner or later. 

314
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,700
 I might as well take the chance to get this pill to save Brother Yu Mo's life. 

315
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
 You've done so much for Yu Mo. 

316
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,900
 Wait until he's conscious and see him before you leave. 

317
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,400
 No. 

318
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,400
 I’m afraid when he wakes up, I will be the one who doesn’t want to leave. 

319
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,600
Zhao Lan.

320
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,500
Brother Yu Mo.

321
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,400
Brother Yu Mo.

322
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,200
This is not a good place to talk.

323
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,700
Hurry up.

324
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,600
I'll keep watch.

325
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,900
Brother Yu Mo, are you feeling better now?

326
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,600
Thank you.

327
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,000
But how can you leave without saying goodbye?

328
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,600
I've been away from home for hundreds of years. It’s time to go home.

329
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,000
You can’t.

330
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,100
After you go back, you'll surely marry that evil Ao Xuan.

331
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,500
Have you asked your heart about it?

332
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,100
See. I knew you didn't.

333
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:14,200
I remember you told me to ask the Heartseeker Bell when I'm undecided at any moment.

334
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Have you asked it?

335
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,000
Then...

336
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,100
What about your heart?

337
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
I've asked the Heartseeker Bell.

338
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,100
Heartseeker Bell told me... that I must break the barrier to go to Mortal Realm.

339
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,700
No matter what the price is, I have to save Yan Dan.

340
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Well then, I've also made my decision.

341
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,900
- Zhao Lan. 
 - Brother Yu Mo, listen to me.

342
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,700
If you want to go to Mortal Realm, now is the best time.

343
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,200
Dragon King and Ao Xuan just left through Southern Heavenly Gate.

344
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,900
The defense there is more relaxed than usual.

345
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,600
The heavenly soldiers can't attend to everything.

346
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,700
You can take the chance to open the sky portal and go to Mortal Realm. I'll help you.

347
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,500
But Zhao Lan...

348
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,800
This is a grave issue.

349
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,500
I'll look out for you here.

350
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,000
I won't let the heavenly soldiers disturb you.

351
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,300
Promise us.

352
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,900
You must find Yan Dan and make sure she's safe.

353
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
You must stay safe too.

354
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,600
 It's Yu Mo again. 

355
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,000
 I wondered why Zhao Lan hadn't caught up with us. 

356
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,400
 Turns out they're meeting secretly here. 

357
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,200
 They want to open the sky portal?  

358
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,200
 Are they trying to elope? 

359
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,400
 I can't let them do this. 

360
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,800
 With the Soul-Returning Spell of Dragon Clan, let's see how you can fight against it. 

361
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,900
 Bear the consequences. 

362
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,600
Brother Yu Mo. Brother Yu Mo!

363
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,900
Brother Yu Mo. You're injured.

364
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,200
Brother Yu Mo. Brother Yu Mo!

365
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,300
Brother Yu Mo, you're injured. Stop trying.

366
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,500
Let's find another way.

367
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,800
There are other ways to open the sky portal.

368
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,300
Brother Yu Mo. Stop trying, okay?

369
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,300
Brother Yu Mo.

370
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,200
Look. The sky portal is open.

371
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,800
I can go to Mortal Realm to find Yan Dan.

372
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Good.

373
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Brother Yu Mo, I hope you find Yan Dan soon.

374
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,300
When you find her, take her to see me in the North Sea.

375
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,600
Thank you.

376
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,400
Go ahead.

377
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,000
Goodbye, Brother Yu Mo.

378
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,400
 The Soul-Returning Spell has never been so powerful. 

379
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,100
 What creature is he? 

380
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:03,000
