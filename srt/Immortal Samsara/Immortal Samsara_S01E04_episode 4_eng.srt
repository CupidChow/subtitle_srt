 ''Mortal World Diary'' - Zhang Jie 

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,439
♫   Loneliness on the Immortal Island of Penglai advises people from the mortal world   ♫

4
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,960
♫   That true love is hard to find   ♫

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,170
♫   What will happen if you give up on love?   ♫

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,479
♫   True love can only be enlightened by chance   ♫

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,279
♫   Fate played tricks on me, causing my tears to fall   ♫

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,100
♫   The sorrow of separation, and the butterflies in my dreams    ♫

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:02,470
♫   I'll never regret my decision, even if I have to suffer in the Six Paths    ♫

10
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,000
♫   I'm helpless against earthly rules and divine laws    ♫

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,270
♫   I made countless attempts to create my own fate   ♫

12
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,439
♫   Like the tree's burden of making flowers bloom, I've wasted years of my life   ♫

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,000
♫   An air of melancholy surrounds me as the Bodhi leaves fall   ♫

14
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,880
   

15
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,050
   

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,200
Sister Ying Deng.

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,779
Congratulations on your promotion. I wish you all the best.

18
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:44,880
You are looking better than ever.

19
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,599
We both serve His Majesty,

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,760
you may skip the formalities.

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,360
Bi Yi.

22
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,819
Since you left the palace, you passed the divinity exams and become a Divine Official.

23
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:00,360
Now, you're the head of a pavilion.

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,860
Among the many immortal attendants in Yanxu Heavenly Palace,

25
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,670
His Majesty clearly is very fond of you.

26
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,980
Is His Majesty inside?

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,679
This fabric is made from cirrus silk with pliable gold.

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,999
It is indestructible, even against a knife or sword.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,659
It has a honeysuckle flower pattern as the base, embellished with Crape Myrtle crystal and Red Qilin stone.

30
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,719
They will help you calm your mind.

31
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,579
From the pattern to the embroidery, Curator Ying Deng made it with her own hands.

32
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,039
I heard that the Cosmic Jade Belt was broken.

33
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,550
It was due to Immortal Attendant Yan Dan's negligence.

34
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,459
I believe Magical Pavilion bears responsibility for this oversight.

35
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,679
The honeysuckle pattern used to be Your Majesty's favorite.

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,799
Now that I'm unable to serve by your side,

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,639
I hope this calming object will help you sleep better.

38
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,620
There's no need.

39
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,680
That immortal attendant might be reckless, but she has repaired the Jade Belt.

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,020
This fabric is overly ornate and too extravagant.

41
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,540
I'm afraid I don't deserve this.

42
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,939
The Lotus embroidery is too insignificant, and the needlework is unrefined.

43
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,440
It's not befitting of Your Majesty's stature.

44
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,219
If Your Majesty wishes to keep the old belt, I've brought along gold and silver threads to fix it myself.

45
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:20,280
I promise to do a good job.

46
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,520
Your Majesty.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,339
Your Majesty. Yan Dan has finished copying the books of immortality, as you ordered.

48
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,700
Would you like to review them?

49
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,919
How could a lowly immortal attendant who was sentenced to palatial duties

50
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,599
come near the classic volumes of Yanxu Heavenly Palace?

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,560
Don't move!

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,540
A manipulation spell?

53
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,159
   

54
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,599
This is for flipping the tortoise.

55
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,039
This is for beating me at GO!

56
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,719
This is for making me mend clothes!

57
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,220
You shot me with an arrow?

58
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,200
This is the time for payback.

59
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,550
   

60
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,580
There is divine justice, after all.

61
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,479
That Yan Dan is unexpectedly evil.

62
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,040
She has no respect for rules and regulations.

63
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,320
What does she think Yanxu Heavenly Palace is?

64
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,279
I'll take her to the Heavenly Gallows to be punished.

65
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,060
That's not necessary.

66
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,220
I was the one who challenged her.

67
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,700
She won.

68
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,080
Your Majesty, this is against the Heavenly Rules.

69
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,019
Ying Deng, you are no longer with Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

70
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,120
Though you're not the head of this palace, you're voicing your opinions.

71
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,620
You're overstepping your jurisdiction.

72
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,380
I have no time to send you to the Heavenly Gallows.

73
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,040
You may leave.

74
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,520
Fairies these days sure are temperamental.

75
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,239
I should teach Zhi Xi this manipulation spell.

76
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,720
She can use it to defend herself!

77
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,559
 Lu Jing will send "Pure Heart Mantra" to your room. Copy it ten times. 

78
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:06,460
 By the way, "Pure Heart Mantra" comes in sixteen volumes. 

79
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,340
You jerk! Come fight me head-on, if you dare to!

80
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,919
A real man won't hide his face! 
    

81
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,500
   

82
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,259
Move everything out. All of it.

83
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,120
Do it now.

84
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,520
This...

85
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,680
Stop!

86
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,820
Who are you? Why are you dismantling our stage and moving our things?

87
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,440
Because I'm Pixiang Hall's supervisor.

88
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,620
Pixiang Hall's supervisor?

89
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,559
Then there must be a misunderstanding.

90
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,459
It's me. Yan Dan!

91
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:46,259
Have you forgotten? I got Lu Ming to send you a lot of divine tools.

92
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,639
What divine tools?

93
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,159
Don't talk nonsense.

94
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,399
Anyway, no more plays are allowed here.

95
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,619
Move all your things now. Otherwise, I'll throw them all away.

96
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,879
Why didn't you say that when you accepted the divine tools?

97
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,759
Besides, Pixiang Hall has been vacant for years.

98
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,940
Why can't we rehearse our plays here?

99
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,560
Even if it's vacant, it's not for you to use.

100
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,900
The Heavenly Rules state that only those who have attained divinity level

101
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,459
and hold high rank positions above Deputy Curators have the right to use these halls.

102
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:15,960
What?

103
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,360
I know you haven't attained divinity level, yet you don't know how to greet properly?

104
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,880
You really should learn from your sister, Zhi Xi.

105
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,180
At least, she greets like a servant.

106
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,000
Greetings, Curator Ying Deng.

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,999
I have to point out an error in your words.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,679
My sister is not a servant.

109
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,879
She is Magical Pavilion's Deputy Curator.

110
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,599
I might not be at the divinity level, but I have studied the Heavenly Rules.

111
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,679
The rules say that immortals are differentiated by ranks.

112
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,460
But everyone is not defined by status.

113
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:59,079
Don't the rules also state that there are different levels of divine powers?

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,160
We need to do something!

115
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,120
What should we do?

116
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,999
 The manual said, "Reverse the microcosmic orbit to unlock the body and mind." 

117
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:26,680
 But why do I feel so weak? 

118
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,359
 First, collect your Qi in the outer layer before reversing it.
(T/N: QI is the vital energy which exists in all things) 

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,620
Then, have confidence in your heart.

120
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,540
Confidence in the heart.

121
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,800
Receptive Mind Unleashed!

122
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,760
Curator Ying Deng.

123
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,400
 Your Majesty. 

124
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,100
Your Majesty.

125
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,159
Yan Dan is my immortal attendant.

126
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,360
I will reprimand her if she did anything wrong.

127
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,500
Since when was this the Magical Pavilion's duty?

128
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,440
Does it hurt?

129
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,119
I dare not complain.

130
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,780
It should hurt.

131
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,079
You’re bullying the immortal attendants, being arrogant and mean.

132
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,980
This is not how a leader should behave.

133
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,480
You reported Si Xuan's violation of abstinence.

134
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,360
She was at fault.

135
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,520
But let me remind you...

136
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,500
Keep your hands off my people.

137
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,119
- Escort Curator Ying Deng back to the Magical Pavilion. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

138
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,900
   

139
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,540
Is that a spell from the Xiaohan Scriptures?

140
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,339
Ying Deng spent a lot of time studying the Xiaohan Scriptures. So I picked up some things.

141
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:50,719
You seem to have gotten smarter after joining Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

142
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,759
Don't remind me.

143
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,439
That crook, Ying Yuan, keeps ordering me to copy books!

144
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,460
It's hard not to get smarter.

145
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,039
"Xiaohan Scriptures" is an ancient volume.

146
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,199
I'm sure the cultivation method is very different, compared to the present.

147
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,139
If you wish to learn it, the mantra would have to be changed too.

148
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,940
It's too much trouble.

149
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,860
Copying books really did make you smarter. Tell me more.

150
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,160
In the Scriptures, it said, "First seek Heaven's secret, then follow Heaven's will."

151
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,519
But in my opinion, the current immortals’ cultivation practices in the Heavenly Court

152
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,180
should first seek Heaven's will, and then follow Heaven's secret.

153
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,419
Otherwise, your breath will stagnate, and your powers will diminish.

154
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,559
Did His Majesty teach you that?

155
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,720
Of course not!

156
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,679
There's no way that vile person would be so kind.

157
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,860
I figured it out myself.

158
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,999
Your cultivation skill isn’t great,

159
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,960
and yet you are exposed to these high-level powers here.

160
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,479
You could be easily confused.

161
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,960
Remember, never be overconfident or force yourself.

162
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,340
If other Divine Officials heard what you said just now,

163
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,059
they might accuse you for disrespecting the ancient laws. What will you do then?

164
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:56,760
Then I'll  have to ask Fairy Zhi Xi to spare my life and let me go!

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,359
We've chatted enough. I have to leave.

166
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:04,360
Where are you going? What can be more important than your sister?

167
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,519
The palaces' divine tools must be replaced every two hundred years.

168
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,299
During the last inspection,

169
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:11,359
a few divine tools at the Magical Pavilion were broken due to age.

170
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,600
They were added to the damaged list.

171
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,779
The curator of the Soul Incinerator at Qianyun Palace

172
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,159
asked Magical Pavilion to deliver

173
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,959
the broken divine tools sooner, due to the large quantity.

174
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,060
I'm in charge of the delivery.

175
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,200
Is the Crape Myrtle Bottle one of the items?

176
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,960
How did you know?

177
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,480
How could they make you deliver it?

178
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,459
I'm the Deputy Curator. It's part of my duty. What's the matter?

179
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:37,760
Nothing, I just think it's unsafe at night.

180
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,239
Things have been chaotic too.

181
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:41,559
Sister, you shouldn't go.

182
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,360
Ask somebody else to do it.

183
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,319
Are you going to worry about me now?

184
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,980
You should work more on your lips instead of your brain.

185
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,700
I really have to go now.

186
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,699
- You can’t. 
 - Your Majesty. I'm willing to copy all the GO manuals in the Six Realms a hundred times.

187
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:09,080
You can copy the manuals, but you can't switch with her.

188
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,119
This is a big deal. Any slight mishap will bring problems to the Six Realms.

189
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:15,099
We've planned this for a long time. We're almost done.

190
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,999
If the person in charge of the incineration is changed suddenly,

191
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,880
it might alert the enemy.

192
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,839
I am leading the arrest this time.

193
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,319
Nothing will happen to your sister.

194
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,780
But I—

195
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,460
But I almost died in the hands of the Devil Clan.

196
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,739
Moreover, Divine Realm envoys won't be the only ones there.

197
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:32,179
Devil spies will also be present!

198
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,879
Don't forget the entire heavenly army.

199
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,999
If tension arises and a fight breaks out,

200
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,719
your only concern will be the Six Realms.

201
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,520
You won't be able to protect my sister’s life.

202
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,040
Are you doubting me?

203
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,260
That's right.

204
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,879
I am doubting you.

205
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,479
The safety of the Six Realms is important.

206
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,439
But so is my sister's life.

207
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,079
You set her up as the bait.

208
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,759
But you didn't tell her what is going on,

209
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,319
nor did you ask if she is willing to do it.

210
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,740
Don't you think it's unfair?

211
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,539
- Yan Dan. 
 - D-Don't come any closer.

212
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,520
Right now, there's someone who is willing to be a martyr.

213
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,279
I’m willing to take Zhi Xi’s  place.

214
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,300
We are twins, with the same origin.

215
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,719
I can use facial exchange spells to disguise myself for some time.

216
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,079
As long as the people we meet don't check for spells,

217
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,639
no one will find out.

218
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,999
This way, your plan will not be disrupted.

219
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,719
If anything were to happen,

220
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,839
no one would gossip about it either.

221
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,119
Gossip?

222
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,399
It looks like you're the biggest gossip in the Six Realms.

223
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,319
One of these days, I'll have to sew your mouth shut.

224
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,700
Your Majesty!

225
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,039
Zhi Xi is the last hope of the Four-Leaf Lotus Clan.

226
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,679
The heavens love everyone equally!

227
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,200
Please grant my wish, Your Majesty!

228
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,220
You just won't give up.

229
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,620
All right, I approve.

230
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

231
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,079
I'm willing to bow down and sacrifice my life

232
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,460
to repay your kindness.

233
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,900
First, seek Heaven's will, and then find Heaven's secret.

234
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,520
How could this be?

235
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,420
What are you doing, Zhi Xi?

236
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,840
Curator Ying Deng.

237
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,779
Curator wanted to speak to you.

238
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:35,640
But I couldn't find you anywhere in the Pavilion.

239
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,799
Here you are, secretly breaking the artifacts.

240
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,580
Are you that upset about the task given to you by the Magical Pavilion?

241
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,279
Curator Ying Deng. I was just practicing my divine arts.

242
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,780
I didn't mean to break the divine tools.

243
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,159
This morning, you went to Yanxu Heavenly Palace

244
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,240
to look for your sister, right?

245
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,060
I’ve had enough of that innocent expression of yours.

246
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,700
Are you ready with the items that have to be incinerated?

247
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,460
They're ready.

248
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,960
Then bring them here.

249
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,540
Yes, Curator.

250
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,300
The seven items are all here.

251
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,200
Send it to Yanxu Heavenly Palace.

252
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,420
Yes, Curator.

253
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,919
Why? Shouldn't I be the one delivering it?

254
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,539
His Majesty just sent a secret order.

255
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:12,280
These divine tools will be delivered by Yanxu Heavenly Palace's Yan Dan.

256
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,719
Matters pertaining to the Magical Pavilion

257
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,070
have always been carried out internally.

258
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,120
What are you and your sister plotting this time?

259
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,939
You made His Majesty think that Magical Pavilion couldn't even handle such a small matter.

260
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:27,540
I didn’t do such a thing.

261
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,580
You didn't?

262
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,980
Then you better ask your sister.

263
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,680
What she stole isn't just Magical Pavilion's duty,

264
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,380
but also your duty.

265
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,099
The slap I gave you wasn't just from me.

266
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,660
It was bestowed by your sister.

267
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,720
One twin is always stronger than the other.

268
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,740
I know you're useless.

269
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,680
But I thought you would at least be stronger than Yan Dan.

270
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,220
Perhaps my judgment was wrong.

271
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,860
I'll tell you this now.

272
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,200
Magical Pavilion doesn't accept rejects.

273
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,280
 Yan Dan, why do you want to deliver the divine tools? 

274
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,620
 What exactly are you doing? 

275
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,560
 You are very familiar with the palace volumes. 

276
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,920
 Common Devil Clan members shouldn't be a threat to you. 

277
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,899
 The patrols outside the palace are under my command. 

278
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:02,160
 They are ready to intervene at any time. 

279
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,279
 The pearl hairpin you're wearing has a surveillance function. 

280
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,360
 If the trespassers try anything, I will react immediately. 

281
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,080
 There must be a spy within the Divine Realm, 

282
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,360
 who helped include the Crape Myrtle Bottle in the damaged list. 

283
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,960
 The goal is to expose their identity. 

284
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,750
   

285
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,299
I've brought the divine tools to be incinerated from the Magical Pavilion.

286
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,839
There are seven items in total.

287
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,300
Divine Official Yan Chi, please check.

288
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,439
Fairy Zhi Xi, you have always been meticulous.

289
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,079
There's no need for me to worry.

290
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,479
You are on duty so late at night.

291
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,479
I asked the immortal attendants to prepare some tea.

292
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,400
Why don't you take a break inside?

293
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,559
I'm only doing my duty.

294
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,640
It's no trouble at all.

295
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,139
As per the rules,

296
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:51,200
I have to monitor the incineration in person.

297
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,039
It's to ensure a straightforward report to the curator.

298
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,440
Sure.

299
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,880
Fire up the incinerator.

300
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,620
Let me go! Let me go!

301
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,200
Get inside!

302
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,400
We caught her at the back door.

303
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,186
Are you all right?

304
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,339
What is going on?

305
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:47,319
You don’t need to show me your pathetic act.

306
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,919
You are Zhi Xi’s sister.

307
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,520
Yan Dan, from Yanxu Heavenly Palace!

308
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,300
You are not with Qianyun Palace.

309
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,920
Who are you?

310
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,560
Sister!

311
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,080
Watch out!

312
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,719
Run, Yan Dan!

313
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,660
You're no match for them!

314
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,820
Sister, you should leave!

315
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,940
Wow, I'm amazing.

316
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,720
Yan Dan.

317
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,399
Emperor Ying Yuan!

318
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,919
Help! Help beat them up!

319
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,579
- Hands off. 
- No, no, no!

320
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,199
- Let go of me.
 - I won't!

321
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,860
No! No!

322
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,979
They're defeated. How much longer are you going to embrace me?

323
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,300
Where did you get that strength from?

324
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,900
It's none of your business!

325
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Not my business?

326
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,519
You wish to become a martyr, right?

327
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,839
Better step up your game, then.

328
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,919
No way!

329
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,559
You didn't see how fierce they were.

330
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,100
If you had come any later, I would've been turned into ashes!

331
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,560
That would have been great. At least I'd have my quiet time back.

332
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,100
Greetings, Your Majesty.

333
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,800
Sister, are you okay? Let me see.

334
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,740
I'm okay.

335
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,859
Didn't you know? Burning the divine tools was the Devil spies' scheme.

336
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:23,499
They wanted to create poison using the Crape Myrtle Bottle and the sacred tree sap.

337
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:26,199
I was worried about you. That’s why I took your place.

338
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,320
Why did you show up anyway?

339
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,799
Thank you, Your Majesty, for personally guiding Yan Dan

340
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,660
and helping her develop her powers.

341
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,560
I'm truly grateful.

342
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,260
"Personally guiding"?

343
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,260
Well, she's naturally gifted.

344
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,480
I take no credit.

345
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,159
Thank you for the compliment, Your Majesty.

346
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
I will work much harder.

347
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,739
Oh, right. That sleazy Divine Official Yan Chi

348
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,439
put the Crape Myrtle Bottle in his sleeve.

349
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,240
Remember to check it.

350
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,619
All right. We will not get involved with your investigation.

351
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,299
I'm going to escort my sister back to the pavilion.

352
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:06,960
We will leave now, Your Majesty.

353
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,380
Let's go, Sister.

354
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,820
Let’s go.

355
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,880
We grew up together.

356
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,479
Zhi Xi was the best student.

357
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,240
She had the strongest cultivation skill.

358
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,119
Now Yan Dan has Emperor Ying Yuan’s guidance.

359
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,719
Her powers have improved so fast.

360
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,500
I think she’ll upstage Zhi Xi.

361
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,319
A pair of twins, one strong and one weak.

362
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,359
I'm afraid we mistook a chicken for a phoenix...

363
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,959
Who did you call a chicken?

364
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,579
Who has average talent?

365
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:41,119
If you're so gifted, why aren't you a Divine Official?

366
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,759
Why aren't you a Deputy Curator?

367
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,919
If she has average talent, you were both born dumb!

368
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,359
Not only are you dumb, but you're also evil!

369
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,079
How could you be so evil?

370
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,119
Are you trying to run away?

371
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,020
I'm going to teach them a lesson.

372
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,980
Don't waste your time.

373
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,700
Besides, they're not wrong.

374
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,140
His Majesty also said so.

375
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,599
I am indeed the weak one.

376
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,279
Ignore what that vile emperor said!

377
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,919
You are the most talented one, among the fairies.

378
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,999
You've attained divinity and you're a Divine Official.

379
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,200
Who could be better than you?

380
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,920
But today, I couldn't beat Divine Official Yan Chi...

381
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,879
while you defeated him easily.

382
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,799
I just got lucky.

383
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,279
I just happened to read a few books.

384
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,719
If you were also taught at Yanxu Heavenly Palace, you'd be stronger than me!

385
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,699
You'd take him down in one blow. I'm sure!

386
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,960
I'm not that lucky.

387
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,839
You should leave.

388
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,740
You don’t need to walk me home.

389
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,480
I don't want Ying Deng to see you and call you out again.

390
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,960
But...

391
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,040
It’s fine.

392
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,579
Remember, Zhi Xi.

393
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:59,920
No matter what others say, you're always the best in my heart.

394
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,720
You're my sister, who will always protect me.

395
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,620
Don't think too much.

396
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,460
I'm leaving.

397
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,039
Just ignore them!

398
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,500
Tell me if they bully you!

399
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,700
 Are you okay? 

400
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,239
  Am I teaching too fast? 

401
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,999
  There's no need to rush. Take it easy. 

402
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:04,479
 Master, don't you know who she is? 

403
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,160
 She's very famous. 

404
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,359
 She's the Lotus descendant who solved the Jade Pool crisis. 

405
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,919
 It's the talk of the town! 

406
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,279
 The whole Divine Realm knows. 

407
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,759
 A pair of twins, one strong and one weak. 

408
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,680
 She must be the weak one. 

409
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,759
 Any other person would get it after three tries. 

410
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,759
 But she's still struggling after a few days. 

411
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,239
  It's not that you're teaching fast. She's just stupid! 

412
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:23,439
 That's right. 

413
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,159
 Enough! Don't gossip about others. 

414
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,959
 It's okay not to be gifted. 

415
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,779
 You could focus on listening. Don't force yourself to learn. 

416
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,379
  If you don't fully understand, you might end up hurting yourself. 

417
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,519
 That would be worse. 

418
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,279
 I'm not the weak one! 

419
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,480
 I can do it! 

420
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,860
 Zhi Xi! Yesterday, I found many play scripts about fighting spirits and demons at the Pavilion of Books. 

421
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,500
 It was really fun. Do you want to go with me? 

422
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,239
 Yan Dan, you mustn't skip class all the time. 

423
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,579
  No master would be willing to teach you if you keep doing this. 

424
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:27,319
 Well, the masters are so boring. 

425
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,159
 The play scripts are more fun! 

426
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,180
 If you won't go, I'm going to go on my own! 

427
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,540
 Go on, then. 

428
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,979
 There you go. You're welcome! 

429
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,559
   

430
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,320
 All these years, 

431
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,020
 I trained day and night, enduring ridicule. 

432
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,760
 I gritted my teeth and struggled to climb higher. 

433
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,800
 Finally, I made it to the Magical Pavilion. 

434
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,440
 I became the Deputy Curator. 

435
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,020
 Divinity is right within arm's reach. 

436
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,100
 I thought hard work could change anything. 

437
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,440
 However, I still can't escape 

438
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,740
 from the destiny I was born with. 

439
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,940
 Yan Dan, you are naturally gifted. 

440
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,340
 Nothing is hard for you. 

441
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,540
 You'll never understand. 

442
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,120
Who's there?

443
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,719
Why are you sitting up there?

444
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,559
With your great power,

445
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,199
you won't die even if you jump down from there.

446
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,320
Not only will you not get hurt, but you will implicate

447
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,519
this adorable, innocent immortal attendant.

448
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
What is upsetting you?

449
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,000
One step.

450
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,980
What do you want?

451
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,620
What are you trying to do?

452
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,580
What can I do to you?

453
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,480
Do you know how to throw tiles?

454
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,120
How was that?

455
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,900
I won. Drink up!

456
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,600
More.

457
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,200
Drink. Drink.

458
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,500
Here, bottoms up!

459
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,799
I'm curious. Are high-ranking immortals all weird,

460
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,280
or is it only you?

461
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,319
Flipping tortoises. Throwing tiles.

462
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:44,700
Do other immortals do this too?

463
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,320
Don't you have any normal hobbies?

464
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,020
Oh, I remember.

465
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,760
You do.

466
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,319
Making me copy books, ordering me to patch your belt,

467
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,519
forcing me to play GO...

468
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,500
Those are the things you do well.

469
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,919
That's the way to go.

470
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,760
Don't care if it's weird, as long as you're happy.

471
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,460
Do I look like I'm unhappy?

472
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,079
I doubt there are any happy immortals

473
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,320
who would flip tortoises for no reason.

474
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,960
I don't get it.

475
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,359
You're already the Emperor.

476
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,079
Why are you still not happy?

477
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,639
You've found out who the spy is.

478
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,879
The matter has been resolved. You should be happy.

479
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:34,880
I'm afraid that... this problem has not been settled.

480
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,520
It's about to start again.

481
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,400
When you're insignificant,

482
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,760
you are able to change things as you like.

483
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,720
For example, you like staging plays, playing pranks, and making friends.

484
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:56,620
When you're in a position of power, many things are beyond your control.

485
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,200
So you want to jump off the building?

486
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,700
Look at the shooting stars.

487
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:14,520
Shooting stars? Isn't that what mortals like to call it?

488
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,629
They like to make wishes on shooting stars.

489
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:24,479
But they don't realize that it's the Star Deities swaying their dusters.

490
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:29,570
But they believe that their wishes will come true.

491
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,139
So what about you? What did you wish for?

492
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,700
Peace in the Six Realms.

493
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,709
What a pretentious answer!

494
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,000
Who makes a wish that's not for themselves?

495
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,650
Then you tell me. What did you wish for?

496
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,010
Was it only for yourself?

497
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,630
Of course!

498
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,449
And I'll make a wish for my sister and friends too.

499
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,319
As the Emperor, are the Six Realms all you care about?

500
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:06,059
Don't you have anything that you wish you could have? Or someone whom you care about?

501
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,560
To me...

502
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,780
Ensuring the well-being of the Six Realms is most important.

503
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,740
Apart from that...

504
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,280
there is no space for anything else.

505
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,120
The Six Realms ceased fire to have many years of peace.

506
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,500
Currently, the Devil clan are rebelling.

507
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,220
They're plotting in the secret.

508
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:43,260
The moment war breaks out, the hard-fought-for peace we've enjoyed for so long...

509
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,120
will be gone.

510
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,840
What if other people don't see your sacrifices?

511
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,320
What if you are forgotten, like the Nine Fins Clan?

512
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,180
Or cast aside?

513
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,020
Are you willing to endure that?

514
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,180
I'm not fighting for a reputation or to be remembered.

515
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,280
I'm fighting to stop war.

516
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,720
Since I've witnessed how lives can end... I do not wish to see...

517
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,080
past events repeat themselves.

518
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,279
Thankfully I was born in peaceful times. I don't have to think about those things.

519
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,120
Sometimes...

520
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,080
you only understand things after you've experienced it.

521
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,200
But it's not bad being you.

522
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,360
A little carefree immortal.

523
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,040
You didn't have to experience or think about it.

524
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,440
Let's just hope the wish I made wasn't done in vain.

525
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,959
All right. Enough of that.

526
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:56,280
You're putting so much effort into the play because you wish to get the first prize at the Jade Pool Feast.

527
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,240
- It's so that His Supreme Majesty would grant you a blessing, right? 
 - Yes.

528
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,920
Then tell me.

529
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,039
What is your non-pretentious wish?

530
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,020
To get a backer.

531
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,580
Am I not a good enough backer?

532
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,379
Your Majesty, you are in a league of your own. I don't deserve you!

533
00:37:16,379 --> 00:37:19,200
What I need is a backer like my sister, Zhi Xi.

534
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,959
Once she attains divinity, she will have to descend to earth and endure sufferings.

535
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:25,079
But my sister doesn't like the Mortal Realm.

536
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,459
So I wish to ask His Supreme Majesty to let me go down in place of my sister.

537
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:33,759
So when my sister becomes even more powerful, I'd be able to go to her palace and serve her.

538
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:36,080
I'll eat and drink for free!

539
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,320
You can eat and drink for free at Yanxu Heavenly Palace too. Why don't you want to stay?

540
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,200
To be honest, I'm used to freedom.

541
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,399
- I... 
 - An order from His Supreme Majesty.

542
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:54,439
Emperor Ying Yuan is needed at Yuqing Palace.

543
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,720
Please pass on the message.

544
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,820
Your Majesty, why are you here?

545
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,999
You smell of alcohol. I don't suppose you're drunk.

546
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:10,799
I'm afraid your current condition is far from His Supreme Majesty's impression of you being calm and self-constrained.

547
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,939
We caught the spy tonight, but the interrogation hasn't been going well.

548
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:18,180
I couldn't sleep, so I had few drinks.

549
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,140
I have restructured the Heavenly Court's defense plan.

550
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,919
It still isn't satisfactory.

551
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,440
I was planning to report to His Supreme Majesty tomorrow morning.

552
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,500
Your Majesty is very thoughtful.

553
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,839
Immortal Envoy Tao Ziqi sent word.

554
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,219
His Supreme Majesty has learned about Qianyun Palace's Curator's attempt at treason.

555
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:38,139
He is restless. That's why he summoned you.

556
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,560
A few immortal canaries have been visiting the palace.

557
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,820
They've made a nest on the roof.

558
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,980
Looks like being the emperor is not much fun.

559
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,240
It's better to be a little immortal.

560
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,360
Make sure to stay vigilant at all times.

561
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,839
The Devil Realm is in turmoil.

562
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,639
The Heavenly Court's defense was restructured to stay on alert.

563
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:40,800
We don't know what's going to happen.

564
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,039
We are brothers who went through the War of Genesis together.

565
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:46,260
What else are you worried about?

566
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,419
If you ask me, those officials and offenders locked up in the Heavenly Prison are unyielding.

567
00:39:51,419 --> 00:39:54,700
If they don't talk, just kill them.

568
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,760
I'll deliver their heads to the Devil Realm.

569
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,119
That's how we'll get to the bottom of this ploy of theirs.

570
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,819
If something does happen, the Heavenly Court will have a valid reason to act.

571
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,440
Do you think it's funny?

572
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,660
Huan Qin, you were hot-headed and reckless during the War of Genesis.

573
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,140
You kept offending His Supreme Majesty.

574
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,880
It's been so long. I thought you had changed.

575
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,300
But who could have thought? You're still as stubborn as ever.

576
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:29,279
If you're going to continue being reckless, how can I be at peace with your move to Mortal Realm?

577
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:31,799
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

578
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,920
If the other fairies and immortals of the Heavenly Court learn about this,

579
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,060
they will surely ostracize me.

580
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,199
Greetings, Your Majesty.

581
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,820
Greetings, Star Deity Ji Du.

582
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,260
Why are you here?

583
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,919
Your Majesty is always managing the operations of the Heavenly Court.

584
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:57,679
A leisurely palace like Pixiang Hall is honored to receive your attention and added security.

585
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:00,640
We are grateful for your thoughtfulness.

586
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,360
Pixiang Hall?

587
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,919
Since when were you interested in plays and the opera?

588
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,019
An immortal attendant said I'm too uptight and boring.

589
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,800
It's about time...

590
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,560
to find more common hobbies.

591
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,980
It's not a bad idea.

592
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,200
If you are more relaxed, your subordinates can breathe easier.

593
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,300
I need to pack my luggage for my trip to Mortal Realm.

594
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,060
Excuse me.

595
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,060
Huan Qin, always think before you act.

596
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,230
If anything goes wrong, send word back first.

597
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,120
Then plan countermeasures.

598
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,359
Got it. You're so long-winded.

599
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:45,860
I'm leaving.

600
