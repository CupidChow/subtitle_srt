1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:08,490

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,560
 Lee Joon Gi

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,720
 Lee Kyung Young

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,630
 Kim Ji Eun

5
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:35,150
 Again My Life

6
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,930
 Episode 11

7
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,940
- Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop came to see him?
 - Yes.

8
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,160
 Cheonha Hospital

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,050
 He needs to rest as much as possible.

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,650
 If anything were to cause a shock to his heart...

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,930
 Wishing you a speedy recovery

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,270
Vice-Chairman Kim Yong Jun came to see me.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,400
He grew up well. He has good reasoning skills.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,350
He asked me to help him become the chairman in exchange for handing me the outlet.

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,690
The ability to figure out who he's dealing with,

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,460
it's a virtue businessmen need.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,520
So I came to the conclusion

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,320
that I can leave Cheonha to Vice-Chairman Kim Yong Joon.

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,670
Assemblyman Jo, that's my decision.

20
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,430
In time, the successor issue will be—

21
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,250
As you get older, your judgment becomes blurred.

22
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,290
I guess that's why you don't realize

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,680
the time has come for you to step away.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,970
- Assemblyman Jo!
 - Chairman.

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,740
You should step down now.

26
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,230
Cheonha needs to start a new era now.

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,260
 Rehabilitation Center

28
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,650
Check and see if Oppa and Seung Jun made contact with Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

29
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,570
- Also, find out what the board members have been up to.
 - Yes.

30
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,030
Jo Tae Seop...

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,900
That's right.

32
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,770
Thanks to Cheonha, Korea has made great progress.

33
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,880
I acknowledge that.

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,020
But we can no longer keep up with the times with your vision.

35
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,830
I guess you don't know.

36
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,350
Cheonha will never operate on the opinions of a chairman alone.

37
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,880
But it is the sole chairman who makes the decisions.

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,940
The general election is around the corner,

39
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:23,330
so why don't you concentrate on that? I'll worry about my company.

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,170
I think you misunderstand me.

41
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,130
I, Jo Tae Seop, think only about this country's future.

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,680
You mean your own future.

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,400
Not at all. You're mistaken.

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,380
Then let me ask.

45
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,700
What do you think about Hui Ah as my successor?

46
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,020
You probably don't like that

47
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,200
since she would never follow your wishes.

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,790
What you want isn't Korea's future.

49
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,500
What you want is a dog that obeys.

50
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,670
I thought you wouldn't understand, so I prepared a gift.

51
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,510
 Let's move onto the next story.

52
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,000
 Kim Geon Yeong, chairman of Cheonha Group, who had been rumored to be ill,

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,710
  has been hospitalized for 15 days, it has been confirmed.

54
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,110
- I've laid the groundwork.
 -  According to an official from the Cheonha Group,

55
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,270
- Chairman.
 -  he's is critical condition.

56
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,090
Come down on your own.

57
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,580
There's nothing more miserable than being dragged down.

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,220
Is the gift you prepared... merely this?

59
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,270
I thought you were coming with a fruit basket,

60
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,440
but you came holding a knife.

61
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,790
But you should know, too. I also have a knife.

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,030
 - Move aside!
 - You can't go in!

63
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,100
- They're in the middle of a conversation.
 - Move aside.

64
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,590
I told you they're having a conversation.

65
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,460
Let her in.

66
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,320
It's nice to see you, Miss Hui Ah.

67
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,100
Let's go.

68
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,850
 Chairman Kim's critical condition...

69
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,020
Dad, are you okay?

70
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,240
Don't worry.

71
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,700
I'm sure he came to see you on purpose.

72
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,860
He must have been the one who leaked it to the media, too.

73
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,890
What did he want this time?

74
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,160
You don't need to know.

75
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,390
Everything is up to me to figure out before I go.

76
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,650
 Cheonha Hospital

77
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,950
- How was the visit?
 - How is he feeling?

78
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,160
What did you talk about?

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,680
Please answer a few questions!

80
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,500
Let's go.

81
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,670
Please give us a statement!

82
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,090
 We heard that you went to visit Chairman Kim Geon Yeong at the hospital.

83
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,280
- Hello.
 - Hi.
 -  What did you talk about?

84
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,140
 I'm sorry.

85
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,960
 I can't speak about it.

86
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,520
 How is Chairman Kim Geon Yeong feeling?

87
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,450
 As a citizen,

88
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,710
 Chairman Kim Geon Yeong is someone I respect, and I can only wish for his speedy recovery.

89
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,910
 Chairman Kim is critically ill...

90
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,450
 That's why Hui Ah...

91
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,810
 A monk cuts his hair when he leaves the world, right?

92
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,070
 I came to cut my hair, too.

93
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,270
 Hui Ah has jumped into management.

94
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,050
 It's a different development from my previous life.

95
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,610
Did you really meet with Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop?

96
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,080
Yes, I did. I gave him the outlet, too.

97
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,310
But Dad told you.

98
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,830
To develop the outlet on your own steam.

99
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,040
Never to have involvement with the political world.

100
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,320
- It's cooperation, not involvement.
 - Oppa!

101
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,890
Why? Should I shovel and lay the bricks myself, too?

102
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,700
You don't live alone in this world.

103
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,620
You know how Jo Tae Seop thinks.

104
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,240
He'll put you on a leash.

105
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,380
That's for me to worry about.

106
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,910
And he'll shake up Cheonha Group.

107
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,550
I'll worry about that.

108
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,700
Kim Hui Ah,

109
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,970
stay quietly if you don't want to get kicked out and lose everything you have.

110
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,400
I've contacted the board of Cheonha Group

111
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,180
that you'll support Vice-Chairman Kim Yong Jun.

112
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,330
Then we'll now begin working on his image.

113
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,050
 An Anonymous Donor Angel

114
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,610
Okay.

115
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,410
Sir.

116
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,010
What should we do about Jo Yun Ah?

117
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,900
Jo Yun Ah...

118
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,610
Yes, sir.

119
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,530
Who are you?

120
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,010
What are you?

121
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,990
 The actress Jo Yun Ah died in her home last night.

122
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,530
 The late Jo Yun Ah, who appeared like a comet in 2009 and swept the rookie awards at various film festivals,

123
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,480
 had recently signed with a major US agency

124
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,680
 and was about to enter Hollywood,

125
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,180
 adding to her fans' sadness.

126
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,520
"Everything has happened because of money.

127
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,130
"I didn't know things would get so big.

128
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,610
"There are no videos.

129
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,600
"I apologize to President Choi Su Hyeok and to Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun.

130
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,660
"I'm sorry.

131
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,720
"I take responsibility for everything as I leave."

132
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,030
This is too perfect a suicide note.

133
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,570
Not to mention the cause of death. Overdosing on methamphetamine while drinking!

134
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,350
Did she use methamphetamine, too? Wasn't it propofol that she was using?

135
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,510
I feel like I've seen this before.

136
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,700
 It's just the right mix of alcohol and methamphetamine.

137
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,330
Where?

138
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,590
Never mind.

139
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,790
What's with you?

140
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,790
Take a look.

141
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,480
 Actress Jo Yun Ah's "Suicide"
 Leaves a Suicide Note On the Recent Controversy

142
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,440
 Actress Jo Yoon Ah's "Suicide"
 Leaves a Suicide Note On the Recent Controversy

143
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,370
 ... drinking when it's not enough, will it fill that void?

144
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,460
Yes, I understand.

145
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,940
That was from Vice-Chairman Kim Yong Jun's office.

146
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,890
With regard to the instructions you gave on Cheonha Distribution,

147
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,230
he agreed that there will be no restructuring between labor and management

148
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,170
and that he will take the lead in hiring more young people.

149
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,390
He understands quickly.

150
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,630
And the site of the outlet was also confirmed and announced as the area you proposed

151
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,830
to Chairman Kim Geon Yeong in the past.

152
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,260
It's commendable. Good.

153
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,900
Then I'll have to reciprocate.

154
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,580
I can't let him remain in his father's shadow forever.

155
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,530
Put in a call to Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

156
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,410
I understand.

157
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,420
Why aren't you answering your calls?

158
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,280
Chief wants to see us.

159
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:14,270
Chairman Kim Geon Yeong of Cheonha Group is in critical condition, and the succession process is marred by expediency.

160
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,670
You will become righteous prosecutors from this moment on.

161
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,320
If there's any punk here who received an allowance from Cheonha Group,

162
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,720
remove all evidence of it, and if any of you have friends there, forget them.

163
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,720
You will only look at the crime.

164
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,550
Show the world that the law is fair!

165
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,420
- Got it?
 - Yes, sir!

166
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,920
That's all.

167
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,810
 Special Investigation Team Office

168
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:49,310
 Special independent Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin

169
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,950
Turn in your cellphones, and don't answer any calls!

170
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,670
Track down borrowed-name accounts of former and current employees

171
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,700
and shake down every Cheonha Group affiliate who has securities accounts and trades stock.

172
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,660
 Yes, sir!

173
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,650
- What? The prosecution?
 - Yes.

174
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,980
They're investigating the overall succession process and the three of us, too.

175
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,130
 Chairman Kim Geon Yeon will think

176
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,090
 that the prosecution is gunning for him.

177
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,930
 But...

178
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:38,300
if you scar a healthy body, it loses its overall value.

179
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,590
You just need to get rid of the one thing that's ruining the balance.

180
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,620
Like this.

181
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,420
How is it? Doesn't it look good?

182
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,560
Sir.

183
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,090
Mr. Kim Seong Jun?

184
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,250
What is it?

185
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,070
I'm Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin from the Central District Office.

186
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,880
I'd like to give you a choice. Would you cooperate and come with us quietly?

187
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,520
Or do you want your face all over the news?

188
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,320
- What?
 - Let's go.

189
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,420
- Seong Jun?
- Yes, sir.

190
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,040
It looks like he committed embezzlement.

191
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,330
 Kim Geon Yeong will know that Seong Jun's arrest is a warning.

192
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,080
Dad.

193
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,590
I'll bring Seong Jun back.

194
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,890
 And that the next target is Kim Hui Ah.

195
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,940
I'll take care of everything, so you stay out of this.

196
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,850
I told you that I must put an end to this with my own hands.

197
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,730
Dad.

198
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,610
No, don't cut it too close.

199
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,820
Yes, sir.

200
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,480
Good. That's it.

201
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,610
Great. Get ready to greet a guest.

202
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,680
Chairman Kim Geon Yeong won't surrender like this.

203
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,650
He'll visit me with a knife in his hand.

204
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,320
Okay.

205
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,940
Sir, Chairman Kim Geon Yeong is here.

206
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,320
 Again My Life

207
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,140
What brings you here?

208
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,440
What are you doing?

209
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,900
My son, Seong Jun. Please let him go.

210
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,430
Yong Jun, Seong Jun, and Hui Ah.

211
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,830
I do not want my children...

212
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,410
to be involved any further in political circles.

213
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,860
Chairman Kim.

214
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,970
Please, this is my last wish.

215
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,860
I want this relationship to end with me.

216
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't grant your wish.

217
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,720
 You'll just serve ten years in jail, no more.

218
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,190
Chairman Kim!

219
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,830
 1993
 Investigation on Corruption Within Chunha Group

220
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,890
 1993

221
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,970
 What? This is...

222
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,920
 You'll just serve ten years in jail, no more.

223
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,860
 The new administration has taken office.

224
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,840
 It's time to round up some chaebol ( conglomerate owner )  to show the public how "righteous" we are.

225
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,930
 So I'm your target? And you're here to arrest me?

226
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,410
 We'd be having this conversation in my office if that were the case.

227
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,140
 Why do you think I suggested this lunch meeting?

228
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,230
 I'd like to run for office during the upcoming general election.

229
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,230
 Join hands with me,

230
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,320
 and I'll bury this for you.

231
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,260
 I'm sure we can do a lot together.

232
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,460
 Thank you, sir.

233
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,150
I was wrong. It was nothing but an ill-fated decision.

234
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,910
You must know that I don't have many days left to live.

235
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,490
We could go to jail together, hand in hand.

236
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,600
You see, we've known each other for a long time.

237
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,390
It'd be nice to reminisce about the good old days together in jail.

238
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,920
This is my last request and threat.

239
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:56,390
Put Seong Jun back where he belongs.

240
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,560
And do not contact my children again.

241
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,960
I'm sure you get the message.

242
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,030
Let's take care of him. I'll get ready, sir.

243
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,440
- It's too risky.
 - When was it not?

244
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,210
We're dealing with Chairman Kim here.

245
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,560
Kim Geon Yeong.

246
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,060
 Help!

247
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,670
 Oppa. Oppa! Oppa!

248
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,490
 Help! Oppa. Oppa. Oppa.

249
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,290
Oppa.

250
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,860
Do you really think a mere prosecutor can take me down?

251
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:54,020
Unfortunately, this is my job. I'm just following orders. So no hard feelings, please.

252
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,300
Looks like this will take a while. Do you want some ox bone soup?

253
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,970
Oh, wait. Do rich heirs not eat stuff like that?

254
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,620
We're letting Mr. Kim Seong Jun go.

255
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,080
Mr. Kim Seong Jun has been released.

256
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:40,290
Transfer my shares to Hui Ah as quickly as possible so we won't have any problems.

257
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,450
Pardon?

258
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,430
I want Hui Ah to be my successor.

259
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,690
- Tell Yong Jun and Seong Jun to stop by the hospital tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,450
You can go.

261
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:08,220
Dad, just focus on your recovery now. I'll take care of everything else.

262
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,490
You don't need to worry about me.

263
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,520
I'll stay alive until you've fully transitioned into my position.

264
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,110
You'll have Cheonha on your shoulders.

265
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,870
I'm sorry, Hui Ah. You wanted to live an ordinary life,

266
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,000
but you can't do that because you're my daughter.

267
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,690
Expect to get busy. Go home and rest up.

268
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,260
Starting tomorrow, you'll come here and work with me.

269
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,860
Okay.

270
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,420
- Get some rest.
- All right.

271
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,700
- Mr. Park.
- Yes, sir.

272
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,290
- Spare me a moment.
- Yes, sir.

273
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,070
It's chrysanthemum tea.

274
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,830
You made it very cleanly.

275
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,000
Since I've drunk good tea, tonight

276
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:40,830
it seems I'll sleep soundly.

277
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,140
Yes.

278
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,950
Yes, I understand.

279
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,790
Excuse me, Assemblyman.

280
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,380
You've put in much effort, Chairman.

281
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,500
Now,

282
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,440
now, rest in peace.

283
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,770
 Kim Geon Yeong, chairman of Cheonha Group, Korea's number 1 business group,

284
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:47,200
 passed away at 73 years of age at Cheonha Hospital this dawn.

285
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,430
 Continuing the legacy of the late founder, Kim Seong Man...

286
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:54,780
 It's not yet time for Chairman Kim Geon Young to leave this world.

287
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,370
 Cheonha Electronics' Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun, Cheonha Group Strategic Management's General Manager Kim Hui Ah,

288
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:03,120
 Cheonha Products President Kim Seung Jun.

289
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,520
 It's because of me.

290
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,930
 As I intervened, the future deviated.

291
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,510
Look at this fancy place.

292
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,770
Where is this?

293
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,750
The home of Cheonha Group Chairman Kim Geon Yeong.

294
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,760
The home?

295
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,620
Wait here a moment.

296
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,760
Yes, go ahead.

297
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,170
 Our deepest condolences

298
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,170
 Republican Party Representative Jo Tae Seop

299
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,000
I will pray that his soul may rest in peace.

300
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,640
Thanks for coming.

301
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,270
It's really regrettable what happened with your father.

302
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,200
I'm sorry.

303
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,090
Why should you?

304
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,870
It's not something you should apologize for.

305
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,800
I'll help.

306
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,700
- With what?
 - Cheonha Group.

307
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,190
Won't it be difficult for you to handle alone?

308
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,840
What is that you are saying all of a sudden?

309
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,270
See you soon.

310
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,230
And take good care of your body.

311
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,640
Investigate Hui Wu a bit for me.

312
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,620
Who is the person driving, friend, what his parents do, everything, without leaving out anything.

313
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,980
Yes.

314
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:40,640
 Chairman Kim Geon Yeong is someone who should have lived several years more.

315
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,580
 If someone like that died suddenly...

316
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,510
 In this life, there is only one reason.

317
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,330
 Jo Tae Seop. Isn't it that he has

318
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,090
 moved up Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's death?

319
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:30,850
 Now, he will slowly reveal his greediness about swallowing up Cheonha Group.

320
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,620
Let's start.

321
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,810
Yes, sir. I'll buy more of Cheonha's shares.

322
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,210
 But I can't let things proceed as Jo Tae Seop intends.

323
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,090
Chairman Kim Geon Yeong passed away.

324
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,760
Right.

325
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,500
Although someone will be saddened,

326
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,490
someone will think of it as an opportunity.

327
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,370
I... think of it as an opportunity.

328
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,540
Let's catch him, Kim Seok Hun.

329
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,650
As Jang Il Hyeon was caught, Kim Seok Hun was shaken.

330
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,610
Also, the special team that set Cheonha Group as the target,

331
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,330
it's obvious that it will be disbanded with Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's death.

332
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,610
Right, since it'll become a burden for politicians also.

333
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:24,150
Prosecutors' complaints will pile up, and Kim Seok Hun's walls will become precarious.

334
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:29,660
Right now is the best opportunity for us to strike Kim Seok Hun.

335
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:34,960
But there still isn't anything revealed about Kim Seok Hun's personal corruption.

336
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,790
JQ Construction.

337
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:42,140
I think you will know it well since you have investigated it all that time.

338
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,730
The corruption that Kim Seok Hun's wife, who is the CEO,

339
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,570
and their son JQ Construction's Kim Yeong Seon committed.

340
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,910
However, we haven't found corruption that Kim Seok Hun has directly committed.

341
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,310
Yes, however, that much source is enough.

342
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,040
Since what holds back a powerful person is always

343
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,240
family.

344
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,580
And there's what I prepared too.

345
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,830
Fine.

346
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,650
Let's give it a go.

347
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,960
"Chairman Kim Geon Yeong deceased, curtain rises for Cheonha Group Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun's time"

348
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,790
It's wrong.

349
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,370
Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun's time won't come.

350
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,520
What are you saying?

351
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,900
Did you come from the future, Sir?

352
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,600
That's done, and

353
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,070
let me ask a favor.

354
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,900
Say it, since whatever favor you ask is okay.

355
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,970
Write an article for me.

356
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,010
Something like... "Cheonha Group General Manager Kim Hui Ah leads the way"

357
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,000
Hey.

358
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,350
Even I know that Kim Hui Ah is your friend.

359
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,250
How dare you try to use a reporter of the Republic of Korea for personal matters?

360
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,560
Do I look like a trash reporter to you?

361
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:22,580
The person the late Chairman Kim Geon Yeong marked out as his successor is Hui Ah.

362
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,890
She's the only one out of the three children who didn't bow to Jo Tae Seop,

363
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,510
and her management skills are excellent.

364
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:35,090
The media is only talking about Kim Yong Jun and Kim Seung Jun, right?

365
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,580
That's Jo Tae Seop's work.

366
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,110
Ah, wait a second. I'm very confused right now.

367
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,500
Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's death

368
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,610
could become the foundation for increasing Jo Tae Seop's power.

369
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,520
I'm going to prevent that by helping Hui Ah.

370
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,690
Hey, if I saw you as a trash reporter, I probably wouldn't have made a request like this.

371
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,690
I'm not asking this favor of my friend Kim Han Mi

372
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,040
but of Reporter Kim Han Mi.

373
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,020
I think I just heard some very shocking news.

374
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,630
So, you're going to help Kim Hui Ah to stop Jo Tae Seop?

375
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,070
Yeah.

376
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,220
Then, asking me to let you meet Representative Hwang was also...

377
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,200
Because he's the only politician who didn't bow to Jo Tae Seop.

378
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,130
Hey, do you not know Jo Tae Seop?

379
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,220
The most popular with the entire nation, an icon of trust and integrity!

380
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,160
It's a charade.

381
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,440
And I'm going to take off that mask.

382
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,970
If Jo Tae Sup is a dinosaur, then you're just an ant!

383
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,820
Isn't an ant a bit much?

384
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,040
Kim Hui Wu!

385
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,450
That's enough.

386
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,340
So! The answer to my request?

387
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,020
Do you not see me opening my laptop?

388
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,550
Good!

389
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,390
Do me this favor!

390
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,890
Did you eat well?

391
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:20,450
Are you spying on me? I just finished dinner and was on my way home.

392
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,110
I suddenly thought of you.

393
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,940
As if. What is it again, today?

394
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,430
As expected, our criminal investigator's good at getting right to the point.

395
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:33,050
I'm already thrilled.

396
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,340
Please investigate Bando Bank's corporate loan case.

397
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,560
And look into the transaction details of the related companies involved.

398
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,190
 Yes!

399
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,310
Yes, thank you!

400
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,870
I will use the money that you have given me.

401
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,670
I told you to do whatever you want. Why do you keep asking?

402
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,990
It's because we could lose everything.

403
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,370
But you could also make it bigger?

404
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,170
Yes!

405
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,810
 Making how much money is your goal?

406
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,750
 I...

407
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,450
 This. And...

408
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,040
 That!

409
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:24,270
 And... if I can buy that, over there, it'll be enough.

410
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:31,950
 So it's Cheonha Electronics, Cheonha Automobiles, Cheonha Construction.

411
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,810
 So you want Cheonha in the palm of your hands.

412
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,070
It's money I gave you to spend. Spend it the way you want.

413
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,570
Whether you buy a phone, buy a car, or buy an apartment!

414
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,740
Thank you, Elder!

415
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,720
- Hyeong, you're back?
 - Yeah.

416
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,130
How are you managing the elder's current assets?

417
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,150
I'm managing it by investing in stocks and real estate.

418
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,590
As for the investments, I'm in the process of increasing the earnings by focusing on the stocks that you picked, and

419
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,260
they are on fire.

420
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,910
As for real estate, I'm managing

421
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,570
auction items such as stores, villas, and apartments that Elder is advising me on.

422
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,310
Sell it all.

423
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,980
Sell? Everything?

424
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,200
Stocks, shops, villas, apartments, everything?

425
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,520
Mm-hm.

426
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,040
Turn everything into cash. As soon as possible.

427
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,880
Wow. Cut the belly of the goose that lays the golden eggs

428
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,640
and take out the golden egg?

429
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,280
Mm-hm.

430
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,630
Okay.

431
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:59,480
You've worked hard. You managed to accomplish something big.

432
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,490
Manager Kim,

433
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,070
I have set up a position as Minister of Health and Welfare.

434
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:10,160
Prepare for the hearing. I'll tell the leaders of the ruling and opposition parties in advance.

435
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,530
Thank you.

436
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,690
See him out.

437
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,020
Yes, shall we go?

438
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,500
- Manager Han.
 - Yes?

439
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,700
Call Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun. Tell him to stop the investigation of Cheonha Group.

440
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,910
Yes.

441
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,650
 Cheonha Group

442
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,220
 Kim Geon Yeong, Chairman of Cheonha Group passed away. Where's the rest of the police investigation?

443
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:46,000
As expected, the investigation into Cheonha Group has been suspended.

444
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,330
 Come to my office.

445
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,040
Hold off on the investigation that said "Become Just Prosecutors"?

446
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,110
That's what I'm saying. They said to look only at the guilt.

447
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,530
They said that they'd let the world know that the law was fair.

448
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,320
What is this, I say!

449
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,320
It's not as if we're training mutts!

450
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:21,440
Prosecutors are getting agitated. It's time to toss the bait to Kim Seok Hun.

451
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:26,290
 Prosecution Service

452
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:37,180
There are many complaints from prosecutors. We even set up a special investigation team to catch chaebols,

453
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:42,590
but we've all become dogs staring at the roof where the hen flew away because of the suspension of the investigation.

454
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:48,500
Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's death is unfortunate, but we should try to put the special investigation team back—

455
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,370
How about it if we turned people's attention away?

456
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,860
- Attention?
 - Yes.

457
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,280
Yes, they are prosecutors whose morale has increased a good bit due to the investigation of Chunha Group.

458
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,280
If you throw them a case equivalent to that, they'll be less dissatisfied.

459
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:15,140
Can you make a case similar to the Gimsan Case?

460
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,400
Yes.

461
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,080
What is it? Tell me at once.

462
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,480
It's a case involving embezzlement and illegal loans from insolvent banks.

463
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,620
Which bank?

464
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,570
It's Bando Bank.

465
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,330
It was merged during the 2008 financial crisis, and the major shareholder is DH Money—

466
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:34,170
No. We can't touch banks recklessly.

467
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,800
Don't bring up things that are closely related to national life.

468
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:43,120
However, due to excessive loans to insolvent companies and extended maturity, we have low liquidity.

469
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,420
- We have to at least protect people's property—
 - We still can't do that.

470
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,600
The work prosecutors must do is ensure the country's security, not create confusion.

471
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,960
Find another case.

472
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,160
Yes, I understand.

473
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:00,450
What? You talked about Bando Bank?

474
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:06,000
Hey! Look at his spirit! You knew it'd be disregarded, but you still suggested the case. The reason is?

475
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,780
I wanted to show it to the chief prosecutor.

476
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:11,200
That even prosecutors have a hidden card.

477
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:16,480
Political prosecutor Kim Seok Hun. But in essence, a prosecutor.

478
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,380
His pride and self-esteem as a prosecutor are greater than anyone else's.

479
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,770
That kind of person arrested and released Kim Seung Jun.

480
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,510
Following the order of the person in power.

481
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,500
His pride must have been hurt.

482
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,540
Would you like to do it together?

483
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,340
So that Chief Prosecutor Kim will have no choice but to use his hidden card?

484
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,230
Sorry.

485
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:45,380
Although I want to do whatever together if it's your work, Bro, but the trial for Mirae Electronics President Jeon Il Bo has been set, finally.

486
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,980
I'll be the one to go to trial.

487
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,420
Oh, really?

488
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,990
I guess there's nothing I can do.

489
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,580
- I'll cheer you on!
 - Me too!

490
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:03,560
 Kim Hui Wu Investigation Results

491
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,870
Is this all real?

492
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,330
Yes.

493
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,170
And what is this person named Park Sang Man?

494
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,560
How could there be such a large amount of money in Hui Wu's hands?

495
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,690
It seems that Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu has a definite talent for investing.

496
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,040
Since college, he's made huge profits in real estate and stocks.

497
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,690
There is definitely something...

498
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,490
Miss?

499
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,360
- I...
 - Huh?

500
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,690
It's nothing.

501
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,690
As I thought, I'll have to hear it from him directly. Manager Park!

502
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,110
Yes.

503
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,440
They say Degas was originally a young man who used to study law.

504
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,020
But he met Ingres and turned into a painter.

505
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,690
This painting... Doesn't it look like someone's stealing glances at something?

506
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:26,190
It's exactly like someone I know.

507
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:29,510
A person who graduated from law school and became a prosecutor.

508
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:36,450
That person is also snooping around the other world, peeping.

509
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,430
Even though you've been caught, you're not surprised.

510
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,510
I don't know. Is it something to be surprised about?

511
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,000
Then, would you be surprised if I said it like this?

512
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,010
Because I'm not the type to be surprised by most things.

513
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,260
Park Sang Man

514
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,020
After my father passed away,

515
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:06,860
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu, who turned the assets he managed incognito through Park Sang Man into cash

516
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:11,900
and approached me at an appropriate time.

517
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,690
What could the reason be?

518
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,160
Did you investigate me?

519
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,350
Yeah. You said you would help me.

520
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:23,390
I looked into you to determine whether you were trustworthy.

521
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,890
You know how good Cheonha Group is at getting information, right?

522
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:33,810
So? What do you think?

523
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:36,810
Do I seem trustworthy?

524
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,390
I don't know...

525
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,220
If you're friend or foe.

526
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,400
Let's go get a cup of tea.

527
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,220
Sure.

528
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,960
What? You saved up money to catch Jo Tae Seop?

529
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,740
Yeah. Little by little.

530
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,280
I also didn't want to see a friend suffer.

531
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,680
- It's dangerous.
 - I know.

532
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,810
To Jo Tae Seop, all you are is a prosecutor.

533
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:21,230
I know that too.

534
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:25,230
Hui Wu. The money you saved is impressive.

535
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:30,100
But, that amount is pocket change to Cheonha Group.

536
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,240
I know that too.

537
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,370
If you know that—

538
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,350
- I said I would help you, didn't I?
 - With what?

539
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:46,210
Will Jo Tae Seop just leave Cheonha group alone if the chairman is gone?

540
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:54,650
Jo Tae Seop will order another search and seizure of Cheonha group soon.

541
00:45:54,650 --> 00:46:00,400
He'll shake up your family while revealing all of the corruption that Cheonha group thought that they buried.

542
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,410
He'll never choose just one method.

543
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:10,110
Finances, prosecution, government, the money and power he needs to kill Cheonha.

544
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,630
He has everything he needs to take the group down.

545
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:18,200
Eventually, your family will lose the group.

546
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,890
Thank you for your concern, but

547
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,350
our group is stronger than you think.

548
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,010
We won't get dragged along by Jo Tae Seop.

549
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,120
You can't just rely on official numbers.

550
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:37,130
Your brothers, President Kim Yong Jun and President Kim Seong Jun,

551
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,820
do you believe in them?

552
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,020
The enemy is Jo Tae Seop. He can do anything.

553
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,830
Do you still not get it?

554
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,450
Do I need to give you examples of the groups he's destroyed using inheritance disputes?

555
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:55,420
You're doing a good job making up stories even though we're meeting up for the first time in a long time.

556
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,560
Stories are based on reality.

557
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:10,990
I'll help you. You protect Cheonha Group.

558
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,410
How?

559
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,400
Park Dae Ho.

560
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:23,140
He's the CEO of Bando Bank, the bank that manages Jo Tae Seop's money.

561
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,010
How do you...

562
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,030
I'm prosecutor, aren't I?

563
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,940
I'll catch Park Dae Ho and bring him to you.

564
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:38,520
I'll bring you the 15% of Cheonha group that he owns too.

565
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,800
Do you think that's even possible?

566
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,470
I'll take care of it.

567
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,780
In exchange, I have a condition.

568
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:48,590
Condition?

569
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:54,350
When you become the president, cut off all ties with the political world.

570
00:47:54,350 --> 00:48:00,250
If not, I'll have to catch you too.

571
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:15,740
Can I really do what Hui Wu said?

572
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,010
Are you talking about becoming the head of Cheonha group?

573
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,600
That, and cutting ties with politics.

574
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:27,590
It was something my father wasn't able to do either.

575
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:29,770
It will be difficult.

576
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,150
But you have to do it.

577
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:35,270
To protect the company and its employees.

578
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:37,180
That's true.

579
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:49,250
 The rapid rise of a next generation leader. Kim Hui Ah, Head of the Cheonha Group Management &amp; Strategy Division

580
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:55,620
Kim Hui Wu, you're really pushing me on.

581
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,270
Secretary Park, what's on the schedule today.

582
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,900
There is one meeting left with the Jinhyeok Group executives.

583
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,680
 I'll help you

584
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,150
 You protect Cheonha group

585
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:24,430
I improved on the marketing strategy based on your suggestions. It has been received well so far.

586
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:26,410
This is it, right?

587
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:39,900
 Foodology

588
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,070
It's particularly popular with young women.

589
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,900
That's good.

590
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,590
Moving forward, the number of people who pay special attention to their bodies will continue to increase.

591
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:56,310
Dominating the market is important.

592
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:59,240
- You're okay, rigtht?
 - Excuse me?

593
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:04,400
We've been worried about you since the chairman passed away.

594
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,890
I'm okay.

595
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:09,700
I'm keeping myself busy by focusing on work.

596
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,590
We're on your side.

597
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:15,230
Please overcome it even if it's difficult.

598
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,540
The person who stopped Vice Chairman Kim Jong Jun from selling Cheonha Healthcare,

599
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:24,590
I heard it was you.

600
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:28,890
It's a promising business. We can't let it be taken away.

601
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:32,570
- Of course, our chairman thought so too.
 - Excuse me?

602
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:38,290
While he was alive, he used to say something to us employees about our stake in Cheonha Group.

603
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:43,000
To throw it to the person protecting the company.

604
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,130
How much does it amount to?

605
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,530
0.5%.

606
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:53,130
It's not a lot, but don't fights even break out over 0.1% stake?

607
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:57,970
Thank you! I hadn't even thought about that.

608
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:01,310
Look closely,

609
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,930
subsidiaries like us that want to follow the chairman's will,

610
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:08,010
there will be quite a few.

611
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,760
Yes.

612
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,420
Thank you for becoming my strength.

613
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:23,590
Please give me permission to continue my investigation into Cheonha Group.

614
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:25,720
There is a lot of talk about who will take over.

615
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,880
There have been allegations of illegal inheritance and tax evasion in the media

616
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,400
If the Prosecutor's office stays quiet in this situation—

617
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,570
Chairman Kim Geon Yeong passed away.

618
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:37,760
You might have difficulty if you conduct an unreasonable investigation.

619
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,470
Assemblyman. You said it yourself.

620
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,430
That Cheonha needed to be sacrificed to rise to the president's position.

621
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:50,160
But, I didn't even put up a fight and gave up.

622
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,820
Seok Hun,

623
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,030
you're different.

624
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:01,490
I told you that I know what the size of your bowl is

625
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:04,400
and that I would be the one to fill that bowl for you.

626
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:10,230
It takes time for that bowl to be filled.

627
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,380
Come in.

628
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,420
Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi from the Eastern District Prosecutor's Office has arrived.

629
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,610
Send him in.

630
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,400
Assemblyman.

631
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,940
Come sit.

632
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,560
Okay.

633
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:41,470
It's been a long time.

634
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:43,200
Yes.

635
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:50,240
It's been a while since we saw each other too.

636
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,640
Yes.

637
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,060
Here, let's have a drink.

638
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,360
There's not much time left until the announcement about the prosecutor general, right?

639
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,330
I believe.

640
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:10,950
No matter who becomes Prosecutor General, I'll work with him for the sake of the country.

641
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,590
Come, let's have a drink.

642
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,850
 Prosecution Service

643
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,090
So you'll do it to the end.

644
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:44,550
How long do you think you'll be able to use me like a dog?

645
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:50,970
Come in.

646
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,370
Did you call for me?

647
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,110
Kim Hui Wu.

648
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:02,050
Yes?

649
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,250
We're prosecutors.

650
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:08,810
Don't think about anything else. Only pay attention to the crime.

651
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:14,430
Let's start an investigation of Bando Bank.

652
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,410
 He took the bait!

653
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:20,680
Do it in secret. And report all of the results of the investigation to me.

654
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,970
You understand, right?

655
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:24,260
Yes.

656
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,090
You can leave.

657
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:47,730
 The cracks in Jo Tae Seop and Kim Seok Hun's relationship have finally started to show.

658
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:02,180
Hey, it's me. Let's go to the gym after work.

659
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:11,420
Shouldn't prosecutors go to a nice room to talk?

660
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:14,040
Why do you insist on coming here?

661
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,640
There's no place as safe as this one.

662
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,810
And it's cozy. It suits us perfectly.

663
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,540
Thank you.

664
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:22,870
What do you mean, thank you?

665
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:26,290
I didn't say something to get a thank you.

666
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,790
Then, I'll leave you to have your conversation.

667
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,230
- Sung Ho
 - Yes.

668
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:39,990
Before we begin, I'll give you the opportunity to get out.

669
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,370
You have a wife and child and—

670
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,960
I don't know what it is, but you have them too, wife and children.

671
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,020
Whatever it is, I should do it since I've come following only you.

672
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:55,430
We're going to catch him. Kim Seok Hun.

673
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:58,080
Yes? Really?

674
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,890
Since you've heard this, you can't get out now.

675
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:07,770
I absolutely can't leave. No matter what, it's go!

676
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:12,260
Finally, what we've investigated all that time will finally see the light.

677
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,840
- Let's begin.
 - Yes.

678
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:21,910
If we're going to catch Kim Seok Hun, it's necessary first to cut off his backing.

679
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,200
What do you mean his backing?

680
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,120
Jo Tae Seop.

681
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,500
Jo Tae Seop?

682
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,470
Continue. How do you mean to cut it off?

683
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:35,180
I'm going to use the Bando Bank card that Kim Seok Hun holds.

684
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,130
Bando Bank?

685
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:41,180
- The one where Park Dae Ho, formerly of organized crime, is the CEO?
 - Yes.

686
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,230
We're talking Jo Tae Seop's slush fund too.

687
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:47,020
It's still only a rumor. We haven't confirmed it as fact.

688
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:50,040
So I want to try to fact check.

689
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,240
- By using Kim Seok Hun.
 - Yes.

690
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:59,230
If things just turn out properly, fact check is a matter of course and the relationship between the two also gets split.

691
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,620
The plan is good.

692
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:05,330
But will Kim Seok Hun indeed take out that card? It'll be hard.

693
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:09,350
No. He's already pulled it out.

694
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:15,250
Today, Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun permitted investigation into Bando Bank.

695
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:18,030
- Kim Seok Hun did?
 - Yes.

696
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:22,060
Of course, maintaining secrecy was a condition precedent.

697
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,310
It must not have been an easy decision, so why did he do that?

698
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,070
It was that he was dissatisfied

699
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:34,290
with Jo Tae Seop, who was weighing between him and Yun Jong Gi for the next prosecutor general.

700
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:39,130
Bando Bank will become a secret card for such a Kim Seok Hun.

701
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:43,690
So Bando Bank is the warning Kim Seok Hun sends Jo Tae Seop.

702
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:48,580
If he isn't elevated to the position of Prosecutor General, he will take this case to the end.

703
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,410
That's it.

704
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:54,460
But, if Jo Tae Seop holds up Kim Seok Hun's hand, it seems like the situation will end anything but seriously.

705
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,270
No.

706
00:57:56,270 --> 00:58:00,100
Jo Tae Seop won't hold up Kim Seok Hun's hand that easily.

707
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,150
Why not?

708
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:04,450
I will give Jo Tae Seop a card to hold too.

709
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,610
A card?

710
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:08,340
Yes.

711
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,200
Is the hidden card going well?

712
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,800
It's too bad. Since I should have been involved, it's really too bad.

713
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,370
You're coming to the Mirae Electronics President Jeon Il Bo's trial at 2 pm tomorrow, right?

714
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,950
Starting now, we will begin the trial of Case No. 2017- Gohap 1234,

715
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:34,670
concerning alleged violations

716
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:39,310
of the Law on Aggravated Punishment for Certain Economic Crimes, etc.

717
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:42,240
Isn't the evidence that's come out so far telling you?

718
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:47,070
This is the creation of an illegal slush fund and manipulation of stock prices.

719
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:48,250
I object.

720
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:51,980
The prosecution is accusing the defendant with unclear evidence.

721
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,530
The prosecutor's indictment is ambiguous.

722
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,330
The source of the slush fund is also certain.

723
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:59,440
Aren't they the unjust enrichment from manipulating stock prices?

724
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,610
It's merely coincidental that the price of the stock rose.

725
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:03,710
- He's making an absurd claim.
- Oh, please.

726
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:06,970
He used inside information to artificially manipulate the market price

727
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:11,340
so he could set up his secret funds.

728
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:15,650
Pursuing corruption while exercising the right of management and

729
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:20,580
having seriously twisted the business's rational decision-making and the business's transparency,

730
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,760
the defendant Jeon Il Bo has committed a serious crime.

731
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,860
In accordance with the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes,

732
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:30,390
for the violation on the charge of embezzlement, I request ten years

733
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:33,890
and a fine of 15 billion won (~$15M).

734
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:40,950
We won't refute anymore.

735
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:46,290
Only, we earnestly request a wise decision by the judges.

736
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:50,340
After a moment's recess, we will issue the sentence.

737
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,740
We are issuing the sentencing.

738
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:56,350
As the CEO of Mirae Electronics, the defendant Jeon Il Bo

739
00:59:56,350 --> 01:00:01,310
embezzled a huge sum of the company's money and caused damage to the company.

740
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,500
The amount embezzled is in excess of 30 billion won

741
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,350
for the company at which he involved the employees in the corruption.

742
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:13,880
Since the nature of that crime is depraved, it is appropriate that he bear serious punishment.

743
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:18,390
However, as the President of Mirae Electronics, the defendant Jeon Il Bo

744
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:22,610
has made an effort to repay the entirety of the amount of damage the company incurred, and

745
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:26,110
seeing that he has repaid all of the amount during the trial,

746
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:32,790
this court sentences the defendant Jeon Ilbo with 2 years and 6 months.

747
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,400
Only 2 years and 6 months!

748
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,990
However, for four years from the date of this ruling,

749
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:44,180
the enforcement of the sentence will be suspended.

750
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:51,340
What?

751
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:21,300
It was always that way.

752
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,760
The cases you thought you had in the bag got buried for people in power.

753
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,030
It was the might of the powerful.

754
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:31,700
The preparation is finished and the planning is perfect, but

755
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,840
for that reason, I feel anxious.

756
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:41,160
If the work this time gets buried for power, it'll be hard for everyone to be safe.

757
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,290
Me, you too,

758
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:45,280
Seong Ho too.

759
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,520
Don't worry, you kids!

760
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,110
If we fail, I'll go down for everything.

761
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,730
There won't be any such thing.

762
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:59,900
What do you mean? That's what Nongae would've said.

763
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,830
What's this about?

764
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:06,010
Right? We're in the same boat, so we'll share fate.

765
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:08,730
Is there some serious matter?

766
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:10,310
No, there isn't.

767
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:13,790
Our work is always serious, no? Don't pay any attention.

768
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,570
Hui Wu's mom has a lot of worries

769
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:19,300
that since all you guys meet are bad people, you may get harassed.

770
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,720
Father, please do not worry.

771
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,170
I will protect them well.

772
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:27,380
Just hearing you say so feels reassuring. Dear, do you not have something to say at this moment?

773
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,440
Director, do you have anything you'd like to eat?

774
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,220
Why wouldn't there be? Let's bring the kitchen in its entirety.

775
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,790
Let's braise everything and bring them to him.

776
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,940
Who will protect whom?

777
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:44,050
Have you not seen Hui Wu flying about? We'll be fortunate if we don't become a burden.

778
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:45,760
What do you mean a burden?

779
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,080
We each protect each other.

780
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,860
Here, let's have a drink.

781
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,400
What is the matter?

782
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,140
 I would like to see the Assemblyman.

783
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:21,200
The Assemblyman doesn't receive visits other than scheduled appointments.

784
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,950
Please convey that it's urgent business concerning Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

785
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:27,220
Then, after you've made an appointment, please return.

786
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,990
 Manager Ha, I'm not someone who comes on pointless matters.

787
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:34,560
That decision is, of course, the Assemblyman's part.

788
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:39,060
Then, I will ask him.

789
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,460
 Please come in.

790
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,900
Finally, I've arrived.

791
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:22,150
 The heart of power in Korea. And the gathering place of trash.

792
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,770
Assemblyman, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu has arrived.

793
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:54,790
Let him enter.

794
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:23,240
Have you been well?

795
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,930
So what is the matter?

796
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:32,580
I will catch the Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

797
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:40,990

798
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:46,510
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

799
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:49,740
♫  We are here to wreck it up  ♫

800
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:55,940
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

801
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:03,540
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

802
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:06,630
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

803
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,050
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

804
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:11,340
 Again My Life

805
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:15,550
 The trigger has already been pulled.

806
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:17,200
 Let's make a deal.

807
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,360
 It's time for those who were waiting in silence to shine.

808
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,850
 That bastard, Kim Hui Wu, doesn't he seem dangerous?

809
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,980
 Even if I can know the truth—

810
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,750
 You have no right to stop me.

811
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:34,750
 Should I go along with him, or if not...

812
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:38,660
 I will shut the mouth of the righteous lawyer.

813
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,530
♫  what they say  ♫

814
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:44,340
♫  At the end, They'll know  ♫

815
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,960
 Again My Life
