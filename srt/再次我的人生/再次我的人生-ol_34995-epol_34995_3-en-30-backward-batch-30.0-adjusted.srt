 Again My Life

6
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,990
 - How are you?
- Not very well.

7
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,300
 You are lousy, as usual.

8
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,120
 I'm  disappointed.

9
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,550
Damn! This is driving me crazy

10
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,330
 Again My Life

11
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,790
 Episode 3

12
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,610
 Raise your guard!

13
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,310
 Get up. How long are you going to live getting beaten up?

14
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,590
  Hyung Seong Jae ... We met sooner in this life!

15
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,140
- What would you like to practice?
- Can we have a sparring session?

16
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,130
- Sparring?
- Yeah!

17
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,720
♫  Hey, you're so cold.  That evil leer  ♫

♫  Oh, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on  ♫

35
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,630
How old are you?

36
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,830
I’m 30... 20 years old.

37
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,030
You can work out here. I won't charge you.

38
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,430
You're as fiery as I expected!

39
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,890
As expected? You know me?

40
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,180
Come on! We have exchanged blows, so we are acquaintances now.

41
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,520
But aren't you talking a bit chummy with me?

42
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,910
There is no superior or inferior inside this ring. Don't be tacky.

43
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,170
- Should we go down and fight once more?
 - No.

44
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,820
Anyway, I humbly request your guidance from now on.

45
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,820
 Be my oh~~ so best martial arts teacher in this life too.

46
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,170
It's a deal, for now.

47
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,970
Deal!

48
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,690
Hi!

49
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,630
Oh! Hello!

50
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,170
Here!

51
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,860
I was waiting for you.

52
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,080
- What is this?
-  I made it myself.

53
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,250
If one is indebted, they should surely pay it back. That's what I learned.

54
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,490
Aww. You didn't have to...

55
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:43,030
Ah! If you don't like the taste, that's on you, so don't be too surprised.

56
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,950
Wow, a special precaution too!!

57
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,490
Okay! Noted. Thanks for the food!

58
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,530
Yeah! See you later.

59
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,390
Sure.

60
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,250
Gosh, my popularity...

61
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,980
Looks delicious!

62
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,120
Umm.... No, no.

63
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,590
It must be me. Let's not get flustered.

64
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,650
Kim Gyu Ri!

65
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,850
What is this?

66
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,990
- But did Kim Gyu Ri come to college today?
 - No.

67
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,410
- Don't you guys attend the same academy?
 - That's right.

68
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,360
Then contact her. We have to distribute notices, but she doesn't accept my calls.

69
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,290
I don't think I can attend college.

70
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,650
What?! Why?

71
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,900
My dad’s business went bankrupt.

72
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,660
Our house is up for sale, and Dad even fainted.

73
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,610
My mother, who was a housewife her whole life, is still dazed.

74
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,520
I am sorry to hear that.

75
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,330
You know that you are a full scholarship student, right?

76
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,450
I can't pay my father's hospital bills with the scholarship, right.

77
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,290
Considering Dad's health care, it's not that surprising.

78
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,520
I am sure there's a way. You should attend college.

79
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,140
The situation is worse than I thought.

80
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,220
If the house also gets sold, then our family...

81
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,410
I need to gather money for a studio room deposit.

82
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,160
There's nothing I can do. I need to try something.

83
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,110
But, I am earning quite a bit these days.

84
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,050
Guess how much a private tutor with a perfect score on the college entrance exam gets paid?

85
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,650
Hello! What?

86
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,340
Yes, I understand. Yes!

87
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,450
I’ll be right there.

88
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,120
What? Something happened?

89
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,020
I think my dad just collapsed.  Thank you for your concern, Hui Wu. I'll see you next time.

90
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,970
 That's why the Gyu Ri of my past life wasn't there.

91
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,660
 Because she gave up on her studies.

92
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,560
 Then...

93
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,090
 Seoul Central District Court

94
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,520
Since it's my first time at an auction court, it's so unfamilar.

95
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,820
Ajumma, please give me an auction information booklet.

96
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,350
- Ah, here you go. There are a lot of good items.

97
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,050
- Excuse me. Give me one, please.
 - Here you go.

98
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,780
Let's see.

99
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,730
Gyu Ri's apartment information is here too.

100
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:32,760
Yeah, I'll be able to see firsthand the competition and the winning bid.

101
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,160
Case number 2008 Ta-Gyeong 7611

102
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,850
 Wu Yong Su, 354,999,000 Won - successful bid winner.

103
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,390
Again?

104
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,270
 TN: "Ta Gyeong" is a fictional case citation, usually denotes type of case, here, the "Gyeong" denotes Auction.)

105
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,660
 Wu Yong Su? Where have I heard it?

106
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,940
 That's already two apartments and three villas.

107
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,650
 They were all bought for half their market value.

108
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,070
Case Number 2008  Ta-Gyeong 7913

109
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,460
 If I can buy these places for a profit, not only can I cover Gyu Ri's apartment

110
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,380
 I can also raise funds to respond to Jo Tae Seop.

111
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,230
 But... I don't have enough yet.

112
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,040
Are there such things as hacks to auctions as well?

113
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,740
♫   Hold on to your mental state and   ♫

122
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:31,770
 Stamina. Studies. Money. I can't give up on any of them.

123
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,170
A is the owner of patent A.

124
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:41,490
But B produced and sold the product using A's technology without A's permission.

125
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,920
Tell me about the legal measures A can take at this time.

126
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,590
- Kim Hui Wu.
 - Yes!

127
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,600
First, under Article 750 of the Civil Act

128
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,980
and Article 128 of the Patent Act, the right to claim damages can be exercised.

129
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,360
Article 126 of the Patent Act grants the right to seek a preliminary injunction

130
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,720
and a permanent injunction against patent infringement.

131
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,370
Also, the right to claim reinstatement of the business reputation under Article 131 of the Patent Act

132
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:22,410
and Article 741 of the Civil Act provides the right to sue for the return of unjust enrichment.

133
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:28,340
Under the Criminal Code, a person who infringes on a patent or exclusive right can be reported or sued.

134
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,200
You're like a professional!

135
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,220
Now then, that is all for today!

136
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,110
Thank you, Professor!

137
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,350
Hey, Hui Wu, there's this octopus restaurant...

138
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,990
Hey, Hui Wu, Hui Wu—

139
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,010
Do you have to use the restroom?

140
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,500
He's fast.

141
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,700
 Seoul District Court Auction Court

142
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,290
Case Number 2008 TaGyeong 2534

143
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,900
  Wu Yong Su, 32,845,000 Won - successful bid winner.

144
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,020
 TaGyeong 2637

145
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,150
Wu Yong Su, 35,910,000 Won - successful bid winner.

146
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,610
 TaGyeong 2718. Wu Yong Su

147
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,280
 52,740,000 Won - successful bid winner.

148
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,800
 Three villas...

149
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,200
 It was like this last time.  But why now, when the market isn't even good.

150
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,240
If you don't know, then you have to go and see directly.

151
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,860
It's underground.... underground.

152
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,150
All of the villas that were auctioned off are on the basement floor...

153
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,620
Why?

154
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,080
There's nothing special about this area so why was it auctioned off?

155
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,590
What's so different about this place?

156
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,790
I have no idea.

157
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,120
Elder!

158
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,540
 Seoul District Court Auction Court

159
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,090
Hello!

160
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,780
I am Kim Hui Wu, a Hankuk  U. law student studying court law.

161
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,430
What business does a court law student have with me?

162
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,400
- I want to earn money.
 - And?

163
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,760
I was looking around about the property you won at the bidding last week.

164
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,420
Looking at potential profit from selling, the real estate market is not very active.

165
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:40,010
They wouldn't even be profitable if you rented them out because they are half-basement properties.

166
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:45,240
For the life of me, I couldn't understand why on earth you would try to buy such property on a bid.

167
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,650
If you don't know then you can't earn money.

168
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,760
And I am not obligated to explain it to you either.

169
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,270
Elder! Then, at least a hint.

170
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,750
Did I ask the question? What hint?

171
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,800
Look at the map.

172
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,170
Map?

173
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:23,490
Other than them being in Seoul, there is no other connection.

174
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,740
Ah, what is it?

175
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,820
Wait.

176
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,610
These locations...

177
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,050
Redevelopment!

178
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,330
It was redevelopment!

179
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,950
A place where redevelopment is expected in the future due to the rise in local values.

180
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,800
The last remaining  goldmine-like land in Seoul. And if you only count the stakes in the basement homes...

181
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,230
You can make a huge profit at a cheap cost!

182
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,370
Yeah, that was easy. You should have known that much already.

183
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,680
I need a teacher like you. Please teach me.

184
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,940
I have no interest in teaching someone.

185
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,960
Then, let me just watch you as you work.

186
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,890
Please, I beg you.

187
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,230
Do you know what real estate is?

188
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,520
Real estate starts with the ground, then the building and planting trees.

189
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,930
In order to raise its value. In other words, it's greed!

190
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,450
- Greed?
 - Do you know the price of greed?

191
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,050
Loss of character.

192
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,650
 Keep this in mind.

193
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:56,490
 You cannot catch the devil until you become a bigger monster.

194
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,130
How can you succeed without greed?

195
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,470
And how can you make contributions without success?

196
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,370
Couldn't you cultivate that greed and use it for good?

197
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,210
Fat chance of that.

198
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,550
Elder. Please look into my eyes.

199
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,840
I believe that it is important to know how to read people as much as the land.

200
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,750
What do you think? It looks nice, right? You felt that from the beginning, right?

201
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,740
I am a righteous man.

202
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,200
You must be crazy.

203
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,820
You keep calling me Elder, but you mock me. Fine.

204
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,150
Then, I'll give you a test.

205
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,530
 Eviction Notice

206
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,670
- That's for Basement Number 1. 30 minutes should be enough, right?
 - What?

207
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:50,520
Evict them within the allotted time.

208
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,750
So you mean, kick out the people that are living here?

209
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,650
Correct. Keep the moving costs at a minimum, and they are to move within a month.

210
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:05,650
If you can do it in 30 minutes, I'll take you in.

211
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:18,270
Umm... When can you move out?

212
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:26,420
Yes... I understand that this isn't an easy decision.

213
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,440
I don't know what to do.

214
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,720
What am I supposed to do with such short notice?

215
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,340
Yes, and it's still cold outside.

216
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,350
Elder!

217
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,360
Shall we go inside?

218
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,770
Here. Let me pour you a glass.

219
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,390
Okay.

220
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,750
Here.

221
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,350
Thank you.

222
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,550
Can I treat you as my teacher from now on?

223
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,460
If you like.

224
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,480
By the way, you did a good job earlier.

225
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,210
How did you do it?

226
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,470
I couldn't do it.

227
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,550
And I shouldn't.

228
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,660
 So, money is the reason you can't leave this house?

229
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,920
 Yes.

230
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,580
 I don't have money.

231
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,960
 I want to earn some money, but I'm not in any position to do that.

232
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,550
 What do you mean?

233
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,980
 That enemy I call a husband used my name to borrow money.

234
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,800
 And then, he went bankrupt.

235
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,720
 Fortunately, I was able to get by

236
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,970
 with what I was being paid at a neighborhood restaurant.

237
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,050
 But, a little while ago,

238
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,180
 while I was working in the kitchen,

239
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,480
 I got hurt.

240
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,820
 So, I can't even work anymore.

241
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,720
 The situation is pretty bad.

242
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,530
 Where else could I go?

243
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,930
 I even looked into declaring bankruptcy.

244
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,040
 But the lawyer asked for

245
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,560
 1.5 million won (1,500 USD) as the base fee.

246
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,230
 - Bankruptcy?
 - Yes, bankruptcy.

247
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,620
 Ajummeoni,

248
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,100
 I can move forward with the bankruptcy proceedings so that you can move on with your life.

249
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,480
 But you're just a student.

250
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,310
 I'm a law student at Hankuk University.

251
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:31,800
 I can do this much for free.

252
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,500
 - Really?
 - Yes.

253
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,830
 In exchange, can you move out within a month?

254
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,670
So, you didn't really do much?

255
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,180
Yes.

256
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,840
That's fine. The outcome matters most.

257
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,100
Why do you want to make money?

258
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,780
To prepare for what will happen in the future.

259
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,890
An investment in the future?

260
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:59,080
That's good. But there's something you need to know.

261
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,100
There aren't many days that go as well as it did today.

262
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,440
Some days happen to help you sharpen your knife.

263
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,440
That's the nature of the real estate business.

264
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,650
Of course, most people are going through a difficult time.

265
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,300
And of course, you have to heartlessly kick most of them out.

266
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,500
That's why real estate is known to be a business of greed and loss of character.

267
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,190
Like you said, it's something you can't do.

268
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,010
I'll turn that thing I shouldn't do, into something that's okay to do.

269
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,120
I think it'll be possible as long as I move faster and work harder.

270
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,320
While maintaining law and justice.

271
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,670
Your goals are big!

272
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,800
- Here.
 - Yes!

273
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,030
- Here.
 - Yes!

274
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,620
You said you'll catch the bus from here, right?

275
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,900
Yes.

276
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,170
You worked hard today.

277
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,440
- Excuse me, sir?
  - Yes?

278
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,520
Um...

279
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,480
There's a house I really want to win the bid for.

280
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,050
Is there some way to guarantee that I win the bid?

281
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:14,560
Is there a reason you have to be the one to win the bid?

282
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,750
Someone's life depends on it.

283
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,750
 The consolidation of domestic financial institutions is accelerating along with the global financial crisis.

284
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,340
 On the other hand, depending on where the Bando Bank goes for sale,

285
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,450
 it is expected that the structure of the domestic banking sector will undergo some changes.

286
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,030
 This is Kim Sae Hee is on the scene.

287
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,930
Are you okay, Dad?

288
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,980
I told you to not feel bad about asking for help.

289
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,250
I'll be your hands and feet until you get better.

290
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,310
You must be tired.

291
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,830
- Go home.
 - I'll go when Mom comes.

292
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,550
Don't worry. Should I massage your legs?

293
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,950
Are you okay?

294
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,050
Does it feel nice?

295
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,080
 KMS Law Firm

296
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,180
Okay. What is it?

297
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,710
I want to participate in an apartment auction, but I'm not in the position to do it myself.

298
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,240
Auction?

299
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,280
What kind of ambition is driving you to be so active?

300
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,480
There are still a lot of things I haven't been able to do.

301
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
There's someone I need to help.

302
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,450
Who?

303
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,210
My friend's apartment went up for auction.

304
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,560
You're going to spend that much money on a friend?

305
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,130
It's someone who helped me get into Hankuk University.

306
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,490
- Did your friend ask for help?
 - No,

307
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,380
they don't know. And they have to keep on not knowing.

308
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,660
Hmm...

309
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,360
And you've thought hard about this, right?

310
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,310
Yes.

311
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,000
Okay. I'll help you.

312
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,380
Why are there so many people here today?

313
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,220
 Bidding booth

314
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,910
 I feel like everyone is bidding for Gyu Ri's house.

315
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,720
  Should I bid more?

316
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:24,640
 Do you know what mistake most newcomers make at auctions?

317
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,650
 They're often taken in by the atmosphere

318
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,880
 They think that everyone there is going after what they want

319
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,350
 So, they get anxious.

320
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,150
 That's right. Calm down Hui Wu!

321
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,780
 You've already confirmed everything.

322
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,790
 Bidding booth

323
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,370
Case number 2008

324
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:03,410
TaGyeong 9931, Lee Ok Seon,

325
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,650
has won with a bid of 240 million won (240,000 USD).

326
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:13,170
Case number 2008 TaGyeong 8092...

327
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,150
 I'm up. Please...

328
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,370
  - Please!
 - Kang Min Seok.

329
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,910
Has won with a bid of 2.35 million won (235,000 USD).

330
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,160
Sir!

331
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,300
Thank you, sir. Thanks to you, I was able to win the bid.

332
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,950
Why is that thanks to me?

333
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:45,440
From now on, everything that happens at the auction house is thanks to you.

334
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,480
- Then, is it still my fault if it doesn't go well?
 - Yes.

335
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,360
It'll make me feel better that way.

336
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,210
You're a funny one.

337
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,440
Anyway, that friend is the best in the country.

338
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,060
She's a good person. And above that, she was able to protect that talent.

339
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,440
- Isn't that called patriotism to the nation?
 - I don't care about all of that.

340
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,700
Today, you must evict a tenant who won't get any money for moving

341
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,710
because she did not submit a report of her moving.

342
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,630
Okay.

343
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:16,500
When can you move out?

344
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,530
Can't you wait a little bit longer?

345
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,790
We couldn't get the moving compensation so we have no money.

346
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:29,560
Your situation is a shame, but I also can't afford to wait indefinitely.

347
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,450
If you move within the month, I'll cover the moving costs.

348
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:39,340
But any longer than that, and it won't be easy for me to help you

349
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,330
since I also have to pay interest to the bank.

350
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:45,860
Please just wait until I find a new place to live.

351
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,760
If not, we'll have to sleep on the street.

352
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,010
I've filed for a compulsory eviction with the court.

353
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:58,000
- Compulsory eviction?
 - I'm not in a position to drag this out.

354
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,420
So I'll at least pay for the electricity and water bills

355
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,810
during that time.

356
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,230
Okay.

357
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,530
I understand.

358
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,430
- What do you think?
 - Excuse me?

359
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,680
About that mother and daughter.

360
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,940
Her husband is in prison and she doesn't have any family to help her.

361
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,240
She's barely making a living by doing some chores in a neighborhood market.

362
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,660
Honestly,

363
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,590
- it was a shame.
 - What was a shame?

364
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,280
If not me, was it that woman?

365
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,110
- Of course...
 - Is this something to have to think about?

366
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,850
- Of course, it's a shame for me.
 - What?

367
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,540
I won the bid and have rights to that property.

368
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,650
But that woman infringed on my rights using her circumstances as a justification.

369
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,620
I've never received any money for a deposit or rent.

370
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,180
But I said I would pay for utilities and moving expenses,

371
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,720
even though she's not even a tenant I signed a contract with.

372
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,550
But, who is it a shame for?

373
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:09,230
Do you remember what I said about real estate?

374
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,590
 Real estate starts with the ground, then the building and planting trees.

375
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,930
 In order to raise its value. In other words, it's greed!

376
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:21,080
  - Greed?
  - Do you know what the price of greed is?

377
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,380
Yes. You said it's a business that robs you of your character.

378
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,020
That's right. If you start something to make money, you only pay attention to money.

379
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,390
Real estate is not something you can do if you pay attention to anything else.

380
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,480
Throw away useless emotions and only pursue profit.

381
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,560
That's how you can make real money.

382
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,700
Sympathy is forbidden when delivering evictions.

383
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,340
There are many times when kindness is repaid with poison.

384
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,620
It's nice to help others, but if that fails,

385
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,190
the other person will pull your hair to save themselves.

386
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:57,360
When that becomes a wound, and it feels like a nail is being hammered into your heart,

387
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,850
you stop being a person.

388
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,580
You become numb to sorrow. And seeing other people's tears becomes a nuisance,

389
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,460
and it only annoys you.

390
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,640
At that point, you're already a demon and a beast.

391
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,610
 I knew, but the reality is much harsher and more merciless.

392
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:35,580
 If I move a little bit faster, would I be able to make up for the rest?

393
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,250
 Key Money Deposit
  Monthly Rent

394
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,280
Are you there?

395
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,020
What brings you here now?

396
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,950
I have something to tell you.

397
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,420
You didn't seem to have a lot of stuff, so I suggest that we call a moving service.

398
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,120
- I'll help you.
 - Excuse me?

399
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:14,860
Call the elder tomorrow and say that you'll move out in two days and need to borrow 500 thousand won.

400
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,340
He'll probably agree to that amount.

401
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,960
What are you saying?

402
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,150
Here.

403
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,450
This is a property on the way to the subway.

404
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,760
There are places that just need 500 thousand won more than the cost of moving to rent.

405
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,200
It was just sold, so it's still vacant. You can move in immediately.

406
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,750
Oh... This is...

407
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,830
Honestly, there are some problems with the apartment.

408
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:42,520
But I'll take care of them before you move in, so you won't feel uncomfortable.

409
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,770
You shouldn't have...

410
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,490
- Thank you.
 - It's nothing.

411
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,060
Sir!

412
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,100
How much more did you tell her to rip me off?

413
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:09,050
Five hundred thousand won! I told her that the real estate office down there had a cheap place!

414
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,700
They said they're moving soon.

415
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,800
That's a relief. Be careful.

416
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,880
If you are always the one to concede, you can end up being the one who falls to ruin.

417
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,850
Yes, sir. I’ll keep it in mind.

418
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,890
It wasn't a bad idea to find a house for them like you did today.

419
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:32,570
There won't be a reason to fight them tooth and nail.

420
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,350
You have a good head on your shoulders.

421
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,880
Keep doing that in the future.

422
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,590
Hey.

423
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,980
- Hui Wu.
- Yes?

424
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,300
How much do you want to earn?

425
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,240
I...

426
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,740
This,

427
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,310
and... that.

428
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,330
 Chunha

429
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:07,660
And, that over there, enough to buy an apartment.

430
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,290
Chunha Electronics, Chunha Cars.

431
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,580
Chunha Construction.

432
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,110
You want Chunha in the palm of your hands?

433
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:28,080
 Yes. I need Chunha so I can stop Jo Tae Seop.

434
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,510
There will be a redevelopment boom in Seoul.

435
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,090
If you leave it there for a few years, it will be a lot of money, so keep it in your pocket.

436
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,060
Understood.

437
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:44,440
You'll know when you see it, but the man owns a few small pieces of land and some houses.

438
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,190
Heaven must be on your side. To your benefit, everything you needed was in the hands of one man.

439
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,570
It should be easy then.

440
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:56,190
According to Department Head Han's investigations, there were many shops and villas in the area.

441
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:01,130
The total assets are worth about 200 billion won, and after deduction of debt, the net worth is about 100 billion won.

442
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:06,440
Since you work in finance, you know how to set it up, don't you?

443
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,860
Shall I bring all of it?

444
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,010
He's quite old.

445
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:17,740
Help him use his assets well as his final service to his country.

446
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,430
Leave him a home to live in.

447
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,750
I'll take care of it right away.

448
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,430
 Personal Details Statement
 Wu Yong Su

449
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,060
Oh, Kim Gyu Ri!

450
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,060
Thanks!

451
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,320
 She's really smart.

452
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,610
 She asked a lot of questions in place of her mother, so she had me sweating answering her.

453
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:59,340
 Anyway, I took care of the auction and Gyu Ri's father's hospital bill.

454
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,260
What should I do?

455
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,000
I'll pay you back later. Many times over.

456
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,010
Enough of that. Aren't you paying attention to class?

457
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,530
It's almost midterms.

458
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,550
Oh, that's right!

459
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,680
I'll have to start living at the library starting today.

460
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,480
- You'll help, right?
 - Of course.

461
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,020
I will help you.

462
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,740
You are Kim Gyu Ri, right?

463
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,600
Who are...?

464
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,920
Me? I'm the student rep, Park Seung Won.

465
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,950
- I've been dying to meet you. Miss Perfect Score and first place on the college entrance exams.
 - Oh...

466
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,730
Really?

467
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:32,800
Oh right. When it comes to school news and miscellaneous announcements, you'll want to hear them from Seung Won.

468
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,370
He's the most hard-working student rep in our major.

469
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,610
It's all true.

470
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,570
Although his introduction was very modest,

471
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,920
the more you get to know me, the more you'll realize how meaningful my work is.

472
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,810
Oh, I see.

473
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,820
I'll look forward to working with you.

474
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,160
Sure. Nice to meet you.

475
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,380
Seung Won!

476
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,520
Really?!

477
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,020
Do you spend all day waiting for the perfect moment to jump in?

478
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,550
You have to put in the effort, you bastard.

479
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,010
Ah, seriously!

480
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,410
Who's this? I only had a nap, and suddenly there's a new face?

481
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,330
I'm a freshman but today is the first day I've come to school.

482
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:23,330
Why are you so polite? We are the same, freshmen.

483
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:26,490
Oh, I have a quiet personality.

484
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,890
Don't be polite, and don't be modest.

485
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,840
We're all friends with Hui Wu.

486
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,760
I'm Lee Min Su. You can speak informally, friend.

487
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,170
No,  thanks.  I'll speak formally.

488
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,070
W-Why?

489
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,170
I’ll feel comfortable that way, sir.

490
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,020
She's even speaking with honorifics. That's going too far.

491
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,410
Why are you playing around?

492
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:49,760
I'm Kim Gyu Ri. Accept my bow.

493
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,560
Stop! Stop! I can't accept that.

494
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,440
Why aren't there any laid-back people here? Seriously.

495
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,930
So you do know how to joke around!

496
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,960
It's not a joke!

497
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,040
Please accept my bow!

498
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,050
Wh-What? What's the matter with you? Don't bow to me.

499
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:08,130
You're making me bow too. Damn it.

500
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,500
You know mutual bows are only done by couples marrying each other.

501
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,970
How long has it been since I've been tutoring you?

502
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,390
What? Why? What is it? Is there a problem?  I tried really hard!

503
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,220
No, your head...

504
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,510
wasn't totally made of rocks after all!

505
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,590
Watch your tongue. You're dead meat.

506
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,000
Amazing! Good job!

507
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,260
- Really?
 - Yes!

508
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,040
At this level, you can aim for universities in the Seoul metropolitan area.

509
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,570
That's a given.

510
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,100
I'm going to go to Hankuk University.

511
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,730
What? Really?

512
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,600
Well... I know it's a long shot.

513
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,370
No. You have the basics down, so you catch on really fast.

514
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:52,100
If you just nail the concepts, you can even get into Hankuk University

515
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,390
I'm your proof here.

516
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,920
- Really?
 - Yes.

517
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,830
I did it, so you can do it too.

518
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,800
Yes, teacher.

519
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,340
 Dad:  Critical announcement: Dinner time tonight.

520
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,360
What's the critical announcement?

521
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,240
- First, pour me a drink.
 - Yes.

522
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,580
You must have something to celebrate.

523
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,560
More, more, more, more!

524
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,690
Your mom and I have decided to open a steamed chicken restaurant!

525
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,720
What? So suddenly.

526
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,080
We signed a contract for the store today!

527
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,430
When everyone else is going for fried chicken, your old man will open Red Ocean which will only sell steamed chicken.

528
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:52,740
I want to let people know that fried chicken isn't the only way to enjoy it.

529
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,300
When we open, bring all your friends! I'll give them an 80% discount!

530
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,860
- What?
 - Fifty percent discount!

531
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,620
- You're crazy!
- Four percent discount!

532
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,580
- There isn't a discount. I'll just give you something complimentary.
 - Okay.

533
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,480
We are the only house that had delicious steamed chicken!

534
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,550
I support your decision.

535
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,420
- Here! Take this.
 - Yes!

536
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,880
Steamed chicken!

537
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,560
What? Give me one.

538
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,610
Sorry!

539
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,650
There. Steamed chicken!

540
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,370
I'm going to brag to my mom about my grades.

541
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,420
I was told to escort you.

542
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,980
- Take it.
 - What is it?

543
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,720
Your tuition. Your mom asked me a favor.

544
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,580
Take it.

545
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:54,720
I heard you're studying hard. Since you're smart like me, you'll get accepted somewhere.

546
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,710
Use the remaining money to buy clothes when you get accepted.

547
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,940
What are you gawking at? Say yes and take the money.

548
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,590
Yes.

549
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,620
You aren't hanging around with gangsters anymore, right?

550
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,000
Make sure I never have to interfere like that again.

551
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,350
Don't be an insolent child that blocks her parent's way.

552
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,280
Are you here to beg my father again?

553
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,990
- What?
 - Why are you being so pathetic?

554
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,110
Do you want to know how to make easy money?

555
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:51,340
Like your mom?

556
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,520
Stay out of my sight.

557
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,420
It's disgusting to see you come to my house to beg.

558
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,240
You guys are like parasites.

559
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,000
Then you should have given me more pills to keep the parasites out.

560
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,790
What?!

561
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:13,100
Because I am low born, it's my job to skin animals like you.

562
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,020
How about it?  Should I skin you too?

563
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,950
Kim Han Mi.

564
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,900
Born how?

565
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,750
Don't go around saying things like that.

566
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:31,390
Apologize. Apologize right now.

567
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,940
I'm sorry.

568
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,930
 Kim Hui Wu.

569
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,430
 Come quickly.

570
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,290
Hey, Kim Han Mi.

571
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,510
My teacher is here.

572
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:31,980
Why are you drinking all by yourself?

573
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,660
Ajumma, another glass, please.

574
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,130
Chicken feet too!

575
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,980
I'm paying today, so eat as much as you want!

576
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,890
Today I...

577
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,320
have a crap-ton of money.

578
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,320
What's with that money?  Don't tell me you're...!

579
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,280
I didn't steal it!

580
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,590
Or did I?

581
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:18,310
From that bastard's perspective, I guess I did steal it.

582
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:24,020
Or... did I beg for it?

583
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,400
What do you mean that bastard?

584
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:31,770
You saw him at the police station.

585
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,420
Our Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

586
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,090
I'm that person's bastard child.

587
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:45,450
 I was anticipating this,  but I was right.

588
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,010
I... didn't want to accept that money.

589
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,640
I really didn't want to.

590
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,710
I don't understand this.

591
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,100
Which one?

592
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:24,050
This one. The criminal code on rape. This part.

593
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,970
Oh, special rape?

594
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,260
Okay, so, special rape.

595
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:34,070
In special rape, it doesn't matter whether the perpetrator can kill or not.

596
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:37,570
As long as there's a threat to the victim, it counts as special rape.

597
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,960
That's difficult.

598
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,810
Stay calm.  I won't kill you. Follow me quietly.

599
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,130
You surprised me.

600
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,340
I told you to follow me.

601
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,720
Ok, cut! That's enough!

602
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,030
Was that okay, director?

603
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,920
That was very good Sunbaenim!

604
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,120
So, how did you feel just now? Scared?

605
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,550
A little at first.

606
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:03,450
So, even something like a pen which usually isn't considered a weapon

607
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:07,550
If the threatened person feels like they will die or be hurt, it is special rape—

608
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:09,610
Then it's special rape.

609
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:13,830
Additionally, when it comes to special rape, the evidence is particularly important.

610
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,150
Thank you.

611
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,810
Don't hesitate to ask for more!

612
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,140
But, wasn't my acting really good?

613
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,840
What do you think Hui Wu? I'm thinking about trying out for a theater major this time!

614
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,600
Let me try again with my theater voice.

615
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,120
- Wasn't it funny?
 - Nope.

616
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,860
It's rare in Korea to have such a unique mask as I have.

617
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,990
Yes, Seonbaenim. Why don't you take that unique rare mask and quietly disappear?

618
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,290
You're so mean, friend.

619
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,560
You're that friend.

620
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,530
Gyu Ri, shall I explain armed robbery to you this time?

621
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,810
No thank you.

622
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,730
Why are you so serious?

623
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,930
Because it's the truth.

624
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,170
- I see!
 - Hui Wu!

625
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,700
Ah, you scared me!

626
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,370
- One moment.
 - Why?

627
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,990
Did you do anything to upset Sunbae Kang Jin?

628
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:11,690
He's not the kind of sunbae to call people in individually.

629
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,110
Just apologize for everything.

630
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:17,200
If possible, I'll stand by your side.

631
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,950
I'm the student representative of our department.

632
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:23,640
  Law School Student Council Room

633
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,550
Come on in.

634
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,630
Oh!

635
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,000
RIght. You're here.

636
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,920
Welcome, Kim Hui Wu!

637
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,530
You can leave now.

638
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:39,390
- Sorry?
- You did your job so you can leave now.

639
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,670
Okay.

640
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,690
Sit! Sit comfortably!

641
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,630
Yes, thank you.

642
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:04,730
The professors praise you a lot.

643
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:05,670
Ah, no.

644
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,210
There's no need to be humble.

645
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:11,130
Everybody here is smart.

646
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:14,210
But everyone says that you're special.

647
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:18,390
- So I want you to join the student council.
 - Pardon?

648
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,090
You know our alumni paved the way for the entire legal profession.

649
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:26,180
And among those, those from the student council have the fastest way up.

650
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,550
Yes.

651
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:30,440
But, I don't know if I'll be able to do well.

652
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,390
This smart boy is also cautious.

653
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,800
I really like you.

654
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:41,010
Let's go outside. We can't make our Sunbaenim wait for us.

655
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,980
The guest is coming in!

656
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,880
- Thank you for coming, Sunbaenim.
 - Yeah.

657
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,430
Hello, Sunbaenim. I'm Kim Hui Wu, a freshman.

658
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,890
Is that so? Have a seat.

659
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,760
- Your first impression isn't bad.
 -Thank you, sir.

660
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,570
You heard about our club from Kang Gin?

661
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,370
Sorry? Club?

662
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:18,600
Ah, I haven't told him yet.

663
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,930
I thought that it would be good if you told him directly.

664
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,050
Really?

665
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,860
- Kim Hui Wu.
 - Yes!

666
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:29,250
We have decided to accept you as a member of our secret law club.

667
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,950
Secret club?

668
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:35,760
Yes. Our secret club isn't even known inside our law department at Hanguk University.

669
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,410
But it's a private organization that has existed for a long time.

670
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:42,630
You know that our major's alumni have a strong bond, right?

671
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:44,130
Oh yes. Of course.

672
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:48,970
People say it favors school connections, but our secret club is beyond that.

673
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:51,980
Why would we look for bright juniors from school?

674
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:57,920
A talented person who shoots up from the bottom is always a threat to the person above.

675
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,350
But what if we find talented people first

676
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:03,270
and let them walk on the solid path that we've built?

677
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:08,390
Brilliant seniors sit in key positions, help juniors build good careers,

678
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:13,170
and keep those positions until the juniors come up, then hand them down to them.

679
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:19,540
Also, juniors follow behind their seniors and keep watch to make sure other people don't move up.

680
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,830
What do you think?

681
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,360
Ah, yes!

682
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,970
There isn't a reason not to accept, am I right?

683
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:31,050
This is how we all can benefit together.

684
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,830
Here.

685
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:42,770
Until now, the Minister of Justice, Public Prosecutor General, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and so on.

686
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:47,570
Everybody who went up to the very top is from our club.

687
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:51,130
That's all. I explained it very simply.

688
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,600
- I bet you understood.
 - Wow!

689
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,170
You explained it so it was very easy to understand. Thank you, sir.

690
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:01,000
- How is it? Doesn't it make your heart pound from excitement?
 - Yes.

691
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,280
This is like a national archery team.

692
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,080
It's harder to become a national team member than to get an Olympic medal.

693
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,150
That's a perfect way to put it.

694
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:13,960
Thank you.

695
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:19,460
Sunbaenim! Thank you so much for thinking of me in a good way.

696
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,830
I'll do my best so that I won't let your expectations down.

697
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:26,630
I'll work myself to the utmost!

698
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,390
Look at him!

699
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,230
- I like your personality.
 - Thank you so much.

700
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:35,100
Please allow me to pour you a glass on that note.

701
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,910
Yes.

702
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:38,130
Go for it.

703
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,510
Thank you for letting me into the club.

704
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,100
It's nice!

705
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,880
Okay! Today's a good day.

706
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,730
- Thank you, sir!
 - Yes.

707
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,420
- Let's work together well.
 - Yes, sir!

708
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,420
Cheers!

709
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:59,470
I'm so happy and honored to be with all of you, Sunbaenim.

710
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,420
This boy.

711
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:05,990
Choi Kang Jin, you found a real good one this time.

712
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:09,330
I have a good eye for people, Sunbaenim!

713
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,370
That's why you have me as your senior.

714
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:15,020
By the way, since I became a prosecutor,

715
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:19,520
so many people around have wanted to meet me. It's exhausting.

716
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,490
I have no doubt. You are working so hard.

717
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:27,810
Hey, this is a secret. But do you guys know what DH Money is?

718
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,650
DH Money?

719
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:33,410
  Park Dae Ho, the one who manages Jo Tae Seop's fund, is the CEO of that place.

720
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:34,830
As a new business from DH Money, where is that?

721
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:38,570
The end of Songpa-gu, where it's meeting Gyeonggi-do. They are redeveloping that area.

722
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:41,650
  That's where most of the elder's real estate is located.

723
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,510
  As I expected ...

724
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:46,150
They have already set the target.

725
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:50,140
There's someone who has the most houses and land in that area.

726
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:54,220
I heard that he's the God of auctions. His name is Wu Yong Su.

727
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,320
 And they are going to get rid of him first.

728
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,010
If you get rid of him and go into redevelopment,

729
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:04,540
in the blink of an eye, you'll have hundreds of billions of won in your hand.

730
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,420
  - I have to stop this.
 - Isn't this crazy?

731
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:28,110
I'm sorry, so sorry.

732
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:32,250
I don't have much time left until I'll be with you, my love.

733
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,460
I'll see you then.

734
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,150
Oh, it's you, boy. What are you doing calling me in the middle of the night?

735
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,720
What did you say?
  Coal BBQ

736
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,230
Sell all of my property?

737
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:59,550
Yes, and as soon as possible as well.

738
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:00,850
Why?

739
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:03,840
I heard from a school sunbae currently working as a prosecutor

740
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,050
that DH Money is eyeing your land and buildings.

741
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,790
Why my property?

742
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:13,450
Apparently, there's a redevelopment plan for that area as you expected.

743
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:18,150
That's true, I wasn't wrong much in the past.

744
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:24,250
I think there's a political force behind DH Money.

745
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:31,030
Those bastards. I see what they're doing,

746
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,050
but do you think it will be easy?

747
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:36,560
When you bought the realty, you sought a loan, yes?

748
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,720
Yes, I did.

749
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,160
What if the interest rate on your loan were to be raised to the max?

750
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,560
To a point where you couldn't even handle it.

751
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:48,100
And if you couldn't repay it, it would go to auction right away.

752
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,730
They would buy anything that fell into auction at a cheap price.

753
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:54,570
In the end, it would bankrupt you.

754
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,920
My bank is Bando bank.

755
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,190
It's not related to DH Money in any way.

756
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:02,580
You know that the banks are in the process of merging.

757
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:07,810
Taking over that single Bando bank would be a piece of cake for DH Money, which has Japanese funds.

758
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:11,510
Also, there's a political force watching their back.

759
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:14,010
All of it would be taken care of as if it were totally legal.

760
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:17,650
Just to get a few pieces of real estate that an old man has...

761
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:21,420
Because they know the value of that land.

762
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,190
Fine.

763
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:28,720
Okay. I can see it clearly.

764
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:37,700
You're saying I need to sell it all right away, right?

765
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,040
Yes.

766
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,680
And when you transfer your registrations, you have to sell all of them at the same time.

767
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,620
Why is that?

768
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:49,430
Now that they're targeting it, they will be watching the movement of your assets.

769
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:53,510
If they find out that you're in process of selling...

770
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,810
You're saying they won't just sit back?

771
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,620
Yes.

772
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:00,520
We don't know what they'd do.

773
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,550
Since DH Money is a company that grew by loan sharking.

774
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:06,790
Are you saying they might kidnap me or something?

775
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:11,520
They might lock you up so you can't pay back the loan.

776
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,490
You managed to save one person's life...

777
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,540
It's all thanks to you.

778
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:21,740
This time, did you come to save my life?

779
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:46,740
 Through property speculation including redevelopment,

780
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,970
 Jo Tae Seop earned a huge profit in his past life.

781
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:53,190
 He used the financial sector to steal people's assets,

782
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:57,630
 and in that process, several properties suffered heavy losses.

783
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,590
 The body of a man in his seventies

784
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:07,880
 found by a Han River Police officer searching for fallen victims early this morning,

785
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,710
 was identified as Wu Yong Su, who had the title of the God of Bidding.

786
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:18,050
 The God of Bidding Wu Young Su is an example of one of those people who died a pitiful death after going bankrupt

787
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:20,730
  due to the pressure from finance corporations to collect on loans.

788
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:25,920
 I will protect him.

789
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,700
 Always Green Realty

790
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,300
 Realty Sale Contract

791
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,900
Are you really selling all of it?

792
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,100
I'm going to register them all at once on the same day.

793
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,880
Okay.

794
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,150
Are you sure you won't regret it?

795
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:47,410
I put the rest of the money in Nara bank instead of Bando bank.

796
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,440
Really...

797
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,300
You're going to regret it.

798
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:58,890
 Always Green Realty

799
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:10,700
 I must be suffering like this to go by your side.

800
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:18,800
DH Money succeeded in taking over the Bando bank.

801
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,570
Yes. DH Money and Bando bank have unified,

802
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:26,080
providing them the stepping stone to becoming the number one finance corporation in Korea.

803
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,930
We will always be with the people.

804
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:30,830
and take the lead in the welfare of the people.

805
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:32,880
What did you say, you bastard?

806
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,730
Are you seriously telling me all the properties were sold in one day!?

807
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,990
How can you let some random old man get away like this!?

808
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:38,930
I'm sorry.

809
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:41,240
Sorry?

810
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,810
Sorry? Didn't I tell you to keep a close eye on him?

811
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:48,370
There weren't any strange movements, so I didn't really take action.

812
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:52,530
So, that's why you let one hundred billion won disappear into thin air?

813
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:58,560
We finally got Bando bank and had a plan ready, and now our target is gone, you little shits!

814
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,180
 Department Head Han

815
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,240
I've committed a serious error.

816
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,600
That old fox Wu Yong Su moved faster than we thought—

817
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,310
It's okay.

818
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:24,320
As people live, they make mistakes in life.

819
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,640
Think of this as a mirror for the future and don't make mistakes anymore.

820
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,480
This won't happen again. I'm so sorry.

821
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,820
It's okay, that's enough. Get up.

822
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:41,870
It's just that the houses now belong to multiple people instead of one.

823
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:45,130
Nothing's changed. Am I right?

824
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:47,890
Yes, I won't mess up next time.

825
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:50,440
You can go now.

826
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,050
Yes.

827
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:58,090
Are you forgiving President Park?

828
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:02,920
One cannot allow himself to get tunnel vision when undertaking a big task.

829
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,580
Because you never know what variable might interfere.

830
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:08,500
You have to look far and wide.

831
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:13,400
If you bet one hundred billion and earn a trillion, it's a profit.

832
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,860
I was shortsighted.

833
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:18,650
Department Head Han, thank you for the data that you got from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport.

834
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,500
Yes.

835
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:25,660
A good staff member moves before suspicion, like Department Head Han.

836
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,950
They used to say that the country will go into ruin if a politician knows money,

837
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:34,350
but nowadays, without knowing money, you can't be a leader.

838
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:37,780
Look at America. They earn money printing dollars.

839
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:42,320
If you don't know the economy, you can't have power.

840
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,500
It's a time where money is power.

841
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,850
I'll keep that in mind.

842
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,860
Wu Yong Su...

843
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:59,200
Was he just lucky?

844
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,650
Elder.

845
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:04,040
Don't worry about it.

846
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,950
Today, I'm going to pour my own drinks.

847
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,370
Okay.

848
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,620
Today is my birthday.

849
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:22,080
Before I die, I figured I'd celebrate my birthday for once instead of working.

850
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:27,350
What do you think of it here? This is a place that I like.

851
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:33,220
It's my town, but it looks cool from here.

852
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:37,310
All those houses you can see will become apartments.

853
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:42,110
And this mountain will become a luxury villa area.

854
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,040
 Yes, that's what it will become.

855
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,870
You look like you already knew that.

856
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:48,570
Excuse me?

857
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:51,700
No.

858
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:56,240
As if. You were born with a talent for seeing the future.

859
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,730
You're also smart.

860
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:02,950
I pray you use your talent in a good way.

861
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:08,270
Here take it, I liquidated everything.

862
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:09,670
What is this?

863
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:13,420
You take care of this from now on.

864
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,320
 Wu Yong Su
 Savings Account

865
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:20,900
  ₩101,330,000,000

866
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:21,820
Sir...

867
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:24,190
Didn't you protect this money with your wits?

868
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:26,760
I'm reinvesting it in you.

869
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,370
- But...
 - The fact that we met,

870
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:34,390
and that I protected my money thanks to you... It all seems like the heavens willed it.

871
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:39,530
Use it as you wish and rule the world like you said you wanted to.

872
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:43,800
Money does its job when it goes to a person who needs it.

873
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:46,130
Have a glass.

874
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:47,790
Yes.

875
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:08,320
The auction house is almost like a composite art piece.

876
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:13,010
Forecasting the future and calculating profits through regional analysis,

877
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,850
avoiding losses through the use of legalities,

878
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:19,350
the thrill of winning a bid at court,

879
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:22,190
and even playing mind games with the residents.

880
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:26,490
You have to move after planning and seeing the big picture.

881
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:30,150
Instead of investing aggressively in a building with high risk,

882
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:34,260
lower the risk by investing in a safe asset.

883
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:38,850
Those are the rules of auctioning that I've kept until now.

884
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:44,340
Learn to see the future value and find the lowest risk assets.

885
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,550
That's what you mean, right?

886
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:46,920
Exactly.

887
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:51,210
Don't only focus on one thing, but look at the big picture.

888
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:53,940
What's the redevelopment speed around there,

889
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:57,800
what do people want and where do they gather...

890
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:04,040
My wife died when I was scouting out the whole country because I was crazy about land.

891
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,490
She kept saying her stomach hurt,

892
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:11,410
but I thought she'd get better after a while, so I just got her some digestive medicine.

893
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,960
I regret that.

894
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,920
She could've lived if I took her to the hospital sooner.

895
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:28,280
I have one thing that worries me when I see you.

896
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,590
Sir?

897
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:35,080
When I first saw you, it felt like looking into my own eyes when I was younger.

898
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:40,200
Eyes that are crazed about something. Don't get too crazy about it.

899
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,010
If you do, you'll lose yourself.

900
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:52,640
Let me pour you one, sir.

901
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:57,220
Happy birthday, sir.

902
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:27,400
 The fact that we met, and that I protected my money thanks to you...

903
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,450
 It all seems like the heavens willed it.

904
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:33,900
The heavens willed it...

905
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,390
No, no.

906
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,230
Here he comes again.

907
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:39,630
That person came to our school.

908
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,210
Do they really want to do that?

909
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:42,500
April, 8th. April, 8th.

910
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,830
What is it?

911
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:48,120
 Young people, set a goal and achieve it!

912
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:53,800
Young people, set a goal?

913
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,480
That's today.

914
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,460
Should we go see it?

915
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:58,990
Hmm?

916
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:01,520
Shall we go, Sunbaenim?

917
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,660
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop is a graduate from our department.

918
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,140
I wouldn't go even if they paid me to.

919
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:07,150
- Me neither.
 - You scared me.

920
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:10,950
Kim Hui Ah from the engineering department. 'Saved'!

921
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:12,760
I don't like that man, Jo Tae Seop.

922
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,650
Right?

923
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,440
Let's go and check it out. He supposedly has some helpful things to say.

924
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,600
We should be thankful.

925
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,200
Should we?

926
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,610
Are you going?

927
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,230
How about some day drinking?

928
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:37,090
How did you know today's my day off from my part-time job?

929
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:39,040
You make a proposal I can't refuse.

930
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,030
- Let's go.
  - You have money, right?

931
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,910
 Young people set a goal and achieve it!

932
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,500
- Here?
 - Yes.

933
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,720
It's a full house.

934
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,980
He's the only assemblyman in Korea people don't talk badly about.

935
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:05,190
He is here! Wow!

936
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,710
 It's been a while, Jo Tae Seop

937
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:23,400
 Let's see what kind of nonsense he'll spout.

938
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:31,460

939
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:41,620
 That woman...

940
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:46,370
 When you get closer to Jo Tae Seop, you might see me again.

941
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,210
 The Grim Reaper?

942
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:55,680
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

943
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:59,020
♫  We are here to wreck it up  ♫

944
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:05,110
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

945
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:12,550
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

946
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:15,940
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

947
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:21,950
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:31,150
♫  Who would ever find out who you really are? Hm  ♫

949
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,350
♫  You'll never know  ♫

950
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:36,440
 Again My Life

951
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,870
 Jo Tae Seop wouldn't just keep a random person by his side.

952
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:43,440
 Why don't you take this program?

953
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,620
 Haha Talk?

954
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:48,270
 This time, I'll carry out my plans for you a little more quickly.

955
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:51,740
 Who's meddling in all this? Who?

956
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:55,670
 The only way to fight with them right now is head on.

957
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:58,040
 I like the phrase "Too Big To Fail."

958
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,490
 Work with me.

959
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,610
 I remember...

960
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:04,430
 who you are.

961
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,910
 Again My Life
