1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:08,670

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,790
 Lee Joon Gi

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,830
 Lee Kyung Young

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,610
 Kim Ji Eun

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,110
 Again My Life

6
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,880
 Han Ji Hyeon?

7
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,520
 The fate of others is changing because I am living again.

8
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,410
 A butterfly's wings fluttering in the sky may result in a typhoon elsewhere.

9
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,120
 Grim Reaper Han Ji Hyeon, you brought me back to life!

10
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,490
 Are we enemies or friends?

11
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,470
 Again My Life

12
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,210
 Episode 12

13
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:37,120
 Finally I'm here. The heart of the Republic of Korea’s power!  Where filth gathers.

14
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,060
Have you been well?

15
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,960
Yes. What brings you here?

16
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,480
I'll bring down Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

17
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,860
Will you bring down Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun?

18
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,510
- Yes, sir.
 - Why?

19
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,750
I remembered the conversation we had before.

20
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,100
- About what?
 - Your goal to build a strong Republic of Korea.

21
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,760
Yes, that's what I'm always doing.

22
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,980
Chief Prosecutor's goal is to create a strong prosecution.

23
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,410
I also heard that from him often. What about it?

24
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,660
Right now, I work under the orders of Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

25
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,890
So I've been contemplating it.

26
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,800
Contemplating?

27
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,360
A strong nation and a strong prosecution.

28
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,400
But you and the chief prosecutor can't coexist.

29
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,820
As for me,

30
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,410
I want to be on your side, sir.

31
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,890
What are you saying right now?

32
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,430
Bando Bank.

33
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,190
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun ordered me to conduct a secret investigation.

34
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,850
Excessive loans to insolvent companies and extension of the deadline for repayment

35
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,630
And illegal loans through homeless people.

36
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,240
Park Dae Ho owns 15% of the shares in the Cheonha Group, but in name only.

37
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,300
The real owner is you, sir.

38
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,030
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun wants to put a leash on you.

39
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,260
What do you want to do?

40
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,710
So, what do you want to do with Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun?

41
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,240
I don't believe that's my concern.

42
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,330
I'm just a prosecutor.

43
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,310
Then can you cover up what you just told me?

44
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,390
I'll do that.

45
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,470
Then I'll take care of this.

46
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,360
Then I need to compensate you for this.

47
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,160
- What do you want?
 - Sorry?

48
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,460
Feel free to tell me what position or place.

49
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,230
I’m giving you a chance to choose your future.

50
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,400
- Nothing.
 - Is there nothing?

51
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,920
You betrayed Kim Seok Hun and came to me.

52
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,230
Wasn't it because you wanted something?

53
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,190
I didn't betray but only followed my convitions.

54
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,800
- Convictions?
 - Yes, sir.

55
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,620
Yes, convictions.

56
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,700
I'm glad the country has a prosecutor like you.

57
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,020
If you ever need anything, come and see me.

58
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,360
The door will be open to you at any time.

59
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,670
Thank you.

60
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,920
Goodbye for now.

61
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,640
- Manager Han!
 - Yes, sir.

62
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,130
- See him out.
 - Yes, sir.

63
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,520
If you had told him what you wanted, he would have granted it.

64
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,740
There isn't anything like that.

65
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,070
- I’m curious what you're thinking.
 - Sorry?

66
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:11,120
You told me you woul'd keep your promise.

67
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,260
I'm curious as to what that is.

68
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,460
- Before I answer, I have a question.
 - For me?

69
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,080
While investigating Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop under the chief prosecutor's orders,

70
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,600
I looked into you as well.

71
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,410
But I didn't find anything on you.

72
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,620
- You won't be able to investigate me.
 - Is that so?

73
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,390
Saying something like that makes a prosecutor want to dig deeper.

74
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,510
If you can, do so.

75
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,070
I think it's time now to get my question answered.

76
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,630
I can't give you all the answers yet. Be patient a little longer.

77
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,450
The hour when I'll keep my promise is approaching.

78
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,450
What does that mean?

79
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,380
Thank you for seeing me off. Then, now ...

80
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,240
Kim Seok Hun finally showed who he is.

81
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,670
He is shortsighted.

82
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:37,420
Just because of the prosecutor general position, he's going to lose something bigger.

83
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,170
- Manager Kim.
 - Yes, sir.

84
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,150
Keep an eye on Kim Seok Hun's every move

85
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,600
- and watch the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.
 - Eastern District Prosecutors' Office?

86
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,100
- If one moves, will the other stand still?
 - Understood, sir.

87
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,320
- Manager Han.
 - Yes, sir.

88
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,100
Doesn't Kim Hui Wu seem dangerous?

89
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,110
Look into him from start to finish.

90
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,660
Without missing anything, investigate thoroughly.

91
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,570
Yes, sir.

92
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,870
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office is investigating Bando Bank?

93
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,040
- Is Kim Seok Hun doing that?
 - Yes, sir.

94
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,010
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun wants to become the next prosecutor general.

95
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,950
He wants to use Bando Bank as a bargaining chip with Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

96
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,300
So, what do you need from me?

97
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,180
I'm going to leak information that the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office is investigating Bando Bank.

98
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,060
Leak?

99
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,180
- You want me to light the fuse?
 - Yes, sir.

100
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,690
- In your name.
 - Why?

101
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,260
If, rather than a leak, we hold a press conference, it won't just light the fuse,

102
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,790
but set the house on fire.

103
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,390
But last time, it backfired.

104
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,970
We tried to blow up the issue,

105
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,510
but Assemblyman Jo became more powerful and stronger.

106
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,670
Also, Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop has

107
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,330
enough power and resources to distract the public no matter how we try to expose him.

108
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,090
That's true.

109
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,820
That’s why the goal of my plan this time

110
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,480
is to break the alliance between Jo Tae Seop and Kim Seok Hun.

111
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,770
- Break the alliance?
 - Yes, sir.

112
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,640
Bando Bank and

113
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,490
Kim Seok Hun and Jo Tae Seop.

114
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,140
If it goes as planned, they'll be attacking each other like in some melodrama.

115
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,880
But then again,

116
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,550
people love melodramas.

117
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,810
I'm asking for your help.

118
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,940
Fine.

119
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,880
 But don't forget that your opponent is Jo Tae Seop. You will have to have a plan B

120
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,320
 and be more prepared.

121
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,440
 Yes, sir. Of course.

122
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,600
- Kim Hui Wu.
 - Hi.

123
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,010
What's it? What happened that you came all the way here to see me?

124
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,000
- Let's talk.
- You're making me excited.

125
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,770
What is it? You said you wanted to talk.

126
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,310
I'm going to catch a really bad guy.

127
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,430
But it could cause my friend to suffer some damage.

128
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,450
- A nice friend?
 - Yeah.

129
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,730
You're talking about Kim Seok Hun, right?

130
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,650
How did you know?

131
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,820
Before I came out to see you, Ajeossi Hwang Jin Yong called me.

132
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,100
And I got a rough idea, too.

133
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,760
Hey, how can you let me hear something that concerns me from Ajeossi?

134
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,820
I'm sorry.

135
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,360
It could make things really hard for you.

136
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,230
I can see the headlines in my head.

137
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,890
"The suspicion of Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun's extramarital affairs revealed to be true"

138
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,820
I'll try to block it as much as I can.

139
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,690
But I wanted you to be prepared, at least.

140
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,490
Don’t worry. Just promise me one thing.

141
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,590
Come on.

142
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:20,310
Take him down for good. If you don't, I'll never see you again.

143
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,090
Okay.

144
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,260
Also, this is my job. I will support you.

145
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,910
- Hey, Kim Han Mi!
 - I'm leaving.

146
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,280
  - Keep an eye on Kim Hui Wu.
 - Hui Wu?

147
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,040
Yeah. I told him to take care of something.

148
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,890
But Kim Hui Wu, that punk,

149
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,740
doesn't report back to me but gives me notice. He did the same thing with Gimsan and Jang Il Hyeon.

150
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,870
He's like a runaway train with faulty brakes.

151
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:11,150
We have to help him brake at the critical moment. Can you do it?

152
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,550
Yes, sir.

153
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,650
I'll promise. If all goes well this time,

154
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,960
I’ll have your father released.

155
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,230
- Are you clocking out now?
 - Yes.

156
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,740
How about we get some drinks?

157
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,880
Sorry.  I have an appointment.

158
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Gee, you're always so busy.  Take it easy.

159
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,270
I will.  Then ...

160
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,940
Okay.

161
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,190
Right now. Follow him.

162
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,750
- You're here?
 - Yes.

163
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,490
- Did everybody come?
 - Yeah. Even the woman warrior.

164
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,400
But I have a tail.

165
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,740
- Shadowed a prosecutor?
 - Yes.

166
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know what kind of guy he is, but he's foolhardy.

167
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,580
Should I grab him?

168
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,700
No, pretend you don't know and just keep an eye on him.

169
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,590
We need to find out who ordered him.

170
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,810
Here.

171
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,130
What is this?

172
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,290
A present. I wanted to wrap it beautifully, but this time you should put the ribbon on it yourself.

173
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,790
 Internal Investigation Report on JQ Construction

174
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,670
- JQ Construction?
 - Yeah.

175
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,990
 JQ Construction is owned by Kim Seok Hun's wife's family.

176
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:24,110
If this gets out, it would deal a fatal blow to Kim Seok Hun's ambition to become the next prosecutor general.

177
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,680
At the same time, it will be good for his opponent Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi.

178
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,490
Hey, if this is done right, we can uproot everything evil that is embedded there in one move.

179
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,450
It doesn't matter if you uproot the evil.  It is opposing Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

180
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,450
What's wrong with opposing the chief prosecutor?

181
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,680
Yes.  Whoever it is who violates the law should be caught.

182
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,690
We are prosecutors.

183
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,720
Let's catch him.

184
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,520
I knew you were a woman warrior.

185
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,740
Punk, to your seonbae ...

186
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,220
Keep it under cover for now.  I'll tell you when to expose it.

187
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,110
Okay.  For now I will do a confirming investigation with Prosecutor Gu.

188
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,210
We have a great sauce so we should cook it perfectly.

189
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,910
Okay.

190
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,120
This is the intel on Kim Hui Wu.

191
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,900
What do you think, can we trust him?

192
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,090
That's something you should decide on your own.

193
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,980
 Kim Hui Wu Resumé

194
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,030
His father was the witness at the scene of Hyeon Seok's accident?

195
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,170
Yes.

196
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,680
What a strange coincidence.

197
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,040
Anyway, this guy was under Kim Seok Hun

198
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,740
and attached himself to me like a bat. Why did he do that?

199
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,320
From the circumstantial evidence and what the head of the training center when Kim was there said,

200
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,950
I think Kim is working on behalf of Prosecutor Jeon Seok Gyu.

201
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:53,740
That's a valid point. It didn't make sense for the first place trainee at the center to apply for a provincial office.

202
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:59,410
Yes. I think the design was that he and Jeon Seok Gyu would come to Seoul together.

203
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,760
Yes, Kim Hui Wu is not  Kim Seok Hun's person.

204
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,950
From the start, he has worked to bring Jeon Seok Gyu back to Seoul.

205
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,620
And to bring down Kim Seok Hun,

206
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,750
he is trying to use me.

207
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,810
What should I do?

208
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,370
Shall I do what he wants?

209
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,190
Or should I make him pay for trying to use me?

210
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,540
Shrewd bastard.

211
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,060
Central District Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun?

212
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,530
- Why?
 - This is a bit ...

213
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,100
What's the matter with you? Let's not be like this among pros.  You've released even worse.

214
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,550
The office is a phantom and there's an overseas server.

215
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,570
The most important is that the source is Assemblyman Hwang.

216
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,740
What's the catch? Is price a problem?

217
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,580
Deal?

218
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,420
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

219
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,290
- Yes?
 - I threw the bait.

220
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,270
Did you? Good job.

221
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,100
 Jo Tae Seop.  You'll have no other choice but to come to me.

222
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,180
Sir, this is an urgent report we just got in.

223
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,510
Tell me.

224
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,900
It's the content of a tabloid article that will be uploaded tomorrow.

225
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,780
- The Central District Prosecutors' Office is investigating Bando Bank?
 - Yes.

226
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,370
So it's true that Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu has been investigating this.

227
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,910
For now, I've muffled the tabloid reporter's mouth, but the problem is the source is Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong.

228
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,300
If he knows, the problem is rather serious.

229
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,240
It could be hard for me to block it on my own.

230
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,900
- Summon Kim Hui Wu.
 - I will.

231
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,460
 Han Ji Hyeon.

232
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,870
 It's Han Ji Hyeon.

233
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,220
I was expecting your call.

234
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,830
You want me there right now?

235
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,280
 What?

236
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,150
Yes.

237
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,280
Sir, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu is here.

238
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,550
Welcome.

239
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,940
You're a gifted prosecutor.

240
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,040
You're a promising prosecutor who can grow even greater in the future.

241
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,010
I'd like to give you an opportunity.

242
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,170
Take Kim Seok Hun down.

243
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,950
I'll help you.

244
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,130
 Help me?  But you won't accept responsibility...

245
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,150
To what extent will you help me?

246
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:47,750
I won't let anyone interfere with you while you are carrying out the task.

247
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,610
Thank you, sir.

248
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,020
It's not going to be easy.

249
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,010
I am only following the orders given to me.

250
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,070
- First, look into JQ Construction.
 - I'm already doing that.

251
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,770
Are you? Great. Did you find anything?

252
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:13,090
Yes. However, it requires more time to confirm.

253
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,580
Of course, with your assistance, I could shorten the time.

254
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,000
My help?  What is it?

255
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,240
I need your secretary.

256
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,950
- Manager Han?
 - Yes.

257
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,090
She has never left my side.

258
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,750
What do you need my secretary for?

259
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,300
She just needs to show her face. She won't need to say a word.

260
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,340
What are you trying to accomplish with Manager Han?

261
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,360
I will show you through the result.

262
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,190
All right.  Well, I'll see it when the time comes.

263
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:55,100
I'll ask you again today.  What do you want?

264
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,570
- Nothing.
 - There isn't anything this time either?

265
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,710
No.  I'm not looking for a reward.

266
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,020
I'm only following my convictions.

267
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,260
- Manager Han.
 - Yes, sir.

268
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,940
Help Prosecutor Kim.

269
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,550
Yes, sir.

270
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,670

271
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,910
Look at this punk. What are you doing here?

272
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,850
Why have you come, punk?

273
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,820
How many times has Kim Seok Hun come here?

274
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,770
Naturally, he would not have phoned.

275
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,630
You've been abandoned. Completely.

276
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,070
And you will stay.  Right here.

277
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,870
Hey, Punk. Did you come to fan the fire?

278
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,220
That fire, I came to put it out.

279
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,750
What?

280
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,960
- Let's make a deal.
 - A deal?

281
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,240
There's a way to reduce your sentence.

282
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,440
What bullshit is that, punk?

283
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,450
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

284
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,320
I'm working for him now.

285
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,740
He's ordered me to bring Kim Seok Hun down.

286
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,570
Hey. Don't go overboard with your lies. Are you kidding?

287
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,750
You're daring to claim to be in a position I could never attain?

288
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,530
Yes.

289
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:55,950
So please tell me about Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun's corruption.

290
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,880
What an amateur. Corruption is something only bastards like me commit.

291
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,370
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun doesn't need things like that. Don't you know his wife's family is JQ?

292
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,410
That JQ is all I need.

293
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,380
When JQ Construction bought the land in Gusan City,

294
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,120
there was a report that you were involved.

295
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,880
Then prove that you're the assemblyman's person first.

296
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,940
So that I can believe it.

297
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,610
Please come in.

298
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,600
 Record

299
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,930
Everything that you say here can be used as evidence.

300
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,970
Do you agree to it?

301
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,190
Yes. I agree.

302
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,280
Please tell us.

303
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:08,100
JQ Construction won an unfair bid on the purchase price of land in Gusan City,

304
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,120
which was much lower than market value in the vicinity.

305
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,090
Is there any evidence for that?

306
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,880
There isn't.

307
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,950
Not with me.

308
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,690
But JQ's Executive Director Shin Dae Wung will probably have proof.

309
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,300
JQ's old-timer, in the position of executive director.

310
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,570
He's also the architect of the crooked purchase of the land in Gusan City.

311
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,130
All right. I'll stop recording now.

312
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,210
Thank you for your hard work.

313
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,290
Hey, Kim Hui Wu. Let me ask one question.

314
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:56,640
Since when did you betray me?  Bastard, was it from the very beginning?

315
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,180
Never mind. Make sure to keep your word.

316
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,310
Are you positive you can reduce my sentence?

317
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,880
Yes.  I keep my word.

318
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,790
 Central Detention Center
 Maintaining Public Well-Being and Order

319
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,410
It's a present for the assemblyman.

320
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,060
I hope he likes it.

321
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,210
I really didn't say a word, did I?

322
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,980
Should I ask the assemblyman to reduce Jang Il Hyeon's sentence a little?

323
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,930
A promise is a promise, so maybe about a month?

324
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,780
Please ask him for me.

325
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,430
Good-bye for now.

326
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,220
Kim Hui Wu met Jang Il Hyeon with Manager Han?

327
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,220
Were you still here?

328
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,750
Yeah.

329
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,870
Yes, Chief Prosecutor.

330
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,080
 I want to hear an interim report on the Bando Bank investigation.

331
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,140
Yes, I'll come right now.

332
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,380
Park Dae Ho runs separate organizations that employ foreigners and don't share information.

333
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,710
We have secured a list of the homeless in need of illegal loans.

334
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,910
- Foreigners?
 - Yes. If something goes wrong, it's hard to trace.

335
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:19,590
So Bando Bank made illegal loans to homeless people.

336
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,120
And the money went straight into Park Dae Ho's back pocket.

337
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,810
The situation is still ongoing. I've only checked the list.

338
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,250
The situation is also a fact.

339
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,940
We will be unbeatable if we go together wielding swords.

340
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,920
Thank you.

341
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,400
- Do you have plans later?
 - No, nothing at all.

342
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,520
Let's have dinner.

343
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,490
Yes.  Let's do that.

344
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,930
The size of the home care market is growing daily.

345
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,020
We need a unique technology that can dominate this global market.

346
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,140
What is the special feature of the products that will be launched this time?

347
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,940
Yes, it's been made to be used conveniently after considering the consumer's ease.

348
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,630
We can use it easily.

349
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,170
Yes, would you like to try using it yourself?

350
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,880
I'll do that.

351
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,670
Then, it'll become very easy to take care of one's skin at home.

352
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:31,510
That's good. Please hurry the product launch. I'll tell the  related design.

353
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:37,330
And, going forward, I hope you will submit overall reports regarding product development directly to me.

354
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,220
Then, let's end today's meeting here.

355
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,600
Thank you for your effort.

356
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,760
Thank you for your effort.

357
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,220
General Manager.

358
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,850
What is it?

359
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,620
This is the status report on stocks that was just uploaded on the FSC and KRX websites.

360
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,190
JQ Constructions' Managing Director Kim Yeong Il suddenly bought a huge block of Cheonha Holdings' shares.

361
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,460
What is this? 5%?

362
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,090
Yes.

363
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,460
But JQ Constructions lacks funding. Who is their source?

364
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,700
It's been revealed that they received the loan from Bando Bank.

365
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,740
Bando Bank?

366
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,190
If they purchased shares through a loan from Bando Bank, I'm sure they're not on our side.

367
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,960
CEO Park Dae Ho's shares are 15%

368
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,820
If even the 5% share here that JQ Construction has taken goes into CEO Park Dae Ho's hands,

369
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,100
then my brothers and I would be unable to prevent their right to management.

370
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,520
While investigating, we detected a few places where Bando Bank made illegal loans for JQ Construction.

371
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,110
How about exposing that?

372
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:04,660
No, for us to expose it, the risk is too big. It's also work that prosecutors should do.

373
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,130
Manager Park, please organize the material on everything we have gathered so far.

374
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,650
Yes.

375
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,150
 Hui Wu

376
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,130
Aren't there many places to eat in Seochodong too?

377
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,300
Why? Do you find it burdensome to go far?

378
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,560
Or is it strange that I am driving without even a driver?

379
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,680
It's both.

380
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,250
It's because it's a difficult and an important get-together.

381
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,890
Do you know what I want to do if I become Prosecutor General?

382
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,800
Isn't it to make the prosecutor's office strong?

383
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:01,040
More specifically, a prosecutor's office that does not get jerked around by politics.

384
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,880
However, in order to get that kind of power,

385
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,410
the reality is that there's no other way but to collude with politics.

386
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,840
You've met Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop before, right?

387
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,950
Yes.

388
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,010
It seems he thought well of you. He told us to come together.

389
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,050
Don't speak until you meet him.

390
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,090
 What is this?

391
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:40,470
 Have I been caught in Jo Tae Seop's and Kim Seok Hun's snare?

392
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,520
He's waiting.

393
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,660
It's been a while.

394
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,720
According to the Chief Prosecutor, you've been very busy due to the case you've taken on recently.

395
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,910
What kind of case is it?

396
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,560
 If I tell the truth, Kim Seok Hun will strike me, and if I lie, Jo Tae Seop will.

397
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,030
Speak comfortably.

398
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:34,810
 I can't lie. Then...

399
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,630
I apologize. While I respect you, sir,

400
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:47,040
because it is a matter related to a prosecutor's duties, I cannot speak of it with outsiders.

401
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,890
Aigoo, I... I have asked an onerous question.

402
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,080
Haven't I, Chief Prosecutor?

403
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,710
Yes.

404
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:01,590
The reason I asked you two is that I wanted to see Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

405
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:07,590
This prosecutor who will lead the prosecutors' future, what kind of person, how he'd express himself...

406
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,130
I wanted to offer a glass of this drink too.

407
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,520
I know how you feel. I must seem heartless.

408
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,500
You must be thinking that I'm weighing between you and Chief Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi.

409
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,130
It's been difficult recommending you to both parties.

410
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,640
Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong's side is particularly a problem.

411
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:38,320
You know. That I have no way of manipulating that side.

412
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,530
Assemblyman, if that's the case, how about we entrust Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong to Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu?

413
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,940
 Was it this? They called me to get Assemblyman Hwang?

414
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,740
Don't underestimate Hwang Jin Yong.

415
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:55,390
I also had a number of opportunities when I could have stripped Hwang Jin Yong of his position, but I bided my time.

416
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:59,220
Since an immoderate attack has a way of creating cracks in me too.

417
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,850
Yes, sir.

418
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:05,190
He's a man who has stood firm all this time on this harsh political field.

419
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:09,410
If you are to oppose Hwang Jin Yong, you'll need to build more experience.

420
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,590
I'll consider it more seriously.

421
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:17,630
But I think he will come in quite useful when it comes to taking down small fry.

422
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:23,490
What do you say? Do you think you're up for the task?

423
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:27,120
 He's calling Kim Seok Hoon small fry.

424
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,870
 It's Jo Tae Seop's intent to discard him.

425
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,870
Yes, I'll catch him.

426
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,650
Here.

427
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,990
You too should have a glass.

428
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,550
- You did a good job, even though it must have been difficult for you.
- Not at all.

429
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:00,420
It's not much longer. We must launch a new era for prosecutors.

430
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,760
Prosecutors who don't get jerked around by politics.

431
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,500
The era of just and upright prosecutors who see only the law.

432
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:30,280
 That's not something to be said by a person who's trying to become the prosecutor general by flattering politicians.

433
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,080
The assemblyman asked for you.

434
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,080
- Did you have enough to drink?
 - Yes.

435
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,320
Your mask is better than I thought.

436
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,960
Were you testing me?

437
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,710
Yes, I tested you.

438
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,700
I was curious

439
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:17,580
as to what face you'd present when Kim Seok Hun and I were in the same place.

440
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,700
You answered as I'd expected. I like it.

441
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,560
I heard from Manager Han about where you went.

442
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,480
How is the work progressing? Well?

443
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,450
Yes.

444
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,570
You'll need to move carefully.

445
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,400
Kim Seok Hun catches on more quickly than you think.

446
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,260
I understand.

447
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,190
Ta-da.

448
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,010
While Hui Wu's on his way, could you taste this?

449
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:48,930
It's a new dish we developed, but I don't know if it'll be to young people's taste.

450
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:52,450
Gyu Ri, you like Western food, don't you? I wondered if Western food and steamed chicken

451
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,010
couldn't become friends and tried making this.

452
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,750
I named it, "Dominate the World, Jjimdak". Don't hold back on your comments.

453
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,970
Thank you, sir. It looks delicious.

454
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,290
The sauce and the steamed chicken blend together well.

455
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:17,120
Dear, dear! I have a good feeling this time too!

456
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,360
The last menu item  Gyu Ri praised became a hit too.

457
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,990
You and I seem to get each other in some way.

458
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,330
While I can't cook, my sense of taste lives on.

459
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:29,280
The world is full of delicious food. It's not a problem that you can't cook, sweetie.

460
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,650
Anyone watching might think Seonbae (Gyu Ri) is your daughter-in-law.

461
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,400
Really? I wanted to be seen as a daughter.

462
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,220
Honestly, we need a daughter and a daughter-in-law too. Do you have any interest in our Hui Wu?

463
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,870
Even though Hui Wu may seem blunt, when you take a good look at him, he's tender, kind, and alright.

464
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:50,090
- Don't worry. Gyu Ri likes Hui Wu.
- Hey, Gu Seung Hyeok!

465
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,950
Ah, liking someone is not something to be embarrassed about. Like him all you want.

466
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:56,190
Continue to like him. Nonstop. On and on and on.

467
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,710
Thank you. Father. Mom.

468
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,440
-I'm back.
 - Come in.

469
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,120
One came in.

470
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,700
Right, I'll prepare five servings of steamed chicken.

471
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,760
- Hey, you waited a long time, didn't you?
 - No.

472
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,260
What do you mean we haven't waited long? An hour and a half has passed.

473
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,650
But what about you, Seonbae Min Su?

474
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,520
I came together so I could make an alibi for Hui Wu.

475
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,860
Alibi?

476
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,620
With just the three of you, people will think you're conspiring. But if I'm here, it becomes a friendly gathering.

477
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,580
What's going on? Are you being followed?

478
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,350
Yes. But don't worry.

479
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:34,160
We can talk comfortably today thanks to Min Su.

480
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:40,130
Here. I'll offer this as my fine for being late.

481
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,910
- Jang Il Hyeon's confession.
- What?

482
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:48,620
In order to forget the pain of Jeon Il Bo, I've already taken it upon myself

483
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,780
to investigate Executive Director Shin Dae Yong.

484
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,100
Please take extreme caution so that our paths don't overlap.

485
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,460
Yes, Seonbae.

486
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,460
But the more I dig into this, the bigger it gets.

487
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,950
I think JQ Construction will collapse.

488
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:06,140
No, it won't. Only their higher-ups will change.

489
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,320
From a scumbag to a clean one.

490
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,340
- Park Sang Man.
 - What's up?

491
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,940
You graduated at the top in computer science from Hanguk University.

492
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,850
You were on scholarship for four years.

493
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,070
You received job offers from large domestic and foreign corporations, but you rejected them all.

494
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,990
Are you just recognizing my value?

495
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:34,110
Why do I have such a competent person?

496
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,600
Do I have to say it?

497
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,530
What is it?  Tell me.

498
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,810
Because I like you so much.

499
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,850
Thanks.

500
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm more thankful to you.

501
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,800
You got my father off from the false charges.

502
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:59,200
Then ...  shall we start something more suited to your specialty now?

503
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,350
What's that?

504
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,200
Make a proper company.

505
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,810
Make a company?

506
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,610
Yes.  As an investment.

507
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,940
Come on. I've never ever worked for a company.

508
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,220
Good. You can start now then.  As the CEO.

509
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,920
CEO?  Are you serious?

510
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,190
You are taking over JQ Construction.   Starting now, buy its stock whenever you can.

511
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,600
Hyeong, are you nuts? Do you really want me to run the company?

512
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,720
Yeah. Your minor was business management, wasn't it?

513
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,880
You had very good grades

514
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,280
and you like playing business games.

515
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,330
The thing is ... are studying and playing games the same as the real thing?

516
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,400
They are different. Reality might be easier, especially for you.

517
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,660
Hyeong.

518
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,890
Start getting ready to take over.

519
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,140
CEO?

520
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,090
Get ready to take over?

521
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:06,790
Kim Seok Hun will disappear soon and JQ Construction will collapse.

522
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:12,600
The financial structure of JQ Construction is poor, but not so much that it'll become a problem.

523
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,090
- If DH money succeeds in taking it over—
 - But that is —

524
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,120
Why? Is there a problem?

525
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,320
- That is—
 - Say it.

526
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:26,460
If the prosecutor starts to investigate JQ Construction, we will be in trouble.

527
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,000
What do you mean by trouble?

528
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,010
I heard that Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun was your man and gave his son...

529
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,480
A loan.  An illegal one.

530
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,180
Yes.

531
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,250
Why did you?

532
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:47,390
It wasn't easy to find someone to hold on to a large block of Cheonha Holding Company stock.

533
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:51,410
If we placed the stock with a less wealthy person, his source of funds would be immediately traced.

534
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,810
Even I couldn't come forward so I used Kim Yeong Il because of the situation.

535
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,650
Without even reporting to me?!

536
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,850
I deserve to die.  The situation was so urgent.

537
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,070
That side needed money and we needed a strawman to hold title.

538
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:12,670
I thought it was a great opportunity for him to secure a 5% share of the Cheonha Holding shares on the market.

539
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,560
This really...

540
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:20,830
The total amount of the loans is 700 billion.  Of that, 500 billion went to Kim Yeong Il.

541
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:21,990
How did he use them?

542
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,760
As Director Park Dae Ho said, he bought shares of Cheonha Holding Company and—

543
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,700
There's more?

544
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,730
Yes.  We have determined that it was used in the purchase of his apartment.

545
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:38,830
When the investigation begins we cannot predict the extent of the fallout.

546
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,670
I thought I said you didn't need to know.

547
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:49,130
Still, I need to know what case Kim Hui Wu is investigating.

548
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,400
I'm looking for the common thread in his different actions, but for now—

549
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,280
There's nothing special in Kim Hui Wu's activity, is there?

550
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,910
No.

551
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:01,020
Okay.  For the time being, keep a close eye on him.

552
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,210
Kim Hui Wu.

553
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,250
Let's chat.

554
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,420
 They didn't exceed expectations.

555
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:52,600
What is this?

556
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,810
I tailed you a little.

557
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:59,970
Don't be offended. Let's not get emotional.

558
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,560
When we are ordered to reveal something, we reveal it because we are prosecutors.

559
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,360
So what?

560
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,950
Who told you to meet Seonbae Jang Il Hyeon with Manager Han?

561
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:11,620
The chief prosecutor's order? If not, the assemblyman?

562
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,380
I'll ask a question first. Tailing me,

563
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,590
was it the chief prosecutor's order or if not, of your own volition?

564
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,880
Chief Prosecutor's order.

565
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,060
This time, it's me.

566
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:36,280
After staking down Seonbae Jang Il Hyeon, he must be thinking of taking me down this time.

567
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,920
Then who will be next?

568
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,370
Don't you know?  The chief prosecutor does not intend to take you or me with him to the prosecutor general's office.

569
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,920
It must be a liability for him, right?

570
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,390
That his right-hand hoobaes  (juniors)  are stained with corruption.

571
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,900
He must have thought he had to cut us off before he moves up to the prosecutor general's office

572
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,190
so that he could become a fine prosecutor general.

573
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,950
So who ordered you to meet Jang Il Hyeon?

574
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:03,620
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

575
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:17,130
Don't waste your time chasing my tail.  Stand in line well.

576
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:20,050
It's up to you to judge.

577
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,780
Then, I'll be leaving now.

578
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:53,450
What do you mean there is a case you want to request?

579
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,270
These are Cheonha files.

580
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,320
 Report on Holders of Large Blocks of Cheonha Holdings Stock

581
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,270
Coveting Cheonha.   Kim Yeong Il's greed is  extraordinary.

582
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:10,210
He has taken a 5% stake in Cheonha Holdings.

583
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:16,420
He looked for an opening while you and your siblings were frantic after the chairman died.

584
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,620
If not now, there won't be an opportunity to get shares in our group.

585
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,860
But where did Kim Yeong Il get the money?

586
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:27,270
JQ Construction that I investigated is having a liquidity crisis.  (That is, being short of money.)

587
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:30,910
From Bando Bank. It was a preferential loan.

588
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:33,890
If you analyze documents and accounting data related to the bank's investment business,

589
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:38,490
you'll find evidence of poor screening during the processing of the loan.

590
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,700
The loan is of a magnitude which is difficult to obtain with JQ Construction's poor credit rating.

591
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,520
Right.

592
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:48,040
Thanks, Kim Hui Ah.

593
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,790
- Do you mean it?
 - Yeah.

594
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:54,350
This is information I needed.

595
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:58,330
That's fortunate. I wondered if I was pressuring you.

596
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,080
Even though I know the truth—

597
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,230
You have no authority to punish.  That's why you looked for me.

598
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,380
Yes.

599
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,860
I'll make good use of it.

600
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:12,070
You'll soon learn how helpful you've been.

601
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,340
Oh, I've got to get going.  See you later.

602
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,040
Yes.

603
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:32,790
Are you saying Bando Bank and JQ Engineering &amp; Construction are connected?

604
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,310
Yes.

605
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,260
My heart is pounding. Look at this case growing bigger.

606
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:44,250
He was trying to use Bando Bank as a springboard for his career but it got entangled with his son.

607
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,230
It's a royal backfire.

608
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,610
Kim Seok Hun must be in shock.

609
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:51,390
He probably didn't know.

610
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,840
The issue is what will Jo Tae Seop's next move be?

611
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:05,320
 Manager Han Ji Hyeon

612
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:10,460
 Stop the investigation of JQ Construction.

613
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,790
- What?
 - It's the Assemblyman's instruction.

614
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:15,970
I understand.

615
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:19,980
He said that he will not forget

616
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,510
 how hard you have worked all of this time.

617
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,180
Yes.

618
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,800
I told him.

619
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,930
How did he respond?

620
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:32,210
He was calm.

621
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:35,850
Calm? Without asking why?

622
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,610
Yes.

623
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,730
You were calm?

624
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,390
As expected, the investigation was stopped.

625
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:50,050
But it's not over until it's over.

626
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,060
He's a little late.  It's about time he arrived.

627
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,730
Who's coming?

628
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,440
I brought the homework.

629
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,990
You came?

630
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,200
Why are you so surprised? Have I come where I shouldn't have?

631
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,110
Here. A recording of the confession of Sin Dae Wung,

632
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:10,200
the architect of corruption in Gusan City.

633
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,990
Good job, Seonbaenim.

634
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:19,200
From now, it's time for Department head and Seonbae Ji who have been working hard,

635
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,290
and the friends who were quietly sharpening their knives,

636
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,650
to see the light.

637
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:38,290
Gyu Ri, I'm sending you a recording of Sin Dae Wung's confession.  Verify it and

638
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,890
release it.

639
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:44,170
Welcome, Prosecutor Kim.
  Eastern District Prosecutor's Office.

640
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:47,830
Did you and Prosecutor Gu bring this?  Report of the Internal Investigation of JQ Construction

641
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,940
Yes, that's correct.

642
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,850
I think there should be more prosecutors like you.

643
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:56,910
Then, the public can trust us.

644
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:03,550
Can you finish by yourself what you started?

645
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,630
Yes. Of course.

646
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,260
Then, get started.

647
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,520
The whole investigation process should be reported directly to me.

648
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,700
I will, Chief Prosecutor.

649
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,380
What?

650
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:16,690
Do you know who I am?

651
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:21,420
Kim Yeong Il, son of Kim Seok Hun, chief of the Central District Prosecutor Office,  and third generation chaebol.

652
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,150
Still a witness,  soon to be a suspect.

653
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:29,870
The law is equal for everyone.

654
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,770
Assemblyman.

655
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,140
Is something the matter?

656
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,640
The Eastern District Prosecutors' Office just arrested Kim Yeong Il, managing director of JQ Construction

657
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,370
- What are the charges?
 - Illegal loans and a rigged bid on land.

658
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:46,370
- Call Yun Jong Gi.
 - Yes.

659
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,160
Okay.

660
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,060
Kim Yeong Il was arrested.

661
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,260
The warrant will be issued soon, right?

662
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,240
Isn't that risky?  To the Eastern District Prosecutor's Office.

663
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,760
When JQ's loan issue is revealed, Park Dae Ho will appear.

664
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,420
Right.  Park Dae Ho used to be a gangster.

665
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:09,410
They will be fine.

666
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,990
 - Yeon Seok.
 - Yes.

667
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:15,330
 Starting tomorrow, you should become Gyu Ri and Seung Hyeok's guard. Without anyone knowing.

668
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,830
 I will.

669
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:20,230
 If anything dangerous happens, call me right away.

670
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,830
  Yes.

671
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,480
That jerk, Yun Jong Gi!

672
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,090
 Prosecution Service

673
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,940
 Manager Han Ji Hyeon

674
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:01,050
 The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

675
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,960
The timing isn't ideal.

676
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,600
Release Kim Yeong Il of JQ Constructions.

677
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:18,800
Why? Are you upset?

678
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,670
Well.

679
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:23,710
It's not exactly a nice feeling.

680
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:28,220
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun is lacking to be the leader of the prosecutors.

681
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,080
That's not up to you to decide.

682
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:39,590
Please take a look and make your decision.

683
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:47,870
 Investigation Report on Suspicions in JQ Construction

684
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:54,090
This matter is too serious to cover up. According to the investigation, done by my prosecutors—

685
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:56,940
- So what?
- Pardon?

686
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:01,940
I didn't call you here to talk about the appointment of the prosecutor general.

687
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,480
I called you here regarding the JQ Constructions case.

688
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,820
Can't you see?

689
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:10,870
I don't like stubborn dogs.

690
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,870
You can go now.

691
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:27,510
It's all material you already know.

692
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:32,280
Do you think Chief Prosecutor Yun will cover up the JQ Construction case?

693
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,230
He will. He doesn't have any other choice.

694
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,960
The problem isn't the chief prosecutor. It's the two prosecutors in charge of the case.

695
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,580
They are very tenacious and don't compromise.

696
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,840
How noisy.

697
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,130
They are bothering me.

698
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,360
I'll take care of them.

699
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,420
Something is off.

700
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:10,910
Bando, JQ Construction, and Hwang Jin Yong. Now, Yun Jong Gi as well?

701
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:17,520
It's like someone is reading my moves ahead and getting in my way.

702
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:22,170
Should I go along?

703
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,420
Or...

704
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:28,860
Or...

705
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,430
Stop the investigation?

706
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:36,530
Don't ask me anything.

707
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:37,610
Just do what I say.

708
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:41,390
It's an order. Get out.

709
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,530
I'm sorry. But I'm a prosecutor.

710
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,580
Kim Gyu Ri.

711
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,520
What is this?

712
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,140
I need to be somewhere right now.

713
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,670
Are you crazy? Where do you think you're going after what just happened?

714
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,460
We have a witness.

715
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,270
- A witness?
- It's a civil servant from the JQ Construction corruption case.

716
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:13,340
The witness kept dodging my calls, but now, the witness wants to meet.

717
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,850
The witness wants to testify.

718
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:18,880
We can keep Kim Yeong Il here with the testimony.

719
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,510
Okay.

720
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:24,470
I'll stall time here. Make sure to bring the witness here.

721
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:25,940
Okay.

722
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,150
There he comes.

723
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:44,090
Yeon Seok, I'll follow Prosecutor Gu.

724
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:46,170
You stay here and keep an eye on Gyu Ri.

725
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,870
Okay.

726
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:05,170
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

727
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,110
Hey, Sang Man.

728
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:16,540
Huyng. I followed Prosecutor Gu's car here. But something is off.

729
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,490
What do you mean "off"?

730
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,330
 We're in Gusan now.

731
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:21,220
This is an empty carpenter's shop.

732
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,040
Really? At this hour?

733
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,230
Yes.

734
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,120
Okay.

735
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,450
Is this the right place?

736
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:52,630
 The number you dialed does not exist. Please check and try again.

737
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:54,850
Prosecutor Gu.

738
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:02,430
Who are you?

739
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:09,980
Why don't you stop investigating the JQ Construction case?

740
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:10,750
What?

741
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,760
Telling me that you'll stop isn't so hard.

742
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,630
If you give me your word, I will let you go unharmed.

743
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:21,540
I won't listen to your nonsense. Do you think a thug can scare me?

744
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,000
A thug?

745
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,900
Do you think I'm a mere thug?

746
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:32,050
I'll give you time to decide. You may die here.

747
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,410
I hope you will make a wise decision.

748
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:43,790
 Hui Wu. A guy in a black suit is talking to Prosecutor Gu.

749
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,130
Assemblyman.

750
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,540
I came here because I needed to sort things out.

751
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:26,380
Chief Prosecutor Kim, it's time to decide now.

752
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,130
I'm sorry.

753
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:30,820
If you made your decision, I will accept it without objections.

754
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,830
You'll accept it without objections?

755
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,690
I will.

756
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39,190
- You take it.
- Pardon?

757
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,330
The prosecutor general title.

758
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:46,980
Your name will be engraved on the deskplate of the next prosecutor ceneral.

759
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:50,670
Don't worry about your son. I'll take care of it.

760
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:54,190
Isn't this funny?

761
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:59,780
I'm trying to help you. But you are trying to hold me back. You know?

762
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,000
Bando Bank.

763
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:07,160
I would like to hear your excuse.

764
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,830
- Assemblyman.
 - Seok Hun.

765
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:15,210
I hope this is the last time you ever test me.

766
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:19,110
Don't cross the line. I told you many times.

767
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:22,530
I will let you reach your limit.

768
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:26,750
Make sure I never have to repeat myself again.

769
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:29,610
I'll keep that in mind.

770
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:34,730
As of today, I will forget your past mistakes.

771
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:39,030
But let's clear one thing up.

772
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:43,240
What do you think of Chief Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi?

773
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:48,280
Stabbing a colleague in the back to become the prosecutor general.

774
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,640
It is indeed ridiculous.

775
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:55,970
But Seok Hun, Yun Jong Gi is standing in the way of your future. You get rid of him.

776
01:00:56,710 --> 01:01:01,630
I will silence the mouth of the righteous prosecutor.

777
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:10,450
This is your last chance.

778
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:13,590
Tell me you will stop.

779
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,790
What's the point of bringing justice and following the law?

780
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:20,720
You need to live first.

781
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,200
If you can't speak, just nod your head.

782
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,670
Like a dog.

783
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:29,790
What if I tell you I will stop the investigation,

784
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:33,250
but I keep investigating the case?

785
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:35,070
It doesn't matter.

786
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:39,900
A submissive dog isn't threatening.

787
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:46,330
Too bad. I'm not a dog. I'm a prosecutor.

788
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:53,590
That only leaves killing you.

789
01:01:56,990 --> 01:02:01,120
This is a perfect mixture of alcohol and methamphetamine.

790
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,620
Tomorrow morning,

791
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:05,780
the world will remember you as a corrupt and drug-addicted prosecutor

792
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:09,410
who committed suicide.

793
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,630
Hey.

794
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:20,370
You still haven't changed your playbook.

795
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,550
That's too outdated. It's boring.

796
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,070
Who are you?

797
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:35,850
Is that important right now?

798
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:38,940
I asked who you were.

799
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:42,290
Someone who knows you very well.

800
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,330
Have we met before?

801
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:46,690
Yes.

802
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:51,480
And I died at your hands.

803
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:57,250
You have mistaken me for someone else. I have never failed.

804
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:01,460
Right. You didn't fail.

805
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:04,660
I just resurrected like a miracle.

806
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:10,590
I was gravely wronged and furious. So even death grazed past me.

807
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:12,840
How funny.

808
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,600
Then I expect you to do the same again.

809
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:19,110
Are you dense?

810
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:24,160
If that was the case, I wouldn't have gotten involved. You jerk!

811
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:55,990

812
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:02,060
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

813
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:05,220
♫  We are here to wreck it up  ♫

814
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:11,400
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

815
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:19,090
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

816
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:22,390
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

817
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:28,470
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

818
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:31,430
 Again My Life

819
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:34,420
 "When the fight begins, think only about winning."

820
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:37,150
 I need to give a signal to Jo Tae Seop.

821
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:38,500
 You might be in danger.

822
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,790
 Tell him that a rich lady wants to invest in JQ Construction and she's waiting for his call.

823
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:47,350
 Perhaps, that unidentified attacker could be working for you.

824
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:48,960
 Kim Seok Hun is the bait.

825
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,560
 You crossed the line.

826
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:57,030
 I'm the only one who can measure up to Kim Hui Wu.

827
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,100
 I won't go easy on you this time.

828
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,220
♫  nowhere to hide  ♫

829
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,440
 Again My Life
