 Again My Life

6
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,910
 A country can survive a war.

7
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,230
 A country can survive both disease and poverty.

8
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,710
 However, a country without justice can never survive.

 Prosecution Service

00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,050
Prosecutor Oath.

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,610
Prosecutor Oath!

13
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,390
At this moment, I am called by the country and the people

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,640
to be a proud and honorable prosecutor for the Republic of Korea.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,660
As a representative, I will uphold justice and human rights
 Celebration: New Prosecutor Ceremony

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,860
and protect the community and public from crime

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,230
as I am entrusted with this grave duty.

18
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,780
 Episode 1

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,880
What are you doing?

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,420
Prosecutor, you've come.

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,330
You were told to enforce the law, but you're just standing facing them.

22
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,110
Is this Panmunjom? Is this a demilitarized zone?

23
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,340
I see you guys are armed, at least.

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,830
- What are you doing, Captain?
 - We were waiting for a warrant.

25
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,780
I told you their boss would try to escape as a stowaway and that it was urgent!

26
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,740
I told you to arrest without a warrant.

27
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,520
You know that we're 21st-century policemen who have to follow procedure! Why are you being like this?

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,200
If two or more able-bodied men, regardless of field-work,

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,630
have equipment in their hands that can be used as blunt instruments and confront a public official for more than three minutes,

30
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,580
it can be regarded as the formation and participation of criminal organizations,

31
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,800
even those who engage in simple activities

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,070
will be sentenced to a minimum of two years in prison or fined a minimum of 50 million won.

33
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,570
Hey, give me that.

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,660
I told you it's  a minimum   50 million won fine.

35
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,270
Hey.

36
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm sure you've heard of a maximum fine,

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,560
but a minimum fine is all new to you, no?

38
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,180
- Yeah.
  - Right.

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,340
Not fair, is it?

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,560
 - Ah, you scared me!

41
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,690
Damn, it split open.

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,830
- Ah, what are you doing? South Korea's prosecutor's head was just split open!

43
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,760
He's a freaking lunatic.

44
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,320
Now, on the count of three, drop your weapons and follow me politely.

45
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,530
One.

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,290
Two.

47
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,860
- Three.
 - What are you guys doing?

48
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,880
Let's go!

49
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,310
 I am a brave prosecutor who removes the darkness from injustice.

50
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,410
 Gyodae Station, Courts, Prosecutors' Office

51
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,260
- Ma’am.
 - Yes?

52
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,820
You're in front of the prosecutor's office. There will be a crackdown in no time.

53
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,290
But I haven't even sold anything yet.

54
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,630
Yes, it's me. Today's lunch is going to be kimbap.

55
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,860
Ma'am, I'll take everything here.

56
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,960
- All these?
- You should get to sell something, at least.

57
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,070
 - Thank you so much!

58
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,800
 A warm-hearted  prosecutor who cares for the powerless and the excluded.

59
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,810
 They're here!

60
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,380
Prosecutor Kim.  There is public opinion that during a protracted economic recession,

61
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,390
an intense investigation into a large corporation can have adverse effects on the economy.

62
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,700
What's your opinion?

63
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,630
The economy is the force that sustains the nation.

64
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,530
There is only one reason the nation is failing economically.

65
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,570
Corruption.

66
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,320
As a person affiliated with the prosecution, believing that the law should be protected,

67
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,840
I only think that it is my duty to eradicate that corruption.

68
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,760
When will the results of the investigation be announced?

69
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,170
Prosecutor, just one more question!

70
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,520
 An impartial prosecutor who pursues the truth only.

71
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,880
There was an instance of that slush fund flowing into political circles.

72
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,450
"Who is responsible?"

73
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,130
If I asked that, I'm sure you would say that you don't know, right?

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,940
It's Jo Tae Seop, isn’t it?

75
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,350
There it is. I expected to see that kind of expression, and I did.

76
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,630
- Are you scared?
 - Isn't there anything you're scared of?

77
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:24,780
Well, coming to work on Mondays always scares me.

78
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,380
Now.

79
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,700
Look, Jo Tae Seop is a criminal.

80
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,460
He's not someone to be scared of but someone you just need to report.

81
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,010
Then I arrest him. Got it?

82
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,430
Speak up! Are you just going to maintain your right to be silent?

83
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,780
In the event of a false accusation,

84
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,850
you could be punished under Act 156.

85
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,000
Do you acknowledge that?

86
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,670
Prosecutor, I received a call from the head of the management strategy department.

87
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,460
 As a prosecutor who is stricter and more honest with himself.

88
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,330
 Kim Hui Wu
 Prosecutor

89
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,930
 Cheonha

90
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,990
I'm trusting you.

91
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,320
I will give my testimony.

92
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,450
 Name: Jo Tae Seop
 Resident Identification Number: 5203

93
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,800
 Prosecution Service

94
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,330
 Warrant

95
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,710
  On my honor I swear firmly

96
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,840
  to serve with all of my might the people

97
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,020
 of the nation for the sake of the country.

98
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,850
- Don't do it.
 - "Don't do it?"

99
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,650
- Yeah, don't do it.
- Why?

100
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,510
There is no one in the entirety of South Korea who thinks Jo Tae Seop is a criminal.
  Kim Seok Hun: Chief Prosecutor of Seoul

101
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,170
Since they're being fooled.

102
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:39,100
I will make sure he gets punished for deceiving the citizens by pretending to be an angel.

103
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,540
Do you think a prosecutor who targets power has a chance to win?

104
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,820
But it's not impossible.

105
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,370
Because of you, people are calling from all over the place.

106
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,820
Good. Give me a list of everyone who's called. I will have them all arrested.

107
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,830
Now I see why they call you a lunatic prosecutor.

108
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,980
I catch bad guys. Who cares if I'm a lunatic?

109
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,100
I am a prosecutor who catches criminals.

110
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,270
 Kim Seok Hun: Chief Prosecutor of Seoul

111
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,700
Do you think that there aren't any other prosecutors who work with the same conviction and confidence as you?

112
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,490
That those prosecutors are keeping things buried because they have no volition or thought?

113
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:26,500
Conviction is only good when you can beat your opponent.

114
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,460
Prepare well and use that conviction when you know you can win.

115
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,480
Do you think I'm not prepared enough?

116
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,260
Don't think that you are well-prepared because you're wrong.

117
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,670
 Kim Seok-Hoon: Chief Prosecutor of Seoul

118
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,700
The village that you are trying to touch has its own order.

119
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,720
When you're trying to get to its center, where would you tread?

120
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,000
Obviously, you'd step on the village grounds to get in,

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,720
thereby upending their order.

122
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,380
Then, instinctively, the villagers will join forces and grow power.

123
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,760
At that point, it is no longer a fight between two individuals.

124
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,570
Who said that the people in that village could live without any rules?

125
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,950
- Perhaps, do you live in that village?
 - Hey, Kim Hui Wu.

126
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,750
Why did you meet with Jo Tae Seop yesterday?

127
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,560
- You're even tailing me now?
 - I tail criminals, and our paths overlapped.

128
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,860
Thanks to an unrealistic subordinate,

129
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,230
I had to have dinner, which didn't suit my taste, and do my job. Happy now?

130
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,120
I would like to believe you, sir.

131
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,930
No matter what I say, you wouldn't get it right now.

132
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,230
There's no right time for filtering out bad advice.

133
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,130
You may leave.

134
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,890
Yes, sir.

135
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,220
Assemblyman, sir, it's me.

136
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,720
I think you'll have to prepare yourself for what's to come.

137
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,540
 Kim Seok Hun: Chief Prosecutor of Seoul

138
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,600
 Can anyone stop Jo Tae Seop's skyrocketing presidential candidate approval rating?

139
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,790
  Expected to secure over 68% of votes

140
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,300
You have no idea what kind of person Jo Tae Seop is yet.

141
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,110
You're all so frustrating.

142
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,500
Do you really think this matter deserves a meeting?

143
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,310
From Assemblyman Yun as well,
  Democratic Party

144
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,110
people are opposing.

145
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,020
- He's a seven-term assemblyman and father-in-law of the President. Expulsion is too—
 - Look!

146
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,250
"President's Father-in-law, Assemblyman Yun Yeong Hun, is bashed with criticism for only protecting his family."

147
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,220
"He criticizes the aid who was sexually assaulted by Assemblyman Gu Wuk Cheong."

148
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,340
In this world where women are getting wiser.

149
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,460
What's good is serving seven terms when he speaks like someone who's been newly elected?!

150
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,870
Everyone seems to be at ease since the general election is already won.

151
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,770
But it's hard for politicians with no sensitivity to gender-related issues to survive.

152
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,810
In the future, pay some attention to what the opinions of the youth and future voters are!

153
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,660
Expel Assemblyman Yun right away. I'll take responsibility.

154
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,000
 Cheong Wa Dae "Blue House" – Home and Office of President of Republic of Korea

155
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,010
They're waiting for you.

156
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,300
Oh, hold on.

157
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,820
It's not a meeting you can sit in, Chief of Staff.

158
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,900
 Heo Jae Geun, President

159
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,940
- You!
 - Assemblyman Jo!

160
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,700
Assemblyman Jo?

161
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,220
Do you think you can look down on the world now that you're in that seat?

162
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,550
"Expulsion of Assemblyman Yun excessive."

163
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,810
"Come in for a sec"?

164
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,080
I got you elected as President so you can serve the country,

165
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,590
but you're sitting here only worried about your father-in-law.

166
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,690
Why are you fussing over your in-laws while sitting in the Blue House?!

167
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,930
  Would 300 billion won (~300 million USD) be enough?

168
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,820
 You can't win the presidential election with just 56 billion won.

169
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,040
 I'll give you 100 billion won (~100 million USD) today and 200 billion won in a week.
 Presidential Candidate Heo Jae Geun

170
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,930
 They say you can forget your enemies, but you should always return favors.

171
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,720
 What can I do for you?

172
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,630
 I'm not greedy.

173
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,070
 Just become President and take care of Korea.

174
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:25,580
 All I care about is to have one of my people become President.

175
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,280
 Since I felt it wouldn't look good for a presidential candidate,

176
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,070
 I sent her to America.

177
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,480
 She won't be able to return to the country for five years.

178
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,080
 Do you know why I am called the kingmaker?

179
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,190
 Or why the candidate I choose wins the presidential election?

180
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,040
 It's because passing my verification process is

181
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:02,310
 10 to 20 times harder than one carried out by the party.

182
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,520
Your mistress in LA

183
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,270
is huffing and puffing because she's still angry.

184
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,150
Should I go there myself and remove her gag so she can speak?

185
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,140
That's right.

186
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:27,530
Think of it as a dual executive system for the rest of your term and visit other countries.

187
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,440
Go to the military bases and take some pictures with soldiers while shoveling.

188
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,210
I'll take care of the rest.

189
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,790
From now on, this is how we administer the affairs of the state.

190
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,130
This country has me, Jo Tae Seop, and the president.

191
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,240
Do you understand?

192
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,760
  The Prosecutor's Office just summoned the assemblyman. Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun

193
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,170
What is it?

194
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,200
I just received word that you have been summoned by the prosecution.

195
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,580
Okay.

196
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,790
I'll finally get to meet him.

197
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,500
Let's go get something to eat first. I know a great rice and side dish place in Seochodong.

198
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,480
- Do you like spicy food?
 - Yes.

199
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,280
 Prosecutor's Office

200
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,400
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

201
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,790
Sir! Sir!

202
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,400
Do you acknowledge the charges of violations of the Aggravated Punishment for Specific Crimes Act brought against you by the prosecution?

203
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,990
We only acknowledge something when it's true.

204
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,120
The allegations brought forth by the prosecution have absolutely nothing to do with me.

205
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,850
I'm just very sad to have caused concern to the people

206
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:25,610
who have believed and supported me for a long time.

207
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:29,440
Some are saying that this is the prosecution's way of doing away with the presidential candidate.

208
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,480
Please hold your judgment until the results are released.

209
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,250
 When will those results be released?

210
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,140
  Kim Seok Hun

211
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:52,980
It feels different being back here after all this time.

212
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,810
- Maybe because I'm here as a suspect.
 - I apologize.

213
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,960
No, no. You did your job.

214
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,450
The prosecution office had a lot of concerns about it as well.

215
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,480
It's something that I had to go through at least once.

216
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,460
I think of it as a vaccination.

217
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,100
It's nice that I don't have to bother my people and can have someone else take care of it.

218
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,190
But, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu isn't an easy person to deal with.

219
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,110
That's how he should be.

220
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,990
I didn't come here to see someone who only lives a day, did I?

221
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,390
I should go. Thanks for the coffee.

222
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,410
So this is how we meet, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

223
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,570
It's nice to meet you.

224
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,430
I don't think that's how a suspect should greet a prosecutor.

225
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,650
I'm sure you wanted to meet me as well.

226
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:34,340
That's true, but I'm not that glad about it.

227
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,680
- You're full of energy.
 - You're full of ambition.

228
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,270
You're funny too.

229
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,720
- Mister.
 - Mister?

230
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,080
This is a prosecution investigation room,

231
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,180
and you're a suspect.

232
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:01,930
You're only Jo Tae Seop when you're outside. Are we outside right now?

233
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,260
I see.

234
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,120
I brought that powerful Jo Tae Seop in here

235
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,160
to show what garbage he really is.

236
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,130
Why?

237
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,660
Because it's true that you're the trash of all trash.

238
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,750
And even more importantly,

239
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,160
if your usual tactics of putting your all into tearing me down were going to work on me,

240
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,420
I wouldn't have brought you here in the first place.

241
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,310
No, I wouldn't have been able to bring you here.

242
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:34,820
And even if I did bring you here, I wouldn't have been able to call you trash to your face.

243
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,950
I would have taken your order of Americano,

244
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,200
and asked if I should add syrup to your coffee.

245
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,370
I would have asked you about things like that.

246
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:47,350
But, did I ask you how you wanted your coffee today?

247
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,690
Do you not understand the situation?

248
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,880
I think I understand the situation.

249
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,820
If we're clear now, you should sit up and stop being at ease.

250
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:06,270
I don't know what you've misunderstood, but nothing I do is about personal gain.

251
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,570
- Only for the people—
 - I'll start the questioning.

252
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,590
You seem to have a lot to say.

253
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,660
I'm looking forward to what you have up your sleeve.

254
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,950
The higher the expectation, the higher the disappointment, so make sure to do your job well.

255
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,990
It seems like you still don't get it.

256
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,660
Hui Wu.

257
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,460
Hui Wu?

258
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,460
Have you thought about what purpose justice without true power serves?

259
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,120
It's not that you people are ignorant because you are civil servants but you became civil servants because you're ignorant.

260
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,910
You still don't understand that because you're ignorant. Idiots...

261
00:21:54,350 --> 00:22:00,430
About justice... the justice that looks pretty cool when you see it in movies,

262
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,710
it's not something you can have just because you want it.

263
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:08,190
It's not you but it's justice that chooses the person.

264
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,870
Do you know the word naive? What you have right now is not justice.

265
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,180
It's naivety that is firmly based on stupidity.

266
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:26,510
If you want to break me, you have to break the system that was structured for me first.

267
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,660
Do you think you're here to give a seminar?

268
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,120
You're not here on an invitation.

269
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,730
Okay. Fine.

270
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:42,470
I'll break that system down piece by piece from now on.

271
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:48,060
Prosecutor Kim, you have secured a witness, right?

272
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,030
A witness only starts to show their value when they stand in court.

273
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:56,030
But if they can't do that...

274
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,380
Room service.

275
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,370
Speaking of which, wasn't it too easy?

276
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,510
Getting to see me.

277
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,470
I wanted to see

278
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,240
who the prosecutor was that brought me all the way here.

279
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:43,060
Don't you want to use that get-up-and-go spirit somewhere a little more valuable?

280
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,420
Sir...

281
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,350
 I can't contact the Cheonha Group's strategy department head who was staying at the hotel.

282
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,440
 Cheonha Head of Strategy Department

283
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,400
 Text Message: Please save me.

284
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,580
 I-I'm so sorry.

285
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:49,260
  I-I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry!

286
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,160
Bastards...!

287
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,550
 Information got leaked. Jo Tae Seop already knew about our plans.

288
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,290
 We're keeping safe the person you're looking for.

289
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,840
  Prosecutor's Office

290
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,070
The interrogation with the prosecutor ended earlier than expected. How did it go?

291
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,350
I did my best to participate in the investigation.

292
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,840
The judgment is up to the court.

293
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:36,710
This restaurant is famous for its stir-fried octopus.

294
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:41,640
It's different from what they have in Yeouido. It's very spicy.

295
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,610
Yes.

296
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:04,690
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu just got there. Should we get rid of them both?

297
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,550
No need to get rid of a dog that has tucked its tail.

298
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,950
- Surprised?
 - A little.

299
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,700
I'm different from other weak prosecutors.

300
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,300
I'm also different from other neighborhood gangsters.

301
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,390
Okay, let's cut to the chase.

302
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,110
Come on then.

303
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,600
If you say you will stop here, I'll spare your life.

304
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,470
How can you trust me?

305
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:39,710
It doesn't matter. I'm not afraid of a dog that's tucked its tail.

306
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,710
Too bad.

307
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,700
I don't want to be a dog that's surrendered.

308
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,790
This is your last chance. Beg for your life.

309
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,220
Please spare me.

310
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:02,090
So I can wipe you guys out completely.

311
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,630
You need to die.

312
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,410
That's what you think.

313
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:50,750
You instigated and attempted murder. You have the right to an attorney.

314
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,850
You have the right to remain silent, and anything you say

315
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,110
can be used against you in court.

316
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,060
Your arm might break.

317
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:11,100
I've carried out my orders. I'll finish him off as instructed.

318
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,180
He says he'll finish him off.

319
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:24,150
You brewed it very clean and nice. Since I drank some good tea,

320
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:29,020
I'll sleep well tonight. Thank you.

321
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,660
It's a mixture of alcohol and meth.

322
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,980
Tomorrow morning, people will find out a corrupted prosecutor

323
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:54,430
killed himself by drinking and overdosing.

324
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:33,080
 The Zenith

325
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,080
I'm dead, right?

326
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,690
Yes.

327
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,570
But why does it hurt?

328
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,610
The parts where I got hit before I died hurt really bad.

329
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,700
Who said it wouldn't hurt when you die?

330
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,450
I thought that was how it worked.

331
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,310
It's misinformation.

332
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,530
You're killing me twice.

333
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,130
That was a joke.

334
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,220
If you go up to the afterworld, it won't hurt.

335
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,140
Why would you make that kind of joke to a dead person?

336
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,220
Until you feel better, I'll do my work.

337
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,000
You are such an odd person.

338
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,410
I'm not a person.

339
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:32,330
Let's skim through your life for a second.

340
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,810
  Move quickly!

341
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,980
  The next station is the crotch.

342
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,870
  Crotch.

343
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,010
  What did you say? This bastard.

344
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,660
  Stop it.

345
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,570
  Are you crazy?

346
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,050
  Why are you misbehaving?

347
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,990
  Are you out of your mind?

348
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,320
  Are you crazy? Look down!

349
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,550
  This is a crazy bastard.

350
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:03,900
Kim Hui Wu. You got beaten up throughout your life.

351
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,470
Usually, people who have justice

352
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,530
but don't have power get beaten up a bit.

353
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,200
Your parents passed away in a hit-and-run accident.

354
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,990
Then...

355
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,530
will I be able to see my parents now?

356
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,020
You did martial arts, too.

357
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,350
I decided to be strong.

358
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,180
  Wear this.

359
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:01,400
I decided to do it to survive and protect myself.

360
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,430
  Yes! There you go!

361
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:41,890
Accepted to the Department of Law at Hankook University after three attempts.

362
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
  The General Provisions of the Civil Code

363
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,040
  The 2nd room for the 57th Bar Exam's first test

364
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,060
  Lecture room 317

365
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,860
 You passed the bar exam and became a prosecutor.

366
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,800
 And then...

367
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,380
 About justice... the justice that looks pretty cool when you see it in movies,

368
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,660
 it's not something you can have just because you want it.

369
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,080
  It's not you

370
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,590
  but justice which chooses the person.

371
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:20,340
Did you provoke Jo Tae Seop?

372
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,450
What do you mean provoke? I'm a prosecutor.

373
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,650
Jo Tae Seop is just a dirty criminal. Never mind provoke,

374
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,080
my job is to lock him up in jail even if I have to beat him up!

375
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,090
But you failed and got murdered.

376
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:37,230
Maybe it's because you had justice but no power.

377
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:42,280
You didn't even get to show your strength and got killed.

378
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,860
I'll acknowledge that since this was the end result.

379
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:52,640
If you had survived this fight, would you have put Jo Tae Seop in jail?

380
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,640
Would he have been brought to justice?

381
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,830
I'm not sure.

382
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:05,140
If you had another life, would you use it to put Jo Tae Seop in jail?

383
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,450
It's a job I put my life on the line for.

384
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:12,990
It was predetermined and something I have to do.

385
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,970
Do that then.

386
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:23,860
Take time to prepare and finish him off properly.

387
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:29,030
If you move hastily, you could face a useless death again.

388
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,690
I'm telling you I'll spare your life.

389
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,460
- What?
 - Make sure you bring him down.

390
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,820
Punishment in the afterworld is too late.

391
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:43,410
Please show him that there's a living hell in this world.

392
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:45,110
Promise me.

393
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:49,540
Can you show him a living hell?

394
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,700
I'll show him.

395
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:01,620
When you get closer to Jo Tae Seop, you might see me again.

396
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,300
Don't forget.

397
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:12,360
You cannot catch the devil unless you are a bigger monster.

398
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,930
Please get it done.

399
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:23,900
Make sure you succeed.

400
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,350
Hey.

401
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,370
Hey.

402
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,580
Hey!

403
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,580
What are you doing?

404
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,590
Are you not going to ring me up?

405
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,030
Why are you staring at me?

406
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,160
Kim Han Mi?

407
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,540
Yeah, I'm Kim Han Mi.

408
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,000
  This is the convenience store where I worked after graduating from high school.

409
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,880
  But what am I doing here right now?

410
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,390
  Punishment in the afterworld is too late.

411
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,100
  Please show him that there's a living hell in this world.

412
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,880
Hey!

413
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,380
  A Convenience Store Devoted to You
 Part-timer: Kim Hui Wu

414
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,820
How did this happen?

415
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,420
  I'm telling you I'll spare your life.

416
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:47,420
Did I really come back to life?

417
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:02,800
  Again My Life

418
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,520
 Take time to prepare and finish him off properly.

419
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:16,420
  If you move hastily, you could face a useless death again.

420
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,930
Did she really send me back to my past?

421
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,860
If this is real...

422
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,190
  I have to go home.

423
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,680
It's here. The house I used to live in.

424
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,380
  Kim Chan Seong

425
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,660
  I was an immature son.

426
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,960
  Did you eat?

427
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,560
  That temper...

428
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,030
  We'll be back from work!

429
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,200
  I made you breakfast, so don't forget to eat!

430
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,450
  Let's go. Let's just go.

431
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,110
  That was the last time with my parents.

432
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:52,920
  Pushed to survive, my parents couldn't take good care of me.

433
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,450
  And I ignored and resented them.

434
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,570
  That's why

435
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:03,160
  I wanted my parents to see the untouched food on the table

436
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,830
  when they came home and feel heartbroken.

437
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,170
  Hello?

438
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,090
 What's going on?

439
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,630
  Kim Chan Seong
 Lee Mi Ok

440
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,720
 That's how my parents died

441
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,950
 and left behind a son filled with resentment and anxiety.

442
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:58,210
  I was hungry.

443
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,400
  Son,

444
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,390
  I'm sorry that I was so busy that I couldn't make you anything delicious.

445
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:13,460
 There's some bulgogi in the fridge, so warm it up and eat it with this.

446
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:23,100
  The last meal cooked by my mom

447
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,020
  I was desperate

448
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,120
 because I never had the chance

449
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:21,350
  to make up for my mistakes.

450
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,540
  But if I've come back to this time,

451
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,920
 it might be before my parents died.

452
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,220
 Please.

453
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:59,020
  I hope that the heavens have given me this once in a lifetime chance.

454
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,800
Mom!

455
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,830
Father.

456
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,380
Mom!

457
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:13,070
Hui Wu? Are you already done with your part-time job?

458
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,660
M-Mom.

459
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,680
Mom.

460
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,520
Mom?

461
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,570
What's wrong with you all of the sudden?

462
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,830
Is something wrong?

463
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:50,980
What's with all the hugging? Did something happen?

464
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,550
Father.

465
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:58,110
Why are you doing this to me, too? It feels awkward.

466
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,000
It's burdensome.

467
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,550
I'm back!

468
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,350
Obviously.

469
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:20,980
Hey. Are you going to keep making it awkward?

470
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:33,140
 I didn't believe it, but I came back to life.

471
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,810
  I thought that law and justice were enough,

472
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,120
 but I was ambitious and arrogant.

473
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:44,460
 Take time to prepare and finish him off properly.

474
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,590
She wants me to start preparing from now.

475
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:52,350

  May 18th

478
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,700
 Good Student

479
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,340
Come on, brat...

480
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,410
Are you asleep?

481
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:13,350
No!

482
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:17,230
Your father and I going out to do a job.

483
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,450
Mom, wait a moment.

484
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:24,390
I'll open it for you.

485
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:27,350
Why do you keep being weird and doing things you wouldn't normally do?

486
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:33,880
Be safe. Drive safely since it's dark.

487
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,410
Hui Wu. Why are being like this?

488
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,200
What?

489
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,340
Son ...

490
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,740
Are you angry?

491
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,110
I don't know what happened, but I'm sorry.

492
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:46,060
What do you mean angry? I'm just seeing you off.

493
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:50,170
You always rebel against us.

494
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,910
But since earlier, you've felt a little different.

495
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,920
By any chance, are you going to join a temple?

496
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,060
It's nothing like that.

497
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,700
What is this about seeing us off?

498
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,610
Come here.

499
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,570
He's doing it again.

500
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:10,220
What exactly did we do so wrong?

501
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:15,540
If you're not angry, are you sick?

502
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,130
Yes. I'm sick.

503
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,880
I'm sick since I'm so happy.

504
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,050
Why do you keep hugging us? He must have lost his mind.

505
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:28,860
This isn't our son, is it?

506
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,540
I'm not dreaming.

507
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,550
And it does look like him. Is it a mask?

508
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:35,980
I am your son.

509
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,380
Let's go.

510
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,430
Go ahead.

511
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,630
Be safe.

512
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:42,550
Can we leave our house to that stranger?

513
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,630
Who are you?

514
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,460
 I'm not sure if what is happening right now is a dream or reality.

515
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,880
If it's the past or the future.

516
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,510
 Everything is still confusing, but I'm sure about one thing.

00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,400
With these scores, you should go to the most basic class.

549
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,970
That's true.

550

 Kim Hui Wu

553
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,400
He must be new.

554
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,070
Look who it is!

555
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,980
Why? You want to study for college?

556
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:18,280
It's not for working at the convenience store.

557
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,960
You're all done with that, huh?

558
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,540
You've matured a lot, Kim Hui Wu.

559
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,130
Aren't you embarrassed?

560
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,680
- What?
 - If you graduated from school, stop acting like a punk.

561
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,860
Study.

562
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,650
 It's math.

563
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,690
  It'll take some time for me to get in the groove.

564
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:40,920
Just memorize it all?

565
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,140
Yes. Just memorize all of the ways of problem-solving.

566
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,900
If I memorize it, do you think I can be good at math?

567
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,410
Of course, why? you don't believe it?

568
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:51,490
No. It's not that.

569
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,460
I haven't studied math in a long time.

570
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,280
How long has it been?

571
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,860
I think... maybe 17 years?

572
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:05,060
No.

573
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,750
It's because I'm worried.

574
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,160
You can do it.

575
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:17,690
This book shows problem-solving methods very well. So study this and memorize it.

576
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:20,010
Okay.

577
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:21,900
Thank you.

578
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,430
Can I have some expectations of you?

579
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:28,860
Yes. Definitely.

580
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,140
This is shout without a sound.

581
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,240
This expression includes metaphor and paradox.

582
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,980
Because shout without a sound doesn't make any sense.

583
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,550
That's why it's a paradox. And "this" and "shout" are equal, so it's a metaphor.

584
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:45,830
Mang and Mangsoi's uprising happened in Myeonghak-so, Gongju.

585
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:50,690
Please memorize this well.

586
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:53,820
You have to do it as K divided by N.

587
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:56,350
But what should you divide this with?

588
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:59,150
- With 3n.
 - That's right!

589
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,820
Mom. Father!

590
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,680
Hui Wu.

591
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,180
Mom!

592
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,000
What is it?

593
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:59,700
I am sorry. I didn't sleep well yesterday night.

594
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:06,880
So the word that precedes the prepositions and the relative pronouns

595
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,010
means the place.

596
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:09,620
 It's tomorrow.

597
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:12,860
The night when my parents died in a hit-and-run accident.

598

  Traffic situation surveillance camera

600
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,950
Is there any way I can make my parents take a day off?

601
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,870
That's the easiest way to do it.

602
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,620
  May 18th

603
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,600
Hui Wu, let's eat.

604
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,390
Yes.

605
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:55,800
Honey, have this kimchi. It's perfectly ripe now.

606
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:01,040
 This could end up being our last dinner.

607
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,040
Oh no, Hui Wu, you lost weight.

608
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,740
Aren't you studying too hard?

609
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:10,190
No. I'm working out too, so don't worry.

610
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:14,890
Good. Becoming the top of the class is nice, but I like that you're doing something diligently more.

611
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:17,050
Our family just lived off of our looks generationally.

612
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:20,130
So seeing how you're working so hard on something, it's nice to see.

613
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,030
Go, go!

614
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:23,270
Don't push him too hard. He'll ruin his health!

615
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:27,260
Hui Wu, I don't care as long as you're healthy.

616
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,420
- So—
 - She's lying.

617
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:32,660
She's bragging so much at the factory that you are studying hard.

618
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,710
Of course, I should brag!

619
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,430
You're my son, after all.

620
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:39,090
- Right?
 - Whose son? He's my son.

621
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:43,160
We look alike. We look exactly the same.

622
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:52,460
Mom, can you not go to work today?

623
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,760
Why? What's the matter?

624
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,130
You said you had some aches and pains.

625
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:59,550
I thought it might be nice for you to take a day off.

626
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:03,750
You can't take off because you're aching. It's a blessing to have jobs in this bad economy.

627
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:07,050
That's right. At times like these,

628
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:09,570
we need to work harder and more diligently.

629
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:14,050
I'm not going to my part-time work today. Why don't we go out—

630
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:16,850
You can take a break, but we should work.

631
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:19,290
- There's no time to take a break for us.
 - Yes.

632
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:21,310
- Why don't you eat some more?
 - Okay.

633
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:25,810
  Right. My parents are not people who would take off from their work.

634
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:29,180
  I shouldn't make them feel uncomfortable.

635
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:33,650
  I'll just wait in front of the factory and escort them back home.

636
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,820
  It's a typically poor investigation.

637
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,050
  There might not be any surveillance cameras,

638
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:08,450
  but there would have been skid marks and car debris.

639
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:13,510
  If they looked into car bumper repair histories, they could've found suspected cars.

640
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:18,420
  They didn't even do this basic investigation. Why?

641
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:30,770
 Wasn't the time of the accident also manipulated?

642
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:36,830
  If that's the correct time, then my parents should've been working the night shift.

643
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:40,190
  May 18th, 2007, 03:38 AM, Presumed time of the death by hit-and-run

644
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,110
 Snow Removal Tool Box

645
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:50,150
 Snow Removal Tool Box

646
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:53,900
 Snow Removal Tool Box

647
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:03,060
  I should let my parents walk along the street on the inside, and I'll walk on the outside.

648
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,610
 That way I'll be ready for the accident.

649
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:14,220
Mom, Mom!

650
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,320
Hui Wu, why are you here?

651
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,050
I missed you, so I came.

652
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:23,240
I mean, I couldn't sleep, so I came out for a walk.

653
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,590
You don't know when we will finish. Why did you come?

654
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:29,480
What brought you here? The machine stopped somehow, so we came out early.

655
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,380
It's cold at night. You might have waited for us for a long time, Hui Wu.

656
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:37,690
  Because of the machine breakdown, they got off from work earlier.

657
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:40,910
  Now the mystery of the time of death got resolved.

658
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:48,290
It's too cramped.

659
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:52,220
Don't come out from now on. You have to go to class in the morning, so you should be in bed.

660
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:55,320
But it's good to see my son.

661
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,500
Maybe we had telepathy.

662
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,170
How can we run into each other at the exact time? Right?

663
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:02,390
Right.

664
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:06,270
Don't walk around in the middle of the night without fear, even if you are a guy.

665
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,930
Right, listen to your dad.

666
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:12,600
Do you know how fast the cars go around here?

667
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,140
Yes.

668
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,340
 It's coming.

669
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,850
What's wrong?

670
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,510
What is that?

671
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,070
Pardon?

672
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,690
That...

673
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,220
Get out of the way!

674
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,610
No!

675
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:09,990

676
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,980
Mom.

677
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:21,670
Father.

678
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:27,390
  Am I going to end up alone again?

679
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:31,490
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

680
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:35,040
♫   We are here to wreck it up   ♫

681
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:40,650
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

682
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:48,410
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

683
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:51,830
♫  We are here to find the truth   ♫

684
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:57,740
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

685
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,370
♫  Who would ever   ♫

686
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:04,000
 Again My Life
♫  find out who you really are?  ♫

687
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,580
  Time is moving along as I remember.

688
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:13,550
  The time of fate that I have to prevent is approaching as well.

689
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:17,820
  Manners maketh man.

690
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,930
  Since you did it on your own, I bet you dealt with it well.

691
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:24,460
  We had been entangled in a dirty karmic bond for a long time.

692
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,150
  You are not suited for this kind of place.

693
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:28,540
  Kim Hui Wu? I'm Kim Hui Ah.

694
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:34,100
  This is a person I didn't know from my previous life. Fate has changed.

695
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:36,500
♫  Oh I'll wait for now  ♫

696
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,260
  Again My Life
