00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,930

00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,110
 Lee Joon Gi

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,880
 Lee Kyung Young

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,530
 Kim Ji Eun

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,740
 Again My Life

6
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,920
 Episode 6

7
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,600
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,620
 Prosecutor

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,870
 Someone is here to see you.

10
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,140
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu?

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,610
 Yes, sir.

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,070
 I'm Jeon Seok Gyu from the Gimsan Branch.

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,230
 Oh, nice to meet you.

14
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,890
 Please have a seat.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,160
 You must be curious why I'm here to see you without advance notice.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,980
 Yes.

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,440
 Ah! I heard a lot about your achievements during your time here.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,090
 That was a long time ago.

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,340
 On that subject, I've heard a lot about you, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,370
 Everyone says you're even more persistent than I am.

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,640
They may not show it, but many of your colleagues are rooting for you.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,450
 Is that so?

23
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,080
 I brought you what I've compiled while working in the branch offices.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,230
 I hope you find them helpful.

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,970
 "Helpful"?

26
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,910
 Investigating their corrupt deeds will lead you to the big shot behind them.

27
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,070
 I'll leave,  then.

28
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,760
 Let's

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,360
 skip the unnecessary formalities.

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,770
 Yes then, farewell.

31
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,770
 Gimsan City
 Human Trafficking and Drug Cartel

32
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,070
 Breakdown of Jo Tae Seop-related Personnel Corruption

33
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,870
 This lists all the corrupt deeds committed by Jo Tae Seop's minions.

34
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,680
 How many years did it take him to compile this?

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,600
 Don't say.  Is he also after Jo Tae Seop?

36
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,920
Chief Jeon!

37
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,940
Chief Jeon!

38
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,900
Wait!

39
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,750
Thank you.

40
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,510
The information you gave me will be put to good use.

41
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,600
I'm going to quit being a prosecutor.

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,940
Prosecutor Kim, I truly hope you achieve your goal.

43
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,190
 You won't get a second chance. If you can't succeed on your first try,

44
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,060
  you will fall hard,

45
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,130
 like me.

46
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,900
 Again My Life

47
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,900
Don't do this again.

48
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,480
Nothing is more important than your life.

49
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,770
Yes, sir.

50
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,690
So... let's hear if you had a plan before causing this ruckus.

51
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,730
The most they'd get for starting an illegal casino is five years.

52
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,600
Once they have a puppet CEO, the case is closed.

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,390
Sure, if it were like any other gambling den.

54
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,900
What do you mean?

55
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,030
It's already spilled milk. So please leave it to me.

56
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,190
There's no way they're only engaging in this kind of business.

57
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,880
If you stomp around too hard, it'll probably leave footprints.

58
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,260
Do you think only the pure-hearted will follow them?

59
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,670
Don't put your life on the line. Do you understand?

60
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,240
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,570
- Bring them in.
 - Yes, sir.

62
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,590
Let's go. Come on.

63
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,870
Come on.

64
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,640
Do Chang Su.

65
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Yes?

66
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,660
Your daughter's name is Do Hwa Jin, right?

67
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,590
Yes.

68
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,300
The dad accrued gambling debt and to pay it off, he sold his daughter.

69
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,760
 My dad got into debt because of gambling.

70
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,030
 And he sold me to pay it off.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,400
 Well, he didn't actually sell me. He put me up as collateral.

72
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,880
 My dad continued to gamble at that casino, even though I was stuck there as collateral.

73
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,750
 Do you know why I'm not trying to stop him?

74
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,780
 There's no hope. No hope.

75
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,860
 Even if he sold all of his organs.

76
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,010
 he'd just break even on the interest.

77
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,410
 But beyond that, well...

78
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,200
 But who knows?

79
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,160
 If my dad wins a big sum...

80
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,370
 A really big sum.

81
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,040
 Then he might cook... some soybean paste stew for me like the old days.

82
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,180
 Dad is a lousy gambler,

83
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,220
 but he's a great cook.

84
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,560
Cut off my wrists, please.

85
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,260
Then wouldn't I quit?

86
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,100
Please cut them off!

87
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,150
I heard you used to own a restaurant.

88
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,380
I also heard you were a good cook.

89
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,890
Use those hands to make some warm soybean paste stew

90
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,760
- and have a hearty meal with your daughter.
 - Sorry?

91
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,010
If you gamble but can maintain your daily life, you're not considered an addict.

92
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:13,470
Start by regaining control of your normal life.

93
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,160
We'll help you with the rest.

94
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,640
But... but the amount of debt I've accrued—

95
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,800
Gambling debts are not legally enforceable.

96
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,760
And the Yuchae Faction will be disbanded soon anyway.

97
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,140
Luckily, you're a first-time offender,

98
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,150
so you'll probably be released on probation.

99
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,340
- Let's give this a shot.
 - Thank you!

100
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,430
I'll give it a shot!

101
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,920
Thank you.

102
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,410
Thank you. Thank you.

103
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,060
Thank you so much.

104
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,000
My goodness. All this money moved through a small-town casino?

105
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,930
It's unbelievable.

106
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,830
- How's it going? Have you found out anything?
  - Yes, sir.

107
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,220
- Prosecutor,  we've got a problem here.
 - What is it?

108
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,100
On paper, the money was sent to their own incorporated business, so we can't—

109
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,700
Hold on. Hyeong.

110
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,040
This must be it.

111
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,080
Take a look at this.

112
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,220
This was sent to Daemin as an investment,

113
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,030
but it was actually sent to Jangmi for their operating expenses.

114
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,660
Here, it says this money was invested in Yurim Corp, but it was actually sent to Mokran.

115
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,110
- The same amount, 20 million KRW.
  - This is it.

116
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,680
Yes, that's right.

117
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,850
The two ledgers that Yuchae Faction hid.

118
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,760
Well done.

119
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,590
Investigator Oh, please get this organized while I interrogate them.

120
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,700
And let's haul in their boss, Moon Gu Jun, first thing in the morning.

121
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,400
Yes, sir.

122
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,970
- And as for you. I need you to go to Seoul now.
 - Got it.

123
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,330
What? At this moment? But I pulled an all-nighter.

124
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,960
Oh, sure.  Investigator Oh, did you prepare the thing I requested earlier?

125
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,500
Oh, right, yes. Here it is.

126
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,170
Go to Seoul now, deliver this to the addressed person, and then you can go home and sleep all you want.

127
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,710
- "Reporter Kim Han Mi"?
 - Yes.

128
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,700
Tell her I sent you, and she'll know what it's about.

129
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,130
Goodness. We don't have time. Get moving.

130
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,900
- Wake up. Hurry up.
 - Gosh.

131
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,070
 Gangwon District Prosecutors' Office

132
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,370
Now, all of you rise!

133
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,820
Yes, you will all hurry up and rise.

134
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,300
We will now begin interrogating you one at a time.

135
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,770
Beyond the gambling den incident,

136
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,740
I've pulled out every case for which the statute of limitations hasn't expired.

137
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,020
The longer you are uncooperative with the investigation,

138
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,070
the longer your sentence will grow, to put it bluntly.

139
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,350
What the...

140
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,810
Furthermore, your leader, Mun Gu Jun is going to be arrested,

141
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,550
so if you understand you have nowhere else to turn, your hearts will be at ease.

142
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,130
- Okay?
 - Yes

143
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,380
It's Hyeong-nim, you bastards. He'll be on his way home after a meal.

144
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,610
Don't you have an elder at your residence, Prosecutor?

145
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,620
How dare you talk of an elder's name without even a nim (honorific) after? For shame!

146
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,410
I hope you have some manners when using your tongue.

147
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,560
What's this? Do you lack sense or are you just stupid?

148
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,360
- Investigator Oh.
 - Yes.

149
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,650
this bastard needs no interrogation. Just keep him in for ten years.

150
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,100
If his sentence ends up being short, I'll be sure to fill it.

151
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,940
- Like that bastard the other time?
 - Huh?

152
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,270
Oh, yeah. Like that bastard that time.

153
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,660
Yes, understood.

154
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,660
You. Keep your trap shut.

155
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,010
Excuse me—uh, Prosecutor Sir? Prosecutor Sir!

156
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,170
Quiet.

157
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,520
Sit down.  Sit down.

158
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,400
I get that this is your first time, being a rookie prosecutor, so your passions must've gotten ahead of you.

159
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,320
But even without studying law, we know that we're not going to be sentenced to many years over something like this.

160
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,160
I have nothing to say, so call me a lawyer.

161
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,300
Where are the women?

162
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,250
Women? What are you talking about?

163
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,010
The women who disappeared from the gambling den.

164
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,620
Weird things?

165
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,570
Now that I think of it, the young women who came to the gambling den would often disappear.

166
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:01,440
When I finished work, I noticed traces of their disappearance like their handbags or clothes.

167
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,210
But where their owners went, I have no idea.

168
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,360
Afterward, they didn't retrieve their belongings nor did they reappear.

169
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,270
They said you were the one who kidnapped them.

170
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,980
Wh-Who said so? Kidnapping wasn't my job. That bastard Hyeon Jeong was supposed to take care of all—

171
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,140
Ah, Hyeon Jong did it.

172
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,620
 Defendant Testimony

173
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,460
Hey, Choi Hyeon Jong, what did you do with the kidnapped women?

174
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,070
- What?
 - What do you mean what?

175
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,400
They said that was your job.

176
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,650
Which bastard said that?!

177
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,120
Why? You didn't do it on your own?

178
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,530
Prosecutor, I have arrested Mun Gu Jun

179
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,820
- Yes, understood.
 - Very well then.

180
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,540
Hey, you heard? Your boss is here.

181
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,540
So what? Think about it logically.

182
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:05,220
Do you honestly think your boss would say, "I did all of it. Please release my men"?

183
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:16,390
What. Will you take the entire blame and live in prison for human trafficking, too?

184
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,570
All the other kids will be released from prison on probation.

185
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,850
Excuse me, Prosecutor, I only did as I was ordered.

186
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,810
- Ordered?
 - Yes.

187
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,910
- To kidnap the women.
 - And?

188
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,040
After we kidnap them, we drug them.

189
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,450
Drugs?

190
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,960
- Illegal drugs?
 - Yes

191
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,120
We would inject them. The addicted ones were sold to the brothels.

192
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,190
How many up to this point?

193
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,390
About twenty?

194
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,710
 Cecilia

195
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,020
 Milky Way, Cecilia, Susancho

196
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:28,050
Investigator, please confirm the details  the women who work at the circled brothels

197
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,890
of the woman working at the circled brothels and run drug screens on them.

198
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,370
In particular, see if they have injection sites on their arms.

199
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,350
- All of them?
 - Yes.

200
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,510
Human trafficking and illegal drug trafficking will be added charges

201
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,020
We must find the women who were wrongfully abused and kidnapped.

202
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,830
Understood.

203
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,410
- What about Mun Gu Jun?
 - He's in the interrogation room.

204
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:11,240
Mr. Prosecutor, I haven't had my meal yet.

205
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,760
Give me the menu, please.

206
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,110
Hey, go eat this. You son of a dog.

207
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,750
What. Do you want another?

208
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,880
What kind of criminal bastard says that to a Korean prosecutor? What? You want a menu?

209
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,040
Hey, do you think this is a restaurant to order food from, you little shit?

210
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,660
You clearly can't read the room to save your life.

211
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,170
Even if heaven forgives you, you will get a life sentence. You know?

212
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,450
You.

213
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,720
You.

214
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,820
- I'm going to skin you alive myself—
 - You piece of...

215
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,130
Hey, hey Prosecutor, restrain yourself. Please.

216
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,440
No, no. Restrain yourself. You can do it.

217
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,290
- No, let go of me. Today I will skin this bastard.
 - You can't!

218
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,560
Restrain yourself. First, restrain yourself. You've been called by the regional prosecutor.

219
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,380
- Regional Prosecutor?
 - Yes.

220
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,220
- Why?
 - I'm not sure.

221
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,090
Mr. Prosecutor, it looks like you have a lot to learn. That's how things are.

222
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:40,670
I'll order delivery food here. I'll eat that.

223
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,210
But I'll eat dessert at home.

224
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,490
That's how it is.

225
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,570
- This f*cking little...
 - Prosecutor!

226
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,420
Prosecutor, you mustn't. Restrain yourself.

227
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,020
Prosecutor! Go ahead with your other work.

228
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,580
No, no.

229
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,110
- Investigator.
 - Yes.

230
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,210
This son of a b*tch... doesn't get any kibble today.

231
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,920
Yes.

232
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,740
 Gimsan Regional Prosecutors' Office
 Regional Prosecutor Office

233
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,210
 Chief Jeon, what are you trying to pull?

234
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,860
Please calm down everyone and listen to me first.

235
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,380
Does it look like we can calm down right now?

236
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,730
Come in.

237
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,980
I'm Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

238
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,000
Do you realize what you have done?

239
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,250
Yes, I do.

240
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,540
I did my job as a prosecutor.

241
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,970
Prosecutor Kim.

242
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,690
Sure, you can't know everything from just law school alone.

243
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,400
But that is the nature of law.

244
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,800
Taking one code and applying it equally across different situations,

245
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,260
it's an oxymoron.

246
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,710
It's up to the local leaders to be flexible in how they apply them

247
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,590
according to the circumstances.

248
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,100
We're talking about the local economy here.

249
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,420
Do you think they're only engaged in that kind of business?

250
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,380
Who do you think is supporting the city's economy and creating jobs for people so they can put food on the table?

251
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,030
If you keep this up, the city's economy will collapse.

252
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,690
Prosecutor Kim, take it easy and focus on getting to Seoul.

253
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,180
You're all absolutely right.

254
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,290
Chief Jeon, aren't you going to manage your subordinates better?

255
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,800
About the Yuchae Faction too.

256
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,540
The thugs in this area have been quiet because this region is under the Yuchae Faction's control.

257
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,550
If you round up the kids now, all the riffraff will come back.

258
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,960
Then things will really get out of control!

259
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,780
Furthermore, they say over twenty are injured currently.

260
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,230
If this isn't an overreaching investigation, what else would be?

261
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,060
There was some conflict during the arrest, I know there was no overreach or breach of the law.

262
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,700
And there was just one prosecutor on our side.

263
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,460
Chief Jeon!

264
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,990
You clearly haven't come to your senses yet.

265
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:10,000
Wasn't this why you were thrown out by your in-laws' and ended up in this small branch office in Gimsan?

266
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,720
Chief Jeon.

267
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,840
Stop going on about the law. Get off your high horse so we can all live peacefully.

268
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,760
The law is... a set of rules that the nation has the right to enforce.

269
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,090
Mr. Assemblyman, Mayor, and Chief. If we keep changing it like you're suggesting... then it's not law anymore.

270
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,580
- How dare you lecture us?
 - Goodness.

271
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,520
Goodness.Where did this little loach crawl from?

272
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,860
You're dirtying the waters of our peaceful city!

273
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,340
That's enough, all of you!

274
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,990
What did you just say?!

275
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,250
- Prosecutor Kim.
 - Yes, sir.
- That was uncalled for.

276
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,080
Apologize to them at once.

277
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,030
I apologize.

278
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,630
Look, Chief Jeon.

279
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,690
Let's not complicate things, okay?

280
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,020
Chief Jeon, properly educate your junior prosecutors.

281
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,550
Indeed. We'll quietly let this one go,

282
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,200
so put things back in place at once!

283
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,440
Looks like he got the message.

284
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,510
We should get going.

285
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,280
Okay, let's go.

286
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,180
But what shall we do?

287
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,410
We can't let things quietly go, nor can we put things "back in place."

288
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,710
What do you mean?

289
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,680
A junior of mine who visited me in Gimsan saw what happened in this incident.

290
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,560
So? What about it?

291
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,780
I'm telling you this because...

292
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,390
Oh, look it's time.

293
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,080
I know you're all busy with official business but stay for a moment to watch this.

294
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,440
All right.

295
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,420
 This is QBS with the 6 o'clock news.

296
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,690
 Early this morning in Gimsan, Gangwon Province

297
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,750
 a gang that ran an illegal gambling den were all caught.

298
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,900
 The prosecutors swooped down on the scene in the early morning,

299
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,730
 and arrested 20 gang members.

300
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,560
 The high-ranking officials who had embezzled...

301
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,680
What in the world?

302
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,190
Are you playing games with us?

303
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm sorry.

304
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,820
For those who break the law, there is no compromise.

305
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:32,080
The Yuchae Faction must've thought they wouldn't ever be investigated.

306
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,610
They were kind enough to leave the bribery information and details of deposit and withdrawal

307
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,460
precisely recorded in their computer at the gambling den.

308
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,570
Thanks to that it was easy for us to secure the evidence.

309
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,410
Aren't you curious whose names are on the list...

310
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,740
and for what reason?

311
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,770
The young prosecutors these days aren't like what they used to be.

312
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,610
They just won't listen to the regional prosecutor.

313
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,030
Do you think a few names on that ledger

314
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,710
is enough to lock me up?

315
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,210
Don't you know who's got my back?

316
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,860
As the regional prosecutor, you should know at the very least what happens to those who oppose the living power.

317
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,970
We're prosecutors.

318
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,980
The law will decide that.

319
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,400
Fine. Let's see how you end up.

320
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,690
♫  Even if you fool everyone else with that innocent face  ♫

321
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,020
♫  You can't get away from me.  ♫

322
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,990
♫  Oh Bring it on Bring it on  ♫

323
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,350
♫  Bring it on Oh Yeah  ♫

324
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,140
How do you feel about turning this place upside down when you haven't even been here for half a month?

325
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,490
It is very fun.

326
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,900
Rotten things, must be cut out.

327
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,850
But there's an apt timing to all things.

328
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,100
When did you plan on exposing this incident, Regional Prosecutor?

329
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,910
What?

330
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,750
I had the feeling that you were anticipating this more than I had been.

331
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,220
A prosecutor must only speak with conviction, not mere feelings.

332
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,000
I will remember that, sir.

333
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,480
It'll be hard to expose them with the records on the computer alone.

334
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,150
If we add Moon Gu Jun's confession, it'll be worth trying.

335
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,620
Do you feel confident?

336
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,970
Yes, sir.

337
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,320
Prosecutor, we found clear track marks on the arms of the brothel women.

338
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,220
The drug test results will be available tomorrow.

339
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,930
I've taken care of these so far.

340
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,190
Fine, good job.

341
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,450
If you're done with those, please take care of these too.

342
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,080
 Gimsan City High-ranking Officials Personnel Reception List

343
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,180
Um, I really have to go home today.

344
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,540
Ah! You haven't been able to go home.

345
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,350
Indeed.

346
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,260
Then go home and take care of it tomorrow.

347
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,140
And as for Choi Hyeon Jong and the others that we've investigated, just release them.

348
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,760
You went through that trouble, and want to let them go already?

349
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,240
We can't justify keeping them long here.

350
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,760
We have Moon Gu Jun now, so it's fine.

351
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,120
Right, keep Lee Hyeon Seok too.

352
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,550
Yes, I understand.

353
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,900
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

354
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,190
It's good to see you. It's been so long.

355
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,120
- What brings you here?
 - Oh.

356
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,070
I was actually on my way back after the resort's grand opening.

357
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,570
I guess you're busy these days.

358
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,270
Yes, there are more cases than I expected.

359
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,810
You returned to Korea sooner than I thought.

360
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,550
I came back because of my dad's health.

361
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,030
So are you mostly in the office these days?

362
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,000
Well, I'm just helping out my brother.

363
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,530
What about you?

364
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,810
Why did you come down all the way here?

365
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,840
I heard our legal team scouted you, too.

366
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,350
I just... wanted to see the ocean.

367
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,050
What?

368
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,970
Wow. It's so lame

369
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,990
but cool at the same time.

370
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,470
I know.

371
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,660
I missed you and your lame jokes.

372
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,560
And? I haven't changed, right?

373
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,960
Yes.  And I'm still the one who has to reach out.

374
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,350
I'm always the one who says, "I missed you," and reaches out to you first.

375
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,500
Well, then let's just say I said "I missed you" first.

376
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,300
Aigoo, how fair.

377
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,030
I am a fair person.

378
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,360
I heard you had a new case early this morning. Aren't you busy?

379
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,700
A little.

380
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,160
Okay.

381
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,220
- Then let's get going.
 - Sure.

382
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,020
Kim Hui Wu!

383
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,020
Hey, Kim Han Mi!

384
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,410
I'll be off, then. Call me when you're in Seoul.

385
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,960
Okay, keep in touch. Have a safe trip.

386
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,460
Yes.

387
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,230
- Who is she?
 - Oh.

388
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,030
A classmate from college.

389
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:26,130
She is pretty, but not as pretty as I am.

390
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,210
You didn't see her up close.

391
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,750
- I did.
 - No, you didn't.

392
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,620
Give me one reason she's better than me.

393
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,240
Just one? Is that even possible?

394
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,120
Got a death wish? Stop playing hard and just tell me one reason.

395
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,190
W-Well, she's a woman.

396
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,660
How did you know to come all the way here?

397
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,100
I was planning on sending you the press release myself.

398
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,700
How could I ignore you when this guy came all the way to the broadcast station on your behalf?

399
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,050
- I said I was covering a story here as an excuse.
 -Good job.

400
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,520
Do you pick your friends based on looks?

401
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,020
How can they all be so beautiful?

402
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,570
Should I say that birds of a feather flock together?

403
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,930
I was wrong.

404
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,490
About what?

405
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,350
Anyway, it's nice to see you. I didn't get to say goodbye since I left right after the training institute.

406
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,970
Your charm is that you think you're cool.

407
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,180
- I guess my charm is nothing special then.
 - Yeah.

408
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,790
That's why you should treat your friends better.  It's annoying.

409
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,220
What are you annoyed about?

410
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:33,180
When you look at this face, the annoyance just melts away.

411
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,570
Are the two of you by chance...?

412
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,650
You get along well.

413
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,910
So this is where you were!

414
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,920
Mr. Prosecutor isn't that tough after all.

415
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,550
Yeah, it turns out there's not much to being a prosecutor.

416
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,940
You come here for a drink, right? Go ahead. Drink up.

417
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,050
You know, Mr. Prosecutor

418
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:07,120
Hyeon Jeong was really angry. I heard you scared him and threatened him?

419
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,790
Is that how he felt? I wonder why?

420
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:15,420
Plus, everything you said was a lie.

421
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,680
And you have a well-endowed eonni here too.

422
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,710
Really? Does it look that way?

423
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,070
Where was he looking? Gosh, what a lucky—

424
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,620
- Do you think so too?
 - This is a tough one.

425
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,090
I don't think so.

426
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,680
Do you want to die, you bastard?

427
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,240
Hey, hey. That's enough. Just go. Go and have some raw fish.

428
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,680
Look a shrimp. It looks just like you. Do you want to eat this?

429
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:52,510
Prosecutor, be careful. This neighborhood is pretty small.

430
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,990
And Eonni, about what I said before—

431
00:29:54,990 --> 00:30:00,170
I get it, so shut up you asshole. Before I stab you in the ribs with my chopsticks.

432
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,720
Let's go.

433
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,880
Hurry up.

434
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:18,500
Excuse me, Noonim. The way you talk is exactly my style.

435
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,540
- What about the well-endowed thing?
 - I'm not too sure about that.

436
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,590
They're bigger than you think. But I'm not telling you to imagine them.

437
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,720
Oh, okay.

438
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,160
You should relax a bit. How is it your mouth is still foul after all this time?

439
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,520
What are you talking about? Being a journalist just made it worse.

440
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,840
But it's okay... since I'm well-endowed.

441
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,870
Aww... I don't... think that's true.

442
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,520
Hey! Hey! Why are you so fixated on that?

443
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,600
I don't know! I was doing just fine...

444
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,040
It pisses me off more the more I think about it.

445
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,420
- Hey! Hey! Han Mi!
 - Hey! Look!

446
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,590
- They are pretty big.
 - Yes. You're 100% right.

447
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,470
She still has that temper.

448
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,950
It's cold, isn't it?

449
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,660
How is it being a journalist?

450
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,240
I don't know. The whole day passes by without any time to think about things.

451
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,850
That sounds good.

452
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,370
What about you?

453
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:29,260
It's good. I'm doing what I really wanted to do.

454
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,500
You really never know about people.

455
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,980
I never imagined my life would turn out this way.

456
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,700
Until I met you.

457
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:46,420
No. You would have become a reporter either way.

458
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,100
- Do you think so?
 - Yes.

459
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,900
It was your fate to be a reporter.

460
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,360
Oh, right! How did your dad react?

461
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,760
Well... He lost his mind. After all, I didn't listen and do as he said.

462
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,470
Even so, since I was stubborn about it, he took a step back. Do you know what he said?

463
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,080
He said he would consider it if I went into the entertainment department.

464
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,240
He may as well have thrust you into politics.

465
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,570
Of course. I applied for politics.

466
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,920
I'll be assigned as soon as my internship ends.

467
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,940
I'm rooting for you, Han Mi.

468
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,120
 When did you plan on exposing this incident, Regional Prosecutor?

469
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,480
 - What?
 - I had the feeling that you were anticipating this more than I had been.

470
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,870
 It'll be hard to expose them with the records on the computer alone.

471
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:10,380
 If we add Moon Gu Jun's confession, it'll be worth trying.

472
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,860
 - Don't expect me to help.
 - That's a given.

473
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,270
 - Are you saying you don't need help?
 - Not yet.

474
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:19,130
 Really? Then what are you going to do?

475
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,940
I'm going to hand over the human trafficking and drug cases to Deputy Director Kim Seok Hun.

476
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,350
And I'm considering taking you and Sunbae Ji,

477
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,070
and the three of us crossing over to their side.

478
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,840
Even me? Why should I?

479
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,210
You need power to fight for justice.

480
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:53,500
But isn't Kim Seok Hun next in line to be Prosecutor General?

481
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,090
Yes. He is.

482
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,240
And do you think he'd get his hands dirty with work like this?

483
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,890
He doesn't need to do anything at all to become the chief prosecutor.

484
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,000
It's true that Kim Seok Hun is an impressive person.

485
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,140
But he still doesn't have any major achievements.

486
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:15,800
To stand above the 2,000 strong prosecutors, he needs a big case.

487
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,550
We're exchanging a big case that Deputy Prosecutor Kim

488
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:22,120
desperately needs for a ticket back to Seoul.

489
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,320
- And
 - And?

490
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,770
Either way, it would be hard for us to solve the case ourselves.

491
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,630
We could end up ruining the case without even touching it.

492
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,710
So you're saying that since it's a case we couldn't solve anyway,

493
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:38,760
we should hand it over to Kim Seok Hun and take the help?

494
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,560
Yes. Exactly.

495
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:49,020
Kim Hui Yu. What is it that you really want?

496
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,920
Director Jeon Seok Gyu,

497
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,170
Is that why you came here?

498
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,520
Yeah.

499
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,770
Why? His personality sucks and he looked scary.

500
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,870
I really don't know what's inside your head.

501
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,200
I have a lot to learn from him.

502
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,600
Are you looking for another mentor?

503
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,140
Well, it'll be good if we have one per subject.

504
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,280
That's true.

505
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,710
Hyeong,

506
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,250
when did you start dating?

507
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,790
Two women came looking for you on the same day. Which one is the real deal?

508
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,250
If you ask me,

509
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:39,860
my heart says Seonbae Hui Ah. But I'm also strangely drawn to Nuna Han Mi too.

510
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,620
- Sang Man,
 - Yes?

511
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,880
You've gotten really comfortable nowadays, haven't you?

512
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,960
Don't you have a lot of work to do tomorrow?

513
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Let's go to sleep. Go to sleep, you punk!

514
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,510
Turn off the lights!

515
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,880
Hyung, could we share the bed today?

516
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,430
- Do you want to sleep outside?
 - No, no. Sleeping on the floor is better.

517
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,900
That brat,

518
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,570
thinking about useless things.

519
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,900
So cold...

520
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,880
- Be quiet.
 - I hate you...
 - What?

521
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,120
There are reports of drugs being brought in by ship.

522
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,910
If you feel anything is off while you're working, report back immediately.

523
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,980
Park Gun!

524
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,100
The flatfish that we brought in today are fantastic. Should we go have a drink today?

525
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,180
That would be great!

526
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,950
 Gimsan Regional Prosecutors' Office

 Illegal Gambling Accomplices List

528
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,000
- Investigator.
 - Yes.

529
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,200
Take it easy.

530
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,580
You woke the birds of Gimsan Branch with your clacking keyboard,

531
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,820
so that they started chirping before sunrise.

532
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,080
Then should I?

533
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,540
But what's that?

534
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,630
This?

535
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,460
Things I'm going to investigate.

536
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:08,140
Give it here. I guess a house is just a place you go back to on the holidays.

537
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,730
Please stop. You'll pass out at this rate.

538
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:15,200
I already passed out. Work is done with the mind, not the body.

539
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,070
I told you to go home.

540
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:22,440
I can see heaps of work piled up in front of me, but what can I do? People come before work.

541
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,960
Forget it. Give it to me!

542
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,950
But I said it's okay...

543
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,950
I'm only giving these to you because you asked for them,

544
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,010
but as you may well know, I need them done before you leave.

545
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:41,970
Yes, I see now that I had been lazily whistling away while receiving my government pay.

546
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,410
Sure. I'll do it. I have to.

547
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:50,060
If you're telling me to finish it before leaving work, you're basically telling me to leave work tomorrow.

548
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,230
If you look at the volume, it would seem so.

549
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,470
Either way, I respect your passion.

550
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,590
Then, I'll leave it to you. Fighting!

551
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,310
Sure. Go ahead.

 Investigation Room

553
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,100
Is your lawyer not here yet?

554
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,100
What a lazy person.

555
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,810
Let's just say that's how the lawyer is.

556
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:44,460
Have any of your lifelines come to visit you even once?

557
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,400
They didn't, did they?

558
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,100
The people you relied on can't help you anymore.

559
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,650
 Many Gimsan City Gangsters Caught Running Illegal Gambling Den

560
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:10,690
Those folks are very busy right now trying to put out their own fires.

561
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,320
But that's that.

562
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,650
- Human trafficking?
 - What?

563
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,780
Did you personally distribute the illicit drugs?

564
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,900
Mr. Mun Gu Jun. Let's go swiftly and easily. Yes?

565
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,990
The kids under you already confessed anyway.

566
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,310
Here, what you requested.

567
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,590
Thank you.

568
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,950
These are the statements you received from the illegal brothel women right?

569
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,930
Yes.

570
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,990
Great job. I'll leave the rest in your hands too.

571
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,090
Yes, understood

572
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,030
Let's look here.

573
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:02,660
There are times you personally injected the drugs, Chairman.

574
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,930
But you'll still remain mum?

575
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,410
Sure, continue to assert your right to remain silent.

576
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:14,380
Then before the lawyer gets here, let me briefly recite to you

577
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,430
your charges, Mr. Mun Gu Jun.

578
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,610
Criminal syndicate, Yuchae Faction criminal allegations: opening and running an illegal gambling den,

579
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:29,520
bribery, human trafficking for the purpose of prostitution,

580
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,600
smuggling and distribution of illicit drugs,

581
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,590
running a financial institution with illegal interest rates.

582
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,000
Just how many is this?

583
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,490
On top of that, you already have a rap sheet, so your sentencing would be even more severe.

584
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,230
Just looking at it, it would be at least

585
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,850
about 30 years, I wager?

586
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:55,250
You're not young. Looks like you'll end your life in jail.

587
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,820
Look, Mr. Mun Gu Jun. I'll give you some options.

588
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,160
Would you like to take responsibility for only the crimes you committed?

589
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,260
Or would you rather have all of it blamed on you?

590
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,650
Water, please.

591
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,180
His swing is so smooth. He hit him with everything he has without breaking a sweat.

592
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,520
Are you sure he's a first-time prosecutor?

593
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,250
The way he's questioning him, if you said he was in his 10th year as a prosecutor, I'd believe it.

594
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,820
 Okay, we'll end here for today.

595
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,860
Nice work.

596
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,310
Come in.

597
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,340
Nice work.

598
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,620
Shall we have a drink?

599
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,870
Yes.

600
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,880
- Seong Wu.
 - Yes?

601
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,390
Support Hui Wu for now.

602
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,800
Pardon? Me?

603
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,560
Yeah.

604
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,250
If a human trafficking ring is involved, it'll take some time for Hui Wu to find them alone.

605
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,130
You'll bring me to Seoul?

606
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,210
Yes.

607
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,920
If I get stabbed in the back by trusting you,

608
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,970
I'll probably drown in that ocean.

609
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,230
That won't happen.

610
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,230
 Gangwon Province Prosecutors' Office

 Gimsan City
 Human Trafficking. Drug Cartel

612
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,390
I should earn my own carfare. I can't leech off my subordinates now, can I?

613
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:11,190
It's a document listing this region's high-ranking officials' corruption.

614
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:14,290
I collected them whenever they had their guard down.

615
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,760
Thank you.

616
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,760
I will carve out the rotten parts leaving nothing behind.

617
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,980
Assemblyman Gu Ok Cheong, Mayor, Police Precinct Head. You detonated a bomb via the news.

618
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,800
They'll stop at nothing to escape.

619
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,370
I will ensure their roads are blocked.

620
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:34,360
No.

621
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,080
With this, even Mun Gu Jun won't be able to hold out any longer.

622
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,760
But how did you know that I was secretly investigating?

623
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,150
This is a secret investigation for me, too, so I can't tell you.

624
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,180
Please understand.

625
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,850
Kim Hui Wu.

626
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,410
Let's do well.

627
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:57,040
Yes.

628
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,030
Let's drink.

629
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,820
Stay seated.

630
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,720
Stay seated.

631
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,190
No, no, no.

632
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,180
Hyeong Choi Hyeong and Park Gun, come here.

633
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:24,830
What are the two of you doing tomorrow night?

634
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,160
Not much.

635
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,630
Same here.

636
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:30,280
Wouldn't you like to do something with me?

637
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,130
The pay is quite something.

638
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,200
Well, sounds good. What is it?

639
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,230
I'm just letting the two of you know especially.

640
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:44,150
If you help out with the offloading of the fishing boat tomorrow, the pay will be...

641
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:53,200
Also when the work is over, they'll pay for a grand meal afterward.

642
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,290
It's good right?

643
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,950
Sounds good.

644
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,600
 Got you.

645
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,380
What?

646
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:07,680
Got it. I'll give them twice the promised pay, so tell them to give that job to us.

647
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,900
And you need to come to Seoul with me.

648
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,830
Yeah, right now.

649
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,190
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

650
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:21,600
I've heard through Il Hyeon. What is it that you need to discuss?

651
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,140
I would like to request help from you, Deputy District Prosecutor.

652
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,690
- Help?
 - Yes.

653
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:38,190
It's a case about the ties between the Gimsan City's gangsters and its regional politicians

654
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,970
I also heard of this case on the news.

655
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,590
What is it? Human trafficking.

656
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,610
 Breaking of laws regarding illicit drug controls

657
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,380
Drugs?

658
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:53,370
The scale of this case is much bigger than what was on the news.

659
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,990
Yes.

660
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:59,180
Human trafficking is happening through job agencies.

661
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,050
From what we gathered so far, there are 15 sites nationwide.

662
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:09,200
As for the drugs, using fish from Gimsan Port the drugs are being distributed through those agencies.

663
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:12,750
The transaction is scheduled for tomorrow night.

664
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,600
Tomorrow night?

665
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,350
But why are you giving this to me?

666
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:23,120
This is something for the Gangwon Provincial Public Prosecutors' Office to handle.

667
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:28,550
No, we would like to investigate under your direction, Deputy District Prosecutor.

668
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,280
- We?
 - Yes.

669
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,830
To give this case to you, I conferred with the branch prosecutor.

670
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,930
Branch prosecutor...

671
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,760
- Oh, Jeon Seok Gyu?
 - Yes.

672
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,330
Branch Prosecutor Jeon would like to work under you.

673
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:51,670
This case is like a show of sincerity from him to you.

674
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:57,380
 Jeon Seok Gyu... that straightforward bamboo stalk comes to work under me?

675
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,160
 I could use this to bring a considerable number of my opponents to my side.

676
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,710
On your way to an even higher position,

677
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:07,140
I hope that this case will be at least a small help.

678
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:12,870
Well, I also want to quickly come to Seoul to assist you.

679
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:18,270
 Kim Hui Wu is a clever bastard. If someone like this worked for me...

680
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:24,090
Fine. I'll try putting my trust in you.

681
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,370
Thank you, Deputy District Prosecutor.

682
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:30,810
You have to hit the trafficking and smuggling sites at the same time.

683
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:35,690
One whole region will be taking a hit, so it'll seem bigger than it actually is.

684
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,380
That's right.

685
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,720
The large scope of the human trafficking case will be taken care of here.

686
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,360
- What about the drug smuggling? Should I send reinforcements?
 - Yes.

687
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,940
Since it'll be the justification to bring Branch Prosecutor Jeon back to Seoul,

688
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,120
so for the related case of the Gimsan bribery, be sure to cleanly conclude that as well.

689
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,990
I'll expose it to the news to make the world focus on Gimsan.

690
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,140
As ordered, I will take care of it without fail.

691
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,240
When I make my move then, Jeon Seok Gyu

692
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,750
and everyone under him will be able to come to Seoul.

693
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,430
Thank you, Deputy District Prosecutor.

694
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,950
Sure.

695
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,000
 Hey, brother!

696
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,400
Seonbae!

697
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,880
It's been so long!

698
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,200
- Have you been well?
 - Yes.

699
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,680
You never contacted me once after going to Gimsan.

700
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,600
I apologize, I've been busy.

701
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,570
I bet you were.

702
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,970
Jerk! I missed you!

703
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:57,470
Aren't you doing well! Even meeting Deputy District Prosecutor Kim one-on-one.

704
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:00,840
Well, it ended up that way somehow.

705
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,100
Anyway, it was you, right?

706
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,230
Gimsan Illegal Gambling Dens and Bribery Case.

707
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:13,440
Right now there are three prosecutors at the Gimsan Branch.

708
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,540
Two of them have been exiled, so there's no way they'd make a scene.

709
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,070
That leaves just you, but that's not what's important.

710
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:23,910
What is important is that you, as the prosecutor-in-charge,

711
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:27,180
came to Seoul to meet Deputy District Prosecutor Kim.

712
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:33,560
- What about it?
 - There's an even bigger case behind the Gimsan case.

713
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,840
What's more, the fact that you met with a bigshot like Kim Seok Hun and not Jang Il Hyeon means

714
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:45,050
you made a tricky deal that no ordinary prosecutor could pull off.

715
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:48,320
What did you offer and what did you receive?

716
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,540
A ticket to Seoul. Right?

717
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:59,900
 Seonbae Lee Min Su, he's frighteningly sharp and perceptive.

718
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,510
Great idea. Please move up here already.

719
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:05,130
That way my life can get spicier.

720
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,640
Seoul's no fun without you.

721
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,820
 Gyu Ri said to drop by the Eastern District Prosecutors Office on your way.

722
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:19,660
 If you don't want to get cursed out, it's better to go.

723
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,840
Did you come to Seoul to tour the Prosecutors' Offices?

724
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,570
Let's stop by since it's on the way. She's an important friend.

725
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,470
Okay.

726
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,720
 You bastard!

727
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,300
- Did you become a prosecutor to look cool?
 - Sorry?

728
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,720
Do you think you're some kind of justice warrior?

729
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,520
I believe that this society needs to be fair.

730
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,380
Do you think I don't know that?!

731
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,160
 What is the rule of law?

732
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,210
Wrongdoings need to be judged fairly whether they seem unfair or pitiful.

733
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:52,120
If you dismiss all of them because you feel sorry for them and don't indict them because things feel unfair,

734
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,100
what about the crime?

735
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,590
Though you may take things into consideration since being human comes first,

736
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:02,310
the law must account for the wrongdoing. Or you can quit and go help the unfortunate instead.

737
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,520
Got that?

738
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,860
Yes, understood.

739
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,200
I don't want to see you for the next 20 minutes.

740
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,080
- Get out.
 - Yes.

741
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:22,280
That crazy, rock-headed idiot.

742
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,720
Kim Hui Wu.

743
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,720
- Here. This is all I can offer you.
 - Okay.

744
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,580
Thanks.

745
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,340
It's true, what Seonbae Min Su said.

746
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,320
What?

747
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:48,020
The model student Kim Gyu Ri has become a tough woman warrior.

748
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,940
Once I became a prosecutor, I naturally ended up this way.

749
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:56,200
Wait three years, and you'll curse creatively.

750
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,920
Too many things happen that drive me up the wall.

751
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,390
Still, it's nice to see.

752
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:04,790
How are you doing? Do you like being a prosecutor?

753
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,230
Yeah. Of course.

754
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:10,150
Well, you did place first at the institute, so it's not surprising.

755
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:13,440
But about Gu Seung Hyeok...

756
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,070
Gu Seung Hyeok?

757
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,730
Oh, you two were at the institute at the same time, right?

758
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:20,710
Yeah, he's a good guy.

759
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,920
Nonsense.

760
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,120
He's crawling around under me right now.

761
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,620
Was that punk always so stubborn and inflexible?

762
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,340
He's always the same.

763
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:35,040
That's Prosecutor Gu's charm.

764
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,600
He drives me nuts.

765
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,320
Thanks for dropping by with your busy schedule.

766
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,160
I should be thanking you. You're the one who's busy.

767
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,650
Go inside.

768
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:51,450
Okay, see you next time then.

769
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:55,780
Be good to Seung Hyeok. He's going to be a big help to you.

770
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,380
Yeah. Get back safely.

771
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,400
Let's keep in touch.

772
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,040
Hyeong.

773
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,020
I am someone without any predispositions. You can tell me honestly.

774
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,680
You're a pervert, right?

775
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,930
What is this unprovoked attack?

776
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:24,960
How many girlfriends do you have exactly?

777
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,600
Will you focus already?

778
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,370
Hurry up and drive.

779
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,740
- Kim Hui Wu?
 - Yes.

780
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:43,320
He was 1st at the institute, but he went down to Gimsan Branch.

781
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,020
He's an odd one.

782
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:49,280
- And he wants to come to Seoul?
 - Yes.

783
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:54,930
The fact that he was able to grow the case from out in the boonies is an extraordinary skill.

784
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,050
He has good directing abilities.

785
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,870
Bring Kim Hui Wu to Seoul.

786
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:01,090
He had another condition.

787
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:03,700
He said Branch Prosecutor Jeon Seok Gyu and the other ordinary prosecutor

788
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,150
also wanted to be reassigned together to Seoul.

789
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:09,010
Jeon Seok Gyu.

790
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:12,390
A few years ago, he was the one who convicted the son of the Minister of MoLIT  (Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport).

791
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:16,800
Because of his history of rejecting his superiors' orders, he was exiled to Gimsan Branch.

792
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,480
The prosecutor that made a big noise in Seocho-dong?  (Where the Seoul Western District Prosecutors Office is.)

793
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,230
- Was his nickname tiger?
 - Yes, correct.

794
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,220
There isn't any relationship with us,

795
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:29,300
but because of his uprightness, many prosecutors followed him.

796
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:33,100
We wouldn't lose anything by keeping someone like him around us.

797
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,480
I also feel the same.

798
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,870
Look at how he takes care of this case. If he's useful, bring him up too.

799
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,330
Yes, sir.

800
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:44,070
 There's a high chance of suicide...

801
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:53,100
- Investigator?
 - Yes, Prosecutor.

802
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,560
Now if you even just call me, I'm scared.

803
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,140
That's so disappointing to hear.

804
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:59,920
Why did you get to work so early?

805
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,460
What do you mean arrive to work? Because of someone, I was unable to get off work.

806
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,820
I see.

807
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,980
Then you must be about done with your work?

808
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,280
Why? I'm almost done. Is there something else I need to do?

809
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,140
You should come with me from now on.

810
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:17,340
With you, Prosecutor? Why?

811
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,480
Tonight, there's going to be a drug transaction at Gimsan Port.

812
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,560
Drugs?

813
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,730
Yes.

814
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,890
It's Kim Hui Wu's work?

815
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:31,200
Yes. Kim Hui Wu's work.

816
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,680
This time he's given a big present to the deputy district prosecutor. What a kid.

817
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,900
I can tell, seeing that Deputy District Prosecutor himself is directing the investigation.

818
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,180
I knew he was soaring above others, but it's beyond my imagination.

819
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:47,820
If this works out, our merits will be carved into Deputy District Prosecutor's red carpet.

820
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:52,970
He's someone who has set the table for us grandly. He didn't leave a single one of us out.

821
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,210
I'm Osan. You?

822
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,010
- I'm Pyeongtaek.
 - Okay.

823
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,790
- Let's leave early so we're not late.
 - Yes.

824
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,830
Investigator, you're so cool.

825
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:22,100
After we get off work, let's really eat something delicious.

826
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:31,380
He's going to work me down to the bone.

827
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:35,480
What is this? Why is this one so heavy?

828
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,240
Damn it, that punk!

829
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:55,650
 Osan Job Agency

830
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:08,420
 Pyeongtaek Job Agency

831
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:16,980

832
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,180
This is all fish, though.

833
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,360
- Hey, what are you doing?
 - Oh, nothing much!

834
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,060
What if we're wrong about this?

835
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,930
Oh, my back.

836
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:33,720
Sir!

837
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,670
I'm telling you, it's fresh!

838
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:38,590
Of course! I'm not a newbie in this business!

839
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,980
Aren't you going to work?

840
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,320
Oh, sorry.

841
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,050
Just a sec.

842
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:48,710
Hey, you better do your job properly.

843
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,700
- I'm sorry.
 - You should have watched where you were going.

844
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,730
Make sure you pick up every one of them.

845
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:54,410
Yes, sir.

846
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:56,090
Hello?

847
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:59,250
 What problem?

848
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,130
What is this?

849
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:03,150
I'm saying it's truly grade A this time.

850
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,390
It's really grade A.

851
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,140
Good.

852
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,180
What do you think you're doing?

853
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,890
- Are you crazy, you bastard?
 - Prosecutor?

854
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:19,180
Of course, he's crazy. Hard not to be.

855
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,680
Good job.

856
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,430
Innocent civilians have been dragged into a crime scene. Wouldn't you go crazy?

857
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:27,730
How's this bastard now?

858
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,440
Isn't that right, Hyeon Jong?

859
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,900
Don't be startled. Come here.

860
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:42,050
♫  What kind of gang came at me? Stopped in your tracks  ♫

861
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:45,880
♫  Stay there and wait just for me  ♫

862
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:50,250

865
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:03,000
♫  Bring it on Oh Yeah  ♫

866
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,190
♫  Oh Bring it on Bring it on  ♫

867
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:09,510
♫  Bring it on Oh Yeah  ♫

868
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,740
 Again My Life

869
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,400
It was fabricated, right?

870
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,850
By someone.

871
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:19,070
It doesn't matter who truly killed him.

872
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:21,350
What he's thinking, be sure to keep watch.

873
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,850
I have to use it against them.

874
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:27,130
Is it because of Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop? I can convince him.

875
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,650
You're going to set the game up?

876
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,330
Assemblyman is waiting for you.

877
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:33,870
There's a listening device.

878
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:36,290
He wants to make a deal with me?

879
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:40,300
There should be faith between the National Assembly and the prosecutors' office.

880
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,480
I'd like you to come to me.

881
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,170
♫  You can't get away from me.  ♫
