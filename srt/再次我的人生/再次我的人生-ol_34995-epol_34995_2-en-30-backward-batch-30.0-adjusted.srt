1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,950

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,510
 Lee Joon Gi

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,890
 Lee Kyung Young

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,650
 Kim Ji Eun

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,040
 Again My Life

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,440
Get out of the way!

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,100
No!

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,170
Mom?

9
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,370
Dad?

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,910
  There were so many ways I could have saved my parents.

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,040
  But the arrogance of believing that I could change fate led them to die anyway.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,790
  Hey, Mom.

13
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,180
  Can you stay home from work today?

14
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,250
 Why? Is something happening?

15
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,400
 I'm taking today off too.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,750
  - Maybe together we canâ€”
 - Even if you take the day off we still have to go to work.

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,020
  - We work 24/7.
 - Exactly.

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,760
  I should have tried insisting while holding their hands.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,100
  No.

20
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,540
  Even if I had to cause an accident, I should have made sure that they couldn't leave for the factory.

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,880
  I should have realized that I might become a variable to cause the driver to turn the steering wheel.

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,470
 No, I should have pushed my parents a little closer to the sidewalk.

23
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,560
  Am I to end up alone again like this?

24
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,920
 Hui Wu! Hui Wu!

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,150
 - Hui Wu, where are you?
 - Hui Wu?

26
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,810
 Hui Wu!

27
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,390
Mom! Dad!

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,700
- Are you okay?
 - Hui Wu, are you hurt?

29
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,310
Mom, are you okay?

30
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,180
- Are you hurt?
 - Are you okay?

31
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,610
Try moving. Try lifting your arms.

32
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,830
Why are you worrying about me? You two are hurt!

33
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,210
Mom, this won't do. Hurry and get on my back. Let's go to the hospital.

34
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,870
No, I'm okay. I was just a little shocked.

35
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,460
Are you sure you didn't get hit by any glass?

36
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,240
Dad, you're the one who got hurt, I said.

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,550
- You're bleeding.
 - Bleeding?

38
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,910
Darn, I got hurt.

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,550
I did.

40
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,440
 Episode 2

41
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,950
Mom, let's go to the hospital just to be safe.

42
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,310
I'm really okay.

43
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,370
But what happened to the driver?

44
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,580
I know, I think he might be badly injured.

45
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,810
Stay here. I'll go check.

46
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,470
Okay.

47
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,920
Are you okay?

48
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,150
I'm just a little roughed up.

49
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,220
 I'll finally get to see

50
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,890
 the hit-and-run assailant who killed my parents.

51
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,790
 - He died? Are you sure?
 - Yes.

52
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,110
- Did anything about him stand out?
 - It looks like a DUI.

53
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,890
- Drunk driving?
 - Yes.

54
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,660
He reeked of alcohol.

55
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,230
Hello, sir.

56
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,250
- What happened?
 - Well... That...

57
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,980
Gosh!!

58
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,150
  Kim Jin Wu?

59
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,160
 Why would Kim Jin Wu be here?

60
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,780
Please move aside, we have a patient coming through!

61
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,050
  The smell of alcohol is so strong.

62
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,880
 Is that...

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,600
  Jo Hyeon Seok?

64
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,040
  I finally have the missing piece.

65
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,660
 Jo Hyeon Seok. Jo Tae Seop's son.

66
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,960
  It's nice to meet you.

67
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,800
  Mr. Kim?

68
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,510
  I freely did a background check on you.

69
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,810
 You lost your parents to a hit and run accident while you were young.

70
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,430
 With lower-level grades, accepted to the Department of Law at Hankuk University after three exam attempts.

71
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,910
  You were even a martial artist when you took the bar (exams).

72
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,710
  On top of that, you're handsome too.

73
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,570
  Very handsome.

74
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,340
  You don't need to be this good looking if you're already so accomplished, but somehow you achieved that too!

75
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,750
 Anyway, as a rising political star,

76
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,880
 you're overflowing with talent.

77
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,790
 My father,  Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop, will undoubtedly back you, too.

78
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,590
 Just take one step forward.

79
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,480
 The rest will follow.

80
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,450
 What a brazen jerk.

81
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,110
 He already knew who I was.

82
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,840
 Ambulance

83
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,380
 Fabricating and hiding the accident records.

84
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,400
 That was due to Jo Tae Seop's power.

85
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,440
Excuse me?

86
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,330
We'll need a witness statement. Would you mind coming to the station?

87
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,710
Sure.

88
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,040
Excuse me.

89
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,990
I'll do it.

90
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,760
I'm his father. I was also at the scene.

91
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,910
I'm also a victim.

92
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,430
Okay. Then I'll ask for your cooperation.

93
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,680
Come with me.

94
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,880
Are you going to be okay, Dad?

95
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,770
I'll be okay. Take your mom home and get some rest.

96
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,620
Yes.

97
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,150
  I changed fate. I protected my parents.

98
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,180
 And Jo Tae Seop lost his son.

99
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,580
 He'll probably be an even more cold-blooded madman than he was before.

100
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,570
 I know

101
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,860
 since I became that way

102
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,220
 when I lost my parents.

103
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,640
 Again My Life

104
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,850
- You worked hard Seok Hun.
 - I only did my job.

105
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,390
Thanks to you, I was able to protect my son's honor.

106
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,420
We've made sure to secure all information related to the accident.

107
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,110
So, please don't worry about that.

108
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,610
Okay.

109
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,570
I cannot fathom the depth of your grief, and for that, I apologize.

110
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,980
I'm sure it'll get better in time.

111
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,560
What can I do? It's not something that can be undone.

112
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,930
For everything you've done for me,

113
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,680
I'll be sure to repay you. You should receive good news soon.

114
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,830
Thank you, sir.

115
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,240
Only up to today...

116
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,090
That's right. I should think back on it and be sad only up to today

117
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,090
and let my son, Hyeon Seok, go.

118
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,160
Tomorrow, I have to go back and work for the people again.

119
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,820
- Yes, sir.
 - Thank you for all your hard work.

120
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,610
You ate jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) earlier. Why are you hungry again?

121
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,420
- Stop eating you pig!
  - Let me have a cigarette.

122
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,410
Hey, go buy some cigarettes.

123
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,960
- Just give me one. You have some right?
 - Hey, get me a lighter.

124
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,130
You are cool! Woohoo!!

125
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,420
- Get me some chocolate milk!
 - And a cookie!

126
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,830
Welcome.

127
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,470
Cigarettes.

128
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,320
I heard that you were studying. Why? To go to college?

129
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,190
 Hey, you worm-like bastard. How dare you tell on me to the homeroom teacher?

130
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,190
 But your father is a factory worker and mine is a police chief.

131
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,250
 How unfair! It must feel so unfair for you!

132
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,730
Bastard. Are your ears blocked?

133
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,710
Look at that stare.

134
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,400
Why? Are you going to hit me?

135
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,710
Wow, you're so damn whiny!

136
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,980
That's enough. Let's go.

137
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,820
Hui Wu. Study hard and make sure to get into college.

138
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,000
Become an important person.

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,570
- Who? This idiot?
 - I said, let's go.

140
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,670
The others are waiting.

141
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,630
Hey. Watch that stare of yours.

142
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,950
Once a gofer, always a gofer.

143
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,870
Where did you graduate from that you dare to look at me that way?

144
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,340
Stay strong.

145
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,310
I need to hold back and keep it together.

146
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,250
 Kim Hui Wu. Come to the faculty office.

147
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,770
Hey, Hui Wu, you're here!

148
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,980
Say hello. He is the director.

149
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,260
- Hello.
 - Nice to meet you, student Kim Hui Wu.

150
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,080
You are the one who came first in the mock exams.

151
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,820
 Congratulations.

152
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,970
For the first time since the academy was established, a student in the lowest grade class

153
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,220
overtook his peers from Hankuk University and came in first.

154
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,900
From today, move to the Hankuk University class.

155
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,610
Yes, sir.

156
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,180
- Is it you?
 -  Kim Gyu Ri?

157
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,820
First at the academy.

158
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,780
Ohh.. yeah.

159
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,420
What's your secret? I would have never believed it was possible.

160
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,470
- What's so funny?
 - Nothing.

161
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,250
Anyway, congrats.

162
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:08,110
I'm sure it'll be your first and last time. No compromises next time.

163
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,910
Are you okay health-wise?

164
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,590
- What are you saying?
 - Eat well.

165
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,690
Don't eat things like that.

166
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,560
Hey, cigarettes.

167
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,620
There's no cigarette for 1000 won.

168
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,350
- Why are you laughing?
 - Because you are.

169
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,160
So it's true that you changed, just like I heard.

170
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,440
Hurry up and give it to me. I don't have time.

171
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
Time? More like money.

172
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,370
And, no cigarette costs 1000 won.

173
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,250
This bastard, gosh!!

174
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,010
- Huh? Did you just avoid me?
 - Yeah, I did.

175
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,670
- Why should I get hit?
 - If you avoid it, you'll get hit more.

176
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,090
Then try hitting me, you lunatic.

177
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,980
This punk...

178
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,990
Why aren't you coming out already? What are you doing?

179
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,790
Hey! Let's take it outside.

180
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,010
Deal.

181
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,900
Seriously!

182
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,460
Kim Hui Wu, why do you have to give up on life in front of me?

183
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,390
Why is it me of all people? Why are you trying to make me a murderer?

184
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,220
I won't die. Don't worry.

185
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,180
And even if you get caught and locked up,

186
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,340
punks like you only get about six months for a petty offense.

187
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,520
What is he saying? What the hell is this bastard saying?

188
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,740
What?

189
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,590
Gosh, this punk...

190
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,750
Let go! Let go, you punk.

191
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,050
W-W-Wait. Let go. I'm fine.

192
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,660
How dare you, punk?!

193
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,660
Stay back! Stay back! Hold on, hold on. Damn it.

194
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,180
Let go. I said, let go, you bastard.

195
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,090
Let go!

196
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,960
 Did that punk just tickle me?

197
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,820
Hold on.

198
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,950
Are you a pervert? Why are you tickling me?

199
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,310
I'm begging you. Can't you just leave today?

200
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,550
Just go. Okay?

201
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,570
How dare this bastard bite the master without any fear?

202
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,390
 Are you out of your mind now just because you graduated from school?

203
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,280
I didn't bite him. I just tickled him for a second.

204
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,300
- What is he saying?
 - Th-That's actually true.

205
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,280
- What?
 - I mean, th-this bastardâ€”

206
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,870
You moron. Come here, you bastard.

207
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,050
Go kill him!

208
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,430
 Catch him.

209
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,130
What are you doing? Why are you closing your eyes?

210
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,890
To feel it?

211
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,140
I'm going to kill you for real.

212
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,160
Let's stop now, okay?

213
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,090
If I keep going, you might pee your pants. No?

214
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,750
-  College?
 - Yes.

215
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,430
What is your father's name?

216
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,580
Kim Chan Seong.

217
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,770
Our son is saying he wants to go to college?

218
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,160
Yes. I am studying hard while going to the academy.

219
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,920
What about the p-p-part-time job?

220
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,720
- While working.
 - When are you sleeping?

221
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,090
You don't have to worry about my health.

222
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,280
So, what's your goal?

223
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,620
The Department of Law in Hankuk University.

224
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,960
You're scaring me now. What the hell have we done wrong?

225
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:26,530
Hui Wu, come on. Let's start over and talk seriously.

226
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,090
Okay.

227
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,580
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

228
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,230
- Here it is.
 - What is this? Grade card?

229
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,140
- Did you do well?
 - Yes.

230
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,900
I placed first at the academy.

231
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,690
First place? Why?

232
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,250
- What do you mean why?
 - Watch it!

233
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,950
How dare you lie to us? Just because we don't know how to read the grade card.

234
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,500
Our son placed first? Someone from our family is first place?

235
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,160
Did you cheat?

236
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,240
It's a crime to cheat this much!

237
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,900
I didn't! I studied hard for this. Dad, I swear.

238
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,920
Honey, let's have a family meeting. Without him, just us.

239
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,430
How can someone from our family place first? How?

240
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,560
 Assemblyman Jo Tae Seob of the Democratic Party has announced

241
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,320
 his candidacy for the national convention to elect the next party president.

242
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,980
 He held a press conference today at the National Assembly's Democratic Party

243
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,890
 and expressed his intent to run as the party's candidate for president,

244
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,620
 saying he will do everything to create a new Republic of Korea.

245
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,330
 In a situation where inequality and polarization are intensifying...

246
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,370
 Time is flowing according to my memories.

247
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,620
 All the incidents from my past are really happening.

248
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,160
 The fateful time that must be stopped is also approaching.

249
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,460
 Three months later.

250
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,520
 What is this? Why did the lights go off?

251
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,250
I can't see anything.

252
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,230
 What's this?

253
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,270
Could it be... today?

254
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,620
 On that day, thunder and lightning struck, and there was a power outage, too.

255
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,380
 Pharmacy

256
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,980
 I am sure it's somewhere here.

257
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,430
 The academy alley in front of the pharmacy.

258
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,890
 Rensol Pharmacy.

259
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,220
 Pharmacy

260
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,070
Kim Gyu Ri!

261
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,980
You are up. Are you conscious?

262
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,790
Did you bring me here?

263
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,410
Yeah.

264
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,490
- Thanks.
 - You need to take care of yourself.

265
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,170
I'm thankful, but it's not something you need to worry about.

266
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,850
If you are sleepy, just sleep.

267
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,020
 Instead of taking these.

268
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,410
It's not that I didn't sleep. I reduced it as much as I can with this.

269
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,650
- What do you get by forcibly sleeping less?
 - I study.

270
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,180
- What after studying?
 - Get into a good college.

271
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,990
- What after getting into a good college?
 - I will think about that once I get there.

272
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,180
For now, it's important that I don't disappoint my parents.

273
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,800
Is it your goal to satisfy your parents at every step?

274
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,470
I didn't say I was doing it for them.

275
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,960
You're not?

276
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,030
I am grateful to them, that's all.

277
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,470
It's true. Parents are usually people we are grateful for.

278
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,520
- You can just be grateful for them, too.
 - What do you mean?

279
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,790
For your parents, you are just their child.

280
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,900
They wouldn't think of you as adopted.

281
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,180
What are you? How did you know?

282
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,660
Because they are good people who adopted you, you feel burdened and are obsessed.

283
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,120
You even ruined your health. Would they want all this?

284
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,400
Don't try to pay back in the wrong way.

285
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,390
At least for your sake.

286
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,030
True. This is not right.

287
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,890
 In the past, Gyu Ri was someone who always placed first.

288
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,600
Good-bye.

289
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,560
Thank you.

290
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,840
- I heard Gyu Ri fainted.
 - Yes.

291
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,230
I heard that's why she couldn't take the entrance exam. Where did she faint?

292
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,820
In the academy alley in front of the pharmacy.

293
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,930
I just came back from the hospital.

294
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,810
The aftereffect is severe because she was found late.

295
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,150
But, why did she faint?

296
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,220
They say it's from an overdose of stimulants.

297
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,630
I think she took too many stimulants when she got sleepy and didn't eat enough.

298
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,220
 Department of Law at Hankuk University. You can do this! Don't give up till the end.

299
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,580
 Kim Gyu Ri

300
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,790
 Department of Law at Hankuk University. You can do this! Don't give up till the end.

301
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,720
 Rumors said that Gyu Ri went on to attend Law School at Hankuk University.

302
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,380
 But I had never heard Kim Gyu Ri's name in both Hankuk University and the Law community.

303
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,190
 I wonder why?

304
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,240
 Today, her fate was changed through me.

305
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,110
 What would Gyu Ri's future be like?

306
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,210
Jong Il, do you know what this is?

307
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,110
What is it?

308
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,680
It's a hot-ticket item these days.

309
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,920
  Just one and done.

310
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,690
Really? Good. I've been getting really tired of Han Mi playing hard to get.

311
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,350
Put one in her drink at the club later.

312
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,810
Okay.

313
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,820
Han Mi is on her way.

314
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,010
Our pathetic Kim Hui Wu, aren't you working hard.

315
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,900
Do well.

316
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,880
Bye-bye.

317
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,660
â™«  I can feel love  â™«

318
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,760
â™«  Feel love  â™«

319
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,260
â™«  I can feel love  â™«

320
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,060
Geez.

321
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,140
â™«  Feel love  â™«

323
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:46,730
â™«  Countless stars fill me up.
 Theyâ€™re slowly looking for the light  â™«

324
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,170
â™«  I can feel love  â™«

325
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,200
â™«  You seep in like the Milky Way  â™«

326
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,520
Let's go see Han Mi.

327
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,380
 Wow, she is really hot.

328
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,420
 Hey, let's get a better look.

329
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,880
Gosh, these dirty bastards. Look what they're up to.

330
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,440
That punk must be crazy.

331
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,700
Look at that confidence.

332
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,330
Manners...

333
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,010
maketh...

334
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,080
man.

335
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,400
The movie hasn't been released yet, right?

336
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,630
Did I just put on a show again?

337
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,810
What is that bastard saying? You're a dead man.

338
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,990
It won't do. Today, you guys are going to get some true education.

339
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,640
What a load of crap.

340
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,530
That hurts!

341
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,620
- What happened?
 - Are you awake?

342
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,660
I asked what happened!

343
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,530
Here you go.

344
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,280
  Chief Im Jeong Wu

345
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,750
Do you guys know where you are?

346
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,180
Guys.

347
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,300
I am asking you.

348
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,840
Whatever this place is, I don't know why I am here.

349
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,310
Why criminals like you are sitting in the police chief's office,

350
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,660
I am asking you if you know why.

351
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,990
Why am I a criminal?

352
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:10,620
You reported that your drink was spiked, right? That's why we investigated it. Diligently.

353
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,370
 Thankfully, the drug packet was found in the trash.

354
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,040
Who was it?

355
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,020
What are you doing?

356
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,590
- I will pull out your eyes, you son of aâ€”
 - Quiet!

357
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:29,640
My son also drank alcohol without knowing his friends had spiked it for fun.

358
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,540
That's why he was mentally and physically weak.

359
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:40,040
But one guy came out of nowhere and assaulted my son.  Why did you beat him?

360
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,320
I went there to save my friend. These guys didn't listen to me, so I gave them a warning.

361
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,580
I don't know if you checked the crime scene.

362
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,810
That guy threw a liquor bottle at me.

363
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,810
It broke creating a scratch on the wall.

364
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,750
Do you see this?

365
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,420
It was not a one-sided assault. Self-defense.

366
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,090
So you did beat him.

367
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:05,910
I will repeat myself. It was self-defense.

368
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,140
 Injury Certificate.

369
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,120
I heard you're hard-working. Why didn't you consider your future?

370
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:22,410
I thought I'd never see the day a police chief fabricated an incident and threatened kids.

371
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,500
Shut up!

372
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,490
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hoon, what brings you here?

373
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,250
 Kim Seok Hoon? Why is this guy here?

374
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,690
- Are you Im Jong Il?
 - Yes.

375
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,050
- You made a mistake, right?
 - I haven't done anything wrong.

376
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,530
- You haven't done anything wrong?
 - No.

377
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,330
 Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

378
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,440
 Do you have a death wish?

379
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,780
 Shinju Police Station

380
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,750
What is this? Kim Seok Hun had only one son.

381
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,260
Hey, Kim Hui Wu.

382
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,240
Let's go eat.

383
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,720
- I already ate.
 - But I didn't.

384
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,930
- So what do you want?
 - Let's eat together.

385
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,510
- I said I already ate.
 - I can't eat alone.

386
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,960
- So what about it?
 - I am saying let's eat together.

387
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,350
- I already ate.
 - What do you want me to do?

388
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,900
- Let's eat together.
 - That's right, let's eat.

389
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,370
Okay, let's eatâ€” Wait, what?

390
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,150
Gosh, I got confused.

391
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,500
I don't want to eat. I already ate.

392
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,250
It's not me.

393
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,220
Hey, is it me then? I can tell if my stomach makes noise.

394
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,360
Hey, I want to buy you food because I am grateful. Why are you being crazy and rejecting?

395
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,050
Being obsessive about not eating together is crazy, not rejecting.

396
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,950
I'm being obsessive?

397
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,750
Hey. I just want to repay you, so why are making me look pathetic?

398
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,960
I will respectfully turn you down. Why?

399
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,190
What are you doing?

400
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,700
I can smell cigarettes.

401
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,130
I feel sick if I smell cigarettes.

402
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,570
Sorry I'm late.

403
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,410
Welcome. Deputy Chief Kim.

404
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,220
I am sorry, sir. I had to deal with something.

405
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,730
I am sure it went well since you handled it yourself.

406
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:14,680
- Yes.
 -  Every large fissure starts with a tiny crack. Be careful always.

407
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,740
I will keep that in mind.

408
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,190
So, how is it? You are the first one in your class to become a Deputy Chief Prosecutor. How are you feeling?

409
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,650
I am just thankful.

410
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,120
I will do my best so that no one crosses your path and gets in your way.

411
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,450
Just continue what you are doing nowâ€”the path you want to take.

412
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,730
Your capabilities...

413
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,180
I will form that path and fill in whatever you lack.

414
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,560
How's the taste?

415
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,710
Yes, welcome.

416
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,960
Kim Gyu Ri.

417
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,620
- What is this?
 - Summary notes.

418
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,980
 It's better to go on the faster and more accurate path, right?

419
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,780
-  I am paying you back.
 - Pay me back?

420
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:22,220
Thank you for helping me last time. I am not the type to owe someone.

421
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,580
All my study know-how is in it, so use it well.

422
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,250
Thank you.

 What is the answer then?

436
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:17,290
 They used the military

437
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,850
 to fight against the Yuan Dynasty. This is what we call the Mongol Invasions of Korea.

447
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:04,390
 College Scholastic Ability Test held today is said to have been harder than the previous years.

448
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,740
 In particular, the math section will determine the discrimination ability of the top students.

449
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,860
 For this reason, students who did well in the mathematics section...

450
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,300
What is the mathematics section?

451
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,250
Math. Math!

452
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,220
Oh, I thought it was something to fix.

Gyu Ri will be on the news this time.

460
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,140
Did she get a perfect score? Really?

461
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,800
Wow. Amazing. I am jealous. Good for you!

I'm glad to run into you. I was curious.

470
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,580
Did you do well on the exam?

471
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,700
I will let you know when I get my score.

472
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,190
Okay. I am sure the result will be good since you studied hard.

00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,480
What are you going to do now?

474
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,790
I want to work part-time more.

475
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,470
- A part-time job?
 -  Yes.

476

00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,210
 Since you're going to work anyway,

478
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,720
 my brother's office is looking to hire someone for document assistance.

479
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,260
 I think it'll suit you well.

480
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,890
 KMS Law Firm's Head Attorney Kang Min Seok.

481
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,040
 In the past life, he was famous for a high winning rate.

482
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,240
 I can't believe he was Teacher Min Gyeong's brother.

483
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,500
Kim Hui Wu?

484
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,800
Yes.

485
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Nice to meet you.

486
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,770
Hello.

487
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,690
I heard about you from my sister. She said you're smart, and you want to major in law at Hankuk University.

488
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,650
So, do you have any interest in this field?

489
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,330
I have an interest in law, so I have read a few books related to it.

490
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:36,430
Even if it's moderately related to law, it's quite difficult. You must know more than I thought.

491
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,190
Work won't be hard here.

492
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,890
Assisting Chief Seo to organize documents, preparing for meetings, and submitting documents to the court from time to time.

493
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,320
Yes. It's not at all hard. I will work hard.

494
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,960
While you are working, if you want any law-related help, come to me anytime.

495
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,110
Yes, sir.

496
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,630
Let's work well together.

497
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,540
I put myself in your hands.

498
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,450
This case is going to be an iconic one for our law firm.

499
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,950
But, our opponent is Cheonha Group.

500
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,320
It's dangerous. They are formidable.

501
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,880
Why would environmental groups use us as legal representatives?

502
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,830
Because they think we can fight against Cheonha Group.

503
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,770
CEO, sir!

504
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,850
They want to destroy a mountain and build a resort. We should stop it for sure.

505
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,850
I would understand if Cheongpoong Mountain was famous.

506
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,700
 Cheongpoongsan?

507
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,170
 The lawsuit that took five years?

508
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,830
Are you going against Cheonha Group?

509
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,680
Even public opinion won't be on our side.

510
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,850
That's right.

511
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,120
We can't do this, sir.

512
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,470
Crisis is an opportunity.

513
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,390
It will be difficult, but we have to do it at any cost.

514
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,400
Sir, please think carefully.

515
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,210
Please reconsider.

516
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,110
By putting KMS's fate on the line,

517
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:38,170
let's try it. We can do it.

518
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,380
  It's described as an "endangered plant."

519
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,420
  Callipogon relictus

520
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,430
  Callipogon relictus

521
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,380
  A rare 4mm creature that stopped a 9-trillion won mining development project.

522
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,170
  Callipogon relictus.

523
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,740
 Endangered Wildlife Class 1.

524
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,920
Gwangneung Yogang Flower. Endangered Class 1 Protected Species.

525
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,350
Listed in the critical category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's World Red List.

526
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:36,780
A large-scale colony of endangered species of mimosa.

527
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,120
All of these are on Cheongpoong Mountain.

528
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,830
Development or ecosystem conservation? With this, let's fight a winning case.

529
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:47,110
 Kang Min Seok will become a star with this lawsuit.

530
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,200
 He will fight and win against the Cheonha Group.

531
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,290
 He created an opportunity for environmental evaluation to be strengthened in domestic developments projects.

532
00:38:54,290 --> 00:39:00,420
Our part-time worker did everything he should, as well as things he didn't need to.

533
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,990
You make it impossible for me not to compensate you beyond the salary.

534
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,410
Pardon?

535
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,720
I thought cash would be best.

536
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,660
You are wise!

537
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,410
 â‚©1,000,000

538
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,810
But this is too much.

539
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,930
Because I am a big person.

540
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,650
You are wise!

541
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,530
Thank you!

542
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,160
  Check Application Status for Hanguk University

543
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,110
  Checking for the result

544
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,820
Why is it taking so long?!

545
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,060
  Checking for the result

546
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,290
  Congratulations.
 Mr. Kim Hui Wu is accepted into the Department of Law at Hanguk University.

547
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,240
Passed? Passed!

548
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,210
Passed!

549
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,140
 Hankuk University Law School
 Law Students Gathering

550
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,680
It's still the same here.

551
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,170
Is Gyu Ri still not here yet?

552
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:52,660
It's been a while, Professor Min Byong San.

553
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,880
  Civil Code

554
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,980
Civil law is not a science.

555
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,940
Civil law is not a science.

556
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:07,100
It is a user's guide that people of this generation should follow with common sense.

557
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,270
Now, for example.

558
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:13,870
One student rented a room which was the subject of a mortgage of thirty million won.

559
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,360
The student was later in priority than the mortgage.

560
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,500
But the house was at auction.

561
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,280
Also, the winning bid was even lower than the indebtedness secured by the mortgage.

562
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,540
So this student couldn't get his deposit back.

563
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,960
What will you do in this situation?

564
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,950
You have no choice but to give up.

565
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:37,530
If you knew that you were in later priority and signed the lease, then I think there's no way to get out of it.

566
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,750
Does anyone have a different opinion?

567
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,640
I'll get the deposit back.

568
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,870
- Get the deposit back?
 - Yes.

569
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,430
How?

570
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,800
The market price for the deposits for rooms around colleges isn't that high.

571
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,910
So even if the house went into auction,

572
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,540
you can get a minimum award under the Small Amount Housing Lease Protection Act.

573
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,820
- Also...
 - Also?

574
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,380
You don't have to pay the rent during the auction period, so it's more beneficial.

575
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,810
On top of that, you can even receive the moving expenses when the owner asks you to vacate.

576
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:18,560
He's pretty good. He gave a more detailed answer than I did.

577
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,540
It's an answer that's hard to get from a freshmen class.

578
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,780
That's correct. What you just said is the Civil Code.

579
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:30,400
If you know, then it'll protect you from the danger that might come at any time.

580
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,330
You! What's your name?

581
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,920
I'm Kim Hui Wu.

582
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,890
Kim Hui Wu?

583
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,400
Kim Hui Wu.

584
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,680
That's all for today!

585
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,120
Thank you so much!

586
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,230
I guess you studied a lot to get in.

587
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,130
Nice to meet you. I'm Park Seung Hwan.

588
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,450
Yes, nice to meet you. I'm Kim Hui Wu.

589
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,370
You know there's a freshmen welcome party tonight, right?

590
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,320
Seonbae Choi Kang Jin said we should all gather.

591
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,400
- Choi Kang Jin?
 - The student president of the law school, Seonbae Choi Kang Jin.

592
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,610
Choi Kang Jin...

593
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:10,600
Are you going to go there? What's so big a deal about seniors?

594
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,150
Who are you?

595
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,910
Me? I'm Lee Min Su.

596
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,500
Ah, yes.

597
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,690
Hello, I'm a freshman, Kim Hui Wu.

598
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:23,030
I know you, Kim Hui Wu.

599
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,280
- We are in the same year, let's be friends.
 - I'm sorry?

600
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,650
Is that something that surprising? Do you think it's a loss for you?

601
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,460
Of course not.

602
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,810
You don't look that young either.

603
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,500
So are you going?

604
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,470
- He said everybody should definitely come.
 - That makes me definitely not go.

605
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:38,920
Sure, you don't have to come.

606
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,240
- Also, the dress code is business suits.
 - That's ridiculous. I'm not coming.

607
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,250
Again, you don't have to come.

608
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,890
Also, Seonbae Jang Il Hyeon, who was the top of the class at the Judicial Research and Training Institute, is coming too.

609
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,220
Jang Il Hyeon?

610
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,410
Does that make your heart move?

611
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,950
Yes.

612
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,990
How am I supposed to watch people being pretentious?

613
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,190
You said you are not coming.

614
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,420
How can I not go when my friend is going?

615
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,670
Who said he's your friend?

616
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,120
He's not saying anything. Why are you bothered about that?

617
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,320
Wait, Hui Wu. Let's go get some coffee.

618
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,030
- All of a sudden?
 - Yes.

619
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,170
- Why don't you hang out with your friends?
 - You are my friend.

620
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,660
- Let's go.
 - Since when?

621
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,370
From today!

622
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:12,780
How can he be so self-centered?

623
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,380
How far are we going for a coffee?

624
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,170
There were a lot of coffee shops in front of the school.

625
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,100
My friend. Even if it's just a cup of coffee, drink it with class.

626
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,670
There's a national barista called the Alchemist of Coffee.

627
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:25,510
The taste of coffee is amazingâ€”

628
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:29,000
You evil wench! How dare you come in here?

629
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,940
How dare you come here?

630
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,370
Honey...

631
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,130
Excuse me?

632
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:38,170
- Honey!
 - Oh my, me?

633
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,220
Are you saying that to me?

634
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,860
I'm sorry. She's suffering from dementia.

635
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,760
I'm okay.

636
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,340
I went out for a second to get some medicine.

637
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:57,360
So I told you just to leave it by the door when I'm not home.

638
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,320
It's not good if the food gets cold.

639
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,030
Also, it's not good for you to have cold food .

640
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,140
You got a stomach ache after having cold food the other time.

641
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,310
It's because I'm sorry.

642
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:08,000
How many times has this happened already?

643
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,440
I'm okay.

644
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,330
Here. It's still warm.

645
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,770
Please take this home and have it with your wife.
   Lunchbox of Love, Faith Welfare Foundation

646
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,800
Thank you.

647
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,190
Have a nice day.

648
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,370
Let's meet in our next life.

649
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,350
See you!

650
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,320
Lunchbox of Love.

651
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,660
So you are a lunchbox delivery volunteer for the vulnerable group?

652
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,930
Yes.

653
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,650
Wait, let me see your back.

654
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,780
Oh? You are an angel without wings.

655
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,290
Anyway, thank you.

656
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:43,930
I thought I was really going to be beaten with that broomstick.

657
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,790
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.

658
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:52,460
It's a precious connection that we have by the broomstick. Why don't we talk about it more

659
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,410
with drinks and meat in front of usâ€”

660
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,950
I'm late!

661
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,420
Bye! Thank you for helping me today!

662
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,430
Bye!

663
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,850
She's really moving my heart.

664
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,950
I'll save it in my heart!

665
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,810
What is it? How do you know this already?

666
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,160
This thing? I've been doing it for a long time. Do you want me to do it for you, too? Save in my heart!

667
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,950
I mean... Really?

668
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,410
Then is it not real?

669
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:24,820
It's very confusing...

 2008 Welcome Night For Freshmen

672
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,520
Thank you.

673
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,520
  Welcome night for Freshmen of the Department of Law

674
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,610
  Kim Hui Wu

675
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,040
You came.

676
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,360
Yes.

677
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,130
Excuse me for a second.

678
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,270
Congratulations.

679
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,650
Hello, Sunbaenim!

680
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,690
Yes, Seung Hwan!

681
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,540
  Choi Kang Jin?

682
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,630
  This is Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin, whom I talked about before.

683
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,160
  Why don't you introduce yourself to him properly?

684
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,470
  Hello, sir.

685
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:39,350
  Yes, nice to meet you. Let's work well together.

686
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:44,180
  He's very trustworthy.

687
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,730
  You are such a good-looking man.

688
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,430
  You have to work very hard from now on.

689
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:53,250
  This election wasn't a victory for me, Choi Kang Jin,

690
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,530
  but for all of you who voted for me.

691
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,970
  I'll be the Assemblyman who represents truth and justice.

692
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:06,520
  I'll make a warm society where we can embrace the vulnerable and underrepresented groups of people!

693
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,260
  Choi Kang Jin. He started as a prosecutor,

694
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:13,610
  then a human-rights lawyer, and became an Assemblyman. A piece of trash.

695
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,390
Good to see you.

696
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:19,640
Is he a freshman?

697
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:26,510
Yes, I'm Kim Hui Wu.

698
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,300
Oh, yes. I heard about you from Seung Hwan.

699
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:36,650
Some freshmen think passing the bar exam is all there is and don't care about school life.

700
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:40,120
That's not true. It's good to come out to these gatherings.

701
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,580
I'll engrave that on my heart, Sunbaenim.

702
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:47,350
Right. That way, you can broaden your connections. You can pull and push each other in the world.

703
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,210
Also, you can close your eyes to each other and scheme things together.

704
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:53,420
That way, you can stuff each other's stomachs. It's stuff like that.

705
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,970
Why don't you have some manners?

706
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,260
Are you back at school, Lee Min Su?

707
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,080
- Yes, I came back because I missed you. Have you been well?
 - It sucks.

708
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,990
- I can hear you.
 - I said it for you to hear it.

709
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,830
Sunbae Kang Jin is a senior. How do you know each other?

710
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:06,290
He got into medical school when I came into law school.

711
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,980
Also, we graduated high school together.

712
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,710
I guess you didn't like fine art and music school.

713
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,360
You are right. And I need to figure out law school after spending some time here.

714
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,760
  Lee Min Su. I didn't know this person in my previous life.

715
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,120
  I guess my past changed, so he appeared in my life?

716
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,970
Now, our Hanguk University Department of Law's remarkable!

717
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,150
Please welcome, Seonbae Jang Il Hyeon!

718
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:30,340
  Welcome night for Freshmen of Hanguk University Department of Law

719
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,600
Welcome, Sunbaenim.

720
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:47,520
Hello, my dear Hanguk University Department of Law students. I'm Jang Il Hyeon.

721
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,630
  Jang Il Hyeon.

722
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:51,220
  You stupid dumb punk!

723
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:55,060
  How dare you dig into Jo Tae Seob?

724
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,920
  He's a great man doing big work. Who do you think you are!

725
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,710
  How dare you make an issue out of insignificant things!

726
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,490
  Under the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes, bribery,

727
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,690
  embezzlement of government projects, abuse of authority...

728
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:10,760
  Besides these, he also has more than ten minor charges.

729
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,390
  Do you want me to report this to you?

730
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,240
  This punk...

731
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,530
  You are such a dummy.

732
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:21,110
  Hey, he can do that in his position.

733
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:25,760
  If you keep acting out this way, you'll be the one who goes to jail.

734
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,380
  Just shut your mouth quiet, you punk!

735
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,660
We will protect our nation's rights through the law

736
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,710
and make people's daily lives comfortable.

737
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:39,920
I hope you all have a good time tonight with your friends and alumni and share your dreams together.

738
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:46,820
  Welcome Night for Freshmen

739
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,120
I think you are not suited for events like this.

740
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,890
I'm like that, too.

741
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:57,060
People are all being so pretentious.

742
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,890
It feels like I'm standing in the middle of a sandstorm.

743
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,240
When you inhale a lot of dust,

744
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,440
you have to have some greasy meat and a glass of soju.

745
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,690
- Let's go. If you buy it, then it's better.
 - Oh, no.

746
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,700
- Oh, you're getting it for me?
 - I didn't say that.

747
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,860
- Thank you for the meal.
 - What?

748
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:17,020
No, wait.

749
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,300
I said, no!

750
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,210
Hurry up and come!

751
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,920
  What's up with that person?

752
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,910
â™«   Chicken and beer   â™«

753
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:33,070
â™«   Shall we have a fried chicken and beer?    â™«

754
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:34,860
Why do you study?

755
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,100
What?

756
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:40,080
Then let me ask it this way. Do you want to be successful?

757
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,500
Does it look that way?

758
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,630
Yes.

759
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:48,650
Of course. I have to be successful.

760
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,350
How high do you want to go?

761
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:51,490
What?

762
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:55,070
As I think about it, I have the world in my hands.

763
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,730
I wonder if I should squeeze them shut or open them up.

764
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:00,370
Not laughing?

765
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:04,860
Usually, you laugh when I say stuff like this and say stop reading comics.

766
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,370
No, no.

767
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,820
I also think the same way.

768
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:12,920
I knew it.  When I first met you, I felt we were alike.

769
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,420
We must be a perfect match. Want to marry me?

770
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,800
Do you want to marry me?

771
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,420
What kind of thinking is that?

772
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:26,560
Since at our school, you were the only person who could tolerate me.

773
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,630
- No.
 - You!

774
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:28,610
I don't like it.

775
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,200
Stop it.

776
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,060
Anyway, med school, art and music school...

777
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:37,360
In general, didn't you find it difficult to study?

778
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,090
There's nothing as easy and fulfilling to me as studying.

779
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,880
So easy.

780
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,080
The world is a tough place and people have a hard time, right?

781
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,620
  Lee Min Su. I wonder what kind of change he would bring from now on.

782
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,990
  I can't picture it at all.

783
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,350
Hey!

784
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,630
- Why do you take a picture of women's legs?
 - What?

785
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:08,000
You just took a photo of a part-timer girl who just passed by. You pervert!

786
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,690
- Do you have evidence?
 - Yes.

787
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,990
Your phone.

788
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,430
Oh? She's the one who I saved in my heart.

789
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:16,940
You asked me if I had evidence. It's on your phone!

790
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:21,210
She was a humanist before, but she's a warrior here.

791
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,690
Why would I give my phone to you? Are you crazy?

792
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:27,020
Unless you want to see real craziness, give me your phone now.

793
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,300
Are you not going to shut up?

794
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,130
You are an embarrassment. Why don't you take off the school jacket?

795
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,900
Hey, Hey!!

796
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,240
- What?
 - I said, shut up.

797
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,420
Shut your mouth up!

798
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,720
Don't we need to go and stop him?

799
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,370
Hello, there's a fight in the college pub in front of the front gate of Hanguk University.

800
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:44,400
I think you have to hurry up.

801
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,810
You are beyond my expectations as well. It's a very not cool way to deal with it.

802
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,500
This is the real way to help her.

803
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,120
If it escalates after we try to help her, what will you do then?

804
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,580
- That's true.
 - Yes.
 - Shall we wait and see?

805
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:59,650
Jeez. Stop acting out when you are nothing.

806
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,500
- Where are you going?
 - Damn. Jeez.

807
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,110
Hey, student, this is not right.

808
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,590
Police are coming, so please calm down.

809
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:12,330
What? Police?

810
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:15,130
Let me go, you bastard. Who are you?

811
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,860
Who are you to interfere with this?

812
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,400
Just go on your way.

813
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:27,140
Hey, you. You are more than disgraceful right now.

814
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,600
So just stay quiet until the police come. Okay?

815
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,810
I understand.

816
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:35,700
Please, please.

817
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,300
You bastard, it's a lucky day for you!

818
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,020
Why are you stumbling on my feet by yourself?

819
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,400
We got a report.

820
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,460
- Yes, he's the bad guy.
 - I didn't do anything!

821
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,020
It's not me!

822
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,680
I really didn't do anything!

823
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,360
We meet again.

824
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,170
Cheers.

825
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,950
It's really unavoidable, I think.

826
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:25,070
I think it's called meant to be. You can't escape from it.

827
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,780
Does my face have anything on it?

828
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,800
No. I am sorry.

829
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,450
I was just thinking about something else.

830
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:38,540
- From what I heard you say before, are you a Hanguk University student?
 - Yes.

831
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,240
- We are also at the same university.
 - Are you going to Hanguk University as well?

832
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,230
- We are both freshmen in Law School.
 - Oh, really?

833
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:46,350
I'm a freshman in Computer Science. I'm Kim Hui Ah.

834
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:49,030
I'm Kim Hui Wu. I'm 21 years old because I took the college entrance exam twice.

835
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:51,980
I'm also 21 years old and took the college entrance exam twice.

836
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,520
KIm Hui Wu,  Kim Hui Ah.

837
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,500
Our names look similar too.

838
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,040
It is really meant to be. I can't avoid it.

839
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,200
That's what I said.

840
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,260
Then, since we are the same age, let's talk comfortably.

841
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,170
You are very progressive! I'm Lee Min Su. It's nice to meet you.

842
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,450
I'm Hui Wu's friend, so you can talk comfortably to me as well.

843
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,220
I think we should drink properly.

844
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:13,270
I feel like you are pretending not to hear me the whole time.

845
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:19,450
Okay. Since two of my same school friends helped me today, I'll pay for tonight.

846
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,610
- Oh, I like it very much.  Okay.
 - Okay.

847
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,960
- Cheer.
 - Cheer.

848
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,800
You are not listening to me for sure.

849
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,920
Why are you keep looking at me like that?

850
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,150
It's because you look a bit familiar.

851
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:40,180
You can hear that lame line from him?

852
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:43,210
But you look familiar to me as well.

853
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,360
Wow, how can you take that old line from him?

854
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,180
  She does look familiar somehow, but I don't remember her.

855
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:58,430
  Who is she?

856
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,970
  Bus 278: Going to Anguk-dong, Ganghwamun

857
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:01,960

858
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:21,320
â™«  Dear, All your things you've done  â™«

859
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,820
â™«   We are here to wreck it up   â™«

860
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:30,910
â™«  Who knows, how will it go?  â™«

861
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:38,290
â™«  Hiding in black and white  â™«

862
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:41,680
â™«   We are here to find the truth   â™«

863
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,810
â™«  Give up, I warn you so  â™«

864
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:56,670
â™«  Who would ever find out who you really are? Hm  â™«

865
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:05,150
â™«  You'll never know that I will throw off your disguise  â™«

866
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:07,680
â™«  Oh let me show you how to start  â™«

867
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,760
â™«   Wait, Till the end  â™«

868
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,320
â™«    I don't care what they say  â™«

869
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:21,950
â™«  At the end, They'll know there's no where to hide  â™«

870
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:26,470
â™«  Oh I'll wait for now   â™«

871
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:29,030
  Again My Life

872
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:30,740
â™«  Let them get what they want  â™«

873
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,710
  Why did this happen? It's driving me crazy.

874
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:35,520
  It's because I thought of a good move.

875
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,180
  We decided to accept you into our secret club in the Department of Law.

876
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:43,080
  If my eyes are correct, she can be Jo Tae Seob's target at any time.

877
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,270
â™«  There's nowhere you could hide  â™«

878
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:50,610
â™«  We are here to find you out   â™«

879
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,480
  Again My Life
