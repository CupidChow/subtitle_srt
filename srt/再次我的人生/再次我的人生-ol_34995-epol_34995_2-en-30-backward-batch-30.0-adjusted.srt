1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,950

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,510
 Lee Joon Gi

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,890
 Lee Kyung Young

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,650
 Kim Ji Eun

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,040
 Again My Life

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,440
Get out of the way!

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,100
No!

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,170
Mom?

9
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,370
Dad?

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,910
  There were so many ways I could have saved my parents.

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,040
  But the arrogance of believing that I could change fate led them to die anyway.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,790
  Hey, Mom.

13
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,180
  Can you stay home from work today?

14
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,250
 Why? Is something happening?

15
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,400
 I'm taking today off too.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,750
  - Maybe together we can—
 - Even if you take the day off we still have to go to work.

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,020
  - We work 24/7.
 - Exactly.

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,760
  I should have tried insisting while holding their hands.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,100
  No.

20
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,540
  Even if I had to cause an accident, I should have made sure that they couldn't leave for the factory.

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,880
  I should have realized that I might become a variable to cause the driver to turn the steering wheel.

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,470
 No, I should have pushed my parents a little closer to the sidewalk.

23
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,560
  Am I to end up alone again like this?

24
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,920
 Hui Wu! Hui Wu!

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,150
 - Hui Wu, where are you?
 - Hui Wu?

26
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,810
 Hui Wu!

27
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,390
Mom! Dad!

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,700
- Are you okay?
 - Hui Wu, are you hurt?

29
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,310
Mom, are you okay?

30
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,180
- Are you hurt?
 - Are you okay?

31
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,610
Try moving. Try lifting your arms.

32
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,830
Why are you worrying about me? You two are hurt!

33
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,210
Mom, this won't do. Hurry and get on my back. Let's go to the hospital.

34
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,870
No, I'm okay. I was just a little shocked.

35
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,460
Are you sure you didn't get hit by any glass?

36
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,240
Dad, you're the one who got hurt, I said.

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,550
- You're bleeding.
 - Bleeding?

38
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,910
Darn, I got hurt.

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,550
I did.

40
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,440
 Episode 2

41
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,950
Mom, let's go to the hospital just to be safe.

42
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,310
I'm really okay.

43
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,370
But what happened to the driver?

44
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,580
I know, I think he might be badly injured.

45
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,810
Stay here. I'll go check.

46
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,470
Okay.

47
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,920
Are you okay?

48
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,150
I'm just a little roughed up.

49
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,220
 I'll finally get to see

50
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,890
 the hit-and-run assailant who killed my parents.

51
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,790
 - He died? Are you sure?
 - Yes.

52
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,110
- Did anything about him stand out?
 - It looks like a DUI.

53
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,890
- Drunk driving?
 - Yes.

54
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,660
He reeked of alcohol.

55
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,230
Hello, sir.

56
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,250
- What happened?
 - Well... That...

57
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,980
Gosh!!

58
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,150
  Kim Jin Wu?

59
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,160
 Why would Kim Jin Wu be here?

60
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,780
Please move aside, we have a patient coming through!

61
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,050
  The smell of alcohol is so strong.

62
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,880
 Is that...

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,600
  Jo Hyeon Seok?

64
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,040
  I finally have the missing piece.

65
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,660
 Jo Hyeon Seok. Jo Tae Seop's son.

66
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,960
  It's nice to meet you.

67
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,800
  Mr. Kim?

68
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,510
  I freely did a background check on you.

69
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,810
 You lost your parents to a hit and run accident while you were young.

70
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,430
 With lower-level grades, accepted to the Department of Law at Hankuk University after three exam attempts.

71
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,910
  You were even a martial artist when you took the bar (exams).

72
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,710
  On top of that, you're handsome too.

73
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,570
  Very handsome.

74
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,340
  You don't need to be this good looking if you're already so accomplished, but somehow you achieved that too!

75
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,750
 Anyway, as a rising political star,

76
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,880
 you're overflowing with talent.

77
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,790
 My father,  Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop, will undoubtedly back you, too.

78
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,590
 Just take one step forward.

79
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,480
 The rest will follow.

80
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,450
 What a brazen jerk.

81
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,110
 He already knew who I was.

82
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,840
 Ambulance

83
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,380
 Fabricating and hiding the accident records.

84
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,400
 That was due to Jo Tae Seop's power.

85
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,440
Excuse me?

86
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,330
We'll need a witness statement. Would you mind coming to the station?

87
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,710
Sure.

88
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,040
Excuse me.

89
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,990
I'll do it.

90
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,760
I'm his father. I was also at the scene.

91
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,910
I'm also a victim.

92
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,430
Okay. Then I'll ask for your cooperation.

93
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,680
Come with me.

94
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,880
Are you going to be okay, Dad?

95
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,770
I'll be okay. Take your mom home and get some rest.

96
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,620
Yes.

97
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,150
  I changed fate. I protected my parents.

98
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,180
 And Jo Tae Seop lost his son.

99
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,580
 He'll probably be an even more cold-blooded madman than he was before.

100
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,570
 I know

101
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,860
 since I became that way

102
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,220
 when I lost my parents.

103
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,640
 Again My Life

104
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,850
- You worked hard Seok Hun.
 - I only did my job.

105
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,390
Thanks to you, I was able to protect my son's honor.

106
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,420
We've made sure to secure all information related to the accident.

107
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,110
So, please don't worry about that.

108
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,610
Okay.

109
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,570
I cannot fathom the depth of your grief, and for that, I apologize.

110
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,980
I'm sure it'll get better in time.

111
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,560
What can I do? It's not something that can be undone.

112
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,930
For everything you've done for me,

113
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,680
I'll be sure to repay you. You should receive good news soon.

114
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,830
Thank you, sir.

115
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,240
Only up to today...

116
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,090
That's right. I should think back on it and be sad only up to today

117
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,090
and let my son, Hyeon Seok, go.

118
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,160
Tomorrow, I have to go back and work for the people again.

119
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,820
- Yes, sir.
 - Thank you for all your hard work.

120
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,610
You ate jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) earlier. Why are you hungry again?

121
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,420
- Stop eating you pig!
  - Let me have a cigarette.

122
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,410
Hey, go buy some cigarettes.

123
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,960
- Just give me one. You have some right?
 - Hey, get me a lighter.

124
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,130
You are cool! Woohoo!!

125
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,420
- Get me some chocolate milk!
 - And a cookie!

126
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,830
Welcome.

127
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,470
Cigarettes.

128
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,320
I heard that you were studying. Why? To go to college?

129
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,190
 Hey, you worm-like bastard. How dare you tell on me to the homeroom teacher?

130
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,190
 But your father is a factory worker and mine is a police chief.

131
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,250
 How unfair! It must feel so unfair for you!

132
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,730
Bastard. Are your ears blocked?

133
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,710
Look at that stare.

134
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,400
Why? Are you going to hit me?

135
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,710
Wow, you're so damn whiny!

136
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,980
That's enough. Let's go.

137
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,820
Hui Wu. Study hard and make sure to get into college.

138
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,000
Become an important person.

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,570
- Who? This idiot?
 - I said, let's go.

140
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,670
The others are waiting.

141
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,630
Hey. Watch that stare of yours.

142
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,950
Once a gofer, always a gofer.

143
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,870
Where did you graduate from that you dare to look at me that way?

144
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,340
Stay strong.

145
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,310
I need to hold back and keep it together.

146
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,250
 Kim Hui Wu. Come to the faculty office.

147
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,770
Hey, Hui Wu, you're here!

148
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,980
Say hello. He is the director.

149
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,260
- Hello.
 - Nice to meet you, student Kim Hui Wu.

150
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,080
You are the one who came first in the mock exams.

151
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,820
 Congratulations.

152
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,970
For the first time since the academy was established, a student in the lowest grade class

153
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,220
overtook his peers from Hankuk University and came in first.

154
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,900
From today, move to the Hankuk University class.

155
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,610
Yes, sir.

156
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,180
- Is it you?
 -  Kim Gyu Ri?

157
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,820
First at the academy.

158
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,780
Ohh.. yeah.

159
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,420
What's your secret? I would have never believed it was possible.

160
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,470
- What's so funny?
 - Nothing.

161
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,250
Anyway, congrats.

162
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:08,110
I'm sure it'll be your first and last time. No compromises next time.

163
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,910
Are you okay health-wise?

164
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,590
- What are you saying?
 - Eat well.

165
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,690
Don't eat things like that.

166
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,560
Hey, cigarettes.

167
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,620
There's no cigarette for 1000 won.

168
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,350
- Why are you laughing?
 - Because you are.

169
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,160
So it's true that you changed, just like I heard.

170
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,440
Hurry up and give it to me. I don't have time.

171
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
Time? More like money.

172
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,370
And, no cigarette costs 1000 won.

173
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,250
This bastard, gosh!!

174
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,010
- Huh? Did you just avoid me?
 - Yeah, I did.

175
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,670
- Why should I get hit?
 - If you avoid it, you'll get hit more.

176
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,090
Then try hitting me, you lunatic.

177
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,980
This punk...

178
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,990
Why aren't you coming out already? What are you doing?

179
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,790
Hey! Let's take it outside.

180
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,010
Deal.

181
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,900
Seriously!

182
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,460
Kim Hui Wu, why do you have to give up on life in front of me?

183
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,390
Why is it me of all people? Why are you trying to make me a murderer?

184
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,220
I won't die. Don't worry.

185
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,180
And even if you get caught and locked up,

186
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,340
punks like you only get about six months for a petty offense.

187
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,520
What is he saying? What the hell is this bastard saying?

188
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,740
What?

189
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,590
Gosh, this punk...

190
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,750
Let go! Let go, you punk.

191
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,050
W-W-Wait. Let go. I'm fine.

192
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,660
How dare you, punk?!

193
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,660
Stay back! Stay back! Hold on, hold on. Damn it.

194
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,180
Let go. I said, let go, you bastard.

195
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,090
Let go!

196
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,960
 Did that punk just tickle me?

197
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,820
Hold on.

198
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,950
Are you a pervert? Why are you tickling me?

199
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,310
I'm begging you. Can't you just leave today?

200
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,550
Just go. Okay?

201
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,570
How dare this bastard bite the master without any fear?

202
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,390
 Are you out of your mind now just because you graduated from school?

203
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,280
I didn't bite him. I just tickled him for a second.

204
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,300
- What is he saying?
 - Th-That's actually true.

205
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,280
- What?
 - I mean, th-this bastard—

206
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,870
You moron. Come here, you bastard.

207
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,050
Go kill him!

208
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,430
 Catch him.

209
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,130
What are you doing? Why are you closing your eyes?

210
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,890
To feel it?

211
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,140
I'm going to kill you for real.

212
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,160
Let's stop now, okay?

213
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,090
If I keep going, you might pee your pants. No?

214
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,750
-  College?
 - Yes.

215
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,430
What is your father's name?

216
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,580
Kim Chan Seong.

217
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,770
Our son is saying he wants to go to college?

218
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,160
Yes. I am studying hard while going to the academy.

219
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,920
What about the p-p-part-time job?

220
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,720
- While working.
 - When are you sleeping?

221
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,090
You don't have to worry about my health.

222
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,280
So, what's your goal?

223
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,620
The Department of Law in Hankuk University.

224
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,960
You're scaring me now. What the hell have we done wrong?

225
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:26,530
Hui Wu, come on. Let's start over and talk seriously.

226
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,090
Okay.

227
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,580
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

228
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,230
- Here it is.
 - What is this? Grade card?

229
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,140
- Did you do well?
 - Yes.

230
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,900
I placed first at the academy.

231
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,690
First place? Why?

232
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,250
- What do you mean why?
 - Watch it!

233
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,950
How dare you lie to us? Just because we don't know how to read the grade card.

234
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,500
Our son placed first? Someone from our family is first place?

235
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,160
Did you cheat?

236
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,240
It's a crime to cheat this much!

237
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,900
I didn't! I studied hard for this. Dad, I swear.

238
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,920
Honey, let's have a family meeting. Without him, just us.

239
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,430
How can someone from our family place first? How?

240
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,560
 Assemblyman Jo Tae Seob of the Democratic Party has announced

241
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,320
 his candidacy for the national convention to elect the next party president.

242
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,980
 He held a press conference today at the National Assembly's Democratic Party

243
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,890
 and expressed his intent to run as the party's candidate for president,

244
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,620
 saying he will do everything to create a new Republic of Korea.

245
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,330
 In a situation where inequality and polarization are intensifying...

246
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,370
 Time is flowing according to my memories.

247
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,620
 All the incidents from my past are really happening.

248
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,160
 The fateful time that must be stopped is also approaching.

249
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,460
 Three months later.

250
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,520
 What is this? Why did the lights go off?

251
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,250
I can't see anything.

252
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,230
 What's this?

253
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,270
Could it be... today?

254
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,620
 On that day, thunder and lightning struck, and there was a power outage, too.

255
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,380
 Pharmacy

256
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,980
 I am sure it's somewhere here.

257
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,430
 The academy alley in front of the pharmacy.

258
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,890
 Rensol Pharmacy.

259
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,220
 Pharmacy

260
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,070
Kim Gyu Ri!

261
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,980
You are up. Are you conscious?

262
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,790
Did you bring me here?

263
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,410
Yeah.

264
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,490
- Thanks.
 - You need to take care of yourself.

265
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,170
I'm thankful, but it's not something you need to worry about.

266
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,850
If you are sleepy, just sleep.

267
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,020
 Instead of taking these.

268
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,410
It's not that I didn't sleep. I reduced it as much as I can with this.

269
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,650
- What do you get by forcibly sleeping less?
 - I study.

270
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,180
- What after studying?
 - Get into a good college.

271
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,990
- What after getting into a good college?
 - I will think about that once I get there.

272
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,180
For now, it's important that I don't disappoint my parents.

273
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,800
Is it your goal to satisfy your parents at every step?

274
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,470
I didn't say I was doing it for them.

275
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,960
You're not?

276
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,030
I am grateful to them, that's all.

277
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,470
It's true. Parents are usually people we are grateful for.

278
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,520
- You can just be grateful for them, too.
 - What do you mean?

279
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,790
For your parents, you are just their child.

280
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,900
They wouldn't think of you as adopted.

281
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,180
What are you? How did you know?

282
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,660
Because they are good people who adopted you, you feel burdened and are obsessed.

283
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,120
You even ruined your health. Would they want all this?

284
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,400
Don't try to pay back in the wrong way.

285
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,390
At least for your sake.

286
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,030
True. This is not right.

287
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,890
 In the past, Gyu Ri was someone who always placed first.

288
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,600
Good-bye.

289
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,560
Thank you.

290
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,840
- I heard Gyu Ri fainted.
 - Yes.

291
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,230
I heard that's why she couldn't take the entrance exam. Where did she faint?

292
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,820
In the academy alley in front of the pharmacy.

293
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,930
I just came back from the hospital.

294
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,810
The aftereffect is severe because she was found late.

295
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,150
But, why did she faint?

296
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,220
They say it's from an overdose of stimulants.

297
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,630
I think she took too many stimulants when she got sleepy and didn't eat enough.

298
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,220
 Department of Law at Hankuk University. You can do this! Don't give up till the end.

299
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,580
 Kim Gyu Ri

300
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,790
 Department of Law at Hankuk University. You can do this! Don't give up till the end.

301
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,720
 Rumors said that Gyu Ri went on to attend Law School at Hankuk University.

302
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,380
 But I had never heard Kim Gyu Ri's name in both Hankuk University and the Law community.

303
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,190
 I wonder why?

304
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,240
 Today, her fate was changed through me.

305
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,110
 What would Gyu Ri's future be like?

306
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,210
Jong Il, do you know what this is?

307
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,110
What is it?

308
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,680
It's a hot-ticket item these days.

309
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,920
  Just one and done.

310
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,690
Really? Good. I've been getting really tired of Han Mi playing hard to get.

311
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,350
Put one in her drink at the club later.

312
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,810
Okay.

313
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,820
Han Mi is on her way.

314
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,010
Our pathetic Kim Hui Wu, aren't you working hard.

315
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,900
Do well.

316
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,880
Bye-bye.

317
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,660
♫  I can feel love  ♫

318
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,760
♫  Feel love  ♫

319
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,260
♫  I can feel love  ♫

320
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,060
Geez.

321
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,140
♫  Feel love  ♫

322
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,160
♫  I can feel love  ♫

323
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:46,730
♫  Countless stars fill me up.
 They’re slowly looking for the light  ♫

324
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,170
♫  I can feel love  ♫

325
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,200
♫  You seep in like the Milky Way  ♫

326
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,520
Let's go see Han Mi.

327
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,380
 Wow, she is really hot.

328
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,420
 Hey, let's get a better look.

329
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,880
Gosh, these dirty bastards. Look what they're up to.

330
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,440
That punk must be crazy.

331
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,700
Look at that confidence.

332
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,330
Manners...

333
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,010
maketh...

334
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,080
man.

335
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,400
The movie hasn't been released yet, right?

336
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,630
Did I just put on a show again?

337
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,810
What is that bastard saying? You're a dead man.

338
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,990
It won't do. Today, you guys are going to get some true education.

339
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,640
What a load of crap.

340
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,530
That hurts!

341
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,620
- What happened?
 - Are you awake?

342
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,660
I asked what happened!

343
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,530
Here you go.

344
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,280
  Chief Im Jeong Wu

345
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,750
Do you guys know where you are?

346
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,180
Guys.

347
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,300
I am asking you.

348
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,840
Whatever this place is, I don't know why I am here.

349
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,310
Why criminals like you are sitting in the police chief's office,

350
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,660
I am asking you if you know why.

351
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,990
Why am I a criminal?

352
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:10,620
You reported that your drink was spiked, right? That's why we investigated it. Diligently.

353
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,370
 Thankfully, the drug packet was found in the trash.

354
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,040
Who was it?

355
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,020
What are you doing?

356
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,590
- I will pull out your eyes, you son of a—
 - Quiet!

357
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:29,640
My son also drank alcohol without knowing his friends had spiked it for fun.

358
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,540
That's why he was mentally and physically weak.

359
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:40,040
But one guy came out of nowhere and assaulted my son.  Why did you beat him?

360
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,320
I went there to save my friend. These guys didn't listen to me, so I gave them a warning.

361
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,580
I don't know if you checked the crime scene.

362
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,810
That guy threw a liquor bottle at me.

363
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,810
It broke creating a scratch on the wall.

364
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,750
Do you see this?

365
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,420
It was not a one-sided assault. Self-defense.

366
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,090
So you did beat him.

367
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:05,910
I will repeat myself. It was self-defense.

368
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,140
 Injury Certificate.

369
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,120
I heard you're hard-working. Why didn't you consider your future?

370
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:22,410
I thought I'd never see the day a police chief fabricated an incident and threatened kids.

371
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,500
Shut up!

372
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,490
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hoon, what brings you here?

373
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,250
 Kim Seok Hoon? Why is this guy here?

374
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,690
- Are you Im Jong Il?
 - Yes.

375
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,050
- You made a mistake, right?
 - I haven't done anything wrong.

376
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,530
- You haven't done anything wrong?
 - No.

377
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,330
 Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

378
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,440
 Do you have a death wish?

379
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,780
 Shinju Police Station

380
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,750
What is this? Kim Seok Hun had only one son.

381
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,260
Hey, Kim Hui Wu.

382
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,240
Let's go eat.

383
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,720
- I already ate.
 - But I didn't.

384
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,930
- So what do you want?
 - Let's eat together.

385
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,510
- I said I already ate.
 - I can't eat alone.

386
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,960
- So what about it?
 - I am saying let's eat together.

387
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,350
- I already ate.
 - What do you want me to do?

388
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,900
- Let's eat together.
 - That's right, let's eat.

389
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,370
Okay, let's eat— Wait, what?

390
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,150
Gosh, I got confused.

391
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,500
I don't want to eat. I already ate.

392
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,250
It's not me.

393
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,220
Hey, is it me then? I can tell if my stomach makes noise.

394
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,360
Hey, I want to buy you food because I am grateful. Why are you being crazy and rejecting?

395
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,050
Being obsessive about not eating together is crazy, not rejecting.

396
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,950
I'm being obsessive?

397
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,750
Hey. I just want to repay you, so why are making me look pathetic?

398
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,960
I will respectfully turn you down. Why?

399
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,190
What are you doing?

400
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,700
I can smell cigarettes.

401
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,130
I feel sick if I smell cigarettes.

402
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,570
Sorry I'm late.

403
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,410
Welcome. Deputy Chief Kim.

404
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,220
I am sorry, sir. I had to deal with something.

405
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,730
I am sure it went well since you handled it yourself.

406
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:14,680
- Yes.
 -  Every large fissure starts with a tiny crack. Be careful always.

407
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,740
I will keep that in mind.

408
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,190
So, how is it? You are the first one in your class to become a Deputy Chief Prosecutor. How are you feeling?

409
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,650
I am just thankful.

410
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,120
I will do my best so that no one crosses your path and gets in your way.

411
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,450
Just continue what you are doing now—the path you want to take.

412
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,730
Your capabilities...

413
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,180
I will form that path and fill in whatever you lack.

414
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,560
How's the taste?

415
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,710
Yes, welcome.

416
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,960
Kim Gyu Ri.

417
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,620
- What is this?
 - Summary notes.

418
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,980
 It's better to go on the faster and more accurate path, right?

419
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,780
-  I am paying you back.
 - Pay me back?

420
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:22,220
Thank you for helping me last time. I am not the type to owe someone.

421
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,580
All my study know-how is in it, so use it well.

422
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,250
Thank you.

 College Scholastic Ability Test held today is said to have been harder than the previous years.

448
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,740
 In particular, the math section will determine the discrimination ability of the top students.

 For this reason, students who did well in the mathematics section...

What is the mathematics section?

451

Math. Math!

I'm glad to run into you. I was curious.

470
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,580
Did you do well on the exam?

471
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,700
I will let you know when I get my score.

472
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,190
Okay. I am sure the result will be good since you studied hard.

473
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,480
What are you going to do now?

474
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,790
I want to work part-time more.

475
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,470
- A part-time job?
 -  Yes.

476
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,730
I want to pay my own tuition.

477
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,210
 Since you're going to work anyway,

478
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,720
 my brother's office is looking to hire someone for document assistance.

479
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,260
 I think it'll suit you well.

480
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,890
 KMS Law Firm's Head Attorney Kang Min Seok.

481
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,040
 In the past life, he was famous for a high winning rate.

482
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,240
 I can't believe he was Teacher Min Gyeong's brother.

483
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,500
Kim Hui Wu?

484
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,800
Yes.

485
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Nice to meet you.

486
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,770
Hello.

487
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,690
I heard about you from my sister. She said you're smart, and you want to major in law at Hankuk University.

488
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,650
So, do you have any interest in this field?

489
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,330
I have an interest in law, so I have read a few books related to it.

490
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:36,430
Even if it's moderately related to law, it's quite difficult. You must know more than I thought.

491
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,190
Work won't be hard here.

492
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,890
Assisting Chief Seo to organize documents, preparing for meetings, and submitting documents to the court from time to time.

493
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,320
Yes. It's not at all hard. I will work hard.

494
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,960
While you are working, if you want any law-related help, come to me anytime.

495
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,110
Yes, sir.

496
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,630
Let's work well together.

497
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,540
I put myself in your hands.

498
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,450
This case is going to be an iconic one for our law firm.

499
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,950
But, our opponent is Cheonha Group.

500
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,320
It's dangerous. They are formidable.

501
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,880
Why would environmental groups use us as legal representatives?

502
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,830
Because they think we can fight against Cheonha Group.

503
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,770
CEO, sir!

504
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,850
They want to destroy a mountain and build a resort. We should stop it for sure.

505
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,850
I would understand if Cheongpoong Mountain was famous.

506
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,700
 Cheongpoongsan?

507
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,170
 The lawsuit that took five years?

508
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,830
Are you going against Cheonha Group?

509
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,680
Even public opinion won't be on our side.

510
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,850
That's right.

511
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,120
We can't do this, sir.

512
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,470
Crisis is an opportunity.

513
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,390
It will be difficult, but we have to do it at any cost.

514
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,400
Sir, please think carefully.

515
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,210
Please reconsider.

516
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,110
By putting KMS's fate on the line,

517
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:38,170
let's try it. We can do it.

518
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,380
  It's described as an "endangered plant."

519
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,420
  Callipogon relictus

520
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,430
  Callipogon relictus

521
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,380
  A rare 4mm creature that stopped a 9-trillion won mining development project.

522
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,170
  Callipogon relictus.

523
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,740
 Endangered Wildlife Class 1.

524
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,920
Gwangneung Yogang Flower. Endangered Class 1 Protected Species.

525
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,350
Listed in the critical category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's World Red List.

526
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:36,780
A large-scale colony of endangered species of mimosa.

527
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,120
All of these are on Cheongpoong Mountain.

528
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,830
Development or ecosystem conservation? With this, let's fight a winning case.

529
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:47,110
 Kang Min Seok will become a star with this lawsuit.

530
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,200
 He will fight and win against the Cheonha Group.

531
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,290
 He created an opportunity for environmental evaluation to be strengthened in domestic developments projects.

532
00:38:54,290 --> 00:39:00,420
Our part-time worker did everything he should, as well as things he didn't need to.

533
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,990
You make it impossible for me not to compensate you beyond the salary.

534
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,410
Pardon?

535
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,720
I thought cash would be best.

536
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,660
You are wise!

537
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,410
 ₩1,000,000

538
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,810
But this is too much.

539
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,930
Because I am a big person.

540
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,650
You are wise!

541
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,530
Thank you!

542
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,160
  Check Application Status for Hanguk University

543
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,110
  Checking for the result

544
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,820
Why is it taking so long?!

545
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,060
  Checking for the result

546
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,290
  Congratulations.
 Mr. Kim Hui Wu is accepted into the Department of Law at Hanguk University.

547
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,240
Passed? Passed!

548
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,210
Passed!

549
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,140
 Hankuk University Law School
 Law Students Gathering

550
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,680
It's still the same here.

551
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,170
Is Gyu Ri still not here yet?

552
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:52,660
It's been a while, Professor Min Byong San.

553
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,880
  Civil Code

554
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,980
Civil law is not a science.

555
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,940
Civil law is not a science.

556
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:07,100
It is a user's guide that people of this generation should follow with common sense.

557
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,270
Now, for example.

558
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:13,870
One student rented a room which was the subject of a mortgage of thirty million won.

559
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,360
The student was later in priority than the mortgage.

560
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,500
But the house was at auction.

561
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,280
Also, the winning bid was even lower than the indebtedness secured by the mortgage.

562
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,540
So this student couldn't get his deposit back.

563
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,960
What will you do in this situation?

564
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,950
You have no choice but to give up.

565
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:37,530
If you knew that you were in later priority and signed the lease, then I think there's no way to get out of it.

566
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,750
Does anyone have a different opinion?

567
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,640
I'll get the deposit back.

568
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,870
- Get the deposit back?
 - Yes.

569
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,430
How?

570
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,800
The market price for the deposits for rooms around colleges isn't that high.

571
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,910
So even if the house went into auction,

572
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,540
you can get a minimum award under the Small Amount Housing Lease Protection Act.

573
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,820
- Also...
 - Also?

574
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,380
You don't have to pay the rent during the auction period, so it's more beneficial.

575
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,810
On top of that, you can even receive the moving expenses when the owner asks you to vacate.

576
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:18,560
He's pretty good. He gave a more detailed answer than I did.

577
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,540
It's an answer that's hard to get from a freshmen class.

578
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,780
That's correct. What you just said is the Civil Code.

579
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:30,400
If you know, then it'll protect you from the danger that might come at any time.

580
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,330
You! What's your name?

581
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,920
I'm Kim Hui Wu.

582
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,890
Kim Hui Wu?

583
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,400
Kim Hui Wu.

584
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,680
That's all for today!

585
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,120
Thank you so much!

586
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,230
I guess you studied a lot to get in.

587
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,130
Nice to meet you. I'm Park Seung Hwan.

588
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,450
Yes, nice to meet you. I'm Kim Hui Wu.

589
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,370
You know there's a freshmen welcome party tonight, right?

590
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,320
Seonbae Choi Kang Jin said we should all gather.

591
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,400
- Choi Kang Jin?
 - The student president of the law school, Seonbae Choi Kang Jin.

592
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,610
Choi Kang Jin...

593
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:10,600
Are you going to go there? What's so big a deal about seniors?

594
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,150
Who are you?

595
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,910
Me? I'm Lee Min Su.

596
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,500
Ah, yes.

597
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,690
Hello, I'm a freshman, Kim Hui Wu.

598
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:23,030
I know you, Kim Hui Wu.

599
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,280
- We are in the same year, let's be friends.
 - I'm sorry?

600
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,650
Is that something that surprising? Do you think it's a loss for you?

601
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,460
Of course not.

602
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,810
You don't look that young either.

603
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,500
So are you going?

604
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,470
- He said everybody should definitely come.
 - That makes me definitely not go.

605
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:38,920
Sure, you don't have to come.

606
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,240
- Also, the dress code is business suits.
 - That's ridiculous. I'm not coming.

607
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,250
Again, you don't have to come.

608
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,890
Also, Seonbae Jang Il Hyeon, who was the top of the class at the Judicial Research and Training Institute, is coming too.

609
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,220
Jang Il Hyeon?

610
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,410
Does that make your heart move?

611
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,950
Yes.

612
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,990
How am I supposed to watch people being pretentious?

613
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,190
You said you are not coming.

614
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,420
How can I not go when my friend is going?

615
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,670
Who said he's your friend?

616
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,120
He's not saying anything. Why are you bothered about that?

617
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,320
Wait, Hui Wu. Let's go get some coffee.

618
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,030
- All of a sudden?
 - Yes.

619
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,170
- Why don't you hang out with your friends?
 - You are my friend.

620
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,660
- Let's go.
 - Since when?

621
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,370
From today!

622
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:12,780
How can he be so self-centered?

623
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,380
How far are we going for a coffee?

624
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,170
There were a lot of coffee shops in front of the school.

625
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,100
My friend. Even if it's just a cup of coffee, drink it with class.

626
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,670
There's a national barista called the Alchemist of Coffee.

627
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:25,510
The taste of coffee is amazing—

628
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:29,000
You evil wench! How dare you come in here?

629
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,940
How dare you come here?

630
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,370
Honey...

631
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,130
Excuse me?

632
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:38,170
- Honey!
 - Oh my, me?

633
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,220
Are you saying that to me?

634
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,860
I'm sorry. She's suffering from dementia.

635
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,760
I'm okay.

636
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,340
I went out for a second to get some medicine.

637
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:57,360
So I told you just to leave it by the door when I'm not home.

638
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,320
It's not good if the food gets cold.

639
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,030
Also, it's not good for you to have cold food .

640
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,140
You got a stomach ache after having cold food the other time.

641
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,310
It's because I'm sorry.

642
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:08,000
How many times has this happened already?

643
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,440
I'm okay.

644
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,330
Here. It's still warm.

645
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,770
Please take this home and have it with your wife.
   Lunchbox of Love, Faith Welfare Foundation

646
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,800
Thank you.

647
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,190
Have a nice day.

648
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,370
Let's meet in our next life.

649
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,350
See you!

650
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,320
Lunchbox of Love.

651
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,660
So you are a lunchbox delivery volunteer for the vulnerable group?

652
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,930
Yes.

653
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,650
Wait, let me see your back.

654
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,780
Oh? You are an angel without wings.

655
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,290
Anyway, thank you.

656
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:43,930
I thought I was really going to be beaten with that broomstick.

657
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,790
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.

658
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:52,460
It's a precious connection that we have by the broomstick. Why don't we talk about it more

659
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,410
with drinks and meat in front of us—

660
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,950
I'm late!

661
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,420
Bye! Thank you for helping me today!

662
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,430
Bye!

663
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,850
She's really moving my heart.

664
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,950
I'll save it in my heart!

665
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,810
What is it? How do you know this already?

666
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,160
This thing? I've been doing it for a long time. Do you want me to do it for you, too? Save in my heart!

667
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,950
I mean... Really?

668
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,410
Then is it not real?

669
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:24,820
It's very confusing...

 2008 Welcome Night For Freshmen

672
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,520
Thank you.

673
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,520
  Welcome night for Freshmen of the Department of Law

674
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,610
  Kim Hui Wu

675
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,040
You came.

676
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,360
Yes.

677
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,130
Excuse me for a second.

678
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,270
Congratulations.

679
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,650
Hello, Sunbaenim!

680
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,690
Yes, Seung Hwan!

681
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,540
  Choi Kang Jin?

682
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,630
  This is Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin, whom I talked about before.

683
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,160
  Why don't you introduce yourself to him properly?

684
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,470
  Hello, sir.

685
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:39,350
  Yes, nice to meet you. Let's work well together.

686
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:44,180
  He's very trustworthy.

687
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,730
  You are such a good-looking man.

688
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,430
  You have to work very hard from now on.

689
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:53,250
  This election wasn't a victory for me, Choi Kang Jin,

690
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,530
  but for all of you who voted for me.

691
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,970
  I'll be the Assemblyman who represents truth and justice.

692
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:06,520
  I'll make a warm society where we can embrace the vulnerable and underrepresented groups of people!

693
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,260
  Choi Kang Jin. He started as a prosecutor,

694
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:13,610
  then a human-rights lawyer, and became an Assemblyman. A piece of trash.

695
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,390
Good to see you.

696
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:19,640
Is he a freshman?

697
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:26,510
Yes, I'm Kim Hui Wu.

698
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,300
Oh, yes. I heard about you from Seung Hwan.

699
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:36,650
Some freshmen think passing the bar exam is all there is and don't care about school life.

700
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:40,120
That's not true. It's good to come out to these gatherings.

701
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,580
I'll engrave that on my heart, Sunbaenim.

702
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:47,350
Right. That way, you can broaden your connections. You can pull and push each other in the world.

703
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,210
Also, you can close your eyes to each other and scheme things together.

704
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:53,420
That way, you can stuff each other's stomachs. It's stuff like that.

705
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,970
Why don't you have some manners?

706
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,260
Are you back at school, Lee Min Su?

707
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,080
- Yes, I came back because I missed you. Have you been well?
 - It sucks.

708
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,990
- I can hear you.
 - I said it for you to hear it.

709
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,830
Sunbae Kang Jin is a senior. How do you know each other?

710
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:06,290
He got into medical school when I came into law school.

711
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,980
Also, we graduated high school together.

712
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,710
I guess you didn't like fine art and music school.

713
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,360
You are right. And I need to figure out law school after spending some time here.

714
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,760
  Lee Min Su. I didn't know this person in my previous life.

715
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,120
  I guess my past changed, so he appeared in my life?

716
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,970
Now, our Hanguk University Department of Law's remarkable!

717
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,150
Please welcome, Seonbae Jang Il Hyeon!

718
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:30,340
  Welcome night for Freshmen of Hanguk University Department of Law

719
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,600
Welcome, Sunbaenim.

720
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:47,520
Hello, my dear Hanguk University Department of Law students. I'm Jang Il Hyeon.

721
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,630
  Jang Il Hyeon.

722
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:51,220
  You stupid dumb punk!

723
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:55,060
  How dare you dig into Jo Tae Seob?

724
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,920
  He's a great man doing big work. Who do you think you are!

725
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,710
  How dare you make an issue out of insignificant things!

726
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,490
  Under the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes, bribery,

727
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,690
  embezzlement of government projects, abuse of authority...

728
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:10,760
  Besides these, he also has more than ten minor charges.

729
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,390
  Do you want me to report this to you?

730
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,240
  This punk...

731
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,530
  You are such a dummy.

732
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:21,110
  Hey, he can do that in his position.

733
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:25,760
  If you keep acting out this way, you'll be the one who goes to jail.

734
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,380
  Just shut your mouth quiet, you punk!

735
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,660
We will protect our nation's rights through the law

736
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,710
and make people's daily lives comfortable.

737
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:39,920
I hope you all have a good time tonight with your friends and alumni and share your dreams together.

738
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:46,820
  Welcome Night for Freshmen

739
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,120
I think you are not suited for events like this.

740
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,890
I'm like that, too.

741
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:57,060
People are all being so pretentious.

742
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,890
It feels like I'm standing in the middle of a sandstorm.

743
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,240
When you inhale a lot of dust,

744
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,440
you have to have some greasy meat and a glass of soju.

745
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,690
- Let's go. If you buy it, then it's better.
 - Oh, no.

746
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,700
- Oh, you're getting it for me?
 - I didn't say that.

747
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,860
- Thank you for the meal.
 - What?

748
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:17,020
No, wait.

749
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,300
I said, no!

750
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,210
Hurry up and come!

751
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,920
  What's up with that person?

752
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,910
♫   Chicken and beer   ♫

753
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:33,070
♫   Shall we have a fried chicken and beer?    ♫

754
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:34,860
Why do you study?

755
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,100
What?

756
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:40,080
Then let me ask it this way. Do you want to be successful?

757
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,500
Does it look that way?

758
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,630
Yes.

759
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:48,650
Of course. I have to be successful.

760
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,350
How high do you want to go?

761
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:51,490
What?

762
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:55,070
As I think about it, I have the world in my hands.

763
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,730
I wonder if I should squeeze them shut or open them up.

764
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:00,370
Not laughing?

765
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:04,860
Usually, you laugh when I say stuff like this and say stop reading comics.

766
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,370
No, no.

767
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,820
I also think the same way.

768
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:12,920
I knew it.  When I first met you, I felt we were alike.

769
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,420
We must be a perfect match. Want to marry me?

770
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,800
Do you want to marry me?

771
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,420
What kind of thinking is that?

772
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:26,560
Since at our school, you were the only person who could tolerate me.

773
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,630
- No.
 - You!

774
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:28,610
I don't like it.

775
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,200
Stop it.

776
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,060
Anyway, med school, art and music school...

777
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:37,360
In general, didn't you find it difficult to study?

778
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,090
There's nothing as easy and fulfilling to me as studying.

779
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,880
So easy.

780
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,080
The world is a tough place and people have a hard time, right?

781
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,620
  Lee Min Su. I wonder what kind of change he would bring from now on.

782
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,990
  I can't picture it at all.

783
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,350
Hey!

784
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,630
- Why do you take a picture of women's legs?
 - What?

785
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:08,000
You just took a photo of a part-timer girl who just passed by. You pervert!

786
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,690
- Do you have evidence?
 - Yes.

787
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,990
Your phone.

788
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,430
Oh? She's the one who I saved in my heart.

789
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:16,940
You asked me if I had evidence. It's on your phone!

790
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:21,210
She was a humanist before, but she's a warrior here.

791
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,690
Why would I give my phone to you? Are you crazy?

792
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:27,020
Unless you want to see real craziness, give me your phone now.

793
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,300
Are you not going to shut up?

794
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,130
You are an embarrassment. Why don't you take off the school jacket?

795
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,900
Hey, Hey!!

796
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,240
- What?
 - I said, shut up.

797
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,420
Shut your mouth up!

798
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,720
Don't we need to go and stop him?

799
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,370
Hello, there's a fight in the college pub in front of the front gate of Hanguk University.

800
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:44,400
I think you have to hurry up.

801
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,810
You are beyond my expectations as well. It's a very not cool way to deal with it.

802
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,500
This is the real way to help her.

803
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,120
If it escalates after we try to help her, what will you do then?

804
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,580
- That's true.
 - Yes.
 - Shall we wait and see?

805
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:59,650
Jeez. Stop acting out when you are nothing.

806
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,500
- Where are you going?
 - Damn. Jeez.

807
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,110
Hey, student, this is not right.

808
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,590
Police are coming, so please calm down.

809
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:12,330
What? Police?

810
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:15,130
Let me go, you bastard. Who are you?

811
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,860
Who are you to interfere with this?

812
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,400
Just go on your way.

813
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:27,140
Hey, you. You are more than disgraceful right now.

814
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:30,600
So just stay quiet until the police come. Okay?

815
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,810
I understand.

816
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:35,700
Please, please.

817
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,300
You bastard, it's a lucky day for you!

818
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,020
Why are you stumbling on my feet by yourself?

819
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,400
We got a report.

820
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,460
- Yes, he's the bad guy.
 - I didn't do anything!

821
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,020
It's not me!

822
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,680
I really didn't do anything!

823
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,360
We meet again.

824
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,170
Cheers.

825
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,950
It's really unavoidable, I think.

826
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:25,070
I think it's called meant to be. You can't escape from it.

827
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,780
Does my face have anything on it?

828
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,800
No. I am sorry.

829
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,450
I was just thinking about something else.

830
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:38,540
- From what I heard you say before, are you a Hanguk University student?
 - Yes.

831
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,240
- We are also at the same university.
 - Are you going to Hanguk University as well?

832
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,230
- We are both freshmen in Law School.
 - Oh, really?

833
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:46,350
I'm a freshman in Computer Science. I'm Kim Hui Ah.

834
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:49,030
I'm Kim Hui Wu. I'm 21 years old because I took the college entrance exam twice.

835
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:51,980
I'm also 21 years old and took the college entrance exam twice.

836
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,520
KIm Hui Wu,  Kim Hui Ah.

837
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,500
Our names look similar too.

838
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,040
It is really meant to be. I can't avoid it.

839
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,200
That's what I said.

840
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,260
Then, since we are the same age, let's talk comfortably.

841
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,170
You are very progressive! I'm Lee Min Su. It's nice to meet you.

842
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,450
I'm Hui Wu's friend, so you can talk comfortably to me as well.

843
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,220
I think we should drink properly.

844
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:13,270
I feel like you are pretending not to hear me the whole time.

845
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:19,450
Okay. Since two of my same school friends helped me today, I'll pay for tonight.

846
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,610
- Oh, I like it very much.  Okay.
 - Okay.

847
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:23,960
- Cheer.
 - Cheer.

848
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,800
You are not listening to me for sure.

849
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,920
Why are you keep looking at me like that?

850
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,150
It's because you look a bit familiar.

851
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:40,180
You can hear that lame line from him?

852
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:43,210
But you look familiar to me as well.

853
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,360
Wow, how can you take that old line from him?

854
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,180
  She does look familiar somehow, but I don't remember her.

855
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:58,430
  Who is she?

856
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,970
  Bus 278: Going to Anguk-dong, Ganghwamun

857
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:01,960

858
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:21,320
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

859
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,820

873

  Why did this happen? It's driving me crazy.

874
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:35,520
  It's because I thought of a good move.

875
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,180
  We decided to accept you into our secret club in the Department of Law.

876
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:43,080
  If my eyes are correct, she can be Jo Tae Seob's target at any time.
