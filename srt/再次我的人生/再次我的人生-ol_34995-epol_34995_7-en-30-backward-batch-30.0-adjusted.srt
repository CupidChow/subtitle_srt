 Again My Life

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,910
What if we're wrong about this?

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,140
Oh, my back.

8
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,510
You've arrived!

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,980
I'm telling you, it's fresh!

10
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,820
Of course! I'm not a newbie in this business!

11
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,020
What?  Aren't you working?

12
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,190
Oh, yes, sorry.

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,240
- Just a sec.
 - You should have been careful!

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,880
- Hey, pay attention!
 - I'm sorry.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,060
- You should have watched where you were going.
  - Make sure you pick up every one of them.

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,650
Yes, yes, sir.

17
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,790
Hello? What do you mean a problem?

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,450
- What is this?
 - I'm telling you it's truly grade-A this time.

19
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,650
It's really grade-A.

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,440
Good.

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,000
- What do you think you're doing? Are you crazy, you bastard?
 - Prosecutor?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,530
Of course, he's crazy. Hard not to be.

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,720
Good job.

24
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,360
Innocent civilians have been dragged into a crime scene. Wouldn't you go crazy?

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,850
Bastard, what are you?

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,280
Isn't that right, Hyeon Jong?

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,820
Don't be flustered. Come here.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,350
Let's begin.

29
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,580
- Okay!
 - Okay. Let's go.

00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,090
 Episode 7

31
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,850
Boys, take care of Mr. Prosecutor here.

32
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,800
Come on, guys. Let's not make this difficult.

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,480
Stay back.

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,150
♫  Hey, you're so cold.  That evil leer  ♫

♫  You can't get away from me.  ♫

51
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,270
Hey, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu. Everything's been taken care of here perfectly. How about you?

52
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,390
Hey, don't frown and go with a happy heart!

53
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,090
We're wrapping up too. Thank you for everything, Sunbaenim.

54
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,000
♫  Oh Bring it on Bring it on  ♫

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,790
♫  Bring it on Oh Yeah  ♫

56
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,240
It's all been sorted out, Chief.

57
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,890
I will begin interrogating Mun Gu Jun right away.

58
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,600
I believe I gave you more than enough time.

59
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,350
Fine. We found something interesting.

60
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,910
Here.

61
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,170
In addition to investigating illegal gambling, human trafficking, and drugs,

62
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,100
we looked into the bidding for government contracts in Gimsan City and

63
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,690
we discovered that you embezzled 3.8 billion won through fraudulent contracts.

64
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,380
The problem is the trio who saw these contracts,

65
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,720
the mayor, police chief, and assemblyman

66
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,530
were apparently furious that you scooped up all the money.

67
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,460
What will you do? It looks like you'll take the fall for everything again.

68
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,560
So you'll stubbornly stick to your right to remain silent?

69
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,870
Okay. Then keep your lips sealed so you can protect those high-ranking officials

70
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,780
and rot in prison all alone for the rest of your life, all right?

71
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,580
Thank you for your time.

72
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,400
Wait.

73
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,680
- I'll talk.
 - Yes!

74
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,080
- Sung Ho.
 - Yes, sir.

75
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,020
- Prepare for a press conference.
 - Yes, sir.

76
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,240
 Gimsan Regional Prosecutors' Office

77
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,580
 Prosecution Service

78
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,840
He is here.

79
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,220
I am Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu at the Gimsan Branch Office.

80
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,500
I will now begin the press briefing on the Yuchae Gang, a criminal organization in Gimsan.

81
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,260
 Early this morning, the Gimsan Branch Office,

82
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,350
  under the leadership of Deputy Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun of the Central Prosecutor's Office,

83
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,840
 arrested all members of a criminal organization specializing in drugs and human trafficking.

84
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,710
The case started with a campaign to eradicate the Yuchae Gang

85
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,750
which was operating an illegal gambling house in Gimsan.

86
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,630
Investigation revealed the gang was linked to criminal organizations

87
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,270
dealing in drugs and human trafficking.

88
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,690
Also, the relationship between the Yuchae gang and the local government officials was discovered.

89
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,490
We will summon all the relevant officials for questioning.

90
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,360
- So far, we've confirmed that these government officials had—
- Prosecutor Kim.

91
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,200
Please excuse me for a moment.

92
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,420
Chief Jeon wants to speak with you urgently.

93
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,480
Yes, Chief Jeon.

94
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,520
Pardon me? What do you mean?

95
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,070
Understood.

96
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,190
My apologies. Let's continue.

97
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,180
So far, we've confirmed the involvement of

98
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,620
- Police Chief Jang Hae Jin...
 - What?  Jang Hae Jin?

99
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:08,460
and Kim Sang Tae, the mayor of Gimsan.

100
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,590
That's it. Thank you.

101
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,260
What?

102
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,810
- Does that mean...
 - A question, please.

103
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,070
What? What about Assemblyman Gu?

104
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,730
 Today morning, the 4th Deputy Chief of Prosecutors' Office Kim Seok Hun

105
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,880
- Reduce the volume.
 -  from the Anti-Corruption Investigation Department...

106
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,050
- Okay.
 -  was arranging drug distribution and human trafficking.

107
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,190
I nearly lost everything because of that kid.

108
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,540
You saved me, sir. Thank you so much.

109
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,860
- Assemblyman Gu.
 - Yes, sir.

110
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,770
Are you confident that you'll win the next election?

111
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,290
For my constituency, I am certain that I will win as long as I'm nominated.

112
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:55,740
Right, my question is... are you confident that you will be nominated?

113
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:02,310
Please help me just once more. I will devote my life wholly to serving you, sir.

114
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,910
You'll devote your life?

115
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,050
You see, people vote for us because they can't stand the Daehan Party, not because they like us.

116
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,720
They hate the robbers so much that they'd rather vote for swindlers.

117
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,710
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

118
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,390
You'd better be very careful from now on.

119
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,270
Yes, sir. I will heed your advice.

120
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,360
You can go now.

121
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,150
- Manager Han.
 - Yes, sir.

122
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,400
What was his name again?

123
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,350
Do you mean Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu, sir?

124
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,120
Right, Kim Hui Wu. Kim Seok Hun was right.

125
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,890
That kid is really something.

126
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,000
Would you like me to arrange a meeting, sir?

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,810
Yes. As soon as he arrives in Seoul.

128
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,770
- Understood, sir.
- Good.

129
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,060
 Again My Life

130
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,060
Chief Jeon, give me a reason I can understand.

131
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,430
Why did you tell me to leave Assemblyman Gu out?

132
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,450
Chief Jeon.

133
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,450
Deputy Chief Kim Seok Hun called me

134
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,290
and said we'd have to leave his name out

135
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,990
if we wanted to return to Seoul.

136
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,150
Does that answer your question?

137
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,830
- Yes, sir.
 - Then get back to work.

138
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,960
- Be available this evening.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Kim Seok Hun got Gu Wuk Cheong out of this?

140
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,140
But they're not affiliated in any way.

141
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,900
 Do you think a few names on that ledger is enough to lock me up?

142
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,700
 Don't you know who's got my back?

143
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,110
Oh!  The person who's got his back is Jo Tae Seop.

144
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,680
 Please help me, sir!

145
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,670
 Gu Wuk Cheong begged Jo Tae Seop for help.

146
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,490
 So now, Jo Tae Seop has leverage over Gu.

147
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,890
 But I also hold Wuk Cheong's weakness.

148
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,560
 I may be able to use it as a weapon when I strike at  Jo Tae Seop.

149
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,650
- I told you about it.
- Yes, it's delicious.

150
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,480
Investigator Oh.

151
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,960
Could you bring Lee Yeon Seok to the interview room?

152
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,210
Yes, sir.

153
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,130
- Oh, and what are you doing this evening?
 - Why do you ask?

154
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,520
The past few days have been quite stressful.

155
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,240
Why don't we have dinner together? With Chief Jeon too.

156
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,610
I was worried for a second. I must decline.

157
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,290
I'd like to go home at a decent time for once.

158
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,570
- I see. You want to go home.
- I do.

159
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,100
- Then you should.
- I will.

160
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,360
Hey, how are you feeling?

161
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm still aching all over.

162
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:12,850
- Let's see. Lee Yeon Seok. Age 21.  You didn't go to high school.
 - That's not true.

163
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,890
- What?
- I dropped out of high school.

164
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,150
- It's the same thing.
 - No, it's different.

165
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,860
Fine. You dropped out of high school.

166
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,960
You worked as an enforcer to pay your mother's hospital bills?

167
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,080
- I'm a freelancer.
 - Wh-What?

168
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,820
- Sorry, freelancer?
- Yes, sir.

169
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,960
Okay, you're a freelancer.

170
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,340
That's cool.

171
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,210
Hey, Sang Man. It's me. Call Gimsan Hospital now

172
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,710
and pay Ms. Kim Jung Ok's bills in full.

173
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,590
Also, have them transfer her to Chunha Hospital in Seoul.

174
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,990
I don't care how much it costs. Make sure she gets the best treatment possible.

175
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,710
Sure.

176
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,480
- That's your payment in advance.
- Sorry?

177
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,110
You're a young first-time offender, so you'll be released on probation.

178
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,560
Move to Seoul as soon as your trial is over. And...

179
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,070
call this number. Get a job and study.

180
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,800
- And take good care of your mother.
 - Wait.

181
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,180
What are you talking about?

182
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,760
You said you were a freelancer. I want to hire you. Are you in or not?

183
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,460
I'm in.

184
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,030
Good. Then I'll see you later.

185
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,630
Yes, sir.

186
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,650
- No sign of him yet?
- No, sir.

187
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,710
- He hasn't even called?
- Should I try calling him?

188
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,180
No, don't bother.

189
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,100
Why do you think Kim Seok Hun is being like this?

190
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,460
I'd say he's waging a silent protest.

191
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,050
- Against me?
- Yes.

192
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,500
As you know, the periodic personnel reshuffle is coming up.

193
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,090
- He agreed to omit Assemblyman Gu without complaint.
 - So?

194
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:00,000
You haven't promised him anything yet.

195
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,820
The ultimate goal of Kim Seok Hun is the prosecutor general title.

196
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,430
If he's not promoted this time, his plan won't work.

197
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,180
He might think that he'd never get another chance.

198
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,870
He wants me to lay a stepping stone to the prosecutor general position.

199
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,850
Yes, sir. He'll want to become the head of the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

200
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,470
I was going to time it with the presidential election.

201
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,560
He wants to cut a deal with me?

202
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,160
Yes, sir.

203
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,310
- So what do you think?
 - As you know, Deputy Chief Kim

204
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,790
has never once, up to now, asked you for a favor.

205
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,410
- Right.
- But this time, it'll be different.

206
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,930
I suggest you offer him a carrot first.

207
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,490
Make him chief of the Central District Prosecutors' Office

208
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,820
and give him more power so I can keep control over the prosecution?

209
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,410
Yes, sir.

210
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,620
Call him.

211
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,690
Do you know how long I've been working as a prosecutor? It's been 22 years.

212
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:11,300
As you all know, I was ousted and sent here for refusing to follow unfair orders.

213
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,920
They wanted me to end my career here in Gimsan.

214
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,400
So I decided to take a risk.

215
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,160
- Take a risk?
 - I wanted to trust what I saw in your eyes.

216
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,810
 I will send you to Seoul.

217
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,920
  You have no good reason. But you came to take me to Seoul?

218
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,990
 - Reason? I'll find you one.

219
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,690
 - Tell me why I should do that?
 - Because you need power to  realize justice.

220
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,480
I could tell that you were different from the usual rookie prosecutors.

221
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,820
I have yet to come across a rookie who is as fearless and arrogant as you are.

222
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:52,610
So if it were you, I could truly expect to return to Seoul.

223
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,720
And I was right.

224
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,230
And so... I trust you now.

225
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,890
- Thank you, sir.
- No, I'll be honest.

226
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,420
I don't want to stop here.

227
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,990
I'll think of you as my last chance,

228
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,320
and this damn world where the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer...

229
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,280
I want to change this world.

230
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,930
All right. Now, tell me your story.

231
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,300
Now that we're in the same boat, I need to know where you're headed.

232
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,440
Yes, of course.

233
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,090
You graduated first from the judicial training institute. What are you doing in Gimsan?

234
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,200
- I came here because I needed you.
- Why would you need me?

235
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,650
You're not afraid of those with power.

236
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:47,560
No, you may fear them. But you don't avoid dealing with them.

237
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,360
I firmly believe that the prosecution needs someone like you.

238
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,230
And eventually, you should become Prosecutor General.

239
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,460
- What? Prosecutor General?
 - Yes, sir.

240
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,560
The Prosecutor General of the Republic of Korea.

241
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,250
You're crazy.

242
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:15,630
I... would like to help you so you can spread your wings.

243
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,330
Goodness. Am I drunk already?

244
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:26,140
Hearing this runt is getting my heart excited.

245
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,360
That's good.

246
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,930
Let me pour you one, sir.

247
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,820
Sir, Deputy Chief Kim is here.

248
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,920
My apologies, sir. I unexpectedly got called into a meeting.

249
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,300
Gambling requires time to think. Am I wrong?

250
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,320
I won't deny it.

251
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,150
Okay. Tell me what you're thinking.

252
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,760
I'd like to be promoted to chief of the Central District Office.

253
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,860
Very interesting.

254
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,540
Manager Han, your prediction was on point.

255
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,120
The Prosecutor General is on his way here now.

256
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,770
- How about we make it happen in the upcoming reshuffle?
- Thank you, sir.

257
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,900
You can thank me when you're under consideration to be the next prosecutor general.

258
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,210
I will do my very best to fulfill your expectations, Sir.

259
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,420
Sure.

260
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,900
Doesn't Kim Seok Hun irk you?

261
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,290
He's a prosecutor, but he's always trying to please the higher-ups.

262
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,700
Yes, I do find him irksome.

263
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,220
However, I'm in no position to criticize him now.

264
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,810
Just so I can return to Seoul, I let Gu Wuk Cheong go, knowing he's a total scumbag.

265
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,050
We had no choice.

266
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:16,560
It will take some time, but we will get Gu Wuk Cheong no matter what.

267
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,640
For now, let's just think that he was our ticket to Seoul.

268
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,790
Once the train arrives at the destination, the ticket should be tossed.

269
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,490
Yes, you're right.

270
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,220
Here.

271
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,330
By the way, are you sure you're not on Kim Seok Hun's side?

272
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,540
No, sir. I am on your side.

273
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,410
Under Kim Seok Hun, a smooth ride is guaranteed.

274
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,710
Why did you choose a clunker like me?

275
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:57,850
I don't want to become a dog that wags its tail in front of those with power.

276
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,900
Such a man should never become a prosecutor to begin with.

277
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,020
You’re right.

278
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,790
We must bring Kim Seok Hun down

279
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,980
But how? He's well-connected with politicians and business moguls.

280
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,450
And I bet he has many supporters within the prosecution as well.

281
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:19,880
- Right.  That's why I think we should target Jang Il Hyeon first.
 - Jang Il Hyun?

282
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,540
He's ambitious and clever. On top of that, he's from a good family.

283
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,860
At the moment, he's like Kim Seok Hun's henchman within the prosecution.

284
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,330
You're right. Maybe we shouldn't go after the head right away.

285
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,460
It's probably not a bad idea to cut off the limbs first.

286
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,400
All right, then. Let's start with him.

287
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,490
I will open the door for you when you take your first step into the prosecutor general's office.

288
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,250
- Welcome.
 - Thank you.

289
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,950
It's been a while since you've been in Seoul, right?

290
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,480
Thanks to you, I was able to take in the sights here.

291
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,340
Congratulations on your promotion, sir.

292
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,090
My goodness. Thank you. This is my first week here, so I'm still all over the place.

293
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:07,380
That said, go to Team Five and get accustomed to how things are done here.

294
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,810
I'll see how things go and move you to an appropriate position.

295
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,150
I'm honored that I can work in Seoul again.

296
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,760
- I'll do my best, sir.
- Sure.

297
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,610
- Let's all work hard.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,900
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, Prosecutor General - Kim Seok Hoon.

299
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,190
Hey, brother.

300
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,810
Nice catch. Welcome to Seoul.

301
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,190
Is this my welcome gift? This just won't cut it.

302
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,850
Only the best things for you. Check where the beans are from.

303
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,430
It was made with top-notch Colombian coffee beans.

304
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,370
Top-notch, my foot. It's only 40 percent.

305
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,350
Still, they're Colombian beans.

306
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,000
Do you have money invested in stocks?

307
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,590
If you have Mirae Electronics shares, sell them.

308
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,700
What?

309
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,600
We arrested the president, Jeon Il Bo.

310
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,560
I gave him the gift of a silver bracelet  (handcuffs) .

311
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,940
Oh right, I heard about that! As expected it was my seonbae.

312
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,540
Supplied with public funds from taxpayers, the president's son bought a car worth 1.3 billion won.

313
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:13,220
His wife used the corporate credit card and spend 3 billion won overseas.

314
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,340
On top of that, the unjust profits

315
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,110
from inserting a phony affiliate as a middleman, using the toll method, netted him 14 billion won.

316
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,300
I thought he liked the country's money, so I arrested him so he can eat a lot of the country's rice in jail.

317
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,430
But you didn't receive any comment from upstairs?

318
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:31,310
What do you think? He cursed like a rapper.  Blah,  blah, blah, blah.

319
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:36,650
Well, it was reasonable to incarcerate him, but I am worried about you.

320
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,620
Right? Isn't it worrisome?

321
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,570
But it's not fun if it's easy. Life has to be fun.  You know my motto.

322
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,200
As I expect of your mental state.

323
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,780
 Chief Kim Seok Hun:  To my office.

324
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,900
Who is it?

325
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,500
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

326
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,010
What does Chief Kim want?

327
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,700
I don't know.  He wants me to go to his office.

328
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,280
Hey, are you at a level where you can hang out with the chief prosecutor?

329
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,860
Seonbae, I'll see you later.

330
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,280
Hey. Let's get together with Gyu Ri later on.

331
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,180
Yes. I'd like that.

332
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,400
Bye bye.

333
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,270
I've been thinking a little about you.

334
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,720
You handled the Gimsan case neatly and your ability was confirmed.

335
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,450
So I've been considering putting you into an important position,

336
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,660
but for the time being it would be better to stay under Jeon Seok Gyu.

337
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,450
I'm fine with that.

338
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,030
While you're there, find out the real reason Seok Gyu came to me

339
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,510
and what he's thinking.

340
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:08,940
Jeon Seok Gyu is not the kind of person who bows down so easily.

341
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,430
You know that I trust you, right?

342
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,410
Yes, sir.

343
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,910
I'm putting the corruption case with the Gimsan mayor and police chief

344
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,530
under your name, not Jeon Seok Gyu.

345
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,830
This will look good on the resume of a new prosecutor.

346
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,890
Thank you.

347
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,520
Oh and, what do you think about Ji Seong Ho?

348
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,570
Is he useful?

349
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:35,080
I don't know much about him yet, but he seems frank and sincere.

350
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,810
All right.

351
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,180
You can leave.

352
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,980
Yes, sir.

353
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,630
You don't trust Jeon Seok Gyu but you trust me?

354
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,430
 Kim Seok Hun is a meticulous and distrustful person.

355
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:15,960
 He put his own success ahead of his own child, Han Mi's happiness.

356
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,420
 But that kind of person trusts me?

357
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,610
 Electronics

358
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,940
- Seong Ho, let's eat.
 - Yes.

359
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,150
Did you have a good meeting with your colleague?

360
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,370
Yes.

361
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,200
Come to lunch with us.

362
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,810
Go on ahead.  I have some things to take care of. I'll catch up with you as soon as I'm done.

363
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,660
Okay, come quickly.

364
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,430
Yes.

365
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,860
I'm worried because there are so many good things to eat in Seoul.

366
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,000
- How about spicy stewed pollock today?
 - Trying to clear a hangover?

367
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,890
Oh, I just have spicy soup on my mind.

368
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,710
Call Hui Wu.

369
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,390
Chief!

370
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,570
Oh you came quickly.

371
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,060
What do you think about spicy pollack soup for today's menu?

372
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,180
I have something to tell you.

373
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,250
What is this?

374
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,350
- It's a bug detector.
 - What?

375
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,270
Why do you have this?

376
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,820
There is a wiretap in our office.

377
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,010
Because I felt something was wrong, I used it.

378
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,190
I found a bug in the bookcase in your office.

379
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,600
- Are you sure?
 - Yes.

380
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,850
Who on earth bugged ...

381
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,350
Kim Seok Hun?

382
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:31,600
Yeah, it's certainly possible with a wary person like Kim Seok Hun. He won't trust me easily.

383
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,160
 Once you're marked,  you're marked for life I guess?

384
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,170
I am truly seething.

385
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,990
It's one thing if we were ignorant, but as long as we're aware, this is good for us.

386
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,120
Good how?

387
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,000
- Give them a taste of their own medicine.
 - Their own medicine?

388
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm opposed.

389
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,530
Chunha electronics technology is the best.  Why are you cooperating with Mirae Electronics Semiconductor Division?

390
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:59,420
Mirae Automobile Company has been receiving technology from Mirae Electronics for a long time.

391
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,060
I'm saying just leave it that way.

392
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,890
That was a long time ago.

393
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,580
Mirae Automobile Company is now under our Chunha Group.

394
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,070
It's no longer a Mirae affiliate, so we should draw a firm boundary.

395
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,040
Is there something else that is bothering you?

396
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,720
There are a large variety of interests in a business.

397
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,750
Is it because of Jo Tae Seop?

398
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:26,620
The one who gave Mirae Automobiles to you is him.

399
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:32,410
Dad, even if it was customary, I think we should change what needs to be changed.

400
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,610
You are the person who taught me I must be cool-headed when it comes to business.

401
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:42,400
What would you do?  So that neither side is offended.

402
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,310
I'm not sure.

403
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:51,680
It's a high-tech industry.  So I think I would use confirmed data, reliability,

404
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,360
and efficiency to fairly choose a business to partner with.

405
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,840
Then no matter who it is, they can't do anything else but acknowledge it.

406
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,530
That's right.

407
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,050
Chunha has the upper hand when it comes to semi-conductors.

408
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:09,810
Yes.  Because Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop, who only thinks of protecting Mirae Electronics,

409
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:14,230
and my brother, who only thinks of tradition, both know when they see a good thing.

410
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,630
They can be persuaded.

411
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,400
Yes, yes. I should talk to Seong Jun again.

412
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:27,980
Hui Ah, don't just focus on research. Can't you work on the front line now?

413
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,000
You saw what happened to the family in Jaeil Group.

414
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,500
Brothers stealing from each other and abandoning each other.

415
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:42,600
In the end, they become enemies. I don't want that with Oppa and Seong Jun.

416
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,860
I changed my nieces' and nephews' diapers.

417
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,000
And I fed them baby food.

418
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,600
- I want to see them get married as their aunt.
 - Hui Ah—

419
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:59,250
I want to spend my life helping you and doing what I want to do.

420
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,580
Stubborn girl.

421
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,800
 Ilmiri Gold Braised Chicken
 - Good work everyone.

422
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,910
Good job.

423
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,140
Good job.

424
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,370
Thanks.

425
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,470
Thanks for your hard work.

426
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,510
Do you know each other?

427
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,950
Yes, she's a friend.

428
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,610
So the owners here are your parents? Awesome.

429
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,630
What brings you here?

430
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:31,420
I'm taking over the column of a seonbae who is on maternity leave.

431
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,460
The column introduces restaurants.

432
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,190
What an honor. To think my parents' restaurants will be featured.

433
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,520
Hey, blogs are raving about how this is a must-eat place.

434
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,810
The truth cannot be hidden.

435
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,060
Hui Wu, let the reporter eat before she leaves.

436
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,750
She tells me she's so busy she can't even stay to eat.

437
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,360
He's right. Have a bite.

438
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,050
Should I?

439
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,550
Yeon Seok, let's set the table.

440
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,850
Wait a sec.  Nobody move.

441
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,900
My son's friend is here, so let's close this place and have all the braised chicken we want.

442
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,380
Yes.  Hui Wu hasn't eaten well since he came to Seoul.

443
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,380
He's been so busy.

444
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,720
Great.  I invited some others.

445
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,400
What? Is it all right for me to be here?

446
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,060
Of course. They might be people you also know.

447
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,000
How many braised chickens can a human consume?  Let's challenge the human limit.

448
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,040
Tell them all to come.  Yeon Seok, get six orders.

449
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,420
Hello! I brought the elder with me!

450
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,060
Oh, Elder.

451
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,040
Hello. The Real Estate Legend.

452
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,150
Please have a seat.

453
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,020
Hello.

454
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,010
- Hello.
 - Hello.

455
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,030
Hello.

456
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,580
Here. Try this too.

457
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,630
This is my mother's special dish.

458
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,280
Nice.

459
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,130
It's light and savory.

460
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,180
Look at the cheese.

461
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,580
Eating this tender meat with the cheese ... this is crazy.

462
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,770
- It's good, right?
 - Yeah!

463
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,430
Yes, Seonbae.

464
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,530
Yes, yes.  I'll hurry and go.

465
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,590
What, do you have to leave now?

466
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,850
This really is a must-eat restaurant. I lost track of time eating.

467
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,510
I have to go back to work so I'm leaving first.

468
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,460
- That's too bad.
 - Safe trip.

469
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,190
See you next time.

470
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,820
Good bye.

471
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,420
She looks really familiar.

472
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,590
- The college entrance exam repeaters' academy.
 - That delinquent?

473
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,160
She must have studied hard.

474
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,150
I hear her mom sent her to college.

475
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,470
Hey Sang Man, just eat your chicken.

476
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,310
Hyeong, it's tasty.

477
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,500
You must have a skill for raising people.

478
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,290
You raised Sang Man and Yeon Seok, and now you've taken care of her too?

479
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,900
Oh, no such thing. They all did it all on their own.

480
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,780
- Our Hui Wu has a love of people.
 - Indeed!

481
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,900
Let's toast to Hui Wu's comeback to Seoul.

482
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,400
No, don't do that.

483
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,670
Let's do it.

484
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,200
Let's make a good toast.

485
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,190
When I give the signal, everyone shout "Hui Wu" please.

486
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,830
So, all together now!

487
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,220
Hui Wu!

488
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,340
- Now back again!
 - Hui Wu!

489
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,010
Hey, that's enough!

490
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,540
Your stamina is really good, kid.

491
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,260
Good job!

492
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,900
Let's go!

493
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,920
Thank you.

494
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,370
How are your studies going?

495
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,470
It's hard but Hyeongnim Sang Man is teaching me well.

496
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,300
- Do you think you can get into college?
 - I'll try the best I can.

497
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,120
Sang Man is your teacher. Protect him from now on.

498
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,600
Okay.

499
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,240
Hey. If we fought again, do you think you could win?

500
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,350
Look at that. You aren't answering, huh? Huh?

501
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,810
Fine, overtake me!

502
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,450
- Going to the academy, right?
 - Yes.

503
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,200
Let's go.

504
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,420
 Prosecution Service

505
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:16,070
- When you have time, look over the unsolved cases.
 - Yes, sir!

506
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:19,160
I was just about to look over some of today's cases.

507
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,940
If we are as carefree as we were in Gimsan when something happens... gosh, then it'd be chaotic.

508
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,070
Here are the case files.

509
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,220
I have a prior engagement so I'll be stepping out for a bit.

510
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,440
- You may leave.
 - Yes, sir.

511
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,360
There aren't any special movements from Jeon Seok Gyu yet.

512
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,650
What does he usually do when he's in his office?

513
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:04,510
Other than reading the newspaper and watching television, he looks at the unsolved case files.

514
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,820
There was a time when he was once called a tiger by the rich and gangsters alike.

515
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,900
We can't relax just because we have him locked up.

516
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,650
Don't you think he had a lot of time to think during his time in Gimsan?

517
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:23,580
He advised me to turn a blind eye, even if I see the authorities commit crimes.

518
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,370
He's changed a lot.

519
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:33,750
Fine. Let's keep watch until we are certain.

520
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,610
Yes, I understand.

521
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,320
Oh, and clear your evening schedule.

522
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,250
- You can hear the rest of the details from Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon.
 - Yes.

523
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,140
Hello, Seonbaenim!

524
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,310
Maybe it's because you came to Seoul, but your complexion has gotten brighter.

525
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,770
This is all thanks to you!

526
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:05,340
Punk, trying to flatter me.

527
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,620
You're going to have to be on your toes today.

528
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,190
Excuse me? Why?

529
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,570
- You haven't met the top-secret club members yet, right?
 - Right.

530
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,970
We have a club meeting today.

531
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,640
The director has told me to bring you today,

532
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,510
so think of it as an honor.

533
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:28,610
 I'll finally be able to see the faces of the great club members.

534
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,920
- Yes, it's an honor! Thank you!
 - Alright.

535
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,900
I'll see you later.

536
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,340
Yes.

537
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,590
Now, when the elders come, we'll greet them here.

538
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,910
This is the role of the lower-level staff. They are all distinguished people so be on your toes.

539
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,970
Yes! I'll keep that in mind.

540
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,270
They're coming.

541
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:18,370
 Former and current ministers, members of Congress, the Attorney General, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

542
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,690
 All the people in high positions are coming together.

543
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,230
Hello!

544
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,840
- Good job.
 - Thank you!

545
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,680
I haven't seen you in a while.

546
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,180
- Keep up the good work.
 - Yes!

547
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,890
- Keep up the good work.
 - Thank you!

548
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,540
- Welcome.
 - Yes.

549
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:36,640
- Welcome.
 - Wecome.

550
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,400
Good work! Do well today!

551
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,990
Yes!

552
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,590
- Good work.
 - Hello!

553
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,020
- Welcome.

554
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,250
 Thirty minutes have passed.

555
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:06,440
 But no one is touching their food.

556
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,670
 Everyone is waiting on one person.

557
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:14,080
 There is but one person who can keep the nation's most powerful waiting.

558
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:22,420
- When will that prosecutor be done?
 - He said that it'll be done in a month.

559
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,500
 Jo Tae Seop.

560
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,610
Hello!

561
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,870
You worked hard.

562
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,020
Nice to meet you.

563
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,940
Oh, yes.

564
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,670
Please sit. It's not like I'm anyone important.

565
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,820
I told you to eat first.

566
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,880
Let's eat.

567
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,410
 It's a show of power! He's making sure everyone here knows that he's the master.

568
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,490
 So Jo Tae Seop made all the people of power wait for 30 minutes.

569
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,450
Hey, Kim Hui Wu!

570
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,380
Come here!

571
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,270
Kim Hui Wu.

572
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,070
Yes!

573
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:42,220
After you finish your meal, you will meet Representative Jo Tae Seop alone.

574
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,540
- Individually?
 - Yes!

575
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,310
It is a tradition in our club.

576
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:51,570
- The youngest will have a meeting with the head of the club.
 - Wow!

577
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,590
It is such an honor!

578
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,200
Hey. She's here. Go on now.

579
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,810
- I'll be waiting in the car so take your time.
 - Yes.

580
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,940
Don't get nervous!

581
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,010
I'll be back.

582
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,030
The representative is waiting. Let's go.

583
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,790
It's been a while.

584
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:35,630
It's been a few years, but do you remember me saying that'd I'd keep my promise?

585
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:43,330
Did I make some sort of agreement with you?

586
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,370
That's...

587
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,270
Let's just call it homework.

588
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,620
You'll come to realize it as time passes.

589
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,760
I'll trust you. Let's go.

590
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,730
 Representative, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu has arrived.

591
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,470
Come in.

592
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,540
I am Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

593
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:30,060
I am Jo Tae Seop. We finally get to meet, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

594
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,970
It's nice to meet you. Sit over here.

595
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,510
Yes.

596
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:47,680
It feels good seeing a new face after a long time.

597
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,530
So, what is your dream?

598
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,380
I don't have any plans on looking ahead right now.

599
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,310
I want to dedicate myself to the role I have at the moment.

600
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:05,100
Yes, I suppose that's normal for a first-time prosecutor. Expected even.

601
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,090
So what do you think should be the relationship

602
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,710
between an assemblyman and a prosecutor?

603
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:16,210
Don't try to match it to my standards, and just tell me what you think.

604
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,080
I think it's the same as a master and his subject.

605
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,730
Master and subject? So the belief that there must be loyalty between the monarch and subject?

606
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:30,380
Yes, I think so.

607
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,110
It might be a bit awkward to call it a monarch and its subject, but

608
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:38,240
the National Assembly believes in the prosecution and the courts and promotes legislation.

609
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,420
The prosecution should also believe the laws are correct and move forward

610
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,580
before the legislation can properly stand.

611
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:50,590
It's only possible if there's trust and loyalty between the two.

612
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:56,150
That's an interesting interpretation.  But I'm curious.

613
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,950
Who are the "masters" you're referring to?

614
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,420
That is, wouldn't our prosecutors be the ones to make laws

615
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,700
that they can trust and follow?

616
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,910
All right.

617
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:17,010
There has to be faith

618
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:21,600
between the National Assembly and the prosecution.

619
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,380
I think the two

620
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,120
are one.

621
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,950
Don't we have a common goal to make the country better?

622
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,610
Yes, I think so.

623
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,130
Just one more question.

624
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,730
What was your first thought when you saw today's meeting?

625
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,420
With all the people who gathered here today,

626
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,420
I thought the foundation for a national governance organization could be established.

627
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,710
Yes.  They have all that talent.

628
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:01,790
That is why I

629
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,910
want everyone to become one.

630
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:07,320
And that one power...

631
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,000
to come to me.

632
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,930
What do you say?

633
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:24,270
After meeting Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop in person.

634
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,150
He is a powerful man.

635
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,490
Right, he is indeed powerful.

636
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:32,430
He is also the only man who can change this country.

637
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,380
Is that so?

638
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,510
Of course. Honestly who else can unify our country?

639
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:42,950
Assemblyman Jo has come up with a plan to bring together

640
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:47,790
and unify this country, which is divided into progressives and conservatives.

641
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:52,540
You also are patriotic, all because you also are under Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's wings.

642
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,360
 Patriotic, my foot.

643
00:46:54,360 --> 00:47:00,430
You can consider our secret club as an organization to make Assemblyman Jo the President

644
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:04,120
You guaranteed your future because you got under the right leadership.

645
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,350
Consider it an honor.

646
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,920
Yes, I'm honored. Thank you.

647
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,870
So, to celebrate this,

648
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:13,500
let's have another drink tonight!

649
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,440
Let's go!

650
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,690
Floor it!

651
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:19,230
My righteous prosecutors.

652
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:23,570
That guy, Kim Hui Wu, I like him.

653
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:27,250
But why do you leave such talent unattended?

654
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,220
He is overconfident.

655
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,150
- Overconfident?
- Yes.

656
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:36,710
That's why I ordered him to monitor Jeon Seok Gyu and report back to me.

657
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:42,060
So you're making him follow orders and report to you, so he knows who's boss?

658
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:46,560
Yes. In Gimsan, Jeon Seok Gyu let him do as he pleased.

659
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:53,610
It may have worked out for him in the end but, a dog unleashed might bite its owner.

660
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:56,230
This is Seoul, not Gimsan.

661
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:02,260
Once he understands he's on a leash and wags his tail, I plan on bringing him to my side.

662
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:07,280
I understand. But I'd like to suggest a different approach to you.

663
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,090
If you imprison a horse that can run a thousand miles,

664
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:14,430
it can become an idiot or escape your fence.

665
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:20,560
To make it become a horse able to run a thousand miles is the owner's responsibility.

666
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,450
He has already solved the case with Jeon Seok Gyu.

667
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,800
They came together from Seoul. They're comrades.

668
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,060
But you would like to turn a comrade into a supervised enemy?

669
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,790
Are you not underestimating Kim Hui Wu too much?

670
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:41,510
Chief Prosecutor Kim, mark my words.

671
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:45,940
The master is not the one holding the leash,

672
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:51,130
but the one who feeds the animal.

673
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:11,610
Sir, are you reading the Gimsan corruption files again?

674
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:14,170
Just in case we missed anything.

675
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:16,310
That ship has already sailed, sir.

676
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:19,800
You're not seriously trying to arrest Assemblyman Gu Wuk Cheong, are you?

677
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,060
Did I say I'm trying to lock him up now?

678
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,280
Anyway, I'm just looking at it since I have some time to spare.

679
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,210
Gu Wuk Cheong is not even in our jurisdiction anymore.

680
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,950
Exactly. That was Gimsan. But this is Seoul.

681
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:34,590
We have to look for cases here.

682
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,670
 That guy, Kim Hui Wu, I like him.

683
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:58,780
 But why do you leave such talent unattended?

684
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,320
 The master is not the one holding the leash,

685
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:07,540
 but the one who feeds the animal.

686
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,740
Come in.

687
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,350
I have something to report to you.

688
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:28,550
Jeon Seok Gyu seems to still be interested in Gu Wuk Cheong's case in Gimsan.

689
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:33,770
He's not seriously investigating yet, but I'll keep checking and reporting to you.

690
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,650
 It's as I just heard.

691
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,990
 He knows who his master is.

692
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:43,640
 Good.

693
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,380
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

694
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,470
Yes, sir.

695
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:51,180
Starting tomorrow, you can report to Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon in the Anti-Corruption Investigation Unit.

696
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,830
Then how will I keep watching Director Jeon Seok Gyu?

697
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:58,370
You can't do surveillance jobs forever.

698
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,660
Yes. Understood.

699
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:04,000
Also, there will be a Future Talents Forum.

700
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,260
- Future Talents Forum?
- Yeah.

701
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:10,270
It is an event where young and talented individuals from all sectors participate.

702
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:15,730
And Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop personally selected you, so you should go with Il Hyeon.

703
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:19,850
Oh, yes. Thank you for the opportunity.

704
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,690
 Prosecution Service

705
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:33,830
Right. Since I'm holding his leash, and even feeding him,

706
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:36,860
I just have to be a good master now.

707
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,150
Nice to meet you all.

708
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:46,220
Welcome to the Future Talents Forum. Here, we present and discover new talent in Korea.

709
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,390
All of you are the top elite in your field,

710
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,740
and these are the talents who will make our country continue to grow.

711
00:51:53,740 --> 00:52:00,800
All of the innovations and changes in the world are thanks to people like you who continue to strive and challenge yourselves.

712
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,670
As creative leaders,

713
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:06,170
you all inspire and energize your businesses

714
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:10,900
and will lead Korea in the right direction into the future.

715
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:16,500
We hope you spend valuable time in today's forum. Thank you.

716
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,810
 Schön Rosmarin by Fritz Kreisler.

717
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,840
 Hello!

718
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,580
 Everyone is busy managing their contact lists.

719
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,550
Excuse me.

720
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,190
Hello. I am Jo Yun Ah.

721
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:56,780
Oh, nice to meet you. Movie actress, Jo Yun Ah.

722
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,780
Do you know who I am?

723
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,170
Of course. You're the most popular actress nowadays.

724
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:04,620
I also heard you signed a contract with a Hollywood studio.

725
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:07,700
Oh, yes. I was just lucky.

726
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,460
Now that you're right in front of me, you look—

727
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,250
You're much prettier in person.

728
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:16,400
I'm a fan of yours and I'm honored to meet you.

729
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,630
Right.

730
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,830
Oh my! Sorry for not introducing myself.

731
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,340
I am Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

732
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,390
And I'm  Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu's senior.

733
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,910
Oh, really?

734
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,630
Nice to meet you.

735
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,420
Nice to make your acquaintance.

736
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,420
I enjoyed your movie.

737
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,340
Thank you.

738
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,620
 Seong Jin Mi?

739
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,940
 Seong Jin Mi! You are under arrest for corruption in college admission,

740
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,440
tax evasion, and embezzlement of the National Foundation for the Arts  University.

741
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:03,920
 You have the right to remain silent and to hire an attorney.

742
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,550
 Everything you say can be used against you in court.

743
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:16,480
 I personally arrested her on charges of foundation embezzlement and tax evasion.

744
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,760
  The president of the National Foundation for the Arts, Seong Jin Mi.

745
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,480
 Your jokes, really.

746
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,110
 There's nothing much to life.

747
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:27,590
 It's all thanks to you.

748
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:35,140
 One shot,

749
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,050
 two kills.

750
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,900
Hello. You're Ms. Seong Jin Mi, correct?

751
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,290
I attended one of your concerts.

752
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,980
At my concert?

753
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,260
Yes.

754
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,650
Was it Haydn's Sonata? Very impressive.

755
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:06,810
To be honest, I didn't really like Haydn until I heard you play it on the piano.

756
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:13,530
But after that day, thanks to you, I started to enjoy Haydn's clear tones.

757
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:17,380
The people in our country prefer Beethoven or Mozart.

758
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,790
They're both considered masters by everyone.

759
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:25,390
You're the first person to talk music instead of business to me.

760
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,600
Oh, really?

761
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:33,420
I especially liked Sonata N.60, it was really upbeat.

762
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,800
Thank you.

763
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,160
Let me introduce myself. I'm Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

764
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,790
Yes, nice to meet you.

765
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:57,100
I usually thought prosecutors were insensitive to music,

766
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,670
but you have a deep knowledge of it.

767
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:03,310
There are plenty of people who are sensitive to music in the legal business.

768
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:04,950
What a surprise.

769
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:08,040
Here's another. I'll introduce you.

770
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:11,360
- Seonbaenim?
 - Huh?

771
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:20,070
This is Jang Il Hyeon, chief of the anti-corruption crime investigation unit of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

772
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:22,860
You are the President of the National Foundation for the Arts, am I right?

773
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,010
Yes, I am. How are you?

774
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,610
I've always wanted to meet you.

775
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,510
- Seriously?
 - Please, forgive me.

776
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:33,130
I know it may be rude to say it in our first meeting, but you are my ideal type.

777
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,550
Who would have known I would meet you here?

778
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:38,430
Wow, this is truly an honor.

779
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,730
Yes, nice to meet you.

780
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:46,110
Mr. Jang was the person who took me to your concert.

781
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:52,160
You were truly in love with her performance, weren't you?

782
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,400
- Thank you.
 - Oh, yes.

783
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,620
To me, music is equal to love.

784
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:09,420
You two seem to be getting along. I'll bring you some wine.

785
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:16,470
It's a new glass. Please have a drink.

786
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,380
Thank you.

787
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,700
- Really?
- Yes.

788
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,610
I'm being 100% honest.

789
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,610
What did you think about my concert?

790
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,950
Your hands were very beautiful.

791
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,230
I couldn't help it, but I should have paid attention to the music...

792
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,110
 Right. Enjoy it while you can.

793
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:48,240
 This time, I'll arrest you and her together!

794
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,430
Assemblyman, I have something to report.

795
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,560
Sure.

796
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,520
The prosecutors have requested access to Mirae Electronics' bank accounts.

797
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,620
Isn't that managed by Bando Bank? Who requested it?

798
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,610
Prosecutor Lee Min Su.

799
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:07,170
If they happen to find out about the bank's illegal corporate loans—

800
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:09,410
I know.

801
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:16,150
Tell the director of Bando Bank to stall for as long as possible.

802
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:19,190
I'll give instructions to the chief prosecutor directly.

803
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,770
Okay.

804
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:32,850
 Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop

805
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,580
Hello Mr. Assemblyman.

806
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:43,020
Talk about the Mirae Electronics case has made its way to me.

807
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:46,430
 It's because of my negligence. Apologies for the inconvenience.

808
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:47,860
Will it be difficult to cover up?

809
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:51,370
I replaced the prosecutor in charge of the case, so it will be taken care of soon.

810
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:53,120
I understand,

811
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,990
I'll be keeping an eye on this.

812
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:58,620
Since you've become a prosecutor now, you have to look at the big picture.

813
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,990
I'll keep that in mind.

814
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,800
 Jang Il Hyeon

815
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:16,610
Yes. Yes, I understand.

816
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:21,970
They want to settle.

817
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:23,810
Settlement?

818
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:28,930
Oh? This is Seong Jin Mi's CD.

819
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:32,350
This is her recital album.

820
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:37,740
The world seems more livable nowadays thanks to you.

821
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:42,630
Hey isn't Director Seong really fine?

822
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:43,730
Of course. She's the best.

823
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:48,960
At that young age, she gained early admission to college and is the president of a private school foundation.

824
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,990
Would marrying her be the same as hitting the jackpot?

825
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:56,310
Why are you acting so humble? There's nothing wrong with you.

826
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:59,910
She would be the one hitting the jackpot.

827
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:02,410
How are you so good at flattery?

828
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:04,180
I'm not at all.

829
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:08,410
I'm getting you this far, but you have to succeed quickly.

830
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:11,770
Okay. I understand.

831
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:17,790
Kang Jin has been paying a lot of attention to his looks nowadays.

832
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:21,340
That kid was asking about that actress Jo Yun Ah.

833
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,670
Is that the case? That's good.

834
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:29,220
I'm going to investigate a murder suspect right now. Do you want to go together?

835
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:33,920
It's a high-interest case for the prosecution. It would be good for you to go.

836
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,280
Thank you. But what kind of case is it?

837
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,720
It's about a medical student who murdered his pregnant girlfriend.

838
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,160
Ah, I see. I read about it in the newspaper.

839
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,720
I'll be the one doing the work for now.

840
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,340
But watch what I do and learn.

841
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:53,020
Okay. Thank you.

842
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,780
Hold on.

843
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:08,250
I have to stop by here. I have to greet them while we're here.

844
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:14,500
Hello

845
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,050
Aren't you going to say hello?

846
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,560
The president is inside, right?

847
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,230
Yes.

848
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,760
Hold on for a moment. I'll be out shortly.

849
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,420
Okay.

850
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:31,740
Hello.

851
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,880
Hello.

852
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,780
 Thank you for coming. You're doing so much for the economy of the country,

853
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,980
 so I understand that you must be busy.

854
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,570
  The Jeon Il Bo case was sent here?

855
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,900
 It was definitely Min Su's case before.

856
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:54,200
Wasn't the Jeon Il Bo case originally given to another department?

857
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,660
You're right.

858
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:58,620
That idiot Min Su didn't know his place and crossed the line,

859
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,720
so the case was handed over to us.

860
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,290
The boss will be personally in charge of this case from today on.

861
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:06,700
Speaking of which, isn't that guy Lee Min Su really shortsighted?

862
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,910
If he drags the president of Mirae Electronics here without thinking about the consequences, what can he expect?

863
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:13,610
The judge who issued the warrant is an idiot too.

864
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:16,740
 How does our economy even run?

865
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:21,520
 It's all due to our magnanimous CEO.

866
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,070
 Now that we're on the topic, what I wanted to talk to you about...

867
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:26,490
 Hey you rock head!

868
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,560
 Didn't I tell you that it's pointless to go after someone as big as Jo Tae Seop?

869
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,330
 How many times do I have to say it before you understand?

870
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,750
 Do you think you've become a star because the media is talking about you?

871
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:38,480
 What, did you want to act like a prosecutor of justice?

872
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,200
 What will be left for you after you're done playing hero?

873
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:46,740
 Listen up, Kim Hui Wu. Stop investigating Jo Tae Seop.

874
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,660
 Take it easy.

875
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,610
 This brat should understand how to live in moderation.

876
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:54,640
 How long do I have to stay here?

877
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,070
My sincerest apologies.

878
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:00,260
We will open the doors as soon as the public calms down.

879
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:03,350
Please think of it as a short break.

880
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:07,470
We will make sure you aren't uncomfortable during your time here.

881
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,730
- You've worked hard.
 - Hey!

882
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:25,010
Pay a little more attention to the CEO. Serve him some tea or something.

883
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:29,200
And by the way, did you prepare the file on the college student murder case?

884
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,630
Yes.

885
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:32,070
I was just on my way to give it to you.

886
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:34,040
Hurry up.

887
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,700
This is the suspect file. Take a look.

888
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,460
Okay. Thank you.

889
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:47,990
Aren't you going to tell the truth?

890
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:51,870
You killed her. And then, you got scared and reported it.

891
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,650
No. It really wasn't me!

892
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:55,420
What do you mean it wasn't you?

893
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:57,600
 Hey! You said the two of you fought.

894
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,630
 He hasn't changed at all.

895
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:05,250
 He's weak in front of the strong and strong in front of the weak. He's the worst kind of trash.

896
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,420
 Aren't you a psycho?

897
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,670
While we were fighting

898
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:10,770
 Lee Ju Seok, a medical student at Hankuk University

899
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:14,380
 The person who reported the crime and the potential suspect.

900
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:17,900
 He was dating the victim.

901
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:21,100
 Where do you think you are, lying like that? Hey, stop crying.

902
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:25,310
 If they were really fighting outside, there would have been a witness.

903
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:28,030
 But there isn't one.

904
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:32,100
  Nothing was even captured on the CCTV near the scene.

905
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:35,910
  It smells like a sloppy investigation.

906
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:38,630
Your fingerprints were found on the murder weapon.

907
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:45,410
This... I was just holding the knife still after she had been stabbed.

908
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:48,560
 You are the culprit!

909
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,840
 You can't fool the evidence. If you confess, your sentence might be more lenient

910
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:58,690
 That's right, a medical student would do that to prevent further bleeding

911
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:03,500
 It really wasn't me.

912
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,510
It really wasn't me. Please believe me.

913
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,450
Hey, hurry up and tell the truth.

914
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:11,320
It's so unfair. It really wasn't me.

915
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,150
Hurry up and tell the truth!

916
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,450
It's not fair!

917
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,550
This asshole.

918
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:21,790
Let's see how long you can last.

919
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:28,560
 There's only one piece of evidence. Just a knife with fingerprints on it.

920
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,860
 This isn't enough to prove that Lee Ju Seok is the culprit

921
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:36,740
 Jang Il Hyeon is too smart not to know that.

922
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:44,160
You've worked hard.

923
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,170
He's holding up quite a bit.

924
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:49,970
Of course, it must be frustrating and embarrassing.

925
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:53,070
Let's go, I need to quench my thirst.

926
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:54,780
Okay.

927
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:06,020
Should I investigate the people around the suspect one more time?

928
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,290
Investigate?

929
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:11,150
Hui Wu, this is why you're still an amateur.

930
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:13,480
Don't you get what's going on?

931
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,950
It doesn't matter who really killed her.

932
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:21,150
Right now, Lee Ju Seok has to be the culprit.

933
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:26,010
- Excuse me?
 -  I told you didn't I? The chief prosecutor is interested in this case.

934
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:27,360
And?

935
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,420
Why do you think?

936
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:33,120
He's a really attractive suspect.

937
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:37,440
The son of a snack shop owner who always got an award for good deeds. He's poor, but

938
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,520
it only looked like he was kind and smart. In reality, he was a murderer.

939
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:48,260
Before long, it'll be big in the news.

940
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:51,470
It'll be hot on the internet too.

941
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:54,200
He has no money or support.

942
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,040
That's exactly who Lee Ju Seok is.

943
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:04,400
That bastard Lee Ju Seok is completely screwed.

944
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,860
Yes, it's me.

945
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:21,720
From now on, all anti-corruption and crime investigation departments will be on the Lee Ju Seok case.

946
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,350
We will contact all friends and relatives and shake them thoroughly.

947
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:29,220
Posting and leaving comments on the internet on the victims' relatives' pages,

948
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:33,630
we will make him into a complete monster in the public eye.

949
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,560
Got it?

950
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:43,390
This will definitely cover up the

951
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:45,840
Mirae Electronics case.

952
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:50,180
  So that's what it was.

953
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:52,170
It's genius.

954
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:59,850
Yes, Jin Mi?

955
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:02,810
Of course. I missed you too.

956
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,830
Did you eat?

957
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:08,720
Then we should eat together.

958
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,810
♫   Dear, All your things you've done   ♫

959
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:16,020
♫  We are here to wreck it up  ♫

960
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,020
♫  Who knows,   ♫

961
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:23,800
 Jang Il Hyeon, I'll make you into a monster in the public eye soon as well.

962
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:29,950
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

963
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:32,950
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

964
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:38,980
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

965
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:48,110
♫  Who would ever find out who you really are? Hm  ♫

966
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:56,730
♫  You'll never know that I will throw off your disguise  ♫

967
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:57,850
♫  Oh let me show you   ♫

968
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:00,360
 Again My Life

969
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,510
♫  Wait, Till the end  ♫

970
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:04,920
 I'll catch the culprit myself.

971
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,730
 What will you do next?

972
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:09,140
 I'll start by revealing the relationship between those two.

973
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:11,420
 A sponsor prosecutor.

974
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,500
 It can't be Kim Hui Ah.

975
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,130
 So you'll reveal what's going on in my family?

976
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:17,950
 We need evidence that Lee Ju Seok wasn't there.

977
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:20,100
 It's going nationwide right now.

978
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,030
 There is a traitor who'll betray the Assemblyman.

979
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:25,020
 - An easy game is no fun.
 - I investigated it.

980
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:28,620
 Stop what you're doing right now.

981
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:36,150

982
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:38,340
 Again My Life
