 Lee Kyung Young

00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,640
 Kim Ji Eun

00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,350

5
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:35,080
 Again My Life

6
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,110
 Episode 5
 We oppose the restructuring of Mirae Automobiles.

7
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,260
- We oppose!
 - We oppose!

8
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,230
 The company's compulsory liquidation should not be allowed.

9
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,370
- Do not allow it!
 - Do not allow it!

10
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,430
 We oppose the sell-off.

11
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,470
We oppose! We oppose!

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,060
 We oppose the restructuring of Mirae Automobiles.

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,490
  Mirae Automobiles was dissolved after it was sold to a foreign company

14
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,470
 as the result of a labor-management conflict.

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,980
 I know what’s going to happen with Mirae,

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,890
 but I can’t do anything right now.

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,780
 - We oppose the sell-off.
 -  We oppose it!

18
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,730
 - We're oppose it!
 - We oppose it!

19
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,760
 We oppose the restructuring of Mirae Automobiles.

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,920
 We oppose it! We oppose it!!

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,370
Where is Kang Man Cheol these days?

22
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,060
Are you referring to the Kang Man Cheol from the Progressive Labor Party, sir?

23
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,370
That's right.

24
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,780
He's at the protest camp at the factory in Byeongtaek.

25
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,350
- Let's go to Byeongtaek.
 - Sorry? Right now?

26
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,850
Let him know I'm on my way. I want to have a cup of coffee with him.

27
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,590
Yes, sir.

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,980
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop,

29
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:19,330
I heard if you go to the Blue House, even the President himself will scramble to greet you.

30
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,990
But here you are in this shabby tent to share instant coffee with me!

31
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,290
I don't expect you to scramble to meet me.

32
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,630
So at least get yourself some new shoes. It looks like you're putting on a show.

33
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,800
I live by the teachings of Lao Tzu. Isn't it about having fewer possessions?

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,050
Having a lot is chaotic.

35
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,430
Chaos can be fun too.

36
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,760
I heard your son got into Harvard?

37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,090
I thought people of the Juche faction

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,180
generally sent their kids to places like Byongyang University.
  (Juche supports North Korean political ideologies.

39
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,830
Do I get to decide which school they go to?

40
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,780
They figure it out themselves.

41
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,730
That's true.

42
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,850
Time flies when I talk to you.

43
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,330
Coming to the point. This strike... let's wrap it up..

44
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,410
- Neatly.
 - What?

45
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,430
You are holding something big.

46
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,080
Then just enjoy it by yourself. Why are you trying to get us involved?

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,580
Is there a deal that would favor such a fringe party like ours?

48
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,570
This is all to save workers and businesses. What other deal do you need?

49
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,530
I’m curious.  I'm really curious.

50
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,960
Also, for how long are you going to be the party representative?

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,060
Parliamentary Negotiation Body. Floor leader. It's time you take those positions.

52
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,660
Last time you took three seats.

53
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,620
- If you consider the proportion, it's just one seat.
 - That's why!

54
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,080
No more graceful concessions every election season. Sure, you can say it was for unification.

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,150
But in reality, you're just treated as window dressing for the Daehan Party.

56
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,740
Are you already preparing for the general elections?

57
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,180
Saving the economy. Bipartisan. Cooperation?

58
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,630
You are aiming for that, I see.

59
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,480
Even if your opponent's ranking rises, yours will as well,

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,870
and you can keep an eye on the main opposition party.

61
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,610
Just how many birds are you killing with one stone?

62
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,110
I don't like it, but it's good.

63
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,520
All I have to do is take a picture next to you.

64
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,820
How can I reject this?

65
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,500
What an offer!

66
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,270
  Jo Tae Seop!

67
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,510
  Jo Tae Seop!

68
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,340
  Jo Tae Seop!

69
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,880
 They made this decision for the good of the country.

70
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,140
 A big round of applause!

71
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,520
 From now on, we'll work

72
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,570
 to make an environment where workers and companies can coexist...

73
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,430
 Mirae Automobiles is going to Cheonha?

74
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,320
 This is a different story from my previous life.

75
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,340
 Until the dramatic conclusion of the Mirae Automobile strike,

76
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,400
 Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop raised his voice at the party meeting

77
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,740
 to focus on revitalizing the economy with a bipartisan mindset.

78
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,290
 The Daehan Party preparing for the general elections ...

79
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,480
 The goal is not the general election, but the presidential election.

80
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,790
 Ridiculous stuff.

81
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,130
 It once again hit an all-time high. The next news.

82
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,020
 A horrific thing happened when a friend of 40 years went home

83
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,150
 and killed his friend for not paying money back.

84
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,980
 The police arrested the suspect, Mr. Park, and are investigating other details.

85
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,540
 This case...

86
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,730
 Mr. Park's fingerprints were found on a weapon at the crime scene.

87
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,930
 The investigation is focused on the possibility of a crime of revenge.

88
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,870
 An on-site inspection is expected to be conducted today.

89
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,140
Here, take the knife.
  Victim

90
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,470
From here. Like this.

91
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,420
Like this. Do it, just like you did last time.

92
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,560
I didn't do it.

93
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,090
Are you going to change your position here? It will complicate things for us.

94
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,990
Don't you remember this knife?

95
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,350
That, that is ...

96
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,500
It's the one that I held,

97
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,230
but when I thought of my son, I did not stab him.

98
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,210
 How can you do this here? There's proof also.

99
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,260
If you continue this, only your sentence will increase. Your sentence!

100
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,930
It's not me. Really!

101
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,790
I did not kill him.

102
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,340
He's coming out. There he is!

103
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,150
They should at least show his face.  Heaven will punish him.

104
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,700
You killed someone for some money.

105
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,650
Raise your head if you are confident, you bastard.

106
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,160
Where were you going, really?

107
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,650
Dad! Father! My Dad did nothing wrong.

108
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,160
It's not him! Catch the real culprit! Why is it my dad?

109
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,560
Dad! Dad!

110
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,960
Dad! Dad!

111
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,030
Dad!

112
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,460
Dad!

113
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,940
Dad!

114
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,950
Park Sang Man?

115
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,930
- You are Park Sang Man, right?
 - Yes. What is it?

116
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,910
- Who are you?
 - I'm the one who will prove your dad's innocence.

117
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,040
 In exchange, return to school tomorrow.

118
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,670
You, come over here.

119
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,410
Why did you take off your backpack? Stand here.

120
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,200
 The real culprit of this case is revealed after 10 years.

121
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,700
 Believe me and continue your studies, Park Sang Man.

122
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,920
How can he study?

123
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,380
Do you think he will be first in the school?

124
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,330
Hey, be careful.

125
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,150
That punk might stab you for rolling your eyes, just like his dad.

126
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,950
 It won't take too long. Bear it and get through it.

127
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,830
I know it's hard to believe unless I show you the results.

128
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,690
But believe me.

129
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,290
There's nothing you can do to help your dad now anyway.

130
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,320
 Again My Life

131
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,980
 Drinking when you feel like it's not enough... will it fill what's not there?

132
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,870
Ohh, my kid brother!

133
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,230
- Sunbaenim!
 - Yeah.

134
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,230
What's the matter? Sit down.

135
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,030
Please take a look at this case.

136
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,610
 Daesin News: "Man who killed his friend of forty years, arrested due to his fingerprints found on the weapon."

137
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,880
What about this?

138
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,490
It's the father of a friend I know.

139
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,840
I feel like the police have missed something.

140
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,680
Hey, Kim Hui Wu. Why are you meddling?

141
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,780
Murder case arrest rate in Korea?

142
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,040
It's almost 100%.

143
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,690
Here!

144
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,310
- They found the murder weapon, right?
 -  Yes.

145
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,100
- They got fingerprints there.
 - Yes.

146
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,440
- There is a grudge.
 - That's right.

147
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,630
- Gosh! He was drunk?
 - Yes.

148
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,890
That's it. There's no need to dig deeper.

149
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,910
That's the problem.

150
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:40,240
- Murder weapon, motive, and fingerprints. Everything came out very perfectly and quickly.
 - What?

151
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,110
There was so much evidence

152
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,550
that they didn't even feel the need to prove his innocence.

153
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,760
Take a look at this.

154
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,700
Now, look here.

155
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,410
- What's this?
 - It's the clothes my friend's father wore on the day of the murder.

156
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,370
If you check the CCTV in the vicinity, you can confirm it.

157
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,320
What's the probability of not having blood stains on your clothes when stabbing someone?

158
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,810
Zero! As you see, the clothes are clean.

159
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,940
And there is no evidence that it was washed or erased.

160
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,730
Other than this also, there are many ways to confirm it.

161
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,010
Wow!

162
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,850
Sunbaenim, wasn't the law actually made for the suspect?

163
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:31,460
I learned that avoiding unfair punishment comes first.

164
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:36,040
If this is true, then there's a gaping hole in the police force.

165
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,230
And the prosecution is filling it?

166
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,850
Then, the story becomes splendid!

167
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,360
Do you know anything else in detail?

168
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,570
Of course!

169
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,150
Okay, Ms. Lee Seon Yeong.

170
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,970
- You are Hong In Pyo's wife, right?
 - Yes.

171
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,490
I heard that you often said you wanted to kill your husband.

172
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,730
- Is that right?
 - Please call my lawyer.

173
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,030
Right. Of course.

174
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,810
But before that...

175
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,370
Here.

176
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,380
What is this?

177
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,730
You must be glad to meet him.

178
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,560
The affair itself began with a breach of trust.

179
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,470
How can you have faith in that? Let's hear what happened on the day of the murder.

180
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,690
That day... I received a phone call late at night.

181
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,420
 Why are you calling a person who was on his way out?

182
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,040
 What this? Have you lost your mind?!

183
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,320
 You said... you needed money, right?

184
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,820
 This man's property is ours now.

185
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,530
 We are going to be rich now.

186
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,500
 This...

187
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,830
 Quickly take this far away and burn it.

188
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:56,390
 This knife too. Hurry.

189
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,990
Did you kill your husband Hong In Pyo?

190
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,910
Yes. I did it.

191
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,610
Why?

192
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,820
It was a good opportunity.

193
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,640
 Pay me back at once. My 100 million won! The money I worked so hard for.

194
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:23,550
 Hey... friend. How can I pay back what I don't even remember borrowing?

195
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,980
 Do you have proof that you loaned me money?

196
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,380
 You... How could you do this to me?

197
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,010
 Stab me.

198
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,260
 Go ahead and stab me!

199
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,990
 Stab me!

200
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,780
 If you want to ruin your son, Sang Man's future, try and stab me!

201
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,110
 That bastard deserved worse than death.

202
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,100
He only thinks about himself.

203
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,120
He would often disregard the weak and beat them.

204
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,020
You're right. That's why I have always wanted to kill him.

205
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,100
And I was afraid that I would be caught in my infidelity too.

206
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,120
 Prosecutor, I'll be pardoned right?

207
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,950
 If you're not careful, you'll take the fall for everything. So think wisely.

208
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,700
 1 day ago
 - That will never happen.
 - All right.

209
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,870
 - Where did you hide it?
 - Sorry? Hide what?

210
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,360
You're giving it away by acting surprised like that.

211
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,050
The evidence from the scene of Hong In Pyo's murder. You're the one who hid it!

212
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,000
 Prosecutor, you shouldn't count your chickens before they hatch.

213
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,920
 There's a trend in those who hide those types of things.

214
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,060
 Nowadays, kimchi refrigerators?

215
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,950
 They tend to hide them there.

216
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,720
 If I find it, and recover it. You'll be charged with concealing evidence,

217
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,770
 and negligent homicide, and conspiracy, no—

218
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,030
 Never mind. I'm just going straight for homicide.

219
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,420
 If you confess now and ease the load of work on my subordinates,

220
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,200
 t would help reduce your sentence, yes? Here ...

221
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,710
 Prosecutor, I will tell you everything.

222
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,160
 Hey, wrap it up.

223
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,320
 - Yes, sir.
 - Prosecutor.

224
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,330
 Prosecutor!

225
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,750
Everything was exactly as Hui Wu had said.

226
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,240
 Pressure the wife's lover first.

227
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,280
 It's something he can use to hold leverage over her. So he clearly must've hidden it somewhere.

228
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,830
 I'm half-joking, but

229
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,510
 they say there's a trend in where those things are hidden.

230
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:51,630
 First-time offenders tend to follow what's depicted in videos or movies.

231
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,890
 For example... I mean, I'd hide it in my kimchi refrigerator.

232
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,020
 - Gosh.
 - Joking.

233
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,070
 But you never know.

234
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,580
Kim Hui Wu, who the heck is he?

235
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,470
what the hell is he?

236
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,960
- Oh, Prosecutor Jang.
 - Oh, yes.

237
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,430
- Well done! I just heard it.
 - Ah yes.

238
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,340
It'll be a big thing when the media hears about it!

239
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,550
There are great expectations of you.

240
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,720
Thank you, sir!

241
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,210
Hey, Kim Hui Wu, thank you.

242
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:50,170
I feel really awkward being in the position of owing you.

243
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,780
But it's actually not bad.

244
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,300
Seonbae, you just need to keep marching on the smooth, obstacle free road.

245
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,110
I'm just your lumberjack.

246
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,650
Hey!  I have to say you're really growing on me.

247
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,490
You need to keep your wits sharp. Hui Wu is quite extraordinary.

248
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,930
If he becomes a prosecutor, surely he'll be soaring here and there.

249
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:14,480
I know. You'll help me out later on, right?

250
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,190
Oh! I'm embarrassed. I'm still lacking.

251
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,250
Hey, don't be so modest.

252
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,490
You can be aptly arrogant, and as long as your work can back it up,

253
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,710
that's way cooler.

254
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,980
Hey, Kim Hui Wu, how did you know?

255
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,820
Sorry?

256
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,800
How would I know?

257
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,880
No, I mean you said it was a favor,

258
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,290
said it was half a joke, and everything you told me was exactly correct.

259
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,160
And what's more, you sounded professional.

260
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,810
I was merely earnest and was lucky.

261
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,660
You listened to me, Sunbae-nim, and even resolved it.

262
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,500
I am just so very thankful.

263
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,530
Here. With this atmosphere, let's all have a shot, guys!

264
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,950
We'll be saying cheers.

265
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,650
And we'll continue zooming straight down.  (Onomatopoeia for drinking was used as a pun)

266
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,600
 It was the first case I worked on as a prosecutor. Of course, I know everything about it.

267
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,170
- Go all out.
 - And you need to work a bit harder.

268
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,030
- Over here!
 - Honey!

269
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,410
Father!

270
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,520
Honey!

271
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,540
Don't worry! I'm fine. You must have been worried sick.

272
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,500
Honey, it must've been so hard.

273
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,580
- Oh you're so gaunt.
 - No it's okay.

274
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,030
You must've suffered so much.

275
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,870
You look so skinny.

276
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,790
I feel so bad for you, Honey.

277
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,210
- Are you okay? How's your health?
 - I'm fine.

278
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,560
 You were the one who saved your father.

279
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,780
It took ten years.

280
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,690
 Please prove my father's innocence.

281
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,750
 Please help me, Prosecutor.

282
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,520
So at least your face doesn't look as bad.

283
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,750
 It must have been hard because of me.

284
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,580
 The ten years that it took to reach the truth,

285
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,970
 use them solely on yourself this time, Park Sang Man.

286
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,380
 It's so nice since you're finally out.

287
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,360
 Wishing you perfect scores on the CSAT

288
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,440
- Fighting!
  CSAT, even if you guess may it be correct. Let's go! Let's go to college!

289
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,640
 With the wisdom you have acquired, we hope you get a high score.

290
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,470
 CSAT, 18th Testing Site

291
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,820
Fighting! You can do it!

292
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,900
Kim Han Mi!

293
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,620
What? Have you come to wish me luck?

294
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,600
This early morning? In this weather?

295
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,490
You deserve it.

296
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,380
- As a woman?
- As my student.

297
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:47,140
- Your defense is unbeatable.
 - Just do as you've prepared, don't get nervous.

298
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,130
- Were you this nervous too?
-  Don't worry,

299
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,150
you studied hard, so expect good results.

300
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,360
What? Are you scared?

301
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,350
I expected as much, so I prepared something for you.

302
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,000
- For me?
 - Yes.

303
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,860
- What is this?
 - Let's call them good luck charms.

304
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,780
I used these pens last year.

305
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:19,960
They're filled with the energy of a student who got into Hankuk School of Law.

306
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,420
♫  Waking up in darkness  ♫

307
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,450
- Your arrogance is overflowing.
 - Of course it is.

308
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,760
♫   frozen time  ♫

309
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,540
The CSAT pens filled with the energy of arrogant Hui Wu. It's a nice feeling.

310
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,590
♫  I'm lost somewhere it is pitch black in front of me  ♫

311
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,130
♫  And if I get another chance  ♫

312
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,020
Don't worry too much.

313
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,800
You're my student who's smarter than anyone else.

314
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,820
Do well on your test. Then I'll be off.

315
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,530
♫  In the suffocating smoke  ♫

316
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,270
♫  I wanna rise higher  ♫

317
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,940

 Kim Han Mi

353
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,120
- Yes?
 - You got accepted into all the colleges you applied for.

354
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,220
- Yes.
 - You can go to Songwha Women's University Dept of English.

355
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,150
Aren't congratulations in order for things like this?

356
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,330
- I thought you weren't interested  and out of the blue—
 - Kim Han Mi.

357
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,910
- Are you afraid of me turning out well?
 - What?

358
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,550
I put in my own effort to get accepted, can't I decide for myself on the school and major?

359
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,520
Did you forget? Live quietly.

360
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,110
Don't select a job where your name will become known.

361
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,470
You cannot go into media or public service, even more so.

362
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,510
 Do as you're told

363
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,080
if you'd like to continue to live in a country where you at least speak the same language.

Yes.

367
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,470
You chose well. You'll become a good reporter.

368
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,930
Huh? What?

369
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,880
How did you know?

370
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,300
I haven't told anyone yet.

371
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,620
Well, just...

372
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,690
Don't kids who go to the Department of Mass Communication usually dream of being a journalist?

373
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,840
Oh... Good point.

374
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,950
Proud of you, Kim Han Mi!

375
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,360
I am proud of you too! For not giving up on me.

376
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,090
Thanks to your determination, I was able to come this far.

377
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,170
Thank you!

378
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,790
No, this is just the starting point.

379
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,110
- You haven't reached anywhere yet.
 - Ugh.

380
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,920
Gosh!

381
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,180
Just when I start to like you, you have to ruin the mood.`

382
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,960
I like that.

383
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,990
Anyway, be thankful later.

384
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,100
- Pay me back when you become a journalist.
 - Okay!

385
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,190
I am sure there will be a day when I'll pay you back big time.

386
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,380
- Cheers!
 - Okay!

387
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,190
Waiting for that day! Congratulations, Han Mi!

388
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,150
It doesn't suit me to be this happy.

389
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,330
If it doesn't suit you, who would it suit?

390
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,750
Do you want me to cover you thickly with happiness?

391
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,880
- How?
 - Order another side dish.

392
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,040
- Wow... it's so easy.
 - Yes it is.

393
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,190
If I order a side dish here and it tastes good, I feel so happy!

394
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,360
I feel really good!

395
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,410
Why is your expression like this then?

396
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,370
Don't you know?

397
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,770
Why I'm unable to fully enjoy this?

398
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,860
Did I want to be acknowledged?

399
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,660
Mom, Dad! Today was hard wasn't it?

400
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,700
How can I help you?

401
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,080
What's with the mood?

402
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,030
Business wasn't good today, right?

403
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,440
My baby boy!

404
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,320
Son!! So... that is...

405
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,100
What's the matter?

406
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,110
You got a draft notice.

407
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,580
Gosh! Why would I receive the draft again...

408
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,000
 Draft Notice To Mr. Kim Hui Wu

409
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:56,080
Oh my God, my son has grown so much. Now he is going to serve in the military.

410
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,400
Yes.

411
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,770
Th-The military is a thing.

412
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,150
Of course, it's is a thing. All countries have one.

413
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,050
Our country has a draft system.

414
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:10,220
That... if you pass the exam, you can become a military judicial officer.

415
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,000
- Oh right, the military judicial officer.
 - I think it would be good for you to take it on like a man, without any delay.

416
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,270
Yes. I will do so.

417
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,530
By the way, I was from the Special Forces.

418
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,760
When I was parachuting, I was able to shoot at a peanut and hit it.

419
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,310
When I was a diver, once I got into the water, I came out the next day.

420
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,440
What are you saying? You were the military cook, weren't you?

421
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,170
- In every letter, you whined about not wanting to peel onions.
 - I was the Special Forces cook.

422
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:37,820
There was also a time when I had to peel 1000 onions in one sitting. When your mother came to visit at that time,

423
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,760
she was touched that I was crying and did not go home that day.

424
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,200
That's cool!

425
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,070
That's when you were made.

426
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,290
Stop it!

427
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,510
What? Military?

428
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,590
You subtly keep doing whatever you want.

429
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,260
Subtly? This is on the face. Who gives only a two-day notice?

430
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,980
Like someone here. I am upset.

431
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,970
- Like you'd be more upset than the guy going to the army a second time.
 - What?

432
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,080
Yes. What? Why?

433
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,520
But, why are you getting angry?

434
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,420
- We are just flustered!
 - We are just flustered!

435
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:18,090
Aren't you nervous? How come you are always in a far-sighted mood?

436
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:21,430
 - Why would I be nervous when it's my second time?
 - Then again...

437
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,460
It's not like you're going twice. Finish it short and sweet.

438
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,430
Meanwhile, we will become old-fashioned seniors.

439
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,750
Okay!

440
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,980
If you come in as my junior, you are dead!

441
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,560
I will make it hard for you, so be prepared.

442
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,030
Anytime.

443
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,610
I am speechless.

444
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,610
By the way, what did you say earlier? Like someone?

445
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,350
- Don't you know yet? Hui Ah...
 - What?

446
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,670
She is going abroad to study. The day after tomorrow.

447
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,600
Oh, okay.

448
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,470
Yes, esteemed elder.

449
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,870
What, elder?

450
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,430
He has so many secrets. What's with the elder?

451
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,590
- Do you notice anything?
 - Not sure...

452
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,300
He doesn't open up about his private life.

453
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:19,790
Wow, he is so charming, Hui Wu. He is the first guy to make me this curious.

454
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,220
Okay, everyone! I have a dinner appointment, I will take my leave now.

455
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,750
- His cool nature. Wow.
 - Where are you going?

456
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,910
Aren't you having a farewell drink? You should have a farewell party.

457
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:37,080
Why is going to the military a farewell? Time will fly.

458
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,040
Anyway, I'll be back safely. I'll see you on the other side, Sunbae.

459
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,360
I'll be back!

460
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,530
Does he think of the military as a 4-day retreat?

461
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,850
Not even a retreat, but a Templestay, maybe?

462
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,200
 Real Estate

463
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,890
I am going to the military.

464
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,800
So? No need to tell me about it.

465
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,820
About the money you gave me. Because it's such a large amount

466
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,110
leaving it quietly for two years doesn't feel right.

467
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,270
I couldn't think of a way to manage it safely.

468
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,950
That's why...

469
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,370
Here you go.

470
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,750
Please watch over it.

471
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,400
Do you think I'll readily accept money that I've already given away?

472
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,740
Also! How do you when what will happen to me?

473
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,440
But no matter how I think about it,

474
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,070
you're the only one who can handle this money.

475
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,830
Is that so?

476
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,730
There are some real estate properties I have my eyes on.

477
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,510
Where are they?

478
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,220
Mapo.

479
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,820
 As expected!

480
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:07,480
Seeing how you're not questioning me, I take it you have a gut feeling about this.

481
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,930
I already felt that you were not a normal guy.

482
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,780
Please take care of it.

483
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,720
Alright. I'll at least ease your concerns before you go to the military.

484
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,310
Master! Thank you!

485
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,400
Loyalty!

486
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,060
 A life is given to me again.

487
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,330
 Mom, Dad.

488
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,530
 - Kim Gyu Ri!
 - Don't try to repay in the wrong way.

489
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,550
 You are my friend, right. We are all your friends!

490
00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:00,310
 I am a freshman. Computer Engineering Major. Kim Hui Ah. And you?

491
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:04,980
 Do you know what real estate is? You see only money if you started with that as a goal.

492
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,900
 Thank you.

493
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:11,970
 I am changing the lives of precious people around me and the future.

494
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:18,410
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

495
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,870
♫  Who would ever find out who you really are? Hm  ♫

496
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,810
 I, Jo Tae Seop, will help you.

497
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:30,980
 - I am Jo Tae Seop.
  - Jo Tae Seop! Jo Tae Seop!

498
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,410
 I need to let my son, Hyeon Seok, go.

499
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:41,890
 Even Jo Tae Seop's life is changing a little bit.

500
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,440
♫  I don't care what they say  ♫

501
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,010
♫  At the end, They'll know there's no where to hide  ♫

502
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,760
 And...

503
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,040
 Han Ji Hyeon...

504
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,940
♫  Oh I'll wait for now   ♫

505
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,410
♫  Let them get what they want  ♫

506
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:09,480
♫  At the end, I'll get that chance to beat them  ♫

507
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,310
Will you be alright alone?

508
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,020
Why am I tearing up?

509
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:33,530
If both of you accompany me, I don't think I can leave.

510
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,910
Let me just say goodbye here.

511
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,720
Be healthy. Don't hurt yourself.

512
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,100
Okay.

513
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,680
Please sit down. Let me bow to you.

514
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,410
Okay, let's see it.

515
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,530
Mother and Father, I'll be back safe and sound.

516
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,430
Why didn't you tell me?

517
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,200
It's upsetting.

518
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,860
And you?

519
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,450
Same reason, then?

520
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,810
Aren't you leaving?

521
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,540
Yes, I should.

522
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,590
- Hey?
 - Keep quiet.

523
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,120
You're supposed to play dumb at times like these.

524
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:39,580
Besides my dad, you're the first man whose arm I've held.

525
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,950
This is the end.

526
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,130
Goodbye, Kim Hui Wu. Let's meet again.

527
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,080
Alright. Let's meet again.

528
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,760
Go safely.

529
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,390
You too.

530
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,880
- I'll get going.
 - Yeah.

531
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,130
 Seven Years Later

532
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,700
 Gangwon District Prosecutors' Office, Gimsan Branch Office

533
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,920
Hello. I am Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

534
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,790
 Branch Chief Jeon Seok Gyu

535
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,590
- Kim Hui Wu?
 - Yes.

536
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,950
- Top at the training center?
 - Yes.

537
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,670
So why have you come here?

538
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,240
I came here to take you to Seoul.

539
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,250
- Me?
 - Yes.

540
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,670
Is it not to keep an eye on me?

541
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,110
You're mistaken.

542
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:07,110
- About what?
 - You're not even worth keeping an eye on.

543
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,320
- Is that so?
 - Yes.

544
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,450
Now I'm curious. I'm a throwaway prosecutor, and you're here to take me to Seoul for no good reason?

545
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,510
Good reason? I can make you one.

546
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,300
Got it. You can find your office, right?

547
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:27,420
Detective Oh Min Guk will assist you with any questions. Let's have a drink once Prosecutor Ji Seong Ho's back.

548
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,790
- You can go.
- Sure.

549
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,670
- Top at the training center?
- Yeah.

550
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,810
I've never seen a top-rated prosecutor in my 15-year career as an investigator.

551
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,310
And the funny thing is that he applied to come here.

552
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:52,570
Really? The head of the training center class chose our branch?

553
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,710
That's what I'm saying!

554
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,610
But why? Isn't it a given to apply to Seoul with such a resume?

555
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,800
Yeah! It's strange, isn't it?

556
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,820
For sure! Why would someone apply to a rural area unless they've lost their mind?

557
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:08,780
I hope he's not an over-achiever. Those are the ones who always get into trouble.

558
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:15,540
Don't worry. There's nothing to over achieve about here.

559
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,300
The Branch Chief is living proof of that.

560
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,630
- True.
 - I love it.

561
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,640
Hello. I am Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

562
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,830
Hello Prosecutor, I am Investigator Oh Min Guk.

563
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,600
Oh right, it's nice to meet you.

564
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,100
Oh, I work for Mr. Ji, so.

565
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,540
- Is that my desk?
 - Yes.

566
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,330
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

567
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,520
I organized your desk with the basics. If you need anything, just tell me.

568
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,550
It's my first day. Can I still take your offer?

569
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,230
Of course, you can. Would you like some coffee?

570
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,940
No. I can get coffee myself.

571
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:10,880
Gather all the cases from the last six months, whether they're criminal or civil, and report them to me.

572
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,530
- Pardon?
 - You told me I could ask for anything.

573
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,930
Ah, ah, right, yes.

574
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,400
What is this unnerving sensation?

575
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,800
We have a newbie, right?

576
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,740
Oh, yes. I am Kim Hui Wu.

577
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,380
There's no need for that. Follow me.

578
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,800
Wow! The Regional Prosecutor is here!

579
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,490
Have a seat first.

580
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:58,290
So that's where all of you were.

581
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:02,180
Your face has become better, Hyeong-nim. I guess you're living comfortably now.

582
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,640
- Yes
 - The mayor.

583
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,360
We're busy handling all of the cases

584
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,230
so you must have a lot of free time.

585
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,760
Police precinct head officer.

586
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,060
You're right.

587
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,150
Since it's been a long time since we last met, you should have a drink, yeah?

588
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,160
Assemblyman.

589
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:29,690
And that gaudy-looking guy is the community leader, but he's a gang leader.

590
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,970
Everyone was born and raised here.

591
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,720
Here.

592
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,510
Thank you.

593
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,180
I love it a lot. I love that the regional prosecutor is able to drink so well!

594
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,980
You're doing so well.

595
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,070
I'm putting in a good word to the superiors for you, so there's going to be good news soon.

596
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,260
Shouldn't you go to a better place when you leave here?

597
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,120
Thank you.

598
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,520
You saw right? That's the country for you.

599
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,990
In the country, your connections come before the law.

600
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:11,020
They're all so tied up together, so they're mean to outsiders.

601
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,530
These sons of bitches.

602
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,710
What's up with you today? Throwing out these grievances.

603
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,110
I just wanted to say it.

604
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:23,000
I didn't want the rookie to take me lightly.

605
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,850
That's what makes you look easy.

606
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:28,300
You could just follow my concept.

607
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,490
It's because your politics are neither here nor there

608
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:35,580
that you're like this.

609
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,950
What's so cool about being a lone wolf?

610
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,450
There are no ropes to rescue us.

611
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,050
This guy's drunk again. Come to your senses, kid.

612
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,650
Yes.

613
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,750
Team Leader,

614
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,510
don't you want to go to Seoul?

615
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,300
Why do you keep nagging at my side about Seoul?

616
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:04,760
The way I see it,  although you've been exiled here because you upset your superiors,

617
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,210
I don't think the fire from your youth is gone.

618
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:13,870
Are you drunk too? The arrogant talk from earlier is all I need.

619
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:17,250
But you want to go, don't you?

620
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,860
Seoul. Seoul. Seoul.

621
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,750
Pretending you don't.

622
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,720
I'll send you. To Seoul.

623
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,180
- Stop.
 - Regional Prosecutor—

624
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,540
Be quiet while you're here.

625
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,910
Then why would I have bothered to come here?

626
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:38,060
What, is there something you want here?

627
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,490
- Yes.
 - What is it?

628
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:45,370
As for that, I'll report to you once I've sorted it out.

629
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:49,860
Your motivation might be overflowing, but there won't be much for you to do.

630
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,660
- Can I act freely?
 - As freely as you want.

631
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,940
If you give me permission, starting from when I start and end work?

632
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:01,230
Do as you please! Even if you come to work, there's nothing for you to do at this regional prosecutor's office.

633
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,170
- Want a drink?
 - Yes.

634
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,420
It's been a few days, so what do you think about Prosecutor Kim? You were worried that he'd be hard to work with.

635
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,820
I thought so too, at first. So I was really nervous.

636
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,510
And?

637
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:40,150
Don't be surprised. He really, truly does absolutely nothing.

638
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,770
- He aggressively does nothing.
 - Nothing?

639
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,420
Right. On some days he doesn't even come to work.

640
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,690
In some ways, he does even less work than the regional prosecutor.

641
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:50,420
Even the first place in the training institute is helpless in Gimsan.

642
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,320
No, he could be really smart on the flipside.

643
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:59,680
As a reward to himself for studying all these years, he came on vacation. Paid vacation.

644
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,460
Or he could be a weirdo.

645
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,760
Weirdo.

646
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:08,930
What is all this, Prosecutor Kim?

647
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:12,220
Please reorganize all of these files.

648
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,330
- All of this?
 - Yes.

649
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:19,650
When I looked over all the files you gave me last time, I thought this was a quiet neighborhood,

650
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,580
but there were a lot more cases than I thought.

651
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,710
When am I supposed to—

652
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,970
When do you think? Before you clock out today, of course.

653
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,950
Before the end of the workday? How can I—

654
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,880
Oh by the way have you heard of the Yuchae faction?

655
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,770
Yes, they run a few of the entertainment joints. They're the neighborhood gangsters.

656
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:36,770
Neighborhood gangsters...

657
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:42,770
So when I looked at the investigations, all the cases relating to the Yuchae faction weren't closed.

658
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:45,480
So will you reinvestigate them all?

659
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,150
Yes. I will.

660
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,190
I will be working offsite for a couple of days.

661
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:03,140
Ah, and send all of the information you organized to me by mail.

662
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,260
I'm supposed to reorganize all of this?

663
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:16,210
He was a weirdo.

664
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,800
Yes, Elder. Have you been well? It's Hui Wu.

665
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,140
Yes. I was going to see you. Right now.

666
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,590
Hello!

667
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:31,250
Oh my! What brings this old man here?

668
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,550
I came to meet you, old man.

669
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:35,790
Well, I'm naturally an old man.

670
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,320
Sure.

671
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:40,950
What about Sang Man?

672
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:45,140
Yeah. Well, I did take him in because you earnestly asked for it, but...

673
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,230
What about it? He should be a good kid.

674
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:52,690
He's good and all, but he doesn't respect the elderly. Talks back.

675
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:58,160
Wow, you sure have a lot of energy. And you pour all of that energy to insult me?

676
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,880
Look at the way he talks. So rude.

677
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,570
- It's time for your medicine.
 - I won't take it, you brat.

678
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:09,450
Please take it. Straight down.

679
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:14,760
Hyeong-nim. Did you have a safe trip?

680
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,340
Indeed. Could you be any slower to greet me?

681
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,940
Elder needs a lot of help.

682
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:22,570
I don't know where he sold off his manners.

683
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,660
 Please teach him well until I finish at the institute.

684
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,860
 Hello. I am Park Sang Man.

685
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,570
 Got it.

686
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,330
So are you here to take him back?

687
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,970
Yes, I am.

688
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:49,140
- You're ready, right?
 - Yes. Let's go.

689
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,550
Oh, are you sad to see me go?

690
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:53,510
Leave quietly or I'll tie you down.

691
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:56,550
Wow, I'm so scared. I'll be back!

692
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,480
While I'm gone, be sure to take your medicine well.

693
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,250
Yes, be well.

694
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,780
Yes.

695
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,450
Then, we'll get going.

696
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:36,420
This is great. Now that I'm in the field. It's so refreshing.

697
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,500
I brought the money like you asked, but where will you spend it?

698
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,080
Are you going to buy that building?

699
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:46,050
Don't get too ahead of yourself. Elder was concerned about you.

700
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:51,370
I sought you out because I wanted to repay you and maybe stake my life on you...

701
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,420
 Mr. Kim Hui Wu?

702
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,120
 Park Sang Man, how did you...?

703
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,180
 Did you think that I wouldn't be able to find you?

704
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,630
 Well, you did spend ten years finding the criminal. I must've been easy...

705
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:13,240
 I wanted to meet you Sunbae-nim. Let me greet you formally.

706
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,000
 I am Park Sang Man!

707
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,070
 I'm also a student at Hankuk University and I'm studying computer science,

708
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:21,560
 and I was a scholarship student until last semester.

709
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,970
 But I still haven't had a campus romance. But

710
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:26,860
 after receiving the enthusiastic support of my professors and male classmates, I stand before you...

711
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,480
 He's much brighter than I expected.

712
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,110
 Why are you laughing?

713
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,650
 No reason. It's nice to meet you.

714
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:39,670
 I came to pay you back for saving my father.

715
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,090
 From now on, these hands and feet

716
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:46,240
 "are yours," was what I wanted to say...

717
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,810
 Helping the elder is the same as helping me,

718
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,830
 so learn everything thoroughly.

719
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:58,470
Nagging here and nagging over there.

720
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:04,250
I thought something interesting might happen when I went in the field.

721
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,310
Something interesting will happen soon. Take the bag.

722
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:22,590
What?

723
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:26,420
I heard there's a house nearby.

724
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:31,480
What? There's nothing like that here, so go on your way.

725
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,820
Now then...

726
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,880
I really shouldn't do this.

727
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,690
Let's have a little taste.

728
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:55,510
By the way mister, you shouldn't make an estimate just based on the size of the building.

729
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:58,640
It's really big.

730
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,940
I'll escort you, Hyungnim!

731
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,880
This way, please.

732
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,390
Good shot.

733
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,120
The bag with the money...

734
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,050
Welcome, Boss.

735
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,470
The next time you visit, just ask for Ms. Kim.

736
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:44,820
Okay. I'll do that.

737
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,750
Let's go.

738
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,060
Let's go in.

♫  I won't back down again.   ♫

767
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,670
This is the most popular game.

768
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:43,020
The rules are simple. All you have to do is match the number on the dice.

769
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:47,660
But as you can see, the odds are different for each number.

770
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,950
If you hit 7, the number with the highest odds, you get six times the bet.

771
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:56,830
If you hit 2 or 12, the numbers with the lowest odds, you get 36 times the bet.

772
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,260
Easy, right?
 Yes, well. There's nothing too hard about it.

773
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,460
You're not playing any tricks, are you?

774
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,320
Of course not. We're a local business.

775
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,410
Have fun.

776
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,960
We will.

777
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,980
Here, here, come on ten!

778
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,870
Nine! Nine!

779
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:16,790
It's an 8.

780
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:18,960
It's an 8.

781
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,700
What the matter?

782
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:30,580
Ugh, really?

783
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,850
- Seven! Seven!
 - A hundred thousand won  (100 USD).

784
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,760
 Ten! Ten! Four! Ten!

785
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,130
Come out, come out.

786
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:42,180
Seven.

787
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,120
Seven.

788
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,750
It's a six.

789
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,020
Eight!

790
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,040
It's a seven.

791
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,090
- Five.
 - It's a seven.

792
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,490
- Eight. Five.
 - It's a seven. It's a nine.

793
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:23,780
Will you keep going?

794
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,460
Of course.

795
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,890
- Sang Man!
 - Yes?

796
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,610
Go exchange the rest of the money for more chips.

797
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,830
- Okay.
 - Also ...

798
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:33,860
Oh! And...

799
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,310
Let's keep going.

800
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,810
I have a good feeling.

801
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,400
Seven. All in.

802
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,500
- What?
- All in?

803
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,180
How much would that be if he's right?

804
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,050
It would be 42 million won  (42,000 USD).

805
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,240
Hold on.

806
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,560
I'll change it to six.

807
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,430
Six?

808
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,040
Are you sure you would like to change your choice to six?

809
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,330
 The corners of her mouth curved up.

810
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:39,120
I'm not sure. It also feels like it could be an eight.

811
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,750
It's an eight.

812
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,530
Or maybe a six?

813
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,150
 She's relaxed. Then maybe...

814
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:51,720
Seven!

815
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,450
Please make a final decision.

816
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:02,550
Oh. Sorry. I guess I'm just being overly cautious since I bet everything.

817
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,240
Hold on.

818
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,870
Six.

819
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:09,300
No,

820
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,220
let's go with seven.

821
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,090
Hold on.

822
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,880
I'm sorry.

823
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,180
I'll change it for the last time.

824
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,260
Let's go with six.

825
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,210
It's a seven.

826
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:57,120
- Why did you change it!?
 - Wow, just a single round and you're already bust.

827
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,250
Would you like to stop?

828
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:11,760
Yes. I've spent all the money I brought with me.

829
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,330
Good game.

830
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,260
You lost on purpose, right?

831
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,290
You kept changing your choice on purpose.

832
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:30,380
Being indecisive doesn't suit you.

833
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,440
So I watched the dealer.

834
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,660
As I kept looking, I found a pattern.

835
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,930
When you changed your number at the end,

836
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:43,710
It was subtle, but I saw her moving from hell to heaven.

837
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:46,670
How astute.

838
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:49,030
After spending so long with Elder, it feels like I've only gotten better at gambling.

839
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,810
At least you got better at something. Great job.

840
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:55,480
You're not the kind of person to spend money recklessly.

841
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,920
You're also not the kind of person to do it to impress a pretty dealer.

842
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,020
Don't you think I could win her heart without doing anything?

843
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:06,090
You don't miss a chance to show off. I respect that.

844
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:09,420
What is it? You even called me to go along with you.

845
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,710
It's boring if you know everything.

846
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:16,410
You'll see as we go along.

847
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:19,140
Either way, I'm on my way to Seoul.

848
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,490
- Turn off the lights.
 - Okay.

849
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,140
Could we share the bed?

850
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,220
- Don't cross the line.
 - Okay.

851
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,600
Oh? You're here early.

852
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,310
Yes. I read all of the materials you e-mailed me.

853
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:46,090
What about them?

854
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:49,800
Reorganize everything focusing on these events, one more time.

855
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,690
I've picked out the ones that had slight weaknesses in the police investigation.

856
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:56,750
Ah... I see.

857
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,080
When do you need it?

858
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,440
Before you leave work, of course.

859
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,100
You can send it via email.

860
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:19,380
Oh, right! I'll be working outside of the office for a few days.

861
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:29,650
That crazy...

862
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:32,090
He's driving me insane.

863
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,610
What's good here?

864
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:39,990
No need to deliberate too much. The flounder is the best this time of year.

865
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,570
- I'll take that.
 - Okay.

866
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,310
I'm Do Ah Jin.

867
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:53,880
- Why did you do that?
 - Do what?

868
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,420
You lost on purpose yesterday.

869
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,590
As if.

870
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:59,130
If I won, I would have gotten 40 million won.

871
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,590
What do you want to say?

872
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,370
 Good game.

873
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:14,960
 I have something to say.

874
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,410
 I have something to say.

875
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:19,730
If you're looking for a partner to cheat with, I'll leave now.

876
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:22,720
It's similar, but I have my own angle.

877
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,680
A personal interest?

878
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,100
I went through a lot of trouble to pick you out, but you keep disappointing me.

879
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,450
Do I look that simple to you?

880
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,960
Let's keep your point short and sweet.

881
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,890
Information on the Yuchae gang who run the gambling house.

882
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,000
What are you?

883
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,070
I'm Kim Hui Wu, the prosecutor at the Gimsan Branch Office.

884
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:00,820
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

885
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:04,850
Why are you calling me at this hour?

886
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,400
The Yuchae gang.  I'll wipe them out.

887
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,260
What?

888
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,070
Hey, what did you just say?

889
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,540
I said I will wipe out the Yuchae gang.

890
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:15,950
Do you have evidence?

891
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,180
I can make it now.

892
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,330
What's the matter with you?

893
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:22,000
 They are running an illegal gambling house.

894
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,900
That alone is reason enough. I'd like to call for police assistance.

895
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,430
Hey, punk, listen up.

896
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:32,270
I don't know what you're up to, but it's dangerous.  Don't do it.

897
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:34,010
 My job is prosecutor.

898
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:37,360
If I stop because it's dangerous, then I should quit.

899
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,390
Does he have to be so direct?

900
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:41,210
Hey, you saw them when we were drinking, right?

901
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:44,140
They're gangsters, right?  But those bastards think they're civil servants.

902
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:47,850
They're in cahoots with the cops. They're so chummy I bet they even prepare kimchi together.

903
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:51,470
 Police assistance is what they would ask for. Don't do it.

904
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:54,320
You don't know this place well. That's not how it works.

905
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:58,960
I'll try to do as you did in Seoul.

906
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,170
 What?

907
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:02,360
 Hey, Kim Hui Wu!

908
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,640
I'll report to you again.

909
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,690
 Hey. Hey, Kim Hui Wu!

910
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,600
Hey!!

911
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,790
That rock-headed punk.

912
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:16,650
 Billiards

913
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:18,970
Hyung, will this really be okay?

914
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:21,900
It's not okay, but if I go, it will be okay.

915
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,320
Why?  Because it's me.

916
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,670
You're sexy.

917
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:27,290
Want to get married to me?

918
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:29,380
Oh, that's bad luck.   Want me to slug you?

919
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,190
You're handsome.

920
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:34,480
Stop talking bull and be sure to be on time.

921
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,610
Yes!

922
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:37,520
 Billiards

923
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,500
I am going.

924
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,410
You're so cool.

925
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:51,030
 Billiards

926
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,430
Designated Smoking Area

927
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:03,390
 Gimsan Billiards

928
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:22,370
Aigoo, nice to see you.

929
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:23,880
You came again.

930
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,450
What'll it be this time? Craps again?

931
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:28,890
- No.
 - Then?

932
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:31,840
Attention everyone here!

933
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,880
Attention!

934
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:39,160
I'm from the Gimsan Branch Prosecutor's Office.

935
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:44,720
Everyone here is under arrest for violation of Articles 246 and 247

936
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,610
in flagrante delicto.

937
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:50,870
Quiet! Quiet!

938
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:54,010
I see you were a prosecutor all along.

939
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:57,750
But what's wrong with you? How can such an educated person be so senseless?

940
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,660
- Do you have a warrant?
 - Nope.

941
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:02,890
For in flagrante delicto, I learned a warrant is unnecessary.

942
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:03,950
Oh is that so?

943
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:07,760
You seem to be a little uneducated about being in the field.

944
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,270
However, I'm very good at understanding such things.

945
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:16,670
Okay, I understand that you, the young prosecutor, are upset because of what happened yesterday.

946
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:19,440
You can just tell us you're upset in a more positive tone.

947
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,120
What is all this? You're giving everyone a hard time with losses.

948
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,320
Here, here.

949
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,410
It's okay, it's okay.

950
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:32,040
Good.

951
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,910
Good, good.

952
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:37,370
Let's add bribery charges.

953
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,410
I guess you're serious.

954
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:43,520
Hey, prosecutor, you're really going to be in trouble.

955
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,250
This is Gimsan.

956
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:48,670
Do you know why Gimsan's shrimp are so plump and delicious?

957
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:51,640
It's because they grow up eating human corpses.

958
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:56,220
Would you like to be dipped in the shrimp habitat out front in the ocean?

959
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:01,260
Now you're threatening a prosecutor?

960
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,840
I'm adding obstruction of government duties.

961
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:08,200
You're going to get a lot of jail time. Huh? Huh?

962
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:11,960
Why you...!

963
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:17,890
I tried talking to you nicely,

964
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:21,620
but you won't accept my sincerity.

965
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,450
Hyeon Jong, give me the tool.

966
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:28,020
 Oh no, oh my.

967
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,690
You should kick the can instead.

968
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:33,510
Don't you know if you come at me with a knife, it'll add to your sentence?

969
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:35,950
I never learned it, you fucking prosecutor.

970
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,420
Crazy bastard.

971
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,360
One moment.

972
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:48,940
Looks like you have more than enough manpower.

973
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,950
Hey, it's me.

974
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:54,890
Now.

975
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:00,220
What? Turn on the light! Who did this!?

976
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:03,160
What? Which punk did it? Hey!

977
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:07,590
N-Not yet...

978
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,610
Hey, Sang Man!

979
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:21,310
Everybody freeze!

980
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,730
Hey, Sang Man!

981
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:27,170
What's going on?

982
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:28,710
Ajusshi, stay still!

983
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:30,490
Who are you, Ajusshi? Show me your ID!

984
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:32,100
Who are you?

985
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,350
Sang Man...

986
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,240
Hyung!

987
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,570
Investigator Oh, what happened?

988
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:39,700
I came as the backup from the District Prosecutor's Office

989
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:43,980
and this guy was suspiciously hanging around in front of the breaker.

990
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,950
That's understandable. It's not exactly something I should be doing with confidence.

991
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,740
You two are on the same team.

992
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:50,940
He said we are on the same team!

993
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,480
Same team?

994
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,740
Anyway, I still have some things to take care of, so make sure you're both safe,

995
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,380
and I'll see you later. Okay?

996
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,060
Yes.

997
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,910
You didn't need to come out just to greet me.

998
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:06,980
Let's go in.

999
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,200
Why are there so many workers in such a tiny business?

1000
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:27,600
Hey. Do you guys get a dedicated break room working here? Huh!?

1001
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,680
I'm a Korean prosecutor. I guess that won't work on you guys.

1002
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,830
Hey. I don't have time.

1003
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:36,320
Let's get things started.

1004
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,400
Come here!!

1005
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:49,260

1010
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:04,800
♫  You make me bad with cowardly words  ♫

1011

 ♫  You can't get away from me.  ♫

1020
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:32,620
Yes, of course.

1021
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,920
Okay then. Let's go.

1022
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,380
Okay.

1023
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,070
♫  Oh, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on  ♫

1024

1025

♫  Bring it on Bring it on  ♫

1026
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:50,790
 There's an office next to the gambling parlor's chip exchange.

1027
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:53,260
 It's the base of the Yuchae faction.

1028
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:57,380
 It's an office, but even we can't go in there.

1029
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:01,600
 I bet you'll find what you're looking for there.

1030
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:08,880
Oh. Here they were.

1031
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,580
- Investigator.
 - Yes?

1032
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:14,600
Begin seizing every document that's in this office.

1033
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,660
Okay, I understand. I'll bring some boxes.

1034
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:23,640
Sang Man, hack the computer password and compare it to the books.

1035
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,680
Okay.

1036
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,260
Do you think hacking the computer password will be...

1037
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,970
possible.

1038
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:36,890
 What was I worried about? He broke through the prosecutor's office server in order to clear his father's name.

1039
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:39,000
Who are you?

1040
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:48,570
 Staff Only

1041
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:54,390
Are you okay, Investigator?

1042
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:56,550
I'm o-o-okay.

1043
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:15,240
- Sang Man.
 - Yes!

1044
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,090
Hey, it's good to see you, Lee Yeon Seok.

1045
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,380
- Do you know me?
 - You're the reason I'm here.

1046
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,450
Of course, I know you.

1047
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:32,260
Then you must know who my master is.

1048
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,990
I do. Very well.

1049
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,970
But, you should work for me from now on.

1050
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:40,120
I know that you want to use your fists to fight for something meaningful.

1051
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,900
Seems like that mouth of yours will be torn soon by the sound of it.

1052
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:48,620
How come you speak in such a scary manner? I'm scared.

1053
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:51,320
Fine.

1054
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,520
I'll win for your sake.

1055
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,170
If I do, you have to listen to me. Okay?

1056
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:58,530
Sure, Hyeong.

1057
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:01,060
Then even if your trap is ripped open, we're even.

1058
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:02,800
Deal.

1059
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,260
 Lee Yeon Seok.

1060
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:46,780
 If he's left like this, he'll become the best fist in the whole country.

1061
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,240
 This time,

1062
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:55,050
 I won't leave him to live life like that.

1063
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,010
You bastard, seriously.

1064
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,000
- Sang Man!
 - Yes!

1065
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,290
- This guy.
 - Should I kill him?
 - What?

1066
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:10,540
That's what they do in movies.

1067
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:13,090
I almost lost! What are you talking about?

1068
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:15,060
We should get him a job.

1069
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,980
- Where?
 - Working under you.

1070
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,960
Excuse me?

1071
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,890
We need a new employee anyway. He can be your bodyguard too.

1072
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:25,980
I'd need a guard to protect me from him first.

1073
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:29,020
He doesn't bite. Don't worry. He'll listen to you.

1074
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:30,510
Educate him well.

1075
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,280
But...

1076
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,460
Okay, Hyungnim!

1077
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,900
H-H-Hey,

1078
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:40,000
