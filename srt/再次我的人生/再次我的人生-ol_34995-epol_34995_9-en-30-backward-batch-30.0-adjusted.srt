1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,950

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,840
 Lee Joon Gi

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,830
 Lee Kyung Young

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,380
 Kim Ji Eun

5
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,240
 Again My Life

6
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,050
 Episode 9

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,490
- You're here.
 - Yes, sir.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,690
- What's the matter?
 - I've instructed Kim Hui Wu.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,740
Jang Il Hyeon will be arrested soon.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,050
Seonbae Jang?

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,750
Are you ditching him?

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,810
I'm just teaching him a lesson.

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,770
As you know, it would be a waste to let go of him that way.

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,930
We've known each other for a long time as well.

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,540
While he's reflecting on himself, there's something you need to do for me.

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,200
There's a big nuisance to deal with because of Mirae Electronics.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,060
We need an offering to wash away our sins.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,460
Get Jeon Seok Gyu.

19
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,970
We let him transfer to Seoul, but he's hiding his claws and waiting to show his true ambition.

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,660
From the fact that he's been investigating Jang Il Hyeon and Seong Jin Mi.

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,220
The fake company President Jeon Il Bo at Mirae Electronics set up

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,330
sent deposits to this borrowed-name account on a regular basis. Take this andâ€”

23
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,270
I'll make sure it's found in Jeon Seok Gyu's possession.

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,970
- Do you think you can pull it off?
 - Yes, sir.

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,230
This stays between us.

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,340
Proceed quietly.

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,090
Yes, sir.

28
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,970
- You're here.
 - Yes.

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,120
So what's this about?

30
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,450
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun ordered me to take down Jang Il Hyeon.

31
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,530
Kim Seok Hun wants to take down Jang Il Hyeon?

32
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,040
- He ordered you to do it?
 - Yes.

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,940
Handing over his right-hand man to a close junior prosecutor of his...

34
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,940
Maybe he doesn't want to see Prosecutor Jang fall off the cliff.

35
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,390
He wants to put on a show. He doesn't intend to arrest him.

36
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,720
Right.

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,540
Then it means he needs someone to take the bullet instead of Jang Il Hyeon.

38
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,000
I feel like that person is...

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,990
No way!

40
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,010
No, it's very likely.

41
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:36,540
Since you dug the deepest into his right-hand man's dirty deeds.

42
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,400
Not a day goes by quietly in my life as a prosecutor.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,460
I don't think Kim Seok Hun has any intention of arresting Jang Il Hyeon.

44
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,160
I bet he just wants to warn him.

45
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,320
But what can you do?

46
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,770
I've already received orders to arrest Jang Il Hyeon. Therefore,

47
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,450
I need to arrest him.

48
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,300
What's this?

49
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,150
Please take a look first, then we'll talk.

50
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,590
 Apartment Purchase Agreement

51
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,360
You bought an apartment as a wedding gift for your eldest son.

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,040
- How did you get...
 - Isn't it amazing?

53
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,170
No money left your bank account,

54
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,800
but an apartment in Gangnam fell from the sky.

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,850
I borrowed the money from a colleague.

56
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,070
- Do you think you can defeat a prosecutor of Korea by lying?
 - What?

57
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,950
Please finish reading the rest of the pages.

58
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,550
How is it? Now that you've read it, you have your answer, right?

59
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,710
The subcontracting company of Hosan Chemicals paid both the down payment as well as the balance.

60
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,080
Aren't you curious now?

61
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,370
Why I came here in person instead of summoning you to the prosecutors' office?

62
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,030
Why do you think that is?

63
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,020
What do you want?

64
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,110
You know Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon.

65
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,080
I need the deposit records of the bank account backed by Hosan.

66
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,410
Look, I heard that Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon is

67
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,370
backed by the chief of the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

68
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:27,730
Right. I came here under the chief's orders,

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,550
so make sure you pick your side wisely.

70
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,120
I got it. Let's start.

71
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,100
 Again My Life

72
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,490
Who are you guys?

73
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,170
I'm Prosecutor Ji Seong Ho of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

74
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,620
I'm executing a search warrant for your residence.

75
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,550
Get out right now!

76
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,300
Do you know who I am?

77
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,620
I know very well.

78
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,470
Seong Jin Mi, the chairwoman of the National Foundation for the Arts University.

79
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,680
We ask for your cooperation.

80
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,940
Come on. Let's get it done quickly!

81
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,310
Don't leave anything related to the foundation behind!

82
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,500
Il Hyeon, what's going on?

83
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,820
What?!

84
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,250
Okay. Just hold on. I'll take care of it.

85
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,880
I got it, I said. I told you I'll stop it!

86
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,210
So just wait.

87
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,670
Search and seizure of the National Foundation wasn't enough that

88
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,130
you're now cleaning out Seong Jin Mi's house?

89
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,570
Bravo.

90
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,420
I'll arrange a dinner meeting with the chief prosecutor this week.

91
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,200
So make a promise.

92
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,170
Promise?

93
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,810
The National Foundation for the Arts University and I

94
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,470
have nothing to do with each other. Also,

95
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,210
if you're looking to take sides, you'll have to draw a clear line.

96
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,300
I know nothing about the National Foundation.

97
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,370
You'll find out soon enough, but Seong Jin Mi?

98
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,690
She's been involved in illegal activities even before we knew each other, andâ€”

99
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,280
Chief Jang. You're paying for that dinner, right?

100
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,770
Of course.

101
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,540
I loved you, Seong Jin Mi.

102
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,410
- Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon?
 -  I am, so what of it?

103
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,120
We're arresting you on charges of accepting bribes.

104
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,530
What?!

105
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,280
You have the right to remain silent.

106
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,040
You have the right to an attorney.

107
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,460
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

108
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,880
Hey, are you guys crazy?! Don't you know who I am?!

109
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,300
If you refuse to comply with the arrest, you will also be charged with obstruction of justice.

110
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,760
Don't be ridiculous! Which bastard is...

111
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,840
 Arrest Warrant
 Kim Hui Wu

112
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,460
K-Kim Hui Wu?

113
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,680
Hey, let go! This is invalid!

114
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,550
How dare you pull a stunt like this?! Do you know who I am?!

115
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,230
I'm Jang Il Hyeon!

116
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,980
 Copying Files

117
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,630
I should have come by sooner to see you, Sunbae.

118
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,190
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu has been telling me a lot about you.

119
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,450
That you took good care of him in school.

120
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,960
Is that what he told you?

121
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,800
Well, I did help so he could have a comfortable school life.

122
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,920
What's up? That you came to see me out of the blue?

123
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,520
The thing is,

124
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,280
you know that I'm close to Seonbae Jang, right?

125
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,660
I saw him earlier in the hallway, and I was wondering what was going on.

126
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,780
I heard that you have a lot of sources,

127
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,640
but yet, you're asking me?

128
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,800
It's hard to know what's right under your nose.

129
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,140
Kim Hui Wu, you bastard! What do you think you're doing?!

130
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,080
We're being recorded, Seonbaenim. Please calm down.

131
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,940
Please sit.

132
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,740
I didn't have a choice either.

133
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,560
Tell me clearly what's going on!

134
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,070
I was ordered by the higher-ups to investigate you.

135
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,640
I just don't understand!

136
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,460
Why did the chief prosecutor ditch me?!

137
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,390
Is it because I covered for the National Foundation for the Arts University case?

138
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,260
Did Jeon Seok Gyu rat me out?!

139
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,860
Tell me right now!

140
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,830
This is my guess, but public opinion about the prosecution has become very negative.

141
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,920
The prosecution's credibility has reached new lows due to the female college student murder case,

142
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,520
and in the meantime, Mirae Electronics' incident became magnified.

143
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,000
On top of that,

144
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,320
your coverup of the corruption at the National Foundation for the Arts University.

145
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,270
I believe the Chief Prosecutor has been offended continuously.

146
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,930
What?

147
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,570
So that's why he's ditching me?

148
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,850
Do you intend to use me as a scapegoat to regain public trust?

149
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,920
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,960
I need to leave because I have something to take care of.

151
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,020
What?  Hey!

152
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,000
It's all done.

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,660
When are you going to set it off?

154
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,310
How about tomorrow?

155
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,620
Before the press starts to dig into Seonbae Jang.

156
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,550
Yes. When something new appears, the public promptly forgets old memories.

157
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,990
The sooner the better.

158
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,750
It turns out that the main character of the Gimsan case was a corrupt prosecutor.

159
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,770
I came up with a witness, too.

160
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,770
Of course, I will need your help.

161
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,290
Don't be concerned about that.  Make your move before Kim Hui Wu.

162
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,810
Yes, sir.

163
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,800
- I'm sorry.
 - That's okay.  Answer it.

164
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,790
Yes.

165
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,450
What? There is a briefing?

166
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,900
 Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun

167
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,770
Will you be okay?

168
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,650
Yes. It doesn't matter.

169
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,270
Crazy son of a bitch.

170
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,780
I have something to tell you.

171
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,130
Tell me later.  I'm busy right now.

172
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,430
Someone left a present in my office.

173
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,880
I found out he's one of your investigators.

174
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,470
Did someone ask for my head?

175
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,120
What are you talking about?

176
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,960
Do you really not know?

177
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,810
Let's get some coffee.

178
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,670
 Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

179
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,850
I am Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

180
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,070
I'll start the briefing now.

181
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,910
In accordance with our public mission, while the office was investigating allegations of

182
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,760
corruption between the prosecution and industrial conglomerate,

183
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,590
we uncovered circumstantial evidence that Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon accepted bribes.

184
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,520
He has received large amounts of cash every month

185
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,190
from the Finance Director of H Chemicals.

186
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,780
At the same time, at the request of the chairman of the National Foundation for the Arts University,

187
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,170
he interfered with our investigation into corruption involving university admissions.

188
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,160
Now the prosecution has lost the citizens' trust.

189
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,460
As a member of the Prosecutor's Office

190
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,660
I apologize to everyone for this distrust.

191
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,990
 Prosecution Service

192
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,910
Aimed at rooting out corruption inside the Prosecution Service,

193
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,180
this investigation under the special direction of Seoul Central District Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun,

194
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:22,040
is a specific measure to restore public trust in the office.

195
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,580
We will proceed in the future to do our best to investigate thoroughly.

196
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,190
- That is all.
 - Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon...

197
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,220
 13 missed calls

198
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,490
I am sorry.  It's due to my negligence.

199
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,460
Negligence? Are you challenging me right now?

200
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,050
Since when did the Central District Prosecutors' Office represent the entire prosecution?

201
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,030
Are you the Attorney General or what?!

202
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,710
With whose permission are you apologizing on behalf of the prosecution?!

203
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,210
Sir, the thing isâ€”

204
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,700
Also, what's the matter with that Jang Il Hyeon bastard?

205
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,020
 Bribes?

206
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,740
 Don't you know how to keep your subordinates under control?

207
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,150
 You have a call from the Minister of Justice.

208
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,740
 Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun

209
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,890
Tell him I'm out and don't put any calls through.

210
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,570
Kim Hui Wu, you crazy bastard.

211
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,900
 I'll give you full authority.

212
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,290
 Finish it off as quickly as possible.

213
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,080
 Yes, sir.

214
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,060
 Editor-in-Chief Wu Jang Su

215
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,770
Oh, Chief Wu. I have no time to explain.

216
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,930
Put the article about the prosecution on hold right now.

217
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,130
What are you talking about?

218
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,120
There was a misunderstanding. I meant to clarify it, butâ€”

219
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
Why would you clarify it?

220
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,740
Go check online right now.

221
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,760
People are saying that you're the next attorney general.

222
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,110
What?

223
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,920
  You've been slow lately, but you sure know how to strike.

224
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,350
 It looks like you're the best candidate to become the next attorney general.

225
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,960
 Congratulations.

226
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,900
 Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun

227
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,940
 Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop

228
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,920
Yes, sir.

229
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,410
I saw the press conference. Was it intended?

230
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,850
That is... I apologize, sir.

231
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,830
- What do you mean? Good job.
 - Sir?

232
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,390
  I like your initiative. Don't worry about anything and push for it.

233
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,260
The road to you becoming Attorney General is now wide open.

234
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,550
Yes. Thank you, sir.

235
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,010
The road to becoming Attorney General?

236
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,970
 Prosecution

237
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,860
Come in.

238
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,360
I only thought about restoring the prosecution's honor.

239
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,550
I had no choice in order to calm public opinion.

240
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,750
I apologize for putting you in a tough spot.

241
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,670
I will take responsibility for everything, andâ€”
 No need. Good job.

242
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:45,110
I expected this outcome when I gave you full authority.

243
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,460
The press briefing was good today.

244
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,150
Oh, can you handle the trial for the Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon case well, too?

245
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,770
- Yes, sir.
- Since we've started, we need a good outcome as well.

246
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,750
If not, weâ€™ll be criticized again for caring for our own, understand?

247
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,240
I do.

248
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,010
- You can leave.
 - Yes, sir.

249
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,170
One day.

250
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,420
It took one day.

251
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,320
The time it took to get rid of Jang Il Heon.

252
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,970
How should I interpret this?

253
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,230
I was amused by what was done to my computer.

254
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,600
Bank transaction records that I have no knowledge of were planted.

255
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,450
When I looked into it, I saw that President Jeon Il Bo of Mirae Electronics was tied to it.

256
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,710
- Your average investigator couldn't have set up something this big.
 - Geez.

257
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,280
I'll look into it right away.

258
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,200
There's no need, Prosecutor Choi.

259
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,560
I don't want to make a big deal out of this. What's your opinion?

260
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,110
But still, we can't let this slide!

261
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,750
Even for the sake of resolving any misunderstandings.

262
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,220
Then should I make an issue out it?

263
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,450
Iâ€™ll let this particular incident go quietly,

264
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,150
so if you find out who was behind it, let him know

265
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,090
That if he wants to fight me, he should be prepared to end up in hell together.

266
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:43,020
 Chief Prosecutorâ€™s Office
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun

267
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,740
 Iâ€™m sorry!

268
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,960
Kim Hui Wu beat me to it, so I lost my chance to get Jeon Seok Gyu.

269
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,480
Did he figure it out or not?

270
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,250
So he did. How did he react?

271
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:06,010
I donâ€™t know why, but he said he didnâ€™t want to make a big issue out of it and would let it slide.

272
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,690
- He said that?
- He didn't ask any questions.

273
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,150
There's no way he doesn't know.

274
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:15,190
If he knows that you did it, he must know that I was behind it.

275
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,080
His time in the boondocks must've taught him when not to speak up.

276
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,880
Fine. Bury the Jeon Seok Gyu case.

277
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,600
Can I really do that?

278
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,760
That's what he wants. That should serve as a sufficient warning.

279
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,660
Then what will happen to Seonbae Il Hyeon now?

280
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,000
What do you think? The law will decide how he should be punished.

281
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,230
Take Jang Il Hyeon's vacant seat starting tomorrow.

282
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,740
Oh, okay.

283
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,570
- What?
 - The official order will be issued soon. Go ahead and get back to work.

284
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,290
Yes, sir.

285
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,910
 Look in on Jang Il Hyeon on your way out.

286
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,420
 We've spent a lot of time together, so you should at least comfort him.

287
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:25,470
 And let him know that I won't forget him if he stays quiet.

288
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,880
Me in Seonbae Jang's position?

289
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:58,200
I raised a snake, didn't I?

290
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,780
Where is Kang Jin, that little punk?

291
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,410
I'm no longer useful now?

292
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,650
I've relayed the information.

293
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,880
No... Make him a suspect too.

294
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,090
Could I alone fill your stomach, you snake bastard?

295
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,740
If you're looking to succeed by backstabbing your seonbaes, I won't be enough.

296
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,540
What's my title in the media right now?

297
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,530
It's okay. Tell me.

298
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,080
Bribed prosecutor.

299
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,940
Tell them to change the title.

300
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,760
"Choi Kang Jin, Prosecutes for Sexual Favors."

301
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,760
Take him down.

302
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,980
That bastard Kang Jin, too.

303
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,000
You can leave.

304
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,400
Okay.

305
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,230
Seonbae, how can you do this?

306
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,740
All I've been doing out there is thinking of ways to save you! You want us to go down together?

307
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,730
I'm sorry. But I know you as well as you know me.

308
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,690
You've been thinking of ways to save me out there? Stop bullshitting.

309
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,670
You wouldn't have done anything if I hadn't taken it this far.

310
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,850
I have evidence of all of the corruption you've committed thus far.

311
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:46,490
If you don't want that all to blow up in your face, get moving. Don't worry about saving me.

312
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,840
Just bring Kim Hui Wu here.

313
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,390
To jail. In the same room as me.

314
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,760
I threw the bait to Kim Hui Wu, so he will come after you hard.

315
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,680
Find something small and blow it up.

316
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,690
Arrest and lock him up the moment he conducts an illegal investigation without a warrant.

317
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,020
From that point you can do your specialty of fabricating crimes.

318
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,570
Okay. Don't worry.

319
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,700
I will get you out on probation,

320
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,440
and Iâ€™ll come up with a plan to put that bastard Kim Hui Wu away for at least two years.

321
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,730
He will learn the price he has to pay for betraying his seonbae for his own success.

322
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,720
I'll make sure to show him.

323
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,980
Do your best to make sure you don't lose your law license.

324
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,600
I understand.

325
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,880
Kim Hui Wu. Don't ever underestimate him.

326
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,520
It you're not careful, you'll end up in my situation. Do you understand?

327
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,790
Yes. Don't worry.

328
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,400
I'll get going.

329
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,080
 Investigation Room

330
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,220
What are you doing?

331
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,040
I was just passing by and wanted to order some food for Chief Prosecutor Jang.

332
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,120
What should I order? Triangle kimbap?

333
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,500
Do whatever you want.

334
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,680
When will you honor your promise?

335
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,890
Why? I thought you were going to send me to prison.

336
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,310
Oh... That? It got boring.

337
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,860
I was going to put you away with Jang Il Hyeon as a pair, but we're missing the hamburger.

338
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,440
It's not right to just send the french fries.

339
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,760
Crazy assholeâ€¦

340
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,710
An easy game is no fun.

341
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,140
 Gangwon District Prosecutors' Office, Gimsan Branch

342
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,740
  Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

343
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,320
 Prosecutor Service

344
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,870
Hello, Prosecutor Kim.

345
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,570
Hi Investigator Oh. It's me. Have you been well?

346
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,860
Yes. I've been so well that I'm feeling antsy.

347
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,720
Should I make it fun for you?

348
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,450
 I'm already looking forward to it.

349
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,270
Where is it this time?

350
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,030
Cheers.

351
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,050
You worked hard. Because of you, my lifespan got extended.

352
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,210
It's all thanks to you working with me.

353
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,350
About that, are you just going to leave Choi Kang Jin alone?

354
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:45,000
Heâ€™s Jang Il Hyeon's close associate, so I investigated him. A lot of suspicious things came up.

355
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,410
There is a saying that there are some things that are forbidden.

356
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,360
Like the fact that you cannot catch young fish that are below standard.

357
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,370
Exactly. Choi Kang Jin is still immature.

358
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,940
There's no reason to waste the bait.

359
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,000
I want you to catch the bigger one first.

360
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,480
SHC Entertainment, the company that Choi Kang Jin's father, Choi Su Hyeok, runs.

361
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,250
Hyeongnim.

362
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,170
You're here.

363
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,650
Prosecutor Gu is here, right?

364
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,210
Yes. But...

365
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,980
Why?

366
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,760
Go in and see.

367
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,450
- Let's get startedâ€”
   - Hey! Kim Hui Wu.

368
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,980
Who said you could meet with my direct subordinate without my knowledge?

369
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,970
How are you here?

370
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,370
What happened?

371
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,850
I got caught on my way out.

372
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:45,240
What is it? What were you going to talk about without me?

373
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,560
Are you disregarding me?

374
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,580
It's not that. It's too dangerous.

375
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,380
I didn't want to drag you into it, too. Please understand.

376
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,940
What are you saying? You made me catch a serial killer.

377
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,360
It might be dangerous?

378
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,540
You must have misunderstood something.

379
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,490
I have more experience as a prosecutor than you both.

380
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,680
I've been doing it for three years longer.

381
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,310
I'm your seonbae. Do you understand?

382
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,350
It's so ridiculous that I'm speechless.

383
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,030
I'm sorry. Sorry.

384
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,600
Sorry?

385
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,300
No. I apologize, Seonbaenim.

386
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,010
Fine.

387
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,050
Tell me what's going on.

388
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,640
Please don't be angry. Come sit.

389
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,810
You'll know by looking at the documents, but it's SHC Entertainment.

390
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:56,260
Choi Kang Jin's father is an important figure in entertainment, but he's done a lot of bad things.

391
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:02,440
All the while, Choi Kang Jin has been covering for his father on controversial cases.

392
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,090
This crazy...

393
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,090
He lobbied politicians by using aspiring actors in his company?

394
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:12,210
We only have charges. We still need to find evidence.

395
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,570
I understand why you called over Prosecutor Gu.

396
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,610
The Central District Prosecutor's Office is worked up as it is because of Jang Il Hyeon's case.

397
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:24,610
If we lock up Choi Kang Jin, too, it would look like the prosecution is being attacked internally.

398
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,850
But... What if we delayed this a little bit?

399
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:33,120
From lawmakers, to journalists, lawyers and chaebols.

400
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,440
It's unlikely we would be able to take this to court with our power alone.

401
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,190
No. We can catch them.

402
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,770
We can build it up with what we know for certain.

403
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,010
You should go meet Jo Yun Ah, the actress.

404
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,620
- Jo Yun Ah?
 - Yes.

405
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,260
She knows a lot about SHC Entertainment.

406
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:59,010
If Jo Yun Ah, the symbol of youth and innocence opens her mouth...

407
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:04,250
It would cause a commotion. Even a member of the National Assembly wouldn't be able to stop it.

408
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:08,160
But, will she cooperate?

409
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,520
Her image is everything.

410
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,070
 Profile of Actress Jo Yun Ah

411
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:24,110
Propofol? Drugs? Jo Yun Ah is doing drugs?

412
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,180
Let's suggest a plea bargain.

413
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,360
You want to make a deal?

414
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,970
Well.  Let's think of it as a special case.

415
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,800
 Plea Bargain: An agreement that the sentence will be reduced if the defendant pleads guilty.

416
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,710
Okay. Let's try it.

417
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:59,530
 Jang Il Hyeon

418
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:02,960
 Jang Il Hyeon

419
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,990
This is my seat now, Seonbae.

420
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,050
If things go well, wouldn't I be the youngest person to become Chief Prosecutor?

421
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,130
 Donâ€™t ever take Kim Hui Wu for a fool.

422
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,670
 The moment you let your guard down, you will end up like me.

423
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,420
 Do you understand?

424
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,860
I'm not stupid like you.

425
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,460
What's this?

426
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:54,790
This is not the time to be casually working out.

427
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,170
Elder, I am here.

428
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,100
Why did you come again?

429
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,930
No place is as comfortable as here.

430
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,040
A comfortable place?  Aren't you here to hide?

431
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,620
What?

432
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,020
You brought along that guy behind the telephone pole.

433
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,670
You caught on.

434
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,500
Since you came here wanting to hide, I will hide you.

435
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,930
Fill my glass already. Should I call that guy over to pour instead?

436
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,910
No, sir.

437
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,640
Here.

438
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,910
I'm back.

439
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,840
Oh, you are!

440
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,040
You need to eat, right?

441
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,950
Yes.

442
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,440
Aren't you tired of always eating the same thing?

443
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,080
 Come on!

444
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,300
How can the son of a braised chicken restaurant shop ever say that!

445
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,750
I don't ever get tired of it. I want to eat it and eat it again.

446
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,090
I keep dreaming about eating it.

447
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,540
Sang Man, you're my son.

448
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,390
I guess I'm handsome because I resemble you.

449
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:50,970
Hui Wu's the one who looks like me. You just grow up healthy for me.

450
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,210
Hyeong, taste this.

451
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,230
I don't want to.

452
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,360
Eat it. Eat it. Eat it.

453
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,550
Taste it, Hyeong.

454
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,340
Here.

455
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,580
It's more delicious today!

456
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,580
Yeon Seok, is your studying going well?

457
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,600
No, it's hard.

458
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,540
 Assemblyman Hwang, will you accept responsibility for what you are saying?

459
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,560
 Yes, I accept responsibility.

460
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,970
Is that the assemblyman who does volunteer work at the hospital where Mom is hospitalized?

461
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,280
 Are you determined to divide the country?

462
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,940
 Is questioning corruption divisive?

463
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,030
Hey, he's like a neighborhood ajussi normally, but he is a fighter when he's at the National Assembly.

464
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,050
He's just a hypocrite pretending to be good.

465
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,630
Without cameras around, he probably wouldn't do volunteer work.

466
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,470
There's no camera there.

467
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,610
I don't know what all that's about. Always bickering.

468
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:52,550
The more you fight, the more you age. If you fight a lot, you die young.

469
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,030
 Overheated war of words between majority and opposition parties at the confirmation hearing for Minister of Justice

470
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,080
Nice to meet you.  I am Kim Gyu Ri from the Eastern District Prosecution Office.

471
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,760
I'm prosecutor Gu Seung Hyeok.

472
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,890
Hello. I am Jo Yun Ah.

473
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,140
Please have a seat.

474
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,810
Thank you for agreeing to the investigation.

475
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:21,650
Not at all.  You are offering to help, so how could I refuse?

476
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,010
We want to help you as much as we can.

477
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,340
Where should I start?

478
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:39,410
  I met Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin  for the first time at a place called the Future Talent Forum.

479
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,920
 - He approached  me quite enthusiastically.
  - Nice to meet you.

480
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,430
I thought he sincerely like me, and I liked him, too.

481
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,040
During that time, I was having a rough time with my agency,

482
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,990
and Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin offered to help me sign with SHC Entertainment,

483
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,580
the agency run by his father President Choi Su Hyeok.

484
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,260
So, did you?

485
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,410
Yes.

486
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:05,080
President Choi said he would even get me an opportunity to go to Hollywood

487
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,890
and give me the largest signing bonus.

488
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:10,250
Also,

489
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:16,600
he introduced me to a famous plastic surgery clinic in Gangnam where all expenses would be covered by the agency.

490
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,460
That caused a problem.

491
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,830
A problem?

492
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:27,300
I was persuaded by the plastic surgeon, and I had several procedures done.

493
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,440
Before I knew it, I was addicted.

494
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,900
Geez.

495
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,050
President Choi found out about it and used it by

496
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:40,350
offering for me to secretly meet a wealthy married man.

497
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,340
At first, I refused,

498
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,920
but I couldn't bear the threat of exposure of my use of the drug propofol.

499
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,250
So did you tell Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin?

500
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,910
It's been a long time since we've been in contact.

501
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:00,490
I'm so upset that I ever loved such a person for even a moment.

502
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,570
You should sue him.

503
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,560
- Sue him?
 - Yes, of course.  That kind of punk you need to...

504
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,090
Yes.  We will help you with the rest.

505
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,290
Thank you.

506
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,790
 Cheonha Hospital

507
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:24,180
That soon? You said he would be okay for a few years.

508
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,600
About that...

509
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,170
I apologize, Agassi.  (Agassi: young lady, often used for unmarried daughter of a wealthy family.)

510
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,950
Please keep it confidential, for the time being, Director.

511
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,650
Even from my family.

512
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,960
Yes, I will.

513
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,120
Should I take you to the Economic Research Institute?

514
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,280
No.  Where is Dad right now?

515
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,210
He's meeting with Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

516
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,530
What?

517
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:57,050
Cheonha Distributors is planning a premium outlet, right?

518
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,710
Yes.

519
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,820
I've chosen this location for the outlet.

520
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,660
You won't have to worry about any land problems or related laws.

521
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,710
I've taken care of everything, so just take your time looking around.

522
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,430
I appreciate what you are saying,

523
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,600
but I'm sorry.

524
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,300
My eldest is usually in charge of outlets.

525
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,340
I want to see him handle it on his own without help from anyone.

526
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,270
I see.

527
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,910
I'm sorry.

528
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,000
It's nothing.

529
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,350
Kim Gun Yeong ...

530
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,150
Judging from your expression, you must have met with Director Yun.

531
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,000
I heard that he told you to rest no matter what.

532
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,600
I don't have much time left.

533
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,650
Dad!

534
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:44,030
If you're that worried about me, do as I wish.

535
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:48,740
I need to sort it out while I'm alive.

536
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,310
Do you really not want it?

537
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:57,380
Hui Ah, no matter what anyone says, the one who will lead Cheonha isâ€”

538
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,770
I told you before.

539
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,380
I don't want to fight with my brothers.

540
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,760
Money is thicker than blood.  That's the way the world is.

541
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,450
When I die, there will be a fight.  Until someone dies.

542
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,610
Hui Ah, while you might want to protect our family,

543
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:22,540
I am responsible for the thousands of employees at our company.

544
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,670
 Father, please re-consider.

545
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:32,140
 We must mercilessly get rid of those who are against management by restructuring.

546
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,530
 Look at the cost savings.

547
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:40,260
 Don't look at people as numbers. Unless the restructuring is something you can't help but do.

548
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,840
 Oppa, can you re-consider just once more?

549
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,310
 If it leads to a decrease in productivity, the problem will only grow worse.

550
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,650
 Kim Hui Ah!

551
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,810
 I'm neutral.

552
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,490
 Father, if we can just get rid of lazy workers who only cost us money,

553
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,740
 we can save approximately 500 billion won in the electronics sector.

554
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,830
 What? Lazy workers who only cost us money?!

555
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,340
 How dare you say that about my staff?!

556
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:15,090
Someone who can only see the small profits in front of him doesn't deserve to be in charge of Cheonha.

557
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:21,820
Hui Ah, please re-consider.

558
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,070
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop has asked to meet with your older brother.

559
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,160
What?

560
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,650
Should I tell the chairman?

561
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,120
No, don't do that.  I'm sure he already knows.

562
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,830
Then Seung Jun will be summoned soon, too.

563
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,880
Jo Tae Seop...

564
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,190
I'm sure he's trying to make us fight with us in his grasp.

565
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,270
He's going to blatantly intervene in my family's affairs?

566
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,380
Not Kim Hui Ah. She's shrewd.

567
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,420
She won't follow my will.

568
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,250
But Chairman Kim seems to have chosen Kim Hui Ah.

569
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:20,290
It's said that Chairman Kim recently transferred Cheonha Produce bearer bonds to Kim Hui Ah.

570
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,830
He must mean to slowly start supporting his child of choice.

571
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:28,910
The world has changed. It doesn't make sense to hand everything down to one child.

572
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,590
Who do you want to become the chairman of Cheonha?

573
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,260
Didn't you decide on Kim Yong Jun?

574
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,390
Nothing is for sure in this world.

575
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,200
Whoever fits the role takes the seat.

576
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,370
Don't you think so, Director Han?

577
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:47,820
I believe that the successor could change depending on the choices of the politicians when you include tax issues in the equation.

578
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,960
I see.

579
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,150
What happened to Kim Yong Jun?

580
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,640
I let him know that you'd like to meet him.

581
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,540
However, he refused, saying that he'd follow Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's resolution to keep his distance from politics.

582
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,220
As expected.

583
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:06,260
They're puppies that aren't used to the leash. They'll pull against it again and again.

584
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,880
However, the results for leashed dogs are always the same.

585
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,900
They move as their owner wishes.

586
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,000
They'll soon roll over and show their belly in front of me.

587
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,330
Tell him I'd like to see him again in a little while.

588
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,350
Understood.

589
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,520
What's he thinking?

590
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,960
He's not the kind of guy to just sit back.

591
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,090
Enjoy your meal.

592
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,790
Only a few more days until the Jang Il Hyeon trial, right?

593
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:53,790
Yes.

594
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:58,920
Seems like Jang Il Hyeon's sentence is almost certain.

595
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,370
How does it feel to hit another home run after the Gimsan case?

596
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:05,350
It was nothing much. I just did what I'm supposed to.

597
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,510
Who's next?

598
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:11,820
You sent Jang Il Hyeon away, so Choi Kang Jin?

599
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,570
Or Choi Kang Jin's father Choi Su Hyeok?

600
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:22,520
Knowing you, I think you'd go after the father first.

601
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,770
Present.

602
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,130
 SHC Entertainment Male Celebrity Military Corruption History

603
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,250
Military corruption...

604
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,940
How did you...?

605
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,300
Jang Il Hyeon acted like such a jerk when he took my case in the past,

606
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,220
so I did a background check.

607
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:56,910
I looked into Kang Jin at the same time, and he's no saint either.

608
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,320
Choi Kang Jin's father, Choi Su Hyeok.

609
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:05,270
The male actors from that entertainment production company got a diagnosis from the hospital written there,

610
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:09,540
and the doctor in charge is getting a pretty penny from Kang Jin's father.

611
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,530
I'm sure you were busy dealing with the Mirae Electronics case. Thank you.

612
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,940
By now, shouldn't you treat me to some neungi baeksuk  (steamed/boiled unseasoned meat or fish)  or something?

613
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:23,060
- Excuse meâ€“
 - Nope. Let's just keep going with the braised chicken.

614
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,370
I have something to give you too.

615
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,080
What is this?

616
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,840
I can't tell you where it's from,

617
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:39,000
but this is the transaction history of the paper company created by President Jeon Il Bo.

618
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,580
No matter how much we keep digging, his crimes keep coming out like a sweet potato vine.

619
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,660
I guess I can't have the neungi baeksuk.

620
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,340
Braised chicken, sure.

621
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,280
Sir, two more servings of the braised chicken, please.

622
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,610
Of course. The best order is an additional order.

623
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:57,100
Have a glass.

624
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,290
Thank you, Hui Wu.

625
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,120
I'm more thankful.

626
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,890
Hey, I can go on my own.

627
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:20,200
You came all the way to my neighborhood, so I need to see you off.

628
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,770
Do you like me that much?

629
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:24,230
It's just manners. Manners.

630
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:33,440
- Wait.
 - What is it?

631
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,480
There was a string wrapped around the man's hand.

632
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:15,570
 Your father did something wrong, so you should be punished in his place!

633
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:24,220
You bastard!

634
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,610
Stop there!

635
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,400
Hey!

636
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,870
Are you okay?

637
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,540
Excuse me!?

638
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,660
I didn't run. I was waiting for you.

639
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,050
I'll give you a chance. You can keep walking or die.

640
00:47:55,050 --> 00:48:01,220
I'll give you a chance, too. Get arrested nicely, or get arrested after being beaten up.

641
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,060
You must've lost your sense of fear, huh?

642
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,540
Don't move, or your bones will break.

643
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,340
 Operating Room

644
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,850
Hye Jin... Hye Jin...

645
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:38,060
These are the men.

646
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,460
- Thank you.
  Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong. Han Mi?

647
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,900
I don't know how to repay you.

648
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,910
Thank you.

649
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:55,940
Fortunately, she looks like she'll be okay.

650
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,220
Why did that man... terrorize my daughter?

651
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:06,160
We're still looking into it, but he said he didn't like your political actions.

652
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,630
He attacked my daughter because of that? .

653
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:13,430
He should've ... he should've attacked me instead.

654
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,030
Ajussi?

655
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:25,000
Yeah. Well, I guess I can call him a drinking buddy.

656
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,970
How did you become friends with him?

657
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:29,770
I tutored Hye Jin when I was in college.

658
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,890
- Hye Jin?
  - His daughter.

659
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:37,940
What? Is it funny to hear that I used to tutor?

660
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,460
Yes.

661
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,000
Anyway, I'm worried.

662
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,080
I hope nothing happens to Hye Jin.

663
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,660
After his wife passed away, Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong lived only caring about Hye Jin.

664
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,290
 Is this heaven's plan?

665
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,190
 Getting connected with Assemblyman Hwang like this...

666
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:56,990
Can you set up a meeting for us?

667
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:00,540
- What? With him?
 - Yes.

668
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,660
I think I might be able to be of help to him.

669
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,370
I'll try.

670
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:12,310
- It's getting late. I'm going to go.
 - Okay.

671
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,820
- Get home safe.
 - Okay.

672
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,920
 Assemblyman Hwang's daughter died in my past life.

673
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,540
 A passionate supporter of Jo Tae Seop made it happen.

674
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,580
 I hope she won't lose her life again in this life.

675
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,430
Please sit.

676
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:38,900
Wait a minute,

677
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,820
I didn't know the two of you were friends.

678
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,910
Here, have a drink.

679
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:46,480
Let me introduce myself properly.

680
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,720
I'm prosecutor Kim Hui Wu from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

681
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,320
Prosecutors... I'm not really...

682
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:01,350
I know very well that you don't trust prosecutors.

683
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,330
I'd like to ask you for just three minutes.

684
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:07,560
I'll give you three minutes.

685
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,710
Stop what you're preparing.

686
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:14,430
What do you suppose I'm preparing?

687
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:18,160
A knife aimed at Jo Tae Seop.

688
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,420
Even if you swing it around, that knife will only slice the air.

689
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,060
No, you won't even get to swing it.

690
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,850
- See you later, Reporter Kim.
 - Three minutes hasn't passed yet.

691
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,180
You're a prosecutor?

692
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:37,490
- Hui Wu...
 - There's a traitor in your midst.

693
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:39,490
You need to find that person.

694
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:48,290
Young prosecutor, thank you for saving my daughter, but that's it.

695
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:52,390
If you're a prosecutor, you should act like one instead of snooping around the political arena.

696
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:56,310
Also, a traitor?

697
00:51:56,310 --> 00:52:01,430
It's wrong to speak ill of my people by driving in a wedge, like that.

698
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:03,550
It's been three minutes.

699
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,070
Ajussi!

700
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,720
Why did you do that?

701
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:22,800
I told you he hates prosecutors.

702
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,930
- Treading carefully was the least you could'veâ€“
 - I told you already.

703
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:30,410
- That I might be of some help to Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong.
 - What?

704
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:33,790
In order to do that, he needs to trust me.

705
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,890
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

706
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:40,660
He is a good man, give him moral support.

707
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,240
 Daehan Party Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong's Office

708
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,980
 What?

709
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,670
Chairman Kim Jeong Taek seems to have made a deal with Jo Tae Seop?

710
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,370
Yes, sir.

711
00:52:56,370 --> 00:53:00,480
I think Jo Tae Seop has caught onto what we were planning to strike him with.

712
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,880
Jo Tae Seop raised the issue of bribery to Chairman Kim Jeong Taek, andâ€”

713
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,550
Kim Jeong Taek made a deal with our information.

714
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:11,930
To prevent his own bribery charges.

715
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,590
Yes, sir.

716
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:19,800
Wait...

717
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,670
But how did Kim Jeong Taek find out?

718
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,540
What we were planning?

719
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,750
The information might have leaked.

720
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,320
President Kim... I heard.

721
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,570
But that was evidence to strike Jo Tae Seop's faction.

722
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:48,120
You turned that over to save your own face?

723
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:52,240
President Kim.

724
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,460
President Kim.

725
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,280
Call a meeting right now.

726
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,660
 Daehan Party

727
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:14,080
 Call cannot be connected, leave your message

728
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,540
No one is answering.

729
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:27,090
 Daehan Party for a Better Country

730
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,100
It's been a while.

731
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:52,740
I'm happy to see you, but I guess you don't feel the same.

732
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:58,160
Why... would I be?

733
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,130
Seonbaenim, maybe you remember,

734
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:08,960
when we worked together at the prosecutors', we did a lot of work for this country.

735
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,360
Catching killers, gangsters, day and night.

736
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,100
Even back then, you pursued an ideal.

737
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,810
Let's follow the law, stick to the regulations.

738
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:23,030
But what happened in the end?

739
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:26,360
You lost. You only failed!

740
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,270
 Why would I request an arrest warrant?

741
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,680
 Then theyâ€™ll find out!

742
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,150
 The law is the same for everyone. Let's stick to the regulations!

743
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,570
 Hyeongnim, the defendant is the presidentâ€™s son!

744
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,550
 - Even at this moment, that bastardâ€”
 - Hey, Jo Tae Seop!

745
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:39,320
 Seonbae!

746
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,060
 They're asking us to stop.

747
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,630
 They want us to stop the investigation.

748
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:49,110
 Damn it! Seonbae!

749
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:52,900
An idealist like you wouldn't understand.

750
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:57,680
You can't see reality because you're hung up on ideals.

751
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:03,400
"I will give money to the poor and create jobs."

752
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:08,700
So... what did you do exactly?

753
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,700
It's always all talk, just like the prosecution days.

754
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,490
Again, you'll regret this, too.

755
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:19,570
"I should have worked harder."

756
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,760
I'm different from you.

757
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,600
I don't think about anything else but how to make this country strong.

758
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,050
I don't do politics that are all talk.

759
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:32,680
If you ignore the process, there will be sacrifices made accordingly.

760
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:37,570
Do you have any feelings of regret or guilt about those sacrifices?

761
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:39,220
No.

762
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,200
Someone has to sacrifice.

763
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,980
I don't care about the dirt on my clothes.

764
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,980
I don't care if I get covered in filth.

765
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:51,520
If our citizens can live well, if this country can become powerful!

766
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,870
So why...

767
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,780
do you only look at the specks of dust and point fingers?

768
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:03,250
Don't you know that you have to get your hands dirty while achieving great things?

769
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:08,060
If someone who has to achieve great things only stares at the specks of dust,

770
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,110
no one will stand by you.

771
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,570
Just like now.

772
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,490
I promised to nominate him for the next general election.

773
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:31,380
In return, he handed over all the material to me.

774
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:35,770
You did? Why?

775
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:39,520
I worked under you for eight years for the sake of the people.

776
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,850
But you didnâ€™t even once mention the nomination to me.

777
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:48,860
I'm sorry, sir.

778
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,820
I want to do politics.

779
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:54,070
You...

780
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,650
need to learn more.

781
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:59,670
Seonbaenim.

782
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:09,220
You don't even understand how those around you feel, so how you could understand the hearts of the people?

783
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:14,800
I suggest you stop having limited vision and look at the big picture instead.

784
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,490
With us.

785
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,580
Together!

786
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,770
That

787
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,690
will never happen.

788
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:42,690
Then... this is as far as I can go with

789
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:46,310
being considerate of you.

790
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:02,140
 There is a traitor in your midst.

791
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,670
 You need to find that person.

792
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:07,680
That was my aide?

793
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,670
Thank you.

794
00:59:54,440 --> 01:00:00,150
How did you know there was a traitor?

795
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:04,310
I hear a lot things working at the prosecution.

796
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,680
Do you know why I dislike prosecutors?

797
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:11,450
The current chief prosecutor is Jo Tae Seopâ€™s dog.

798
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:15,240
Everything that happens in the prosecution goes to Jo Tae Seopâ€™s ears,

799
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,470
thatâ€™s what makes him stronger.

800
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:24,770
That's probably why you don't like them.

801
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,030
I only have one master.

802
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,320
The law is my master.

803
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,350
I only follow the law.

804
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,270
I'm a prosecutor.

805
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:59,030
I want to take down Jo Tae Seop by helping you.

806
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,010
What is this?

807
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:29,640
Pandora's box.

808
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,200
 Public Officials' Children who evaded Military Service

809
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,440
This is...

810
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,980
Yes, it's exactly as you see.

811
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,440
What do you want me to do with this?

812
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,470
Present it to the National Assembly.

813
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,380
It will shock the country.

814
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:49,940
But you will regain your political strength.

815
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,540
No one can open this box

816
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,770
except you.

817
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:01,950
The moment you open this Pandoraâ€™s box, the world will react loudly,

818
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:08,840
but the people will be able to see their last hope.

819
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:25,920
 Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong was the only politician who opposed Jo Tae Seop.

820
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:32,320
 Now his wings are broken, but he is essential to defeating Jo Tae Seop.

821
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:41,950

822
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:51,390
â™«  Dear, All your things you've done  â™«

823
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:54,640
â™«  We are here to wreck it up  â™«

824
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:00,870
â™«  Who knows, how will it go?  â™«

825
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:08,430
â™«  Hiding in black and white  â™«

826
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:11,500
â™«  We are here to find the truth  â™«

827
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,780
â™«  Give up, I warn you so  â™«

828
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:19,230
 Again My Life

829
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,780
 Pandora's box will open.

830
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,240
 I will release the names on this list.

831
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,560
 Don't be lenient on those people on the list.

832
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,490
 Tell those people on the list. Tell them to come to me if they want to live.

833
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:34,340
 I will be part of management.

834
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,760
 Are you brave? Or are you reckless?

835
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,420
 I will make sure to expose Jo Tae Seop's real identity to the world.

836
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,110
 You'll get another chance. Take a breather and wait.

837
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:48,180
 Now that we've joined hands, I ought to grant him his wish.

838
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,660
â™«  There's no where to hide  â™«

839
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,780
 Again My Life
