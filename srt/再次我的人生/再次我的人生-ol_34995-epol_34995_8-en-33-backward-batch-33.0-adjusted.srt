1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,230
 Again My Life

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:10,100

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,800
  20 year-old medical student kills his pregnant lover and denies crime

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,490
  A creepy and calm suspect who continues to deny crime
 Brutally murdered after refusing an abortion

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,400
Good morning. ( In English
  Episode 8

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,520
The articles are causing public outrage.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,440
The number one most searched term

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,290
is the female college student's murder.

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,560
Everyone is paying attention to the shameless killer.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,850
- Is Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon the one in charge of this case?
 - Yes, sir.

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,150
He's been different since he began, and he has outstanding skills.

12
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,890
Get Kim Seok Hun on the phone.

13
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,270
Yes, Assemblyman. Thank you.

14
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,450
I'll let Jang Il Hyeon know.

15
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,570
Okay. I understand.

16
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,730
Okay.

17
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,660
I said it wasn't me! I said it wasn't me. It's not!

18
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,030
Anger management issues.

19
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,060
Is yelling a mental disorder?

20
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,110
It's a psychologist's diagnosis.

21
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,240
How is that proof that I killed someone?

22
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,450
You often argued with your girlfriend, and during those arguments, you used abusive language.

23
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,360
You would throw things and make a fuss,

24
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,320
and even ended up fighting with the neighbors.

25
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,880
I already explained that to you!

26
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,260
- Can you please listen to meâ€”
 - You fought with your girlfriend that day, too.

27
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,090
You stabbed her in a fit of rage when you lost your reasoning.

28
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,340
Accidental murders are all simple.

29
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,560
What's complicated is the feeling of the person doing the stabbing.

30
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,970
Please! Listen to me!

31
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,060
Hey.

32
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,760
I'm not sitting here to listen to someone like you babble.

33
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,590
How dare you?

34
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,770
You're going to get the maximum sentence.

35
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,510
Do you know who decides the verdict? The court of public opinion.

36
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,720
You ...

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,370
are finished, Punk.

38
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,150
Yes. This is Jang Il Hyeon.

39
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,210
 Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop is paying special attention to this case.

40
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,690
 Make sure to be transparent and thorough.

41
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,940
 and Mirae Electronics stays out of the news.

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,380
Okay. I'll try to cause more provocative headlines.

43
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,190
Thank you.

44
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,490
It looks like we need to speed this up.

45
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,850
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop is paying special attention to this case.

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,770
There's also something I'm aiming for while the timing's good.

47
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,990
If things go well for me, it will benefit you, too.

48
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,430
- You understand, right?
 - Yes. Thank you.

49
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,070
This punk has no patience.

50
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,390
Hello, Reporter Park. Tonight?

51
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,430
Okay!

52
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,820
Yeah. I actually had something to tell you.

53
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,460
Don't you think It's time you got promoted?

54
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,980
Do I ever say anything I don't mean?

55
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,570
Nice to see you.

56
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,380
Why did you want to see us?

57
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,490
I'll catch Jang Il Hyeon.

58
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,950
Jang Il Hyeon?

59
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,200
What's this? His eyes are glistening again.

60
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,550
Something's definitely up.

61
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,500
Someone getting excited at the thought of a promotion by putting another's life on the line.

62
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,510
That shouldn't be allowed.

63
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,770
Of course. That's more than enough reason for motivation. But how will you do it?

64
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,450
Sponsor prosecutor.

65
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,160
That will get people's attention for sure.

66
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,440
But that alone won't get as big a response as you want.

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,830
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun is the one backing Jang Il Hyeon.

68
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,130
And behind both of them is probably someone even more powerful.

69
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,070
Well, It hurts my pride to have to discuss this for more than five minutes.

70
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,360
Let's set the table lightly like we did in Gimsan.

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,780
- Set the table?
 - Yes.

72
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,550
Jang Il Hyeon is currently dating Seong Jin Mi.

73
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,610
Hey, what are you going to do with the two of them dating?

74
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,510
First off, I'm going to expose them to the media.

75
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,550
- Hey. Do you think I'm some sort of entertainment reporter?
 - Hey

76
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,550
What are friends for?

77
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,550
If you show them that, they'll probably treat you to a meal.

78
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,600
Okay. In exchange, you pay for drinks.

79
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,860
 TV: Seung Ji Min is a pianist and president of the National Foundation for the Arts University.

80
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,720
Isn't that Jang Il Hyeon?
  TV: Seong Jin Mi fell in love.

81
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,470
Have they been dating that long? Meeting in a place like that.
  TV:  She's dating a prosecutor at the Central District Prosecutors' Office and they became lovers when they met at an event.

82
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,700
It's that prosecutor passing by now.
   TV:  Look forward

83
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,950
What is going on exactly?
  TV: to lots of news about their lovely relationship!

84
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,520
Prosecutor Jang, I heard that you're dating nowadays?

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,880
Make sure you eat some chives.  (for stamina) .

86
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,440
Why would I eat chives when I'm dating?

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,930
Go do some squats, you loser.
  Pianist Song Jin Mi falls in love with a prosecutor!

88
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,630
She's getting more media exposure than expected.
  Pianist Seong Jin Mi

89
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,280
Dating is good, but you need to think about the advantages and disadvantages.

90
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,970
I'll make sure to take care of any potential disadvantages as we date.

91
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,050
There are advantages then?

92
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:05,330
Yes. There's something functional in the sexual relationship between men and women.

93
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,170
Well. A prosecutor and artist.

94
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,930
is  not a bad combination.

95
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,160
Congratulations.

96
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,890
Thank you!

97
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,040
Really? The Chief Prosecutor congratulated you?

98
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,070
Of course!

99
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,470
 The corruption of two people in the spotlight breaks out at once.

100
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,290
 The whole world will be watching.

101
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,500
 Once that happens, whether it's Kim Seok Hun or the higher-ups in power,

102
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,260
  will have a hard time covering it.

103
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,980
Before that, please take charge of Seong Jin Mi at the National Foundation for the Arts University.

104
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,130
What's this?

105
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,210
An admissions list from the National Foundation for the Arts University

106
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,480
and a history of asset changes for Seong Jin Mi and the foundation.

107
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,390
Please look it over.

108
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,110
Wow. How amazing.

109
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,000
Entrance exam corruption, tax evasion, and embezzlement.

110
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,590
Do you think it'll be possible?

111
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,160
Private school corruption isn't a new issue.

112
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,150
And Seong Jin Mi is a big spender

113
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,630
who tends to travel abroad often.

114
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,450
So there is a high likelihood she is using the foundation's money for her own gain.

115
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,680
You have a point. It is sufficiently possible.

116
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,580
Okay.

117
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,620
Got it.

118
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,810
Boss.

119
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,320
Good job.

120
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,880
 I'll leave the Jang Il Hyeon's sponsor case in your care.

121
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,160
I understand. I've also collected some materials, so I'll do my best to catch them.

122
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,360
For now, I'll focus on the investigation that Jang Il Hyeon is in charge of.

123
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,430
- The female college student murder case?
 - Yes.

124
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,930
We can't let someone be wronged because of a prosecutor like Jang Il Hyeon.

125
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,670
 Prosecution Service

126
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,660
You must be tired from being investigated all day.

127
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,590
I'm sorry for calling you out again.

128
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,670
It's fine.

129
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,170
You didn't kill her, right?

130
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,280
You said you didn't kill her.

131
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,710
Right?

132
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,020
No. It wasn't me.

133
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,690
We got into a big argument, so I went out for a bit since I was angry.

134
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,740
But while I was gone...

135
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,130
If I had stayed, she wouldn't have died.

136
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,150
How far did you go?

137
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,500
I went from the alley down to the main road.

138
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,140
Then I smoked a cigarette and went back when I calmed down.

139
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,620
Walking down that street wouldn't have taken longer than five minutes.

140
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,590
That's true.

141
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,490
You were so close by, but you didn't hear any screaming?

142
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,990
No. I didn't hear anything.

143
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,700
 Is this really where she got stabbed?

144
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,670
- Mr. Lee Ju Seok.
 - Yes?

145
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,760
Do you remember what parts of your girlfriend's body was stabbed?

146
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,710
Throat, chest,

147
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,850
back, her sides, and abdomen.

148
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,060
It wasn't just one area.

149
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,370
- Even so, you didn't hear any screaming?
 - No.

150
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,770
If that's the case, we know where she was stabbed first.

151
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,730
Her lungs.

152
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,660
Do you think you can

153
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,570
look at her wounds?

154
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,520
Yes.

155
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,300
What kind of wound damaged her lungs, do you think?

156
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,910
I think you'll know since you're a medical student.

157
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,880
This one.

158
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,340
The wound on her back damaged her lungs.

159
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,200
If that's the case, it's possible she was attacked from behind.

160
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,220
If that's the case, Seon Hui wouldn't have had time to scream.

161
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,670
If your lungs are punctured, you can't scream.

162
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,480
She must have been in so much pain.

163
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,560
It's my fault.

164
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,580
My fault.

165
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,180
Lee Ju Seok.

166
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,250
Yes.

167
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,360
We need proof that you weren't there.

168
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,710
Even little details can help. So think carefully.

169
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:47,220
Well, maybe this is useful?

170
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,660
Tell me.

171
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,920
There was an idol fan signing event happening while I was on the main road.

172
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,950
I could have been photographed in the background while passing by.

173
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,370
Okay. Let's check the CCTV footage nearby.

174
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,620
And, the fact that I was here,

175
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,080
don't tell Prosecutor Jang.

176
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,660
Okay.

177
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,210
Excuse me, prosecutor.

178
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,890
Does this mean you'll help me?

179
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,410
I don't care what happens to me.

180
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,940
I'll die of guilt anyway.

181
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,080
But the asshole who killed Seon Hui.

182
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,960
Please catch him.

183
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,810
We have to do at least that much for the person who died.

184
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,250
That's the kind of work I do.

185
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,660
And I'm not someone who came to believe your testimony.

186
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,620
We still don't know who the culprit is,

187
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,720
but I'll be sure to catch them.

188
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,370
The real culprit.

189
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,880
Will this suit your taste?

190
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,060
It's just to fill your stomach.

191
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,840
Taste doesn't matter when you're eating at a place like this.

192
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,450
I truly apologize.

193
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,890
Sorry for the inconvenience, but please be patient a little longer.

194
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,670
If you ever need anything, feel free to tell me.

195
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,440
Goodness. What is all this?

196
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,900
Is the District Attorney's Office an amusement park for your picnic?

197
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,720
- What?
- Sir, this is my case.

198
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,880
Chief Kim asked me to take over. You're out.

199
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,620
Sir! Even kindergarteners don't lick someone else's food to claim it.

200
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,000
Isn't that so, Chairnan Jeon Il Bo?

201
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,600
- Come out.
 - Okay.

202
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,290
Sir, I'll see you soon.

203
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,640
Hey, dumb bastard!  Think, will you?

204
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,930
- Think about what?
 - Don't you get it?

205
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,770
Haven't you considered the effect on the country's economy if he gets locked up?!

206
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,930
Why should prosecutors worry about the economy? Transfer to the Ministry of Economy and Finance if you're that worried.

207
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,880
What? This bastard really does...

208
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,220
- What are you doing?
 - A courageous prosecutor who removes the darkness of injustice.

209
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,920
A warm prosecutor who takes care of the powerless and marginalized.   (T.N.  He is quoting from the new prosector's oath of office. )

210
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,970
A fair prosecutor who only follows the truth.

211
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,460
An upright prosecutor who is tougher on himself.

212
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,920
What kind of prosecutor are you?

213
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,980
I know for a fact that I'm not a crazy prosecutor like you.

214
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,510
You crazy bastard.

215
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,710
Have a good day, sir.

216
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,550
Ah, you bastard, let's live quietly, quietly!

217
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,830
You're here. Living quietly is no fun.

218
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,490
- Min Su...
 - It's okay.

219
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,350
- Lee Min Su.
 - Okay.

220
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,350
- I will help you.
  - With what?

221
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,980
- You're a free spirit.
 - So?

222
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,200
Go to Gimsan. There's a vacant position now that Hui Wu and his minions are here.

223
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,910
I'll get you transferred there in the next personnel change.

224
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,990
I have that much influence, at least. In Gimsan, you can go fishing whenever you want and be free.

225
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,460
- Oh, Gimsan is nice.
 -  You don't need to thank me.

226
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,860
I'll go to Gimsan, and you'll end up in jail.

227
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,910
Write me a letter to thank me for giving you time to self-reflect.

228
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,850
It's a joke. Joke.

229
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,960
How could I send you to jail?

230
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,330
What are you waiting for? You're here to wag your tail. Go and wag.

231
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,130
Crazy bastard.

232
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,560
Seonbae.

233
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,340
Oh, are you here? Gosh...

234
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,900
- Are you okay?
 - Oh, of course.

235
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,360
How about having a late-night drink later?

236
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,250
Late at night? Let's go now and grab it.

237
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,420
I have to take care of something after Chief Jang leaves for the day.

238
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,800
What? Are you scheming behind Jang Il Hyeon's back?

239
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,130
Then I'll have to work overtime since it's been a while.

240
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,130
Okay. I'll let you know when I'm done.

241
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:54,800
  This is where it happened. No CCTV.

242
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,340
 An alleyway not used very often by people.

243
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,150
 The culprit is most likely well aware of this,

244
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,050
 so he was able to pull out the knife without hesitation even in broad daylight.

245
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:22,020
 He aimed precisely at the lungs from behind, so that the victim couldn't even scream.

246
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,080
 The culprit must be someone who has experience killing people.

247
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,260
 Yes, Prosecutor.

248
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,950
- How have you been?
-  Good, and you?

249
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,740
But what's the matter?

250
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,880
I have a job that needs to be handled quietly, but I'm a little short-handed.

251
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,680
Just speak. Gimsan is light on work these days.

252
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,620
 I'll text you the address.

253
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,440
Please compile a list of ex-offenders in the area who committed violent crimes in the past.

254
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,170
 Yes, sir. I'll send the list over as soon as it's ready.

255
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,000
Thank you!

256
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,470
They had an argument here.

257
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:15,010
Then he smoked by the main road over there and was possibly caught on camera.

258
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,640
 - Seon Hui.
 - Let go.

259
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,420
 I said, I'm sorry.

260
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,830
 - What's the matter?
 - Let's break up.

261
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,750
 - Just because you want to?
 - Yes.

262
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,850
 Fine!

263
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,900
I'll have to check all the CCTVs around here.

264
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,590
 Again My Life

265
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,280
- Are you here?
 - No.

266
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,310
How about here?

267
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,830
Not here either.

268
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,170
Then let's go to the next one.

269
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,510
Wait. Here!

270
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,790
You're right.

271
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,620
An idol group held a fan signing event in the area that day.

272
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,190
I was standing further over there.

273
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,470
Let's keep watching the video.

274
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,860
There, prosecutor. Here!

275
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,890
Can we use this to prove that I'm innocent?

276
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,400
We've overcome one hurdle now,

277
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,250
but catching the real culprit is the only definite way to prove your innocence.

278
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,170
- What is a prosecutor?
 - What?

279
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,280
Are we a legal criminal organization or what?

280
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,050
Gosh. Being a prosecutor sure isn't easy.

281
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,290
Are you upset about what happened earlier?

282
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,560
That jerk thinks he can lecture me just because he's my senior.

283
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,180
He's coddling a criminal to cover up the Mirae Electronics case.

284
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,370
Mirae Electronics' CEO is a big shot. It won't be easy.

285
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,600
If he were easy, it'd be no fun.

286
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,950
You're not saying you'll give up.

287
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,720
Of course not.

288
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,880
- Did you get everything done?
 - Yes.

289
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,650
Do you think you can catch the real culprit?

290
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,590
- You knew?
 - There are only two things that I don't know.

291
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,300
What women think and what you think.

292
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,300
Too bad. I think I know how you think.

293
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm easy, that's why. I'm the same inside and out.

294
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,350
Assemblyman Lee Jae Hun.

295
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,450
- Did you do a background check on me?
-  Because I wanted to trust you.

296
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,010
- You wanted to trust me?
 - I wanted to know what kind of person you were.

297
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,670
I had to confirm.

298
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,860
- I'm sorry.
- Not a problem.

299
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,120
- So, now you trust me?
- Yes.

300
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,230
That's odd. The brother that I know

301
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,110
would've felt hostility toward me as soon as he heard my father's name.

302
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,940
He wasn't exactly a clean politician, you know.

303
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,990
He had a successful political career, but he was involved in a number of corruption scandals and sex crimes.

304
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,740
He was framed by someone, wasn't he?

305
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,990
How did you know?

306
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,090
All his case files are gone.

307
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,760
The files are gone,

308
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,150
but there are people who remember what happened.

309
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,000
Wait.

310
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,540
I can't think straight right now.

311
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,520
Let me ask you two questions so I can gather my thoughts.

312
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,270
- When did you look into this?
- When I was in Gimsan.

313
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,460
Why are you telling me this when you really didn't need to?

314
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,710
Because I'm convinced that we share the same goal.

315
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,870
- What is my goal?
 - Jo Tae Seop.

316
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,400
Later...

317
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,260
Someday,

318
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,850
I hope I can tell you everything.

319
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,420
I'll look forward to that day.

320
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,260
Let's drink.

321
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,580
- Yeon Seok.
- Yes.

322
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,710
Hey, tell Sang Man to come down for dinner.

323
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,770
Don't make him come down here. He's been helping Hui Wu for the past few days until he's nearly sick.

324
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,810
Really? Then hold on a sec.

325
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,940
You should go and grab a bite too.

326
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,750
- May I?
 - The dinner rush is over. Relax and enjoy the food.

327
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,610
Yeon Seok, let's go. There's nothing like braised chicken after a long, hard day.

328
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,690
What? Are you going with him?

329
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:56,470
Of course. I must serve this delicious braised chicken to the young hardworking men who are helping our son.

330
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,970
- Wait a minute.
- What?

331
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,110
Put your foot on the chair.

332
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,380
You're so bossy. Here.

333
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,150
- The right foot.
 - Goodness. What's with you?

334
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,540
Fine. Here. What's the problem?

335
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,520
Why do you need this?

336
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,820
What is that doing there?

337
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,170
Figures. You were behaving for the past few days.

338
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,400
Don't get the wrong idea. I just wanted to cheer up the young men.

339
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,240
Do you know when a man feels the most pitiful?

340
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,290
When he realizes that he doesn't have soju while eating meat after a long, hard day.

341
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,840
Really?

342
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,670
Here. Take this and enjoy your dinner with Sang Man.

343
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,450
He'll clean and close up today.

344
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,200
- Thank you.
 - No problem.

345
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,210
- Hey, Yeon Seok!

346
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,970
- You!

347
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,120
- What?
- I need to talk to you.

348
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,910
About what?

349
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,280
Let's split up.

350
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,690
Sure, whatever.

351
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,600
Today! Let's split up immediately! Right now.

352
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,200
Then we'll meet again tomorrow.

353
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,940
I love you.

354
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,190
I'm so embarrassed.

355
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,580
Who writes comments like this?

356
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,940
Have some food first.

357
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,400
- What's all this?
- Ah, dongsaeng  (younger sibling) ,

358
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,720
you wouldn't understand even if I explained what the cyber task force does.

359
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,550
Is it going well?

360
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,710
- You're here.
- Yes.

361
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,210
Look at you, our comment management task force.

362
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,680
So? Is everything moving smoothly?

363
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,900
"Comment management task force"? Come on. I'm a pro.

364
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,810
Okay, I deleted those comments.

365
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,240
Jang Il Hyeon will probably upload more malicious comments.

366
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,220
A college student's future depends on this, so focus and don't let your guard down, okay?

367
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,790
I've never let my guard down. I'm tightening my sphincter muscles as I speak.

368
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,760
Good for you.

369
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,730
It wasn't me. It came from here.

370
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,600
Have some food, online comments manager.

371
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,680
I'm the head of the cyber task force.

372
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,240
Here, one more. Open wide, online comments manager.

373
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,000
The cyber...

374
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,720
You've come.

375
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,520
I had a meeting today with the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.

376
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,680
Yes, I heard.

377
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,660
The Korean semiconductor industry should be leading the world now,

378
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,650
but the competition among the domestic companies has been costing them too much.

379
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:06,520
When it comes to technology, fierce competition spurs innovation and development.

380
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,030
Right. I understand that competition is good for the industry, but coexistence is equally important.

381
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,710
Right.

382
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,210
Speaking of which, don't you think Mirae Automobile's decision to end

383
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,200
their affiliation with Mirae Electronics

384
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,710
was made too hastily?

385
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,100
The two companies can and should grow together.

386
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,500
Look at the bigger picture and re-consider the decision.

387
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,500
The thing is, the group has already finalized the decision.

388
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,280
Hello, sir.

389
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,750
Hui Ah, good to see you.

390
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:48,660
I heard you're now the head of Chunha Economic Research Institute. Congratulations!

391
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,340
Thank you.

392
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,850
I'm sorry to interrupt, but my father has to take his medication on time.

393
00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:00,180
As I get older, the only thing which increases is the number of pills I have to take for my blood pressure and heart.

394
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:05,160
You're leading the economy of this country. You must always look after your health.

395
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,770
I'm glad you're here.  Get me the analysis on Mirae Electronics' semiconductor department.

396
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,740
Yes, sir.

397
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:27,030
The decision was made based on our in-depth research and prediction analysis from different perspectives.

398
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,810
Can you explain it to him?

399
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:35,270
Yes, sir. As you know, sir, many semiconductor technologies are used to make a car.

400
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,710
So the key is using semiconductors that incorporate reliable and confirmed technology

401
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,690
and Chunha Electronics' technologies surpass Mirae Electronics' in various aspects.

402
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,720
If you read that, you can confirm the data.

403
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,800
I see.

404
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,560
Now that Mirae Automobiles belongs to Chunha Group,

405
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,680
we believe that focusing on safety and cost-effectiveness is more important than sticking to what is customary.

406
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,710
That is something you always emphasized too, sir.

407
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,820
Your daughter is such a bright young lady.

408
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,150
She sure is qualified to be the next leader of Chunha.

409
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,540
Your brother must be nervous.

410
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,340
No, sir.

411
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,420
 I emailed you the list you asked for.

412
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,550
 Look at this.

413
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,220
Hey, Gyu Ri!

414
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,330
It's been a long time.

415
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,280
Yes. Good to see you. How have you been?

416
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,960
Good, of course.

417
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,990
What brings you here at this time of day?

418
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,520
Aren't you busy?

419
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,240
Hold on.

420
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,330
Take a look at this.

421
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,860
 Prosecution Service

422
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,710
What's this?

423
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,840
It's about a case.

424
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,690
- A case?
 - Yes.

425
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,330
- This is...
- It's about the college girl's murder,  which was all over the news recently.

426
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,590
So you want me to represent the accused in the case?

427
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,070
Yes, sir.

428
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:33,450
I'm sure you're not asking me to fight to lose. What makes you think this is winnable?

429
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,590
There is a lot of uncertainty in the evidence saying the client is the murderer.

430
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,800
And also there is evidence that he wasn't at the murder site at the time.

431
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,610
That is insufficient. Even if you push it, there's no guarantee he will win.

432
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,340
Perhaps the reason the client left the scene was to purchase a knife.

433
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,570
There is no place selling knives of that size within one kilometer of the site.

434
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,860
He was on good terms with his girlfriend before the murder,

435
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,360
so it would be difficult to say he secretly hid the knife in advance in a premeditated crime.

436
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,770
That's no different. It's not good enough for concrete evidence.

437
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,690
If it is true that the client murdered his girlfriend in this heartless way,

438
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:10,590
what will happen if, without any remorse, he denies the killing?

439
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,180
I don't wish to defend such a person.

440
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,210
If you were also a lawyer, you would understand.

441
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,840
That dirty feeling of defending a criminal who should never be forgiven.

442
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,920
If I were a lawyer... when I assert that an innocent victim was guilty,

443
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,880
I would feel even dirtier.

444
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,240
I knew it. You were meant to be a lawyer!

445
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,810
So you'll accept the case?

446
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:48,400
Okay. It'll be a tough fight, but let's try.

447
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,680
Thank you.

448
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,250
My firm doesn't exactly have a good rapport with the prosecution.

449
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,450
You're aware of this, right?

450
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:00,440
The side that loses will take a big hit.

451
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,050
But if we win, we'll gain a lot.

452
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,250
Come to order.

453
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:19,630
Case Number 2017-GH-19273. We will now begin the trial.

454
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:25,450
This photo was taken when the accused was standing by the main road after arguing with his girlfriend.

455
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,860
An idol group's fan signing event was taking place in the area.

456
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,940
This shows the accused who happened to be walking by

457
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,700
while the fan club members were taking the photo.

458
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,700
This photo was taken at 16:27.

459
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,780
The accused called an ambulance at 16:28:52.

460
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:48,020
Do you think he could have run back, stabbed her, and called an ambulance in 1 minute and 52 seconds?

461
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,750
That's certainly not enough time.

462
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,060
Your Honor.

463
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,460
It only takes a few seconds to kill someone.

464
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,650
The defense is distracting us by listing a bunch of numbers.

465
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:03,840
More importantly, from the moment of his arrest on-site and until now, the defendantâ€”

466
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,990
- You're here.
-  has not shown any sign of remorse.

467
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,630
I'm sure you wouldn't have invited me to a fight you would lose.

468
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,440
- How do you plan on catching him?
  - You don't see any bloodstains on the defendant's hands.

469
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,800
- See for yourself.
 - If he had killed someone,

470
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,170
would he have such clean clothes?

471
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,170
Here, we have a clear imprint of the defendant's fingerprints.

472
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:31,810
Let me add that no other fingerprints were found on this besides the defendant's.

473
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:35,890
Additionally, there were no signs of the victim resisting.

474
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:40,360
The fact that she didn't resist is proof that she knew the assailant.

475
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,500
I submit this as evidence.

476
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,850
It's been confirmed that the victim was stabbed once,

477
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,880
exactly in her lungs. This led to her instant death, in which she couldn't even scream.

478
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,930
It's highly likely that the culprit is someone who is experienced with knives.

479
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,870
I object, Your Honor.

480
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,880
The defendant is a medical student.

481
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,980
He knows the human anatomy better than anyone.

482
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,000
Objection sustained.

483
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,280
Kim Gyu Ri?

484
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:10,550
Your Honor, the real culprit of this case has been caught.

485
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:31,680
Therefore, in accordance with Article 255 of the Criminal Procedure Act, the prosecution team

486
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,160
withdraws the prosecution.

487
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,660
Quiet. Be quiet everyone.

488
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,080
This was it, wasn't it?

489
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:06,150
Now spill it, who wants to go first?

490
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,570
 Prosecutor Kim Gyu Ri of the Eastern District Prosecutor's Office, arrests the real culprit in the female college student murder case!

491
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,420
Hui Wu came to me a week ago and asked me to request a case.

492
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,720
 Requesting a case
 1 week ago

493
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,950
- Requesting a case?
 - Yes.

494
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,950
There's something suspicious, so I wanted to ask you to check it out.

495
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,530
I think there's a real culprit somewhere.

496
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,400
Why are you asking me?

497
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:29,030
Director Jang Il Hyeon from my department is in charge of the case, so for me to step in directly is a bit...

498
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,020
- It's a case that Director Jang Il Hyeon is in charge of?
 - Yes.

499
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,880
Of course, I know it's a burden on you,

500
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,280
because you might end up fighting head to head with Director Jang Il Hyeon.

501
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,210
I'll do it.

502
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:47,230
If the real culprit is this bastard like you said, we need to get him.

503
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,580
I knew it.

504
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,220
Thank you.

505
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,690
Kang Deok Gu...

506
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,770
Look at this bastard.

507
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,740
Forced molestation, sexual assault, and battery, rape.

508
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:06,090
- This bastard is a piece of trash, this asshole.
 - Seonbae,

509
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,780
calm down on the swearing.

510
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,740
Even if I'm the only one here listening, don't you think you're going too far?

511
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,710
Whatever.

512
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,570
- Prosecutor Gu Seung Hyeok.
 - Yes?

513
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,220
- Follow me.
 - Excuse me?

514
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,770
Where are we going?

515
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,630
We're going to the Yangpyeong area. There's a murder case reported.

516
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,010
Murder case!? Where is it? Let's go.

517
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,650
Stop!

518
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,720
It's a top-secret investigation, so don't go over the top.

519
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,150
You could ruin things by acting without thinking. This is a warning.

520
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,590
Okay. I'll be careful.

521
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,830
- Let's go.
 - Yes!

522
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,770
You're doing it again!

523
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,440
There's nothing around here, and I don't see anyone passing by.

524
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,800
It's a perfect place to dump a body.

525
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,470
By the way, we're here to collect evidence, not to arrest,

526
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,710
- so look carefully and tell me the moment you see anything suspicious.
 - Okay.

527
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,310
Let's go.

528
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,240
Does he ever tire?

529
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,730
It's already been four hours but I don't see anything special.

530
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,600
Is it too much to search with just two of us?

531
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,100
Prosecutor Gu, let's wrap it up for today.

532
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,180
No, let's look a little longer.

533
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,560
That klutz...

534
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,150
Gu Seung Hyeok, are you okay?

535
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,800
Gu Seung Hyeok!

536
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,870
What is it!?

537
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:18,100
Over... there...

538
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,680
- Yes?
 -  Hey, Hui Wu,

539
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,640
we just found an unidentified body at the place you mentioned.

540
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,500
However, there's no evidence to connect this to Kang Deok Gu. What should I do?

541
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,770
I'll find the evidence. Just keep this information secure for a while.

542
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:42,790
Okay.

543
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:46,800
We'll keep the body secret for now and request an autopsy from the National Forensic Service,

544
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,180
and I'll also start a stakeout.

545
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,900
Okay, thank you.

546
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,340
Sure. Good luck.

547
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,130
Are you here to eat!?

548
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,520
Stop eating so much, you idiot.

549
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,310
- Hey, wake up, now! Now!
 - What, what is it?

550
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,640
Kang Deok Gu!

551
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,770
We can't lose him. Get going.

552
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,510
He's going. He's going! He's going!

553
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,050
- Why is it doing this?
 - I said get going!

554
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,520
Can you tell where he's going?

555
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,520
Misa-ri?

556
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,200
Okay, try following him.

557
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,820
He's a very dangerous person, so don't get too close,

558
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,420
and if you find anything strange at all, request backup right away.

559
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,010
Do not, and I mean  do not  intervene.

560
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,920
Do you understand? Yeah.

561
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,080
Hey, Sang Man.

562
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,980
Let's go.

563
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,870
Slowly.

564
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,890
Kang Deok Gu!

565
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:35,790
I'm Prosecutor Kim Kyu Ri of the Eastern Prosecutors' Office. You're under arrest for the murders of multiple women.

566
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,760
You have the right to an attorney and you'll have an opportunity to explain.

567
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,220
You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.

568
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:14,020
From now on, anything you say may be used against you in court.

569
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:18,800
Hyeong, we arrested Kang Deok Gu.

570
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:32,750
These are the victims we believe you murdered.

571
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:38,670
It's so nice to see them like this.

572
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,580
She had pretty feet.

573
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,700
She had nice hair.

574
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,810
And this one's hands were so smooth.

575
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,050
And this one...

576
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,590
 -  What's wrong?
- Let's just stop.

577
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:57,820
 What's going on?

578
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,570
 Let's break up.

579
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,870
 - Just like that?
- Yes.

580
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,170
 Okay! Let's break up then!

581
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:14,140
Her sharp voice was so attractive.

582
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,770
That's why I killed her.

583
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,110
That's why she died.

584
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,810
I see. That's how it happened?

585
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:25,920
Well done!

586
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,660
Actually, I should thank you.

587
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,380
I caught a serial killer thanks to you.

588
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,850
But Kim Hui Wu,

589
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:36,990
what made you suspect Kang Deok Gu as the real culprit?

590
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:41,190
That was before we got the autopsy result for one of his victims.

591
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,440
Oh, that? I got lucky when I was investigating my case.

592
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,740
How did you know the dead body was in Yangpyeong?

593
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,170
I really didn't like what Jang Il Hyeon was up to.

594
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:55,230
It started off as a simple suspicion. I was just lucky.

595
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,500
Really?

596
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,790
I thought you were some kind of psychic.

597
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,580
I bet it's a hunch of a competent prosecutor.

598
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,140
But everyone knows that Seonbae has the best hunches.

599
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,550
Gosh. Seriously, Hui Wu. Even your flattery is on another level.

600
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,720
I should get going first. I need to identify the rest of the victims.

601
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,670
See you around, Seonbae.

602
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,020
See you. Good luck with the case.

603
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,150
- See you later.
 - Yes.

604
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,940
Okay. Then I'll get going too.

605
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,360
Already? Why?

606
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,720
We should get a cup of coffee.

607
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,690
What are you talking about? I don't have time for that.

608
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,940
I need to wrap up the Mirae Electronics case.

609
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,760
Wait. Did you get the case back?

610
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,050
Not yet. But I will get it back at some point.

611
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,100
Chief Prosecutor Kim's plan to bury the Mirae Electronics case

612
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,700
using the college girl murder case is ruined.

613
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,540
Then the Mirae Electronics case will be in the limelight again.

614
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,780
He will put me back on the case before the public finds out he switched the prosecutor in charge.

615
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:00,200
He hates it when people badmouth him.

616
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,790
Probably.

617
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,530
Anyway, what's next for you, Hui Wu?

618
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,130
In my opinion, you're preparing for an even bigger event.

619
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:10,430
It's not like you to end things this prematurely. Right?

620
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:14,960
Exactly. Where's the fun in showing all my cards in the trailer?

621
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,260
Of course.  I'll look forward to that.

622
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,830
- Bye.
- See you.

623
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,930
 I saw the breaking news.

624
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:40,520
I knew it.. You are something else, Prosecutor  Kim.

625
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,150
Could you tell me your secret? I won't tell anyone.

626
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,670
There's no secret.

627
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,540
It's all thanks to you, Investigator Oh. Thank you.

628
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:53,280
It's my honor to contribute to catching a serial killer.

629
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,980
I'll call you again before long.

630
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,830
I would like to politely decline it.

631
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:59,400
Sorry?

632
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:01,930
It was a joke.

633
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,990
I will welcome your calls anytime.

634
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:09,630
Thank you. Bye bye.

635
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,560
 I emailed you what you asked me to look into.

636
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,850
 Jungjin-gu, Seoul List of Violent Convicts

637
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,860
 Look at this.

638
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,730
 It's the notorious serial killer, Kang Deok Gu.
 [ Kang Deok Gu / 34 years old / 172 cm / 68 kg

639
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,200
 I didn't think I would come across him with this case.

640
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:33,730
- Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon!
- Prosecutor Jang!

641
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,290
- The defendant was acquitted.!
 - One comment!

642
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,820
A comment, please!

643
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,890
What will you do about this case?

644
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,630
A comment, please!

645
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,070
Prosecutor Jang!

646
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,500
A comment, please!

647
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:01,020
I'm sorry.
  Has Mirae Electronics Slush Fund Also Entered the Political Arena?

648
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,350
Your failure to wrap up a case ruined everything.

649
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,580
I'm ashamed of myself.

650
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:13,420
The reputation of Korea's prosecutors is in the gutter. The CEO of Mirae Electronics, Jeon Il Bo's case resurfaced

651
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:18,770
as soon as Kang Deok Gu was arrested as if they had been waiting all along.

652
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:21,810
That means the press saw through our moves.

653
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,720
Yes?

654
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,140
What?

655
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,200
Turn on the TV.

656
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:38,730
 We could not repress the shock from the prosecution's double standard.

657
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,950
 Their shoddy investigation caused an innocent man to be accused of murder.

658
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,780
 But it has come to surface that they showed leniency in a conglomerate corruption investigation.

659
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,590
 Who does Korea's prosecution serve?

660
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:52,870
 Please make your stance clear!

661
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,220
 We at Daehan Party...

662
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,300
Call Public Information. Tell them to release articles that we won't go easy on the rich.

663
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:02,230
Put Lee Min Su back on the case before people start to talk.

664
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:06,030
Yes, sir. I will do as you say.

665
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,960
I got the file from the financial director of Hosan Chemicals, who bribed Jang Il Hyeon.

666
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,280
The funds his son used to buy an apartment in Gangnam seem a bit suspicious.

667
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,660
We found a good lead. Thank you for your help.

668
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:33,230
Here. This is a lead for admissions corruption at the National University Arts Foundation.

669
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:38,120
The kids of famous people entered the school every year by manipulating the scores of practical exams and interviews.

670
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,270
From high-ranking government officials, lawmakers, city councilors, to NIS employees,

671
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:46,070
just one word from them, and the foundation took care of the rest.

672
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:49,410
And I was able to get evidence of corruption on Seong Jin Mi.

673
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,520
This must have been a lot of work. Thank you.

674
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,670
I didn't mind the work. But I was just so shocked.

675
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:57,000
These people had nothing to fear.

676
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,860
When I kept digging, I kept finding more dirt. I bet they don't even think this is a problem.

677
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,430
All right. So what's your plan for the future?

678
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:09,360
First of all, the connection between Kim Seok Hoon and Jang Il Hyeon must be completely severed.

679
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,530
And you will be the cause.

680
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,950
- Me?
 - Yes.

681
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:20,750
Jang Il Hyeon will probably pay you a visit.

682
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,370
What brings you here?

683
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:35,730
I heard you've been investigating National Foundation for the Arts University.

684
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:38,030
I'll cut to the chase.

685
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:43,210
I will soon marry Chairwoman Seong Jin Mi of the National Foundation for the Arts University.

686
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,120
Is that so?

687
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:49,050
That's why I'm bringing this up.  The investigation you are doing... I want you to stop.

688
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:53,160
I understand where you're coming from, but I can't do that.

689
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:58,740
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I came to Seoul and haven't accomplished anything.

690
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:04,960
Don't you want to join  Chief Prosecutor Kim's side?

691
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,630
I hope you and I can belong to the same club.

692
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,730
But with a matter this unsavory,

693
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:15,390
I don't think that's possible.

694
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,870
I understand what you mean.

695
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:25,420
Then I'll stop here.

696
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:30,020
Then I hope our relationship can continue to stay amicable.

697
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:35,610
 Kim Seok Hun

698
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,830
As if losing the trial wasn't enough,

699
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:41,540
how dare he drop my name to stop an ongoing investigation?

700
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,290
 Yes, Chief Prosecutor Kim

701
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,720
Call Division Chief Jeon here.

702
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,840
- Did you ask to see me?
 - Yes.

703
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,850
So you've been investigating National  Foundation for the Arts University.

704
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:04,540
Sorry? Oh, yes, sir.

705
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,090
I was, but...

706
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:08,210
What is it? Something happen?

707
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:11,360
Well, Department Chief Jang asked me to stopâ€”

708
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:16,130
You're a prosecutor, trying to catch criminals. You don't have to worry about him.

709
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,640
You can smell corruption from the foundation a mile away, right?

710
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,410
Yes. It's pretty bad.

711
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,410
Okay. Do you have any evidence?

712
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:23,380
I have it.

713
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:27,470
Request a search warrant now.  Investigate thoroughly and find every single crime they've committed.

714
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:28,890
Don't forget to report to me.

715
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:31,820
Yes, I understand.

716
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,840
What on earth is this now?!

717
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,810
A search warrant for National Foundation for the Arts University?!

718
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,000
Oh! Did it already get issued?

719
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,540
You told me that you would back up. You went behind my back?!

720
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,570
I see. Is your nickname "Bat"?

721
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,610
You clearly told me you would back off!

722
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,370
- I was going to.
 - Then what?

723
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:05,060
Chief Prosecutor Kim told me to keep investigating.

724
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,830
Chief Prosecutor Kim did?

725
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,460
 Are you sure that's what he told you?

726
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,180
 No. I don't remember him telling me about that.

727
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,090
 You're just trying to ruin me now, aren't you?!

728
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,030
 As you may be well aware,

729
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:21,150
the press has been running stories that we've been covering up cases.

730
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:25,330
So Chief Prosecutor Kim is paying a lot of attention to my investigation now.

731
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:31,630
I couldn't bring myself to tell him that you asked me to drop the investigation.

732
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:35,220
Should I go over there and tell him that now?

733
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,540
And...

734
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:45,240
- you'd better watch out, you little shit.
 - What?

735
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,720
How dare you raise your voice in front of your senior?

736
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,940
 The Prosecutor General is on the line.

737
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,180
Yes, Prosecutor General.

738
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,610
How could you fail to take care of the Mirae Electronics case?

739
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:15,650
I'm sorry.

740
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:19,270
Chief Prosecutor Kim, is this your leadership problem?

741
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:22,220
I'll take care of it as soon as possible.

742
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:33,120
 The Secretary at the Blue House is on the line.

743
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:38,560
This is Kim Seok Hun speaking.

744
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,820
 I've been hearing a lot of chatter lately.

745
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,540
 People are already demanding reform in the prosecution.

746
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,460
There's nothing we can do to stop them.

747
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,680
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have let it get past me.

748
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:56,320
Chief Prosecutor Kim. Forget about becoming Prosecutor General now.

749
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:00,850
 Perhaps, even your current position should be reconsidered.

750
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:05,290
 I'm saying everyone has their place based on their competence.

751
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:08,330
But we won't neglect the hard work you put in.

752
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,410
Taking a break can be an option too.

753
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,550
 The prosecution is now trying to prove the charges against Mirae Electronics' former chairman.

754
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:33,860
 He said he had concrete evidence

755
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:38,170
 and dismissed the possibility of his release.

756
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,480
If Mr. Jeon were to get arrested,

757
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:48,170
my request for your help would be moot. Don't you agree?

758
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:51,030
I'm ashamed of myself.

759
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,440
So what brings you here?

760
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,290
The reputation of the prosecution is worsening day by day.

761
00:56:56,290 --> 00:57:00,820
I want to divert the public's attention.

762
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,760
Things must be tough for you.

763
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,860
I need your help, sir.

764
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,590
People take things for granted when I continue to be generous.

765
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:15,410
So when they are in a predicament, they come to me and beg for my help.

766
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:18,420
But how could I believe in you?

767
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:22,730
I'm sorry.  You should step down.

768
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,630
Assemblyman.

769
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,660
I'm sorry, sir.

770
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:34,590
This will... This will never happen again.

771
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:38,860
Prosecutor Kim.  Don't you know who gave you your position?

772
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:39,910
You, sir.

773
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:42,540
I know your limit.

774
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:47,960
I will give you money and power that will satisfy you more than enough.

775
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,800
So bear this in mind.

776
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,450
You will have more than enough as long as you stick to what I give you.

777
00:57:54,450 --> 00:57:56,950
I will bear that in mind.

778
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,180
Get up now.

779
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,180
- Director Han.
- Yes, sir.

780
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,440
Do you have anything we can use?

781
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,480
There's a scandal regarding announcer hidden cameras.

782
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,520
Hidden cameras.

783
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,890
- Let's go with that.
- Yes, sir.

784
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:13,650
I told you to get up. Now.

785
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,470
Thank you.

786
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,680
But to divert the public's attention completely from the corruption of Mirae Electronics,

787
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,810
the announcer spy cam scandal won't be enough.

788
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:31,230
Is there any other case you can use now?

789
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:34,780
There's a corruption scandal behind National Foundation for the Arts University. I'll blow it up immediately.

790
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:40,960
If it's the National Foundation for the Arts University, a lot of people buy art from there as investments.

791
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,860
So make sure they aren't affected by this.

792
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:43,980
Yes, sir.

793
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:49,190
By the way, people already lost faith in the prosecution. What will you do about that?

794
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:52,820
You, especially, must be in a pickle.

795
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,580
I will make sure to redeem myself.

796
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,290
It's not about redeeming yourself.

797
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:01,820
Why don't you offer up a fall guy who will take responsibility?

798
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,050
Responsibility?

799
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:05,770
Why? Show the people that you can still be trustworthy.

800
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:07,960
The credibility of the prosecution is fine.

801
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,620
A loach just clouded the water.

802
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:13,440
You set an example by catching the loach.

803
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,460
Simple, isn't it?

804
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,660
A loach?

805
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,280
 Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office

806
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,620
 The scoop! Announcer Choi Min Jin! Hidden camera video leakage!

807
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:42,060
 When I was investigating corruption behind the foundation, I stumbled upon Chief Jang Il Hyeon's corruption as well.

808
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,220
 It's pretty bad, so I'm reporting it to you.

809
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,040
Come on in.

810
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,750
Did you want to see me?

811
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,600
Sure.

812
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:06,870
What is this?

813
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:11,220
Recently, a prosecutor has brought disgrace to our entire organization.

814
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,790
And the same prosecutor has been taking bribes from conglomerates.

815
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:17,010
You can guess who it is, right?

816
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:18,180
Yes, sir.

817
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:22,130
Do you think you can take down Chief Jang Il Hyeon?

818
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:26,030
I'm going after a colleague as well as a senior prosecutor.

819
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,920
I'll give you full authority. Keep the investigation under wraps.

820
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,330
Hui Wu, you are responsible for restoring the reputation of our organization.

821
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,820
Yes, sir.

822
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:44,190
This investigation is only between us. I expect you to end it as swiftly as possible.

823
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,630
Yes, sir. I will.

824
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:56,940

825
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:08,960
 Your lifeline has snapped, Jang Il Hyeon.

826
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:19,680
â™«  Dear, All your things you've done  â™«

827
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,920
â™«  We are here to wreck it up  â™«

828
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:29,160
â™«  Who knows, how will it go?  â™«

829
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:36,680
â™«  Hiding in black and white  â™«

830
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,050
â™«  We are here to find the truth  â™«

831
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:45,310
â™«  Give up, I warn you so  â™«

832
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:48,590
 Again My Life

833
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:51,760
 The knife that is pointed at Jo Tae Seop.
â™«  Will I ever find out who you  â™«

834
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,480
 He's going to make people want to fight in the storm.

835
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,320
 Live like Kim Hui Ah.
  We'll catch him!

836
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,560
 If it will make our nation stronger...!

837
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,880
 It will make us stronger.

838
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,380
â™«   let me show you how to start  â™«

839
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,310
 Again My Life
