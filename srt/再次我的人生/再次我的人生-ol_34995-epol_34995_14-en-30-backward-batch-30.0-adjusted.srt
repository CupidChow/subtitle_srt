1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,990

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,820
 Lee Joon Gi

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,860
 Lee Kyung Young

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,560
 Kim Ji Eun

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,990
 Again My Life

6
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,360
Sir!

7
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,340
 I brought in the powerful Jo Tae Seop

8
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,540
 to show what trash he really is.

9
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,430
 I look forward to the hand you'll play.

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,650
 Okay, to the end.

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,110
 I have completed the task.

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,890
 I'll take care of it as you ordered.

13
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,450
 If you had another life, would you use it again to catch Jo Tae Seop?

14
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:40,370
 Promise me. Can you show him hell?

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,910
 To catch him, my life began again.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,690
 3 days ago

17
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,260
Do you know me?

18
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,240
Then our conversation will be brief.

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,280
I'll give you an opportunity.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,340
An opportunity for you to achieve your father Lee Jae Hun's unfinished dream.

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,250
How would you like to meet Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop?

22
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,670
Tell him. When I'm ready, I'll come see him.

23
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,890
So you're saying Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's people reached out to you first?

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,040
Right.

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,950
And you met Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop?

26
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,410
Yep.

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,890
 Welcome.

28
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,820
 One Day Earlier

29
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,610
 You resemble him.

30
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,350
  That gaze. It's similar to your father.

31
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,950
 You said you'd come see me when you're ready.

32
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,860
 Yes, I had to prepare myself.

33
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,640
 It's because I understand the significance of standing before you.

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,940
 Whenever I meet young prosecutors, I always ask this.

35
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,640
 What do you think the relationship between an assemblyman and a prosecutor is?

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,130
 A shitty one.

37
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,210
 - Shitty?
 - A relationship where they use each other and form cartels of power.

38
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,060
 If this isn't shitty, what is?

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,980
 And you had a hand in making it that way, sir.

40
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,020
 Do you realize what you're saying right now?

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,090
 I told you that I prepared myself to come here.

42
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,080
 Okay. Then let me ask.

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,500
 - Will you stand beside me?
 - Yes.

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,850
 You might have to do things you don't want to do.

45
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,200
 Can you keep Kim Hui Wu in check?

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,160
 Of course.

47
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,820
 If you order me to, I can get him, too.

48
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,180
 - You can get him?
 - Yes.

49
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,960
 - In return.
 - In return?

50
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,430
 give me Jeon Il Bo.

51
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,850
 Give you Jeon Il Bo?

52
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,010
 Is it because of your father?

53
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,500
 Yes, I feel you must resolve the past to live in the present.

54
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,710
 Jeon Il Bo unjustly accused my father of accepting bribes.

55
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,590
 Thanks to him, my father spent the last days of his life in a mental hospital.

56
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,020
 I've lived up to now entangled in the past, unable to think about the future.

57
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,270
 So I'd like to first resolve the past.

58
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:58,740
 Sir, I've already told you I'd even arrest Kim Hui Wu with whom I've spent a long time.

59
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,840
 - To have me—
 - I too must pay a price?

60
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,110
 Yes, sir.

61
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,060
 Do you realize how arrogant you sound?

62
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,390
 Then I'll leave.

63
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,400
 And I will continue to live tied to the past.

64
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,280
 Don't worry, I don't intend to speak about what happened here.

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,820
 But I'd like you to keep one thing in mind.

66
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,300
 While there are many that can replace Jeon Il Bo,

67
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,150
 I am probably the only prosecutor who can keep Kim Hui Wu in check.

68
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,920
 I'll ask this.

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,380
 After resolving the past, what would you like to do?

70
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:45,010
 Well, I have never thought about the future.

71
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,450
 Get Jeon Il Bo.

72
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,910
 I will draw out your future.

73
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,180
- I see.
 - Entertaining, isn't it?

74
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,710
Isn't it something you couldn't have imagined?

75
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,450
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop and me.

76
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,360
Yes, it's entertaining.

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,400
That's not what your expression reads.

78
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,130
I'm a bit worried too.

79
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:41,760
But, to me, who's already declared war, is it okay for you to expose all your thoughts?

80
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,420
Is this a way to balance out the game?

81
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,180
It is.

82
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,410
You're shooting lasers out of your eyes with that glare.

83
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,020
As promised, let's first catch Kim Seok Hun.

84
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,430
After that, we can fight.

85
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,960
There's a problem with Kim Seok Hun's wife.

86
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,820
Let's finish Kim Seok Hun quickly.

87
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,700
 Again My Life

88
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,930
Here, Executive Director Kim Yeong Il's stocks in Cheonha Holdings.

89
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,060
Now, it has finally found its true owner.
  Episode 14

90
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,750
Leave your evening schedule free two days from now.

91
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,890
You'll receive a notice of your appointment as Prosecutor General.

92
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:50,120
Please tell the Assemblyman that he can look forward to a new Prosecutors' Office.

93
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,440
Speaking of which, the assemblyman had something to say about that.

94
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,290
A new prosecutors' office and that beginning.

95
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,660
An incident to show the people.

96
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,070
In order for the Prosecutors' Office to show it won't bend to political pressures and that the law is equal for all,

97
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,890
how about investigating Cheonha Group's Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's daughter, Kim Hui Ah?

98
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,400
It's a good story.

99
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,250
I'll take my leave.

100
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,060
I got it. I'll buy it next time, for sure.

101
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,710
And then jjajangmyeon  (black bean sauce noodles)  next?

102
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,990
That was Executive Assistant Kim Jin Wu, right?

103
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,960
Yes.

104
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,480
I wonder why he came?

105
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,990
We can't find out the details, but one thing's for sure.

106
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,170
Jo Tae Seop has selected Kim Seok Hun as prosecutor general.

107
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,770
Then, what about you?

108
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,690
I'll probably be fired.

109
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,420
Before becoming prosecutor general, he will want to show what happens to a prosecutor who has lost favor.

110
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,510
No, that won't happen.

111
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,890
What do you mean?

112
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:35,060
I will have him lose the nomination before then.

113
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:41,420
Kim Seok Hun will be unable to escape this time.

114
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,720
Yeah, Han Mi.

115
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,080
Okay.

116
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,980
Have a look at this.

117
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,390
 Prosecutor General Nominee Kim Seok Hun's Corruption Exposed

118
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,280
What is that?

119
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:14,100
Recently, I received an anonymous letter.

120
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,170
The source requested anonymity.

121
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,850
 You'll probably remember the Gimsan drug and human trafficking case that put the country in an uproar.

122
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,610
 It's testimony from someone related to that.

123
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,960
As a person related to the drug and human trafficking incident in Gimsan,

124
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,130
which once caused a stir across the country,

125
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:43,200
he stated he wanted to accuse the one person who had escaped that case.

126
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,630
A key figure who received protection from the authorities was

127
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,760
Assemblyman of Gimsan, Gu Wuk Cheong.

128
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,960
The authority who protected Assemblyman Gu Wujk Cheong

129
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,980
is the nominee for the next prosecutor general and

130
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,640
the current chief prosecutor of the Seoul Central District, Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

131
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,220
 As I inspected the verifiable documents and persons,

132
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,200
 I understood the seriousness of the case

133
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,590
 to stand before you after discussing within the party.

134
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,040
 I, Daehan Party Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong,

135
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,570
 for conflicts of interest in business, receiving commercial favors, sex favors, etc,

136
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,920
 destroying the prestige and honor of an assemblyperson,

137
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,650
 beg that Democratic Party Assemblyman Gu Wuk Cheong and

138
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:34,310
 Central District Branch Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun be indicted by the prosecution.

139
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,050
Gu Wuk Cheong! Finally!

140
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,190
That's right. Used train ticket from Gimsan to Seoul should be thrown away. (He was their ticket to Seoul from Gimsan).

141
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,390
Now, this is only the beginning.

142
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,860
Oh, she's coming out.

143
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,650
 Eastern District Prosecutor Kim Gyu Ri.

144
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,390
 I am Kim Gyu Ri of the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.

145
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,180
Most recently, the Eastern District, while investigating

146
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:10,200
white collar crimes and tax evasion among the upper class,

147
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,530
 What's this?
  Possible Instances of JQ Gallery Tax Evasion

148
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,630
 Give it to District Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi

149
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:19,510
 District Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun is trying to use Choi Kang Jin to hunt District Prosecutor Yun.

150
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,780
 And that these documents will become his shield.

151
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,690
We have found evidence that Seoul Central District Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun's Wife, Pak Min Yeong,

152
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,150
 used various methods of money laundering and tax evasion

153
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:39,080
  during the process of trading high-priced art.

154
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,080
 JQ Gallery where Ms. Park is CEO,

155
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,090
 fabricated accounting books when selling high-priced art to dealers,

156
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,790
Kim Seok Hun, you dare hunt me?
  thereby evading corporate taxes.

157
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,580
 The warrant has been just issued by the court.

158
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,320
 We've launched a search and seizure of JQ Gallery,

159
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,950
I can't die by myself.
 which is being run under Pak Min Yeong's sibling's name.

160
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,410
Let's die together, Seok Hun.

161
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,710
Is it Yun Jong Gi's doing?

162
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,270
I'm confirming.

163
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,080
First, Hwang Jin Yong, and now Eastern District Prosecutors' Office. Something's off.

164
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,860
I'm getting a sense that this isn't the end.

165
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,340
I'm sure he knows that I'm behind Kim Seok Hun,

166
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,790
and that blocking this is nothing for me.

167
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,870
Sir, it's District Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

168
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,820
- Tell him to come.
 - Yes.

169
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,010
Yes, please send him in.

170
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,900
What could it be?

171
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,250
It feels like something bigger has been prepared.

172
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,610
Gu Wuk Cheong's incident, followed by his wife's case...

173
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,590
Will Kim Seok Hun be able to survive this time, too?

174
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:04,430
It could be a difficult issue for Kim Seok Hun to get out of, but it's not at all threatening to Jo Tae Seop.

175
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,830
But Jo Tae Seop will probably be conflicted.

176
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,430
He can pull him out of the swamp again,

177
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,790
but is Kim Seok Hun worth going that far for?

178
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,620
Kim Seok Hun will go to see Jo Tae Seop.

179
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,720
He'll try to survive, but in the end,

180
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,440
the visit will cement his downfall.

181
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:31,840
The last shot is aimed at Kim Seok Hun's heart.

182
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,750
 Above-named will transfer 550,000 shares to transferee.
All fees arising from transfer will be paid by above.

183
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,830
 Park Sang Man

184
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,740
Okay. The stock transfer process

185
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,660
is complete now.

186
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,520
Sang Man. No... CEO Park.

187
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,820
You've worked hard.

188
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,020
Don't say that. It was an opportunity for me to see you, too, and—

189
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,170
Hold on.

190
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,230
Hi, Hui Wu. Yes, I just took care of Kim Yeong Il's stocks.

191
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,970
Oh. I'll do that. Thanks.

192
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,530
Secretary Park, before it's made public, let Park Dae Ho get the wind of the fact that

193
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,730
Cheonha Holdings shares which JQ Construction owned

194
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,770
are now in my hands.

195
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,330
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,390
 District Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun
 JQ Gallery

197
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,130
Yes, I understand.

198
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,400
Sir, that was Park Dae Ho.

199
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,180
He said that the Kim Yeong Il's stake in Cheonha Holdings that were put up as collateral have been collected.

200
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,420
- What?
 - The problem is that the holder of security rights, Park Sang Man, the CEO of PSM Investments

201
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,490
disposed of the stock.

202
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,150
Who bought the stocks?

203
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,890
The Managing Director of Cheonha Group Strategic Management, Kim Hui Ah.

204
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,540
Collateral?

205
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,290
Did Kim Seok Hun really not know?

206
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,140
Sir, Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun is here.

207
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,910
Come in.

208
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,540
I apologize. I really didn't know.

209
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,370
I'll get my wife right away as well as Kim Hui Ah.

210
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,410
Five days. If you just give me five days...

211
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,360
- Five days?
 - Yes, sir.

212
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,500
I'll take care of Gu Wuk Cheong for you. You take care of your family matters.

213
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,730
Yes, sir.

214
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,070
I don't intend to block your appointment.

215
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,110
There are many things you need to do as the prosecutor general,

216
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,870
so hang in there until you reach the position.

217
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,490
Yes, sir.

218
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,010
Pardon?

219
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,080
Sir, there is something you should see.

220
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,410
- The situation is serious.
   - Hello,

221
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,130
 my name is Kim Han Mi.

222
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:21,250
 I am the illegitimate child of Prosecutor General candidate Kim Seok Hun.

223
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:27,510
 My mother Kim Yeong Hui supported Kim Seok Hun while he was preparing for the exam to become a prosecutor.

224
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:33,550
 But after passing the exam, he abandoned my mother.

225
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,560
 So, this was it.

226
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,590
 Under pressure never to reveal the truth in Korea, I was registered under my mother's family register

227
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,920
 and have been hiding my biological father's identity until now.

228
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,800
 I wasn't able to have a normal life since early on,

229
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,070
- Was this it?
  - so I had to give up the freedom to make my own choices.

230
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,360
- After focusing public attention on the corruption of Gu Wuk Cheong and his wife
  - From college to career choice,

231
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,940
- a child born out of wedlock comes to land the final blow.
   - candidate Kim Seok Hun threatened me

232
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,020
 never to call attention to myself,

233
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:01,200
 but I've endured until now with the determination that I must escape that threat.

234
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,410
 The reason that I am standing before you right now is because...

235
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,100
What do you think about what that young lady is saying?

236
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,090
  I find it laughable that such a guilty person should be investigating someone's corruption.

237
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,940
 Candidate Kim Seok Hun,

238
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:20,140
please don't make light of the Republic of Korea any longer!

239
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,280
I guess she's not making it all up.

240
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:34,710
Sir, I'll take care of it.

241
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,750
Don't kneel!

242
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:52,640
It's just one more thing we have to resolve, that's all.

243
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,390
Leave.

244
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,740
Go and take care of it like a prosecutor should.

245
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,350
Tell Kim Hui Wu.

246
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,160
To arrest Kim Seok Hun.

247
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,250
What can I do about a child who's already been born?

248
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,830
 Yes, sir.

249
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,940
This is the assemblyman's order. Arrest Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

250
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,640
I've delivered the message.

251
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,420
- Did he ask why?
 - No.

252
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,400
He just said that he understood.

253
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,210
He's not asking for a reason this time either?

254
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,890
No.

255
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,390
- This is Oh Min Guk.
 - It's me.

256
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,890
I didn't think I would live to see the day that I would wait for your call.

257
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm busy, so I'll skip the pleasantries.

258
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,870
There is something I need you to look into.

259
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,000
I also saw it on TV.

260
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,070
Do you need other crimes on Gu Wuk Cheong in addition to the corruption charges?

261
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,870
Yes. You're right.

262
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,190
I already put it together thinking it could be useful one day.

263
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:35,420
I found out that he bought a painting from JQ Gallery.

264
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,670
 And he even played golf with Kim Seok Hun.

265
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,550
I just sent you an email, so good luck putting the pieces of the puzzle together.

266
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,380
Okay. Thank you.

267
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,000
 Sure.

268
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,320
Sunbae, I'll head out first. Please send the investigators down to the first floor.

269
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,670
Sure. Go ahead.

270
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,480
 Prosecution Service

271
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,910
I apologize.

272
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,380
It's okay. Go ahead.

273
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,000
Kim Seok Hun, you are being arrested without a warrant for abuse of authority.

274
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,550
You have the right to remain silent and the right to request an attorney.

275
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,760
From now on, everything you say can be used against you in a court of law.

276
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,430
- Do you admit to the charges?
 - How do you feel?

277
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,470
 Give us a comment, please.

278
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,540
Please say a word! A word!

279
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,550
It's fine if you express your right to remain silent.

280
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,950
But I'm sure you're well aware it can be disadvantageous,

281
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,050
so I will stop the conversation and ask my questions.

282
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:08,200
Have you ever covered up corruption by Assemblyman Gu Wuk Cheong?

283
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,050
 At the time when I was Gimsan Branch's Branch Prosecutor, I Jeon Seok Gyu

284
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:42,770
 right before the press conference on Gimsan Drug Smuggling and Human Trafficking, received a phone call.

285
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,680
 An order to take Gu Wuk Cheong, whose corruption was clear, off the list of criminals.

286
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,470
 That order was given by then Seoul Central District Deputy District Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun, who is now the District Prosecutor.

287
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:59,520
 I, Jeon Seok Gyu, following those orders excluded Gu Wuk Cheong from the list of criminals.

288
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,200
And I'm the other witness.

289
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:18,960
As you know, the list of people involved in the sexual favors scandal revealed by Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong

290
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,400
and the list you gave me were different.

291
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,600
That decision wasn't mine.

292
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,470
You know very well.

293
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:39,420
Are you trying to trying to rope that person into this?

294
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:48,880
Allegations regarding JQ Construction and Gallery will be jointly investigated with the Eastern District.

295
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,650
You must've received instructions as well.

296
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,260
To take me down.

297
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,320
It'll be difficult to get out of it this time.

298
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,400
Also, about Kim Han Mi.

299
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,660
A long time ago, in order to save Han Mi, who was in trouble,

300
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,380
you came to the police station.

301
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,840
How do you know that?

302
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,750
I'm the friend who helped her that day.

303
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:31,720
I don't know what Han Mi means to you, but she's a dear friend of mine.

304
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:36,130
The decision of going public with the truth

305
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,450
was an agonizing one for Han Mi.

306
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,420
I hope you know that.

307
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,640
I'll ask you the questions now. Do you admit to the charges?

308
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,760
I do.

309
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:30,490
 Prosecution Service

310
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,420
Hello. I'm Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu from the Central District Office.

311
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:44,440
I'll announce the results of Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun's investigation.

312
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,840
We at the Anti-Corruption Investigation Department,

313
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,970
 arrested and indicted him for inappropriate reduction of criminal charges, concealment of crimes and abuse of authority.

314
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:00,540
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun concealed the crimes of Assemblyman Gu Wuk Cheong.

315
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:07,010
 Moreover, he committed similar crimes to protect the assemblymen who were involved in the sexual bribery case.

316
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,960
- Manager Han.
- Yes, sir.

317
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,920
Have you ever seen a tree that was perfectly smooth without a single flaw?

318
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,540
No, sir.

319
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:22,840
- Same here. Kim Hui Wu can't be an exception. Find his flaw.
 - Yes, sir.

320
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,430
He knows mine, so I should know at least one of his, too.

321
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,460
Shall I look into bribery?

322
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,770
No, not that. He said he came to me because of his convictions.

323
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:38,840
- Anything material wouldn't work. Find something else.
 - Yes, sir.

324
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,050
What do you think about making Yoon Jong Gi Prosecutor General?

325
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,520
I think he's the best option we have.

326
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,910
I haven't found any issues in his personal life or with this family.

327
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,320
Nor did he have any political connections prior to Kim Jong Taek.

328
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,880
And I didn't find any ties to Hwang Jin Yong based on the press briefing today.

329
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,710
What about the chief prosecutor position at the Central District Office?

330
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,830
I'm not sure.

331
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,190
Manager Kim?

332
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,320
What about Jeon Seok Gyu?

333
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,420
Jeon Seok Gyu?

334
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,060
He's never been taken care of by someone in power.

335
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,660
He's an honest man. Once he's loyal to you, I doubt he'll betray you.

336
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,930
Arrange a meeting.

337
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,770
Yes, sir.

338
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,770
- Secretary Han.
- Yes, sir.

339
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,020
Tell Yun Jong Gi I'd like to have dinner with him.

340
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,430
Yes, sir.

341
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:29,390
What should I do about Assemblyman Gu Wuk Cheong? He keeps calling.

342
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,580
Leave him be. Now's not the time to worry about small fry.

343
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,450
Yes, sir.

344
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,620
Jeon Seok Gyu.

345
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,760
How do you feel about arresting Chief Prosecutor Kim?

346
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,910
I'm not sure.

347
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,420
Our partnership ends today.

348
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,060
Shall we grab a drink to celebrate?

349
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,340
I'm sorry, I've got plans.

350
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,620
Plans? With whom?

351
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,260
Don't look at me like that. It was my choice.

352
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,490
I should've tried harder to stop you. I'm sorry.

353
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,880
Why are you apologizing?

354
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,350
It must've been a tough decision. Good job.

355
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,250
Do you know how I feel right now?

356
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:46,270
For the first time since I was born, I feel relieved.

357
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,430
What? Do I look pitiful to you?

358
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,860
I said I'm fine. Seriously. I'm totally fine.

359
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,270
All right.

360
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,890
 Mom

361
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,740
That's enough drinking for me today.

362
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,860
I should go comfort my mom.

363
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,190
I feel good, but I don't think she does.

364
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,430
Things are going to get really tough from now on.

365
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,040
Why? Because people know who I am now?

366
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,120
Maybe this is my chance to go into show business.

367
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,160
Didn't I look pretty good on screen?

368
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,490
Come on, punk. I'll see you.

369
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,110
Were you disappointed?

370
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,490
No, sir.

371
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:56,960
I was disappointed. The secret investigation on Kim Seok Hun's wife.

372
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,930
You should've at least given me a heads up.

373
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,420
I'm sorry, sir.

374
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:08,060
I thought a man like Kim Seok Hun didn't deserve to be Prosecutor General.

375
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,910
- The reason?
- Kim Seok Hun always said something.

376
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:14,250
"To make a prosecution that doesn't compromise with politics."

377
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,100
To me, that sounded like Kim Seok Hun

378
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,980
would one day hinder your political career.

379
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,660
All right, I understand.

380
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
Chief Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi.

381
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,960
Yes, sir?

382
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:38,120
The prosecution office you dream of. Try to make it a reality.

383
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,850
- Pardon?
- Prepare for a hearing. You'll get a call sometime tomorrow.

384
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,460
A-Assemblyman...

385
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,290
Thank you.

386
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,980
Try your best.

387
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,910
 JQ Constructions Case Report

388
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,020
 Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun Concealment Charge Case Report

389
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:21,190
 I've cut off Kim Seok Hun, Jo Tae Seop's right-hand man.

390
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:27,050
 Next, I'll have to cut off Park Dae Ho, his purse strings.

391
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,910
Kim Seok Hun's wife and son have been arrested.

392
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,550
JQ Construction will be out on the market soon.

393
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,110
Take it over.

394
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,930
The construction business will flourish again soon.

395
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,450
JQ Constructions will play many roles.

396
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,410
Yes, sir.

397
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:48,470
- Don't make any mistakes. Be on standby and don't miss the timing, okay?
 - Yes, sir.

398
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:54,140
Also, your Cheonha Holdings shares. I'll need them soon.

399
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,960
So get prepared.

400
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,790
Manager Han.

401
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,570
Yes, sir.

402
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,850
I need to make a visit to Cheonha Group.

403
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:07,570
Shall I contact Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun?

404
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,150
No, contact Kim Hui Ah.

405
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,280
Yes, sir.

406
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,070
 Cheonha

407
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,590
 Director Kim Hui Ah

408
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,790
It's been a while.

409
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,650
I was about to visit you soon, but you beat me to it.

410
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,330
Is that so?

411
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,190
Why did you do it?

412
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,130
The special investigation by National Tax Service.

413
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:36,270
You say you care about the nation's economy, but your actions say otherwise.

414
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,720
- Do I?
- Yes.

415
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,530
Why didn't you come by and ask me yourself like you are now?

416
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,700
Or do you have too much pride to do that?

417
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,910
Of course not. A businessman has no pride.

418
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,760
The National Tax Service investigation won't stop easily.

419
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,210
Products, chemicals, and shipbuilding. They'll dig into everything.

420
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:07,650
Do you want to stop it? There's only one way then.

421
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,590
Until when do you plan to keep the chairman's seat empty?

422
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:18,490
Make Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun the chairman. That's my offer.

423
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,960
You're revealing your anxiety for the first time.

424
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,410
You must be worried that I have Kim Yeong Il's shares.

425
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:32,730
You're worried I might use those shares to become chairwoman.

426
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,500
You're mistaken, Director Kim. I'm here to make my last offer.

427
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,990
Last offer?

428
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:45,060
Yes. The three of you didn't know your duties and responsibilities as the children of Chairman Kim Geon Yeong.

429
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,540
You're engaged in a power struggle to become the chairman.

430
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:54,240
The world is changing quickly, but you're fighting to fulfill your personal ambition.

431
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,520
How much longer should I wait? There's a limit to my patience.

432
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,910
My father taught me something.

433
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,190
"Don't do business that'll bring you loss."

434
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:15,870
If you want to make a deal, bring me something beneficial, instead of a threat.

435
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,740
Think wisely. You don't have much time.

436
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:28,270
Once the prosecution stabilizes, who do you think their next target will be?

437
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,980
Shall I repeat myself? Threats will not work.

438
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,820
Thank you for the coffee. Let's go.

439
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,400
I'm going out to eat.

440
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,260
Sure, go ahead.

441
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,950
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

442
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,100
Aren't you going to eat? Let's go get some food.

443
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,740
Sure.

444
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,190
Where's Branch Prosecutor Jeon?

445
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,010
I'm not sure. He rushed out after getting a phone call.

446
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,000
Who do you think will get the chief prosecutor position?

447
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,980
I can't say. I'm not sure.

448
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,100
If only he wasn't disliked by the higher-ups.

449
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,910
It would be nice if Prosecutor Jeon went from the Central District Prosecutor's Office all the way up to prosecutor general.

450
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,290
That would be nice.

451
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:34,100
What should we eat?

452
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,350
Let's have soup today.

453
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,940
How does fish soup sound?

454
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,730
Sounds good!

455
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:53,080
Your junior prosecutors follow your lead, right?

456
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,470
This is the first I'm hearing about that.

457
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,420
I'm just an incompetent prosecutor.

458
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,550
You're humble too.

459
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,890
Why did you call for me?

460
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:15,180
The Chief Prosecutor position is empty.

461
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:25,620
I think that prosecutors meeting up with politicians to talk about prosecutor business is extremely inappropriate.

462
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:31,070
What's wrong with two people who share a worry about the welfare of the citizens meeting?

463
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,200
Today can be the first day of our bond.

464
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,440
You and I?

465
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,780
Why would that be a problem?

466
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,940
I'm thinking of making you

467
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:47,640
the head of the Central Prosecutor's Office.

468
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,780
But, I have a condition.

469
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:56,250
Get Hwang Jin Yong out of politics.

470
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,220
And new wine should be poured into new wineskins.

471
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,730
So cut off all of the current allies that you've been working with.

472
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,040
Keep Choi Kang Jin by your side. That's my condition.

473
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,320
Why me?

474
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,540
Precisely that.

475
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:21,470
When opportunity knocks, everyone desperately tries to grab onto it, but you ask why.

476
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,100
It must be because you're careful and have a strong sense of responsibility.

477
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:28,060
Once you make a decision, you don't change your mind.

478
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,480
Chief Prosecutor.

479
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,710
If you're a prosecutor, it's a position you must have dreamt about at least once.

480
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,700
You must know that the opportunity doesn't come to just anyone.

481
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:48,030
Depending on what you do, you could even become prosecutor general.

482
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,480
 Prosecutor's Office

483
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,930
I thought you said you had a meeting. Did you only eat and come back?

484
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,590
Yeah.

485
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:10,480
Sir, by any chance, did anyone offer you the chief prosecutor position?

486
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,270
What?

487
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,730
Why are you so startled?

488
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,820
What kind of nonsense is that?

489
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,500
I heard the prosecutors from the 1st investigation division team talking in the break room.

490
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,210
- About what?
 - They were saying that you were a candidate for the chief prosecutor position.

491
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,250
It seems like a lot of prosecutors support you.

492
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:29,360
Stop saying nonsense. How did the indictment reports from today go?

493
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,940
Yes. I'll go and report those now.

494
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,000
 Prosecution

495
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,790
 Born in Haesan, Gyeonggi Province. Hankuk University Law Graduate.

496
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,470
 The prosecutor of conviction, Jeon Seok Gyu.

497
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,780
He simply hasn't had the chance to abandon his convictions, that's all.

498
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:01,420
Jeon Seok Gyu knows now. He's older so he'll understand

499
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,160
what it means to live with conviction.

500
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,650
But why did you instruct him to keep Choi Kang Jin by his side?

501
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,790
You said that they don't get along.

502
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,720
If you want something, you have to put up with some things you dislike.

503
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:23,340
If he can't follow this level of instruction, I can't make him my person.

504
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,910
Why have you gotten so much better at hitting?

505
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,800
Really?

506
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,780
What do you think? Is this good enough?

507
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:43,080
It's good enough to be considered professional level.

508
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,910
That's a relief.

509
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:48,580
There is someone I want to face off with at least once.

510
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,460
Do you have someone like that?

511
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,080
Yes.

512
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,680
You'll probably be able to see him soon.

513
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,680
Really?

514
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,230
 Hwang Jin Yong

515
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,660
Hello, sir.

516
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,750
Did you want to speak to me?

517
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,990
Have a seat.

518
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,800
Yes, sir.

519
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,990
Congratulations on becoming the head of the party.

520
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,910
Thank you.

521
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,460
You're the one who pushed me, but I think the reason I got that position

522
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,030
was because of public sentiment.

523
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,070
They say that public sentiment is divine will.

524
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,670
That's why I feel like there's such a heavy weight on my shoulders.

525
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,780
Please become a good party leader.

526
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,160
Yes, I must.

527
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,360
Ah, about the chief prosecutor.

528
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,880
Yun Jong Gi from the Eastern  District Prosecutor's Office,

529
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:29,200
I think he'll become the prosecutor general.

530
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:35,670
It's as predicted. Since he's one of Jo Tae Seop's people.

531
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:40,680
But, the trust between the two of them probably won't be deep.

532
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,880
Jo Tae Seop knows that Yun Jong Gi was working with Kim Jeong Taek.

533
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,430
And Yun Jong Gi knows that Jo Tae Seop used Kim Seok Hun

534
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,380
to target him.

535
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,840
You're saying that once trust is lost, it breaks.

536
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,900
Yes.

537
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:04,220
Before that, we have to hit Jo Tae Seop again.

538
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,530
We should.

539
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,730
The Central Prosecutor's Office.

540
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:13,680
The decision still hasn't been finalized, but Branch Prosecutor Jeon's name

541
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,230
has been floating around the National Assembly.

542
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,740
It would be good for you to keep that in mind.

543
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,640
 Let's go get some food.

544
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,710
 Sure. Where's Branch Prosecutor Jeon?

545
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,600
 I'm not sure. He rushed out right after getting a phone call.

546
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:40,160
 Prosecutor's Office

547
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,150
What brings you here?

548
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,190
Sir.

549
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,120
This is the list of assemblymen who received sexual bribes that were omitted by previous Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun.

550
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,830
A re-investigation is unavoidable.

551
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,630
Of course!

552
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,140
I'll take care of these.

553
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,790
Okay.

554
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,040
Seonbae, how about we have another Gimsan team unity meeting today? It's been a long time.

555
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,580
Sounds good to me.

556
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,950
Sir, shall we have a drink?

557
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,570
Sir?

558
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,370
Sir!

559
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,650
Oh? Yes. What?

560
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:31,130
Are you sick? You've been acting strange since yesterday.

561
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,720
Sir, let's have a unity meeting today.

562
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,900
I'll treat you to Korean beef.

563
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,610
Count me in!

564
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:44,400
Sir, the youngest is offering to treat us. We definitely have to go.

565
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,590
Today is my wife's birthday.

566
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,930
You drink amongst yourselves.

567
00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:00,040
Right! His wife's birthday is in the summer, though.

568
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,590
I am getting a feeling.

569
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,560
Something has slightly changed in him.

570
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,200
Why?

571
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,340
It's suspicious. Something is off.

572
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:18,230
But, are you really buying today?

573
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,830
Sure. Of course.

574
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,880
Where should we go? You should get ready.

575
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,810
I can't arrest Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong.

576
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:59,030
Are you rejecting my offer for the position of Chief Prosecutor?

577
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:02,450
If someone is guilty, I would lock them up even if it's my own kid.

578
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,460
But I can't arrest someone who's innocent.

579
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:10,710
Are you still that naive about the world?

580
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:14,020
I heard your juniors are outrunning you.

581
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,300
Aren't you embarrassed about falling behind?

582
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,180
I'm not ashamed at all.

583
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,510
I'm sure you vetted me.

584
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,340
I was born this way.

585
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,800
Coming to Seoul was a struggle for you.

586
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,450
It seems you'll have to move to an ocean-view office again.

587
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,710
I like the ocean.

588
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:35,750
Did you think those threats would scare me?

589
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:44,400
I get why the junior prosecutors respect you.

590
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,230
Chief Jeon. You have a unique talent of intriguing people.

591
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,180
I reject your offer to live as a dog. Goodbye.

592
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,040
Sit down.

593
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:08,000
If you leave now, it won't stop with exile.

594
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,510
You may lose everything from trying to uphold your principles.

595
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,320
You asked why I chose you, right?

596
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,580
I need a man I can trust.

597
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,040
Not some punk who sweet talks and conjures tricks to ride my coattails.

598
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,000
That's not what I'm looking for.

599
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,130
I need a talent who's honest and upright like you.

600
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:44,220
Then guarantee this for me.

601
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,170
For the Central District Office to have independence over investigations and personnel.

602
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,540
I'll reconsider then.

603
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,710
You want me to give way this time?

604
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,250
That's right.

605
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,260
Aren't you afraid of laying down such a condition with me?

606
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,980
It wasn't a condition, but a right.

607
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,730
A right?

608
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,860
Get back to work then.

609
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,420
A right?

610
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,720
I said I would buy you Korean beef.

611
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,910
Nonsense.

612
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,460
So this is where you ended up without me?

613
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,050
I thought you were buying beef.

614
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:46,070
- Chief!
 - Chief!

615
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,460
I knew you would be here.

616
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,360
Now, this is loyalty.

617
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,010
How could we eat Korean Beef without you?

618
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,550
I appreciate it, my boys.

619
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,820
By the way, do you know you've been acting strange recently?

620
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,710
How so?

621
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:15,120
Are you okay?

622
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,650
I'm hungry.

623
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:20,020
Even with a feast laid out, I couldn't eat because I was dining with someone uncomfortable.

624
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,420
- You mean your wife?
- No, Jo Tae Seop.

625
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:29,030
Was it about the Chief Prosecutor position?

626
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,840
So the rumors were true?

627
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,580
So? What happened?

628
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:38,260
A fancy hat (position) won't ever exist in my life. I was turned down.

629
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,680
Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun is detained in the Eastern Detention Center.

630
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,500
Even if he's acquitted in trial, he's been deemed immoral due to his illegitimate child.

631
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,270
It will be hard for him to make a comeback.

632
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:05,740
Kim Seok Hun.

633
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,950
I had shared my inner thoughts with him and trusted him quite a bit.

634
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:13,210
But...

635
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:16,920
I shouldn't have relied on his greed.

636
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,440
Can I trust Kim Hui Wu then?

637
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:27,980
Manager Han. Did you prepare a leash that suits Kim Hui Wu?

638
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,090
I have, sir.

639
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,610
- Go ahead then.
 - Yes, sir.

640
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:45,660
I said I was fine. Why did you drag me out so early on my day off?

641
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,450
They were worried about you. They kept whining about bringing you out.

642
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,580
Nuna.

643
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,570
What is this?

644
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:56,420
It's a gift from me and Yeon Seok. I paid more.

645
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,020
You were pretty on TV, but your skin looked dry.

646
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,280
What are you saying? I'm trending for my beauty.

647
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,340
Where?

648
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,660
Do you not have internet access?

649
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,830
I didn't see anything.

650
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:20,550
I'm already pretty as is, but I'll be even prettier with this. What to do?

651
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,630
What a stunner.

652
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,130
Thanks.

653
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,750
You took a break from work, right? Don't just stay home and go somewhere.

654
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,030
You're the only friend who worries about me.

655
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,540
I was planning to go somewhere far away to get some air.

656
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,140
How about Bali? A paradise full of passion and romance.

657
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:45,430
Father, it's still cold outside. Aren't you cold in that short-sleeve shirt?

658
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,840
Gosh, you know why he's wearing that?

659
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,070
Let me tell you. The next-door shop owner gave it as a souvenir from a trip.

660
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:55,630
He's braving the cold so Hui Wu would see it.

661
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,870
Gosh, you're making me uncomfortable.

662
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,630
Hui Wu. I have one for you too.

663
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,650
- Seriously?
 - Here, what do you think?

664
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:04,120
How do I look, guys?

665
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,820
- You look great!
 - I do?

666
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,520
- Bali's man.
- That's enough.

667
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,050
Bali is amazing. You should go on a family trip.

668
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,740
You've been to Bali before?

669
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:18,140
Their oceans and sunsets are amazing.

670
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,170
I love the Pacific Ocean, yet I've never been to Bali.

671
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,550
I get a feeling something will happen in Bali.   (TN: Referring to a hugely popular drama in 2004.)

672
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:26,500
Then let's all go after this case is over.

673
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,970
We'll have a family trip.

674
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,150
Really? When?

675
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:32,730
Soon. I'll take you there soon.

676
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:35,640
I'll start practicing Bali dance then.

677
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,930
- It's belly dance.
 - Same thing.

678
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,160
You're flexible.

679
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,300
Welcome.

680
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,980
- Let's eat.
 - Okay.

681
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,120
Whichever dish you choose, you won't be disappointed.

682
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,280
- Okay.
 - You won't be joining the trip.

683
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,780
Come on.

684
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,960
- Han Mi, delicious food will help you de-stress. Eat up.
 - All right.

685
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,690
Thanks. I feel better thanks to you.

686
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:13,500
Don't mention it. Get home safely.

687
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,880
- I'll call you.
 - Okay.

688
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:20,500
OPEN / 11:00 AM
 CLOSE / 10:00 PM

689
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,280
Are you done?

690
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,460
Let me ring you up. It's 18,000 won.

691
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,670
- Here.
 - Okay.

692
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,560
Thank you.

693
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,020
I'm staying at this hotel.

694
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,760
I came because people said the food was good. But I don't know how to get back.

695
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,060
Shall I call you a taxi?

696
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:48,660
I want to walk. Could you just tell me the directions?

697
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,510
Sure. Follow me.

698
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,960
- If you go this way, you'll see an art center.
- Okay.

699
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,340
Turn right from there and walk two more blocks. You'll see your hotel.

700
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:08,920
- Okay. Thank you.
 - Yes.

701
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,820
I've made contact.

702
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:23,520
Tell the assemblyman I can do this.

703
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,040
 I'll make a promise.

704
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:37,620
 If you can put a leash on him, our army will use your company's helicopters.

705
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:45,840
 You want me to seduce a man? You chose the wrong person.

706
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,890
 I'm not some low-life opportunist.

707
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:52,960
 Do you think that's how I view you?

708
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,370
 And does he look like a low-life to you?

709
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:00,140
 A mere prosecutor, with no titles for that matter.

710
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,950
 He's not upper-class for sure.

711
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:07,060
 Don't judge a book by its cover. He's not an easy target.

712
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,680
 You really think so?

713
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,510
 Men grovel to win me over.

714
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:24,790
 Especially, those who seek power.

715
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:29,930
 Because having me means they'll have the best accessory.

716
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:32,760
 You said your name was Jung Seo Yeon?

717
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,970
 Men who covet power want to have you?

718
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:41,070
 Then answer me this.

719
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:49,460
 Do I...

720
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,370
 want you?

721
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,950
 What an arrogant statement.

722
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:04,820
 Just get him to fall for you.

723
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:10,320
 This man will be the key to your business.

724
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,750
 Got it?

725
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,600
It's easy.

726
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,560
My goodness! What?

727
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,460
What? What is it? I lost my heart.

728
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,620
- What?
 - Are you interested?

729
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:33,760
It's the first time seeing you stare at a woman.

730
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,930
That's right.

731
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:39,140
Nuna Hui Ah, Nuna Han Mi, Nuna Gyu Ri ... there are a lot of beauties around you...ha?

732
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:45,260
Ah, the reason why you have been single is that you like that style.

733
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,840
A bit of a femme fatale style, isn't it?

734
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,810
It's not.

735
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:54,020
If that's the case, Nuna Han Mi isn't that easy.

736
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,320
Be honest, you enjoy this, don't you?

737
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,560
- I'm jealous when your eyes wander elsewhere.
 - I see.

738
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,230
Enough with the nonsense.

739
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,430
Yes, Hui Ah?

740
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,250
Gosh, Hui Ah.

741
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,650
Now?

742
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:18,690
Sang Man too?

743
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,650
I think JQ Construction will be on the market soon.

744
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:32,930
But only one company will jump in to buy it.

745
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,670
Jo Tae Seop threatened all the other companies

746
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:39,350
not to get involved with JQ Construction.

747
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:42,800
Then which company will get involved?

748
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,970
A paper company that has zero records until now.

749
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:50,520
The CEO is just a puppet. Someone else is running the finances.

750
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,480
Don't tell me it is...

751
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,150
Yes. Park Dae Ho.

752
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,720
So once he buys JQ Construction ...

753
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:02,270
He'll give their projects away and sell it to another company at a high price.

754
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:05,350
Then he'll use that black money

755
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,440
to buy Cheonha Holdings' shares.

756
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,340
If we don't move now, we might fail to acquire JQ Construction.

757
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,660
You're right.

758
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:19,430
He'll be the only one bidding, so Park Dae Ho will have his guard down.

759
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,940
That's why I'm here to support you.

760
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,180
This rich nuna would like to make an investment.

761
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,070
What do you say?

762
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,260
We would love that.

763
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,290
 Letter of Intent

764
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,240
Is this for real?

765
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,420
Are you sure you have the funds?

766
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,870
How could I buy a company without it?

767
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:42,480
I put down a little more than the market value.

768
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,170
Another company is interested in buying it too.

769
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,820
You think they would guarantee your job?

770
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,950
How dare you?

771
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:56,870
If you help me out until the end,

772
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:01,880
I promise to secure your future.

773
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:08,500
So before I see to it myself, convince the other board members.

774
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,990
This is CEO Park Sang Man.

775
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,130
Please read this.

776
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:18,160
He has a positive outlook on our company.

777
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:23,490
This is CEO Park Sang Man.

778
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:24,820
Read this, please.

779
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:28,900
He has a positive outlook on our company.

780
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,010
Please help us out this time.

781
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,590
What? A fly jumped into the bidding war?

782
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:40,740
Yes, sir. The company is called PSM Investment. I think they offered 300 billion won.

783
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,610
We'll just outbid them.

784
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:46,090
Go to JQ Construction and tell them we'll pay whatever they ask.

785
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,950
Nor will we ask for a discount.

786
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:50,630
And get the extra money from Bando Bank.

787
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,860
Yes, sir.

788
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:57,680
 CEO Park Dae Ho

789
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:03,890
 Prosecution Service

790
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:12,180
Let's start investigating Bando Bank.

791
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,280
 Records of Illegal Loans from Bando Bank

792
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,790
We ended Kim Seok Hun's career.

793
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:21,300
It's Bando Bank's Park Dae Ho's turn now.

794
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:25,790
Hold on.

795
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,260
Now isn't a good time.

796
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:32,620
That's never been an issue for us.

797
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:37,340
Kim Seok Hun's been arrested and Yun Jong Gi has been nominated as Prosecutor General.

798
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,380
There's too much going on at the office. Let's read the situation before we make a move.

799
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:44,820
Yes, sir.

800
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:50,000
But I'll be preparing for it.

801
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:58,690
They offered 320 billion.

802
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,440
They did?

803
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,790
Let's bet 400 billion then.

804
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:06,100
What?

805
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,280
Hey, 400 billion?

806
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,350
Yes.

807
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:11,140
I don't have that much money.

808
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:15,980
You don't? I thought a conglomerate would.

809
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,350
I'm saying it won't be easy getting that money on such short notice.

810
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:23,820
Hey, you better not be asking to use company funds.

811
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,800
Forget it, I was kidding.

812
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,920
- You don't have to prepare anything.
 - What?

813
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,610
I just need you to get some smoke starting.

814
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:36,030
So Park Dae Ho can dig his own grave.

815
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:42,320
Also, there's someone I'd like to meet.

816
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,260
 Director of the Financial Supervisory Service?

817
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,470
 The director always attends the Federation of Korean Industries' meetings.

818
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,930
Oh, there's a meeting tonight.

819
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:58,620
Should I set something up?

820
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:02,840
No, the intel you gave me is more than enough.

821
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,970
It was an honor meeting you, sir.

822
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,070
- I'll see you around.
 - Yes, sir.

823
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:25,200
Goodbye.

824
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:54,860
 Cleaning

825
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,010
Gosh, I've always wanted to meet you.

826
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,950
Director Kim Yong Min of the Financial Supervisory Service.

827
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:09,430
Nice to meet you. I'm Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu of the Central District Office.

828
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:16,940
This contains files on Bando Bank. They have a lot of issues.

829
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,230
It must be the result of the FSS' negligence when they should be monitoring banks.

830
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:24,820
So? Are you planning on arresting me?

831
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,350
Gosh, no.

832
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,760
How could a mere prosecutor arrest you?

833
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,670
You can't. So bow politely and leave.

834
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:37,210
I'll pretend this never happened then.

835
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:41,850
The general election is coming up soon.

836
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,920
As always, politicians will hurl negative comments at each other.

837
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:56,100
But what would happen if Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong gets a hold of this?

838
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:01,370
I heard your term lasts three years.

839
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:05,680
I wonder if you'll finish your term though.

840
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,180
Are you threatening me now?

841
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,120
I'm asking for cooperation.

842
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,080
I just need you to do one thing.

843
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:20,040
Then the opposition party won't ever get this file.

844
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,600
Sir.

845
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:38,490
Sir. We failed to pull money from Bando Bank.

846
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:39,660
What are you talking about?

847
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:44,160
The FSS notified Bando Bank to maintain the asset to equity ratio.

848
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,580
What? Out of nowhere?

849
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:48,610
How much can we utilize then?

850
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:50,240
Only 200 billion.

851
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,230
What about DH Money?

852
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,730
Less than 50 billion, sir.

853
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,720
What should we do?

854
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,230
 Don't make any mistakes.

855
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:03,320
Park Dae Ho will be scared of Jo Tae Seop.

856
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,530
He failed to secure Kim Yeong Il's shares.

857
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:12,930
And Bando Bank received a sanction from the Financial Supervisory Service for failing to satisfy a BIS recommendation.

858
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:19,990
Park Dae Ho. The CEO of Bando Bank.

859
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,990
His true identity is a thug.

860
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:27,580
Once he's cornered, that side will resurface.

861
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,770
That thug mentality of his.

862
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,070
Yes, sir?

863
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:42,890
The Central District's Chief Prosecutor has been decided.

864
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:47,850
It's Chief Jeon Seok Gyu. This is good news to you, right?

865
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,760
 Fancy titles won't ever exist in my life.

866
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,750
 I was turned down.

867
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:03,090
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

868
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:05,370
The Chief Prosecutor is coming in.

869
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,200
- Congratulations, sir!
- Congratulations, sir!

870
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,290
Let's go, sir.

871
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:34,920

872
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:41,450
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

873
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:44,710
♫  We are here to wreck it up  ♫

874
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:51,030
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

875
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:58,540
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

876
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,720
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

877
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:08,010
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

878
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:12,710
♫  Who would ever find out who you really are? Hm  ♫

879
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:16,370
 Again My Life

880
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:20,640
 We have one life and get to make only one decision.

881
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,380
 Hand over Kim Seok Hun's case.

882
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,410
 If I were Park Dae Ho, I would ask Jo Tae Seop for help.

883
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:30,450
 Jo Tae Seop always calculates his next move.

884
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:32,520
 He's a strong man.

885
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,290
 Jo Tae Seop is looking into Sang Man.

886
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:39,990
 In political battles, you always go after the opponent's Achilles heel.

887
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:42,400
 No!

888
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,110
 I'm going to get you.

889
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:48,980
♫  Oh I'll wait for now  ♫

890
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,750
♫  Let them  ♫

891
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:54,650
 Again My Life
