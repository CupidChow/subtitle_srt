1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,020

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,940
 Lee Joon Gi

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,820
 Lee Kyung Young

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,490
 Kim Ji Eun

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,030
 Again My Life

6
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,910
 Young people, set a goal and achieve it!

7
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,580
 Young people, set a goal and achieve it!

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,700
 When you get closer to Jo Tae Seop, you might see me again.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,950
 The Grim Reaper?

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,410
Nice to meet you. I'm Jo Tae Seop.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,650
 Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,250
You played a big role in winning last year's Presidential elections and regime change.

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,500
Unexpectedly, the percentage of voters in their 20s exceeded 45%.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,050
 I want to hear your thoughts on communicating with the younger generation.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,760
I keep my mouth closed and my wallet open.

16
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,330
I watch and listen to Super Junior and Lee Hyo Ri.
 (TN: Kpop idols)

17
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,220
I still Alt+Tab  ( a 1987 function to switch between tasks ) and read Guiyeoni novels  (Guiyeoni: pen name of a well-known internet novelist.)

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,920
to read the thoughts of you all.

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,150
It's a joke.

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,490
Even if we don't listen to the same music, one should understand the other generations

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,950
and respect their cultures.

22
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,480
 It's not a forced communication made

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,420
 by opening the wallets of the older generation. Instead

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,630
 an easy-going communication with formality is needed.

25
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,390
 However, what's preventing it may be vested interests,

26
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,190
 the selfishness of the older generation.

27
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,650
Cutting the tuition fee to half was the promise of the current president.

28
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,770
- Do you think it’s possible?
- No!

29
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,190
- Is it possible?
- No!

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:48,070
No! Our ultimate goal is not to cut them to half.

31
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,070
But make it fully state-funded!

32
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,750
 Young people, set a goal and achieve it!

33
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,240
I believe that everybody has the freedom and right to dream.

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,190
But, what can you do with just freedom and rights?

35
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,270
An opportunity to effortlessly achieve that dream!

36
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,110
That opportunity should be given fairly and equally.

37
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,860
Various voices of the diverse generations should pour out.

38
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,370
And those diverse voices should bear equal power.

39
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,170
Only then a person can go from rags to riches.
  (Meaning derived from a proverb.)

40
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,740
 The youths that act on their dreams

41
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,810
 and the hopes the next generation holds, will protect this society.

42
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,600
 The future is for the ones who dream.

43
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,960
Everyone, please have dreams!

44
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,110
 Have a future.

45
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,770
Our present. Our future.

46
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,310
Please protect them.

47
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,110
I, Jo Tae Seop, will help you.

48
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,840
 Jo Tae Seop, as I expected, this won't be easy.

49
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,040
 Jo Tae Seop

50
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,890
Can I please take a photo?

51
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,210
Thank you!

52
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,510
Assemblyman, can I request one too?

53
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,050
Ah! Sure. Your name is...

54
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,450
My name is Kim Gyu Ri.

55
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,490
Please sign for me also!

56
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,480
 Episode 4

57
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,520
 You're so handsome!

58
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,270
Please stay in line!

59
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:55,470
 If you have another life, will you use it to put Jo Tae Seop in jail?

60
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,540
 Promise me. Can you show him that there's a living hell in this world?

61
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,540
Thanks. I’ll keep my promise.

62
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,690
Yes. Please do.

63
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,350
 The Grim Reaper is Jo Tae Seop's secretary.

64
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,680
He's coming out!

65
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,130
Oh, where?

66
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,160
 Young people, set a goal and achieve it.

67
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,130
Office Manager Han Ji Hyeon, what's the next appointment?

68
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,390
- A field trip to the district and a visit to Daeoseong Orphanage.
 - Okay

69
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,710
Han Ji Hyeon.

70
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,420
- It's been a while. Have you all been okay?
 - Yes!

71
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,140
Let me give you a hug. Up we go!

72
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,460
Oh my! Why did you gain so much weight!

73
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,720
Just grow up strong!  Down we go.

74
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,170
Grandpa, I made this for you.

75
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,130
- Oh! Really? You can put it here.
- Yes!

76
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,370
Thanks, Ye Seong.

77
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,370
I wrote a letter.

78
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,040
Ah! A letter too?

79
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,920
Wow, Su Bin writes so beautifully too!

80
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,790
Thanks.

81
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,590
Wait a minute. The little one is standing there alone.

82
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,740
You’ve never seen me before, right?

83
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,250
- What's your name?
- Park Ji Na.

84
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,580
Ji Na, what a beautiful name.

85
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,300
What's it like to live here?

86
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,050
The principal takes care of me really well.

87
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,650
Ah! I see. Ji Na, come over here.

88
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,720
This country is your mom and dad.

89
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,330
You are not alone. There are always

90
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,320
people rooting for you, Ji Na.

91
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,380
Don't forget that.

92
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,620
Promise me.

93
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,460
 Jo Tae Seop visits people in their environs.

94
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,810
 Manager Han ... Jo Tae Seop isn't someone who would keep just anyone next to him.

95
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,760
 But the fact that I don't know her...

96
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,290
 Please catch him. Please show him that there's a living hell in this world.

97
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,250
Does that mean she died before me?

98
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,490
 Again My Life

99
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,910
 Thanks. I’ll keep my promise.

100
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,490
Now, drink up.
 Jo Tae Seop continues to interact with everyday people ...

101
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,060
- Should I pour for myself?
 - Oh, no. I'll do it.

102
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,210
To the top.

103
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,640
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

104
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,070
Nice.

105
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,320
Why do you think Hui Wu went to go see that person?

106
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,640
I don't think that's Hui Wu's type.

107
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,360
Smart and cool people tend to

108
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,380
master both sides.

109
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,970
Hold on.

110
00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:00,180
Progressive, conservative.  Like this ... like me!

111
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,800
That’s not what I mean.

112
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,090
That person...

113
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,680
A person behaving like that comes across as being false.

114
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,220
Someone whose insides and outside are different.

115
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,780
- Do you know that person?
 - Do I have to know to see that?

116
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,720
You can just tell.

117
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,800
And me?

118
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,660
You?

119
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,660
You're the same inside and out.

120
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,970
- And?
 - Now, all you need is a bit of charm!

121
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,160
Ah, that's hard. It's so hard. That's the hardest.

122
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,440
But since we're in the same grade we should speak comfortably.

123
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,840
Even so, that's kind of ... We have to consider your face value as sunbaenim, so I don't think we should.

124
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,280
What's so important about the outer appearance?

125
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,440
Mental age is what is important.

126
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,160
I am forever 14 years old! An 8th grader. 8th grade.

127
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,450
- Okay! Now, we are friends.
- Okay!

128
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,280
- Friends?
- Okay, Hui Ah!

129
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,910
You're talking casually? What kind of nonsense is that!

130
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,190
Hui Wu! Now, Hui Ah and I are friends.

131
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,590
Why are you obsessed with becoming friends with the younger classmates? I don't understand.

132
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,580
What do you mean friends? You said you were an 8th grader.

133
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,490
- Now, call me Nuna!
 - Nuna.

134
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,060
Nuna! Hui Ah Nuna!

135
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,110
- Nuna!
- Nuna?

136
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,230
Hey, age doesn't matter.  Let's live comfortably.  Freely!

137
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,670
Have a drink.  Have a drink. Have a drink.

138
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,300
Hey, hey.

139
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,480
 Have a glass. Here, here.

140
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,570
Let's go for a second round.

141
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,900
- Hui Wu, I'm really not drunk.
 - That's what a drunk person says.

142
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,160
Let's get in, Sunbaenim. Come on.

143
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,500
- I'm really not drunk! The world is.
 - Get in.

144
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,670
-The world is drunk.
 - Get in.

145
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:58,410
Hui Wu, you know that I'm holding back a lot right now, right?

146
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,280
I really can do anything in this life, you know.

147
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,930
What should I do?

148
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,340
Should I gobble it right up,

149
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,630
or should I break it to pieces?

150
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,050
You can break it, topple it, have it for porridge, or whatever...

151
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,650
Get in! Get in!

152
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,940
To Samdo-dong, please.

153
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,460
Crap, what's this?

154
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,490
- You're a  Kkondae.
 - Yes, have a safe trip, Sunbaenim!
 (Kkondae: Korean term for Boomers.)

155
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,720
I'm so tired.

156
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,420
Who are you?

157
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,030
Hey. Are you a stalker?

158
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,710
Hey!

159
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,270
 Who is he? He's not an ordinary person.

160
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,740
- I think there's been a misunderstanding.
  - Misunderstanding?

161
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,780
I saw you following us from the bar.

162
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,380
I already told you that you've misunderstood.

163
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,140
Then why did you follow us knowing that it would cause a misunderstanding?

164
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,780
Who are you?

165
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,120
Kim Hui Wu.

166
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,450
Manager Park!

167
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,330
What are you two doing?

168
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,360
Miss. There was a bit of a misunderstanding.

169
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,100
Miss?

170
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,250
About that...

171
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,610
 I remember who you are now, Kim Hui Ah.

172
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:11,590
 Kim Geon Yeong, a giant in the Korean business world and chairman of Cheonha Group has passed away at the age of 78.

173
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,720
  He is the son of the late Kim Sang Man who founded Cheonha Group.

174
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,870
 Cheonha Group has become a world-renown company

175
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,880
  Kim Geon Yeong is survived by

176
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,990
  his eldest son Kim Yong Jun, the executive director of Cheonha Electronics,

177
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,570
  his second son Kim Seong Jun, managing director of Cheonha Motors

178
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,650
  and Kim Hui Ah.

179
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,450
 The one whose face became known for the first time at her father's funeral,

180
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,310
  Kim Hui Ah, the only daughter of the Chairman Kim Geon Yeong.

181
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,340
 What kind of fate is this now?

182
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,610
 Hui Yu, can you keep this incident a secret?

183
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,320
 Jo Tae Seop used Cheonha as a slush fund source, but

184
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,070
  I hate Jo Tae Seop

185
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:21,850
 if I'm right, I can bring Kim Hui Ah over to my side.

186
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,000
He's not a normal student.
  Kim Hui Wu

187
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,680
- His parents are nightshift factory workers?
 - Yes

188
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,610
He went from placing last to first place?

189
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,930
Is that even possible?

190
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,170
He even went to Hankuk University Law School, one of the best schools in the country.

191
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,830
And that mere twenty-year-old stood toe-to-toe with you?

192
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,940
We don't know how it would have turned out if the young lady hadn't stepped in.

193
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,100
- Have you ever lost a hand-to-hand fight with anyone?
 - No, never.

194
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,180
This, this is truly a strange one, hmm?

195
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,060
- Look into him some more.
 - Okay, sir.

196
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,290
Dad?

197
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,350
I heard you got a boyfriend?

198
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,770
He's not my boyfriend. He's just a friend.

199
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,420
I heard that there was a fight because he thought Jin Hyeok was a stalker.

200
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,600
In the end, it is something to be grateful for.

201
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,030
Yeah. On top of that, the two were neck and neck.

202
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,780
While the two of them were flying around in the air,

203
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,370
- I thought I was watching a martial arts movie.
 - Really?

204
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,590
He's more interesting the more I get to know him.

205
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,780
When did he have time to exercise while studying as hard as he does?

206
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,150
And he's polite. And attractive...

207
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,150
He is attractive, but he's not my type.

208
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,900
I don't believe you.

209
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,700
It looks like you've already fallen for him.

210
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,890
Of course, not.

211
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:09,050
- Well... it was enough to make me a little conflicted about studying abroad.
 - Really?

212
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,130
In that case, I'll have to ask that guy to keep my daughter here.

213
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,490
Really?

214
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,920
Wow, so you're serious about this, then?

215
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,540
This brat who doesn't even listen to her father.

216
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,870
- You're making me sad.
 - I was joking!

217
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,330
 Chairman, Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop is here to see you.

218
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,620
Send him up.

219
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,580
- I'll head out to school then.
 - Okay.

220
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,090
Who's this?

221
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,550
- Hello.
 - It's been a long time.

222
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,820
I heard that you got into Hankuk University. Congratulations.

223
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:49,910
- Thank you.
 - Pick your major wisely so that you can become one of the talented young people to lead our country.

224
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:55,180
In the future, artificial intelligence, information, and communication technologies will sweep the globe.

225
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,890
Yes. I'll keep that in mind. I'll leave you both to talk.

226
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,210
It's been a long time, Assemblyman.

227
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,900
Hui Ah grew up nicely.

228
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,430
She's still young.

229
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,850
- Have a seat.
 - Sure.

230
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,490
 I hate him.

231
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,950
So good. The instant coffee from my memories.

232
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,320
Pretentious jerk.

233
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,860
- Me? Why?
 - Hm?

234
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,550
- What?
  - Oh... you just said I was a pretentious... something or other.

235
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,630
Oh! Not you.

236
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,190
- That person.
 - Ah...

237
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,410
That's what you meant.
  ...the basic right to live.

238
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:45,140
 Therefore, members of the National Assembly make systems and laws in order to protect the fairness of society.

239
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,680
Fairness? What a joke.
  That is the purpose of politics.

240
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,150
Is Jo Tae Seop a bad person?

241
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,570
Bingo. People just don't know it yet.

242
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,290
How do you know?

243
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,750
Me?

244
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,390
You'll know as time passes.

245
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,770
Lies and hypocrisy are bound to come out someday.

246
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,510
Hui Wu!

247
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:14,390
- What's up Gyu Ri?
 - Are you busy? Can you help me?

248
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,060
Oh, sure.

249
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Can you take this to the classroom?

250
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,560
I have to go to a liberal arts class right now, but it's hard to carry it all.

251
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,620
I'll buy you dinner later.

252
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,110
- Of course! No problem. But is that what you're reading these days?

253
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,220
Oh, I've been taking Western Cultural History, so I'm reading it again.
  Greek and Roman Mythology

254
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,690
I'll see you later then!

255
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,190
Okay.

256
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,320
I heard you guys came from the same academy?

257
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,730
-  Gyu Ri and me?  Yes.
- Ah...

258
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,320
You must have spent all day together when you two were studying.

259
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,880
Probably. Why?

260
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,730
You were a shuttle, weren't you?
  (Shuttle: an errand boy for bullies.)

261
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,590
You seem so used to doing whatever you're told.

262
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,070
Does it seem like that?

263
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,300
I guess you could see it like th—

264
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,400
Take care of mine too, would you?

265
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,270
Yeah, sure!

266
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,450
Hey, Hui Ah... wait.

267
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,160
Hui Ah.

268
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,800
Hey, brother!

269
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,620
Say hello. He’s a friend from med school. His name is: Moon Seong Hwan.

270
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,870
He used to compete for first place in our department.

271
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,910
Hello. I'm Moon Seong Hwan.

272
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,630
Yeah, nice to meet you.

273
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,890
He's kind and gentle.

274
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,610
 Moon Seong Hwan? That name sounds familiar.

275
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:39,320
Take Mirae Automobiles and grow the size of the Cheonha company.

276
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,090
- That's...
 - I'll give you some time to think.

277
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,580
I don't expect Mirae Automobiles to be sold abroad.

278
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,760
How many times has a foreign fund taken over a Korean company and then dine-and-dashed with it?

279
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,410
That's true, but...

280
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,080
The creditor bank decided to provide emergency funds for Mirae Automobiles

281
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,420
since they're in dire need of money right now.

282
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,880
That's a temporary fix.

283
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,260
I heard that the amount of debt alone is close to one trillion won.

284
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,920
That's right.

285
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,280
If we leave it like this, then Mirae Automobiles will be a bottomless pit.

286
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,760
However, if Mirae gets Cheonha branding, that's a different story.

287
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,530
Assemblyman, the trend these days is to establish overseas sites to reduce production costs.

288
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,370
The time will soon come when a single robot will be able to handle the tasks of 10,000 people.

289
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,930
Mirae Automobiles, having only domestic factories, is a company with no major benefits for me as a business manager.

290
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,540
That's strange.

291
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:37,110
You aren't the type of person who wouldn't understand.

292
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,720
There's only one answer to my suggestion.

293
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,410
You have to learn to let things go.

294
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,970
Take Mirae Automobiles.

295
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,560
The entire medical college went nuts at the time.

296
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,720
Two geniuses, born maybe once in a hundred years, were both dropping out.

297
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,440
Don't call yourself a genius.

298
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,840
If I don't say it, no one will.

299
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,160
- Maybe that's why.
 - Ah...

300
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:13,270
Anyway, I dropped out to follow my dreams, and he dropped out to change the world.

301
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,540
You're cool.

302
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,320
Hardly. I was merely displaying bravado by myself.

303
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,550
Do you know how hard it is to show bravado without troubling others?

304
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,230
Resolve. Nice, good.

305
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:28,580
I don't know. After studying how to fix people, my interest shifted to making people more comfortable.

306
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,960
I'm not sure if this will end up as 'nice'.

307
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,180
I think it'll become 'nice' as long as you change the name.

308
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,270
The app or whatever he created has such a childish name.

309
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,940
- HeuHeuTalk?
 - It's HaHaTalk!

310
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,970
- HaHaTalk?

311
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,780
Yes!

312
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,900
 The person who created HaHaTalk, Moon Seong Hwan.

313
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,920
 Youth entrepreneur's downfall, HaHaTalk Moon Seong Hwan leaves to study abroad.

314
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,540
 He creates a platform that changes the world,

315
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:57,030
 but he suffered an intellectual property dispute with Jeil Telecom and lost the trial,

316
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,750
 and suddenly left to study abroad.

317
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,760
Hey, Heuheu Talk is better, right?

318
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
HeuHeuHeuTalk.

319
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,780
- Is it childish?
 - No.

320
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,850
It's great actually.

321
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,150
If he says he likes it,  then it's really good.

322
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,080
Then what, would he change the world with this?

323
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,440
Sure would.

324
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,360
I mean...

325
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,710
That's the feeling I get.

326
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,790
Strangely, I trust him.

327
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,790
Right?

328
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,820
I like it.

329
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,570
I told you to come here—

330
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,470
By the way, it must be a lot of work to do all that on your own, right?

331
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:36,120
I felt limited on my own, both financially and business-wise, so I applied to a large company project contest.

332
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,220
Large company?

333
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,120
Yes. It's called the Cheonha Telecom Youth Enterprise Support Project.

334
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,410
I mean, Cheonha Telecom, and not Jeil Telecom?

335
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,240
Yes.

336
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,430
They haven't announced the winner yet, but the CEO already contacted him to have a meeting.

337
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,800
By chance, do you know the name of the CEO?

338
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,020
I heard it was Chairman Kim Chan II.

339
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,400
- Chairman Kim Chan Il?
- Yes.

340
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,420
 Kim Chan Il?

341
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,110
 Cheonha Telecom Youth Support Project

342
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,050
Disqualify.

343
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,300
However, according to the Cheonha economy research report, it has the greatest potential for commercialization—

344
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,830
Hey, did you not understand what I just said?

345
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,600
Yes, sir. I’ll do as you say.

346
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,080
In addition, secretly prepare a legal team without the company board noticing.

347
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,790
Pardon? Without the company board noticing?

348
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,180
Hey, you're going to be moving with me, so just do what I tell you!

349
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,690
Yes, sir. Understood.

350
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,380
Once we get the source of Moon Seong Hwan's program,

351
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,390
- we'll proceed with patent and copyright registration right away.
 - Yes.

352
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,030
- You can leave now.
- Yes, sir.

353
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,600
 Cheonha Telecom Youth Support Project
  Contest Report

354
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,860
It's me, Manager Han.

355
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,280
 Kim Chan Il

356
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,400
 Cheonha Telecom CEO Kim Chan Il. "We must raise  customer satisfaction in communication services"

357
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,640
 Cheonha Telecom CEO Kim Chan Il.

358
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,540
 Kim Chan Il. he's with Cheonha Telecom this time.

359
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,910
 However, he will lure Moon Seong Hwan and transfer to Jeil Telecom soon.

360
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,110
 He will make HaHaTalk a success, gaining wealth and fame.

361
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,200
 That's our staff member break room.

362
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,110
 Jeil Telecom

363
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,060
 This sculpture is quite unique.

364
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,450
 Yes, it represents that everything comes from this egg.

365
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:32,940
 Kim Chan Il, who was an industrial spy and a minion of Jo Tae Seop.

366
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,810
 Yes, the wish that everything will be awakened from an egg and built.

367
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,130
 Yes.

368
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,220
 Let me show you the research lab.

369
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,690
 Yes,

370
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,620
 we must awaken from the egg to break into the new world.

371
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,480
 Hello?

372
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,390
 What?!

373
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,760
 Don't leave a single thing.

374
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,080
 How dare you search my office!? Who the hell are you?!

375
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,150
 I'm going to ruin all of you! You bastards!

376
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,250
 Who is it? Hey! It's you, right?

377
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,270
 He was known as the hyena of the business world and did not hesitate to be violent or use dirty methods.

378
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:21,730
 He was a criminal who sold core communication technology and manpower to foreign countries.

379
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,390
 Mr. Kim Chan Il. Release him.

380
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,050
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

381
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:33,740
 In addition to the violation of the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes Act, I'm adding obstruction of official business.

382
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,940
 Ah! So it's you.

383
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,120
 You bastard! Who do you think you are?

384
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,810
 Hey! Ow!

385
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,640
 Hey, are you confident that you could take me?

386
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,550
 Yes. Of course.

387
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:52,990
 I would have added a few more years to his sentence if I had known the truth behind HaHa Talk.

388
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,680
 Kim Chan Il, this time I'll be a little faster

389
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,350
 to stamp you out completely.

390
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,010
 Sunbaenim is looking for you.

391
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,340
 The guest is coming in.

392
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,610
Sunbaenim, how do you do?

393
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,670
Oh, it's been a while.  Come and sit.

394
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,340
Sorry, I'm late.

395
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,900
Hui Wu, have a seat.

396
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,600
 He's already drunk even though it's early in the evening.

397
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,760
I just wanted to have a drink with you guys.

398
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,810
I'll come running to you if you call me, except on my funeral day.

399
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:35,760
Then, I'll come running to you even if I become a ghost after death.

400
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,880
You bastard!

401
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,230
Did I overdo it?

402
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:43,670
Hey... I guess this was why I wanted to see you guys.

403
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:51,540
Okay. Kang Jin, you must be a little more relaxed since you passed the bar exam.

404
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,360
Hui Wu, how are you doing?

405
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,610
Well, I'm working hard so I can meet your expectations.

406
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:02,690
Okay. There's no reason for you not to succeed when you're working so hard.

407
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,120
What? Did something bad happen?

408
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,670
It's nothing bad. It's just nothing good either.

409
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:15,650
Hey. How come my presence in the prosecutor's office keeps getting smaller?

410
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:20,470
I don't believe that. You were at the top when you were in the training institute.

411
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,800
Case.

412
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,540
Case.

413
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,150
I have no cases.

414
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:31,120
How long do I have to keep arresting small criminals and worry about how many months I should put them in jail for?

415
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,140
How long do I have to be concerned with such things?

416
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,850
No big cases are coming my way.

417
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,620
Even the great Jang Il Hyeon had a rookie period like that.

418
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,900
A big case, huh?

419
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,500
 A world-leading company
  Cheonha Telecom

420
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,090
Okay!

421
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:06,260
I'll prepare the greatest feast for him to enjoy.

422
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,940
- Here.
 - Yes.

423
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,690
What is this?  HaHa Talk project?

424
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:18,190
- Yes. It's a project created by a Min Su's friend. Take a look.
 - Oh...

425
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,060
You came all this way to give me this?

426
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,360
Yes. I want to know your thoughts.

427
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,740
- At this hour?
 - Yes.

428
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,430
- Is there no other reason?
- No.

429
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,680
Usually, people meet for personal reasons at a time like this.

430
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,820
I’m usually studying at this hour.

431
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,390
Right.

432
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,370
 HaHaTalk Startup Overview

433
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,630
Hey. This person is full of potential.

434
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,440
He's categorically a genius.

435
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
A genius even?

436
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,420
In my opinion, yes.

437
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,560
This may be just the beginning, but you can solve way more problems with this thing than you think.

438
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,780
You could say it's enough to dominate that market?

439
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:16,070
No, it could even monopolize it depending on the speed.

440
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,620
 I knew she would see the potential of this.

441
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,670
I've been carrying such an important thing so precariously.

442
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,580
Right?

443
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,220
But why are you...

444
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,570
I heard he applied for the Cheonha Telecom project contest.

445
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,510
- Cheonha Telecom?
 - Yes.

446
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:41,180
They must've seen the potential. The CEO called him to meet him in person.

447
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,780
Is that so?

448
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,590
If it's someone who's smart, I bet their eyes would spin the moment they saw him.

449
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,830
I knew it was a great idea to ask you.

450
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,000
Good! Then take this home and have a good look at it.

451
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,170
Okay.  Well, I also have someone I want to show this to.

452
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,980
Alright, counting on you!

453
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,000
I got your report.

454
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,310
It's a serious project that's worth keeping an eye on.

455
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:20,980
The Cheonha economy research team's prediction was never wrong. So what?

456
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,230
Why don't you take this program?

457
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:30,040
It will be of great help in the creation of your government. It would also be a good foundation for controlling the company.

458
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,770
Stop beating around the bush.

459
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,530
I'll take this one in my pocket.

460
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:39,270
And, I'll go to Jeil Telecom.

461
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:47,230
I guess Cheonha Telecom has been dominant in global telecommunication for too long.

462
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,320
They don't see the virtue in a win-win situation.

463
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,110
Cheonha Group's motto is 'The more you have, the more you want.'

464
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,940
- Should I start the process?
 - There shouldn't be any noise about this.

465
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,210
Okay, I'll get it done precisely and quietly.

466
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,510
You may leave.

467
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,850
Yes, sir.

468
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,560
Let's go.

469
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,490
HaHaTalk?

470
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,540
This will become quite an item.

471
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,060
 Try this.

472
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,670
My goodness, this is for two people. A serving for two people that feels like it's actually for five people.

473
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,660
I don't think it'll be enough for you, so let me know if you need–

474
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,550
Father! I'm sorry for being late.

475
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,510
You said you had an important meeting, how'd you get here so quickly?

476
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,710
I had to come quickly. Today is a historical day.

477
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,720
They call people like you a filial son!

478
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,330
What are you doing? Don't you see it's crowded with customers?

479
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,380
But, isn't this too much for an opening day? It's a huge success.

480
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,430
Set up some more ingredients in the kitchen when it gets less crowded.

481
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,450
We're already out of ingredients?

482
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,540
My goodness, I'm so very excited right now.

483
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,940
Our golden braised chicken recipe that could've just rotted in our Kim family, is finally debuting into the world.

484
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,320
You're funny. Why is that your recipe? It's my family's recipe that's been handed down since my grandmother.

485
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,190
Hey, hey, red pepper paste from father, soy sauce from mother. What a great collaborative fusion recipe! Right?

486
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:17,490
We're such a great married couple. You married so well. Congratulations for meeting such a cool man.

487
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,990
- Thank you.
- Let's go to work.
 - Excuse me!

488
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,190
Yes, coming!

489
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,480
- Excuse me!
- Yes.

490
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,040
- Three more portions, please.
- Yes, I'll bring them.

491
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,660
 Excuse me! Over here!

492
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,660
 Okay. Yes!

493
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,720
- I have an early meeting, so I'll leave first.
- All right.

494
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,490
I also have an early class. So I'll head out too.

495
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,400
See you later, guys.

496
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,580
What?

497
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,560
I have something to tell you.

498
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,230
What it is?

499
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,550
I have a great business item. May I talk about it?

500
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,330
I think it'll bring a huge boon to our company.

501
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:17,400
It's called HaHaTalk. A senior from our medical school created this communication platform.

502
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,950
It precisely targets the emerging smart phone world.

503
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:25,920
You know that, right? That this will take the place of computers in the future?

504
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,770
How can that help our company?

505
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,500
Listen carefully. A huge amount of people's information will be gathered through that platform.

506
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:43,490
Then, we can use that to analyze consumers' tendencies, and also plan a surefire strategy for the future.

507
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,130
Don't you think it'll be helpful in various ways?

508
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,580
But that Sunbae applied to the Cheonha Telecom

509
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,950
Youth Support program with that platform.

510
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:58,330
We can't give extra points for acquaintances. I'm sure you're aware.

511
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:03,230
Of course. I'm telling you because I heard President Kim contacted him already.

512
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,650
Wait, he contacted him personally?

513
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:11,560
They have an appointment to meet soon.

514
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:26,910
I mean, who could've imagined that such a young person was planning such a platform?

515
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,970
Let me be straight with you.

516
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,870
I think this won't work for the contest.

517
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:40,250
- Excuse me?
 - Then why do you think I asked to meet with you?

518
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,940
You lost sleep, couldn't eat properly,

519
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,480
and toiled endlessly to make this,

520
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,130
but now you're out of development money, and you're at the edge of it all.

521
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:55,370
That's a common problem amongst startup developers.

522
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,280
So...

523
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,170
I'm considering a proposal for you.

524
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:06,590
I'll help you receive investments from Jeil Telecom.

525
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:10,200
Sorry? But you're with Cheonha Telecom–

526
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,930
No, no. Even if I'm the CEO, I'm just an employee.

527
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:20,210
Cheonha's methods are outdated. They don't understand this kind of new platform at all.

528
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:23,360
However, Jeil is different.

529
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:29,850
Mr. Moon Seong Hwan, look at the big picture. The influence your talent will have.

530
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:36,570
If you think beyond the terms of the company, the nation, and even mankind as a whole, then the company name doesn't matter.

531
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:42,290
And right now, it's more important that you acquire a steady development fund.

532
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,080
Yes... but...

533
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,630
However, there's one condition.

534
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,950
Since we will invest huge amounts of money without holding back,

535
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:59,050
you must share the development process of HaHaTalk.

536
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,380
Let's work together. It's an opportunity that won't come again.

537
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,650
Seong Hwan!

538
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,540
Okay.

539
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,220
Do you have what I asked you for?

540
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,860
Here.

541
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,580
Min Su said I should take precautions.

542
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,970
Good job.

543
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,440
I said I'd think about it like you told me to.

544
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,040
But... what should I do now?

545
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,170
Are you aware of wisdom property rights...

546
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,820
I mean, intellectual property rights?

547
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,940
Yes.

548
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:59,010
Intellectual property rights are organized into four categories including patents, trademarks, design rights, and copyrights.

549
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,440
Because you have to get exclusivity as soon as possible, we have to focus on patenting it.

550
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,370
If either Cheonha Telecom or Jeil Telecom is interested in HaHaTalk, there are only two things they can do.

551
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:16,340
First, they invest a lot of their capital and manpower to create something similar,

552
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:21,480
or they steal yours by any means necessary.

553
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:26,110
The only way to fight with them right now is head-on.

554
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:32,210
So, you go ahead and try to finish your project as soon as possible, and we'll hurry up on patenting it in the meantime.

555
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,630
Okay.

556
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,560
- Good. Make sure there are no problems in opening Smile Talk over the next month.
 - Yes, sir.

557
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,710
How's the navigation app development going?

558
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,950
Well, we're in the process of discussing with the developer so...

559
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:49,250
So, how long do we have to wait until we can release it?

560
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:53,050
Four... about three months...

561
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,230
- Next month.
 - That's...

562
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,680
Hey, it must not come out later than S Map. Do you hear me?

563
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,870
Yes. I understand.

564
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,610
Next. What about 'Thunder Sand'?

565
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:08,710
We got the source code from the developer and deposited the money to his wife's account.

566
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:15,340
See? People have no morals or anything when it comes to money. Moon Seong Hwan should've been like this!

567
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:19,260
We're planning to release it in 15 days. They're planning it for next month.

568
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,880
Good job. You should learn something from him, you fool! Damn it!

569
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,670
 Law Firm

570
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:30,070
This law firm specializes in Cheonha Group lawsuits, though.

571
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:35,890
Didn't you know? This is the best law firm in Korea when it comes to patents.

572
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,620
I know, but it feels unsettling that it's here of all places.

573
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:43,550
Hello! Sorry, you've had to wait.

574
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,070
I’m the associate attorney,  Hwang Seon Ham.

575
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:52,000
Hello, sunbaenim! I'm a student at Hankuk University School of Law, Kim Hui Wu.

576
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,400
I'm Lee Min Su of the same department.

577
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,960
Oh, then... that makes you my juniors.

578
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,550
Nice to meet you. Sit, sit.

579
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,420
So, how can I help you?

580
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,400
It's just that one of the sunbaes I know developed this program,

581
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,860
and I have many questions related to patent registration.

582
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,330
Patent? What is it?

583
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,510
 HaHaTalk Project

584
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,760
This here. It's called HaHaTalk.

585
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,800
It's a program that makes communication possible by using the data between users.

586
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,220
Oh, I see.

587
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,080
Cheonha Telecom CEO contacted us about it too.

588
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,860
Really?!

589
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,120
If you look here, in the future...

590
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,690
Really? Is that so?

591
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,000
Thank you, Lawyer Hwang. Let's meet up for a meal soon.

592
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,390
Okay, go ahead. No, no, you go ahead. Okay.

593
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,040
Kids these days grow up without getting beat up enough.

594
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,580
Hey, get in here!

595
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,280
Did you call for me, sir?

596
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,530
Wasn't there an errand center that did cleanup jobs for us before?

597
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,790
Kim Hui Wu, did you visit the law firm to...

598
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,010
Yes. I went there to stir up Kim Chan Il.

599
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,770
People make mistakes when they get hasty.

600
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,710
Use the enemy instead of avoiding them?

601
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,380
- Exactly.
 - You have a knack for strategizing. You're ready for the army.

602
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:25,130
How could you say something so dreadful? How could I go back there... again?

603
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,780
What? What's wrong? You went already?

604
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,970
I have to go, of course.

605
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,420
Stop talking about useless stuff and focus on the job, please.

606
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,860
Why are you annoyed? Do you want to eat  Ppogeul-i later?
  (Ramen cooked in the packaging, often eaten in the army.)

607
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,850
Ppogeul-i my ass!

608
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,320
Hui Ah told me something quite interesting a little while ago.

609
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,780
She said that HaHaTalk, an app created by one of her seniors would change the world.

610
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,680
Really? How?

611
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,860
She said that a lot of people would put their information up on that platform.

612
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,020
She says it could be used to plan for a surefire victory.

613
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,730
Hui Ah is quite clever.

614
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,340
Yes. She is very intelligent.

615
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,950
- But, there's something strange too.
 - Something strange?

616
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,320
It was submitted to the Cheonha Telecommunications Contest,

617
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,860
but President Kim Chan Il personally reached out to the app developer,

618
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,380
even though he's the person who should be the most impartial.

619
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,640
I made him the president of Chunha Telecommunications because of your recommendation.

620
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,050
But, he's changed a lot.

621
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,050
I thought he was a useful person.

622
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,190
It looks like I chose the wrong person.

623
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:50,170
Since you said that, let's get to the point.

624
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,380
Here it is, sunbaenim.

625
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,710
- Is this for real?
 -Yes.

626
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,260
It's evidence that Chunha Telecommunications used ruthless tactics

627
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:05,560
to steal the software developed by one of the contestants.

628
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,580
If you look here, you'll see what was captured on surveillance footage.

629
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,260
You can probably learn a lot from this investigation.

630
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,680
- Of course! There are a lot of problems here.
 - Yes.

631
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,630
This is evidence that these national competitions are not transparent.

632
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,670
This is a big crime even for President Kim Chan Il.

633
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:28,300
- Of course, it is.
 - Anyway, thank you.

634
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,560
Infringement on intellectual property and abuses by executives of large corporations

635
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,030
along with unfair contest practices and industrial espionage.

636
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,820
Wow, this could turn out to be a big scandal.

637
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:44,210
And if we find evidence of patent infringement on top, the case will be huge.

638
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:48,710
Exactly. Of course, you would be able to see the big picture.

639
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,660
This kind of thing is probably happening all of the time at these kinds of companies.

640
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,400
Of course. Exactly that.

641
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,650
After raising the issue with Cheonha Telecom,

642
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,900
demand an extensive inspection of large corporations.

643
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:07,390
- It's a good picture.
 - As usual, I'm glad I came to you with this.

644
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:14,110
And, I don't know if I should tell you this...

645
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,920
Is there more?

646
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,170
I heard a rumor while investigating President Kim Chan Il.

647
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:28,760
Kim Chan Il and Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop have some sort of relationship.

648
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,340
What did you say?

649
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,190
Jo Tae Seop is on the National Assembly of Sciences, Technology, Information Broadcasting, and Communications committee

650
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:38,870
to give Cheonha Telecommunications special treatment.

651
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,350
- Really?
 - Yes.

652
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,510
Are you really saying there is some dirt on Jo Tae Seop right now?

653
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:47,970
The reason that Kim Chan Il is going around running his mouth

654
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,290
is probably because he is immature.

655
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,830
From Assemblyman Jo's point of view, this is probably going to be quite the headache.

656
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,720
Hold on.

657
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:03,400
This case is huge. If I resolve this well, I'll definitely get recognized by my superiors.

658
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,400
I mean, aren't IT-related cases especially sensitive nowadays?

659
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,000
Of course.

660
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:12,120
Hey! Kim Hui Wu.

661
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,880
- You did a surprisingly good job. Thank you.
 - Not at all.

662
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:22,300
I'm satisfied with just helping you advance in your career a tiny bit.

663
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,810
Of course. You're truly like a little brother to me.

664
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:32,220
Hey! When this case ends, let's meet with Kang Jin!

665
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,220
Let's go somewhere nice and celebrate for the whole night.

666
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,660
Of course. Let me know when.

667
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,050
- It's over. They're all dead.
  - I wish you the best, Sunbaenim!

668
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,890
Okay. I understand. This...

669
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,870
- needs to be handled quietly.
 - I'll leave no room for errors.

670
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,370
Good.

671
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,360
Assemblyman, it's President Kim Seok Hun.

672
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,700
- Yes, it's me.
 -  Hello Assemblyman.

673
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,370
President Kim Chan Il has been charged with unfair contest practices, infringement of intellectual property

674
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:40,600
and industrial espionage by the prosecutor's office.

675
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,600
It looks like he even went as far as to sell your support of him.

676
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,480
I know. I'll take care of it.

677
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,800
Things are getting interesting.

678
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,710
Kim Geon Yeong only caught a scent of it, but the information made it all the way to the prosecutor's office.

679
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:00,650
Who's the one behind all of this? Who?

680
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,520
I'll make preparations.

681
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,000
- Do it quietly.
 - Yes.

682
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,380
Hold on. Chief Kim, you take care of this.

683
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,790
Okay. I understand.

684
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,750
It's getting noisy.

685
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:31,160
 The person who benefitted most from HaHaTalk in the past life was Jo Tae Seop.

686
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,090
  As long as HaHaTalk can't find the right investors,

687
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:38,490
 it can always fall prey to Jo Tae Seop.

688
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,510
 Nara Bank

689
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:50,130
 Nara Bank
  Wu Yong Su

690
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,400
You called me at the crack of dawn and this is where you wanted to meet?

691
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,310
Teacher, you don't like exercise, right?

692
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:14,720
I'd rather read another newspaper if I had time to spare.

693
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,200
From now on, let's work out in the morning together!

694
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,050
Why are you like this all of a sudden?

695
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,330
I need you to live long and healthy so that

696
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,790
I can repay all the blessings that you've given me.

697
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,650
If you have something to say, say it.

698
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,390
I don't like it when you beat around the bush.

699
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,860
Teacher...

700
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:38,170
I'm thinking of investing the money you gave me in a start-up company.

701
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:42,710
It's the money that's in your pocket. Why would you ask me?

702
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:43,760
But!

703
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,330
Teacher, teacher!

704
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,780
That's all I needed.

705
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,200
You arrived just in time.

706
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,270
I've been wanting to throw a celebration party.

707
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,320
A celebration party?

708
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,450
We should spread the good news!

709
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:03,100
Oh, good news... What's that?

710
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,900
I got news from Cheonhwa!

711
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,440
And it was from Chairman Kim Geon Yeong himself at that.

712
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,690
He apologized and offered to invest.

713
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,850
He said that they were preparing Cheonha Communication,

714
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:19,060
An internet company that is already separate from Telecommunication.

715
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:24,520
 I got rid of Kim Chan Il and yet... Did I fail in changing his fate?

716
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,640
Honestly, it's almost done.

717
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,700
When we invest and it succeeds, I'll make sure to pay you back.

718
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,760
As to money, you can't do anything, but ...

719
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,350
Yeah.

720
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,700
Are you going to take the deal?

721
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,040
Yes! Because it's a pretty good deal.

722
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,020
I see.

723
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,940
I am curious about something.

724
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,120
- What is it?
 - Why did you believe in me?

725
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,620
Oh, that? I had three reasons.

726
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:01,630
Number one is because CEO Kim Chan Il tried to play me like you said.

727
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,940
You were like a fortune teller!

728
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,030
 Seong Hwan!

729
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:13,880
 Be careful of CEO Kim Chan Il.

730
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,930
 If you meet him, he'll show you a disadvantageous contract and suggest Jeil Telecom instead of Cheonha.

731
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,650
 You must never... take that deal.

732
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:26,720
You should always trust a fortune teller! Ah!

733
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,220
You were also right to recommend I live here for the time being too.

734
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,540
 If I hadn't listened to you, it would've taken me months to just recover.

735
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,410
- What's the second reason?
  - Min Su!

736
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,210
- Seonbae Min Su?
 - Yes!

737
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,050
To tell you the truth, the HaHaTalk idea was Min Su's.

738
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:55,870
A world where people communicate on smartphones using the data communication function.

739
00:50:55,870 --> 00:51:00,770
Min Su told me not to tell you but I'm just telling you the truth.

740
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,750
 Seonbae Lee Min Su. Of course!

741
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,330
I said something to Min Su one time.

742
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:11,100
If I succeed with his idea, then I'd give him money!

743
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,520
But he said he didn't need money.

744
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,370
He said that he could be the richest man in the world if he just put his mind to it!

745
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:20,110
He really is a genius.

746
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,760
 Here's the chicken you fools! Come get it!

747
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,020
Anyway, congratulations!

748
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,470
- Thank you!
 - Congrats!

749
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:30,390
Thanks!

750
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:38,060
Chicken and beer are the best!

751
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:41,800
Ah! Let's continue with what we were talking about earlier.

752
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,690
- What's the third reason?
 - Ah!

753
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:48,940
I got a text right before I met with CEO Kim Chan Il.

754
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,500
Here it is.

755
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,530
Here.

756
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:58,790
I thought that it was strange so I called but some guy picked up and said that he never sent such a text message.
  Beware of President Kim Chan Il. -Pluto-

757
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,550
And...

758
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,000
Give it! What is it?

759
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,080
 'Patent war' holding back start-up companies

760
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,090
Those are all articles related to CEO Kim Chan Il.

761
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:25,000
 Who is it? Why...?

762
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:43,920
Assemblyman, why don't you move up your ranking to the next dan ( level ) now?

763
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,050
I think you've exceeded the pro first dan.

764
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:52,400
It's because you help me often.

765
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,700
I learned a lot today too.

766
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,480
Assemblyman!

767
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,300
Drag him out.

768
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,790
Let's stop here for today.

769
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:09,230
Yes sir. Well then, I'll see you again next time.

770
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,980
Please save me, Assemblyman!

771
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:21,400
You look like you've suffered a lot.

772
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,460
Don't be like that and sit down

773
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,770
Yes sir!

774
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:37,290
The two hours I spend playing baduk once a week is the only time I take a break.

775
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,040
I'm so sorry, it was an urgent matter.

776
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,550
This match is a game where I've been on the edge of losing for three weeks now.

777
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:47,030
I like the phrase "Too big to fail."

778
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:51,910
Even if the sky falls, there's always a way to survive.

779
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,830
Thank you, Assemblyman.

780
00:53:53,830 --> 00:54:00,680
However, if there's a Gonma early on, it must be abandoned.
  (Gonma: a term in go, a stone that's hard to save.)

781
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,980
A player needs to see the big picture.

782
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,250
The moment you get tied up in a stone that's hard to save, your whole game will be in danger.

783
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:13,170
Assemblyman, please, just give me one, one more chance–

784
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:22,830
Thanks to you, I got an excellent idea. This was the move.

785
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,600
- Assemblyman!
 - Manager Han.

786
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,630
Let him out.

787
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,780
Assemblyman... Assemblyman, just one more...

788
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,070
one more chance, please–

789
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,690
 A dog who betrayed you once won't have trouble doing it again.

790
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:07,190
 So I would like to make a suggestion.

791
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:08,380
 Go ahead.

792
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:13,320
 Why don't you just get rid of a dog without the basics, and work with me?

793
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,810
 Cheonha should lead the communication industry, not Jeil.

794
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:22,070
 I hope you would support Cheonha more with this opportunity.

795
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:26,190
 If you give me a positive answer, the talk we had about Mirae Automobiles earlier...

796
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:30,770
 I'll consider it in a positive way.

797
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:34,160
Yes. I'll relay your message.

798
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,430
Assemblyman, we got a call from Chairman Kim Geon Yeong's office.

799
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:47,880
He made an agreement to work with Moon Seong Hwan with HahaTalk.

800
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,990
Good. That was a long way around.

801
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:55,920
The uncomfortable situation with Cheonha is now back under my control.

802
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:00,750
Now, I just hope it all ends well.

803
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:05,260
Why is it taking him so long to buy some drinks?!

804
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,980
He left ten minutes ago to buy it. You're so impatient!

805
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:12,420
I know right. Why am I so impatient?

806
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:15,490
Hurry, turn on the TV!

807
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,320
The TV?

808
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,540
Why what's wrong?

809
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:26,700
 This just in. The CEO of Cheonha Telecom Kim Chan Il has killed himself by jumping off a building.

810
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:31,890
 CEO Kim Chan Il threw himself off of a building in Haero-gu, Seoul.

811
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:35,060
- What is this?
  CEO Kim was taken to Seoul Yeongil hospital

812
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,220
 right after he was found and received CPR...

813
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:42,670
 Due to Kim Chan Il's death, this case has no right of prosecution. It's done.
  but he wasn't able to...

814
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:46,390
 Jo Tae Seop has cut off the tail.

815
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,980
 Completely.

816
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:55,090
 Pluto?

817
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,540
- Homework?
 - Yes.

818
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:07,400
It's so fun learning mythology after always looking at law books.

819
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:12,550
Are you also reading Greek or Roman mythology?

820
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:13,830
No, why?

821
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:18,040
Pluto, that's another name of the god of death, Hades.

822
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,950
Hades...

823
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,310
One second.

824
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,370
Yes, Seonbae?

825
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:33,740
I found him.

826
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:38,260
- Who?
 - The owner of the phone that sent a text to Seong Hwan.

827
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:43,070
He's a part time employee at a convenience store, and they borrowed his phone and sent the text.

828
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:46,130
I'm with the part-timer right now so hurry up.

829
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:49,520
We have to check it.

830
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,040
I was the fool for lending my phone over her looks.

831
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,760
I thought there was something strange about that woman.

832
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,170
- A woman?
- Yes!

833
00:57:57,170 --> 00:58:00,350
Hey! He said it was a woman! You heard right? It's a woman.

834
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:06,170
Let's see here. You said she came in after an old man who bought five bottles of rice wine, yes?

835
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,830
Yes.

836
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:17,320
Right there!

837
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,260
Right after that.

838
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,320
Is this the right girl?

839
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,940
Yes!

840
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,110
 That girl is...!

841
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:45,270
 Pluto, that's another name of the god of death, Hades.

842
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:53,810

843
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:58,170
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

844
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:01,330
♫  We are here to wreck it up  ♫

845
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:07,370
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

846
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:14,980
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

847
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,350
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

848
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:24,430
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

849
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,030

♫  Who would ever find   ♫

850
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:34,280
 Other people's destinies are changing because I was reborn.

851
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,160
  Goodbye, Kim Hui Wu.

852
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,690
 There were many cases.

853
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,900
 It's not something that'll be solved by doing that!

854
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,280
 Hello. I'm prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

855
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,380
♫  Oh let me show you how to start  ♫
