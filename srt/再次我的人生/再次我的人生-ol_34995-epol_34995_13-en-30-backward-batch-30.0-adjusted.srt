00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,040

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,880
 Lee Joon Gi

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,710
 Lee Kyung Young

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,420
 Kim Ji Eun

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,070
 Again My Life

6
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,320
- Sir!
- Just a comment, please!

7
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,430
 I brought the powerful Jo Tae Seop here

8
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,590
to show that you're nothing but a piece of garbage.

9
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,630
I am looking forward to seeing what card you will use.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,200
 I have done the job.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,970
 I will take care of it as instructed.

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,480
 If you have another life, will you use it to catch Jo Tae Seop again?

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,280
 Promise me.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,410
 Can you show him hell?

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,920
 My life began again to catch that person.

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,930
Hey!

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,970
Always the same tactics...

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,050
It's old now. It's boring.

19
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,290
Who are you?

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,410
Is that important right now?

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,490
I asked who you are.

22
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,850
Someone who knows you too well.

23
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,830
Have we met before?

24
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,190
Yes.

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,150
And...

26
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,670
I died at your hands.

27
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,280
You have the wrong person.

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,880
I have never failed before.

29
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,050
You're right. You didn't fail.

30
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,280
I just resurrected like a miracle.

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,670
I was so angry at how unfair it was

32
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,240
that I even managed to avoid death.

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,450
Sounds interesting.

34
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,080
Then try to avoid it this time, too.

35
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,980
Are you stupid?

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,290
I wouldn't have interfered then, you bastard!

37
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,490
♫  Hey, you're so cold. That evil leer  ♫

38
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,260
♫  You clearly intend something nasty  ♫

39
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,620
♫  Lie lie lie gradually it will come out  ♫

40
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,550
♫  Standing up, Standing up, Standing up  ♫

41
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,160
♫  What kind of gang came at me?  ♫

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,330
 I can't lose twice.

43
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,330
♫  wait just for me  ♫

44
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,240
♫  Even if you fool everyone else  ♫

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,390
 I can see it now.

46
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,960
 Got it.

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,130
 I think I can do this.

48
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,270
 As expected, he is strong.

49
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,280
Do you work out?

50
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,080
A little.

51
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,450
To be honest, I'm shocked. This is the first time I've been so flustered.

52
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,040
Right?

53
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,350
I feel like I have fought with you hundreds of times.

54
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,180
You will soon be more shocked.

55
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,640
A fight is different from a competition.

56
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,880
You talk too much.

57
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,330
Come on then.

58
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,010
You cowardly bastard. That's cheating.

59
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,940
I already told you that a fight is different from a competition.

60
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,840
Fine.

61
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,430
I will give you a proper lesson today.

62
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,020
You lucked out.

63
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,720
Hyeong Hui Wu. Hyeong Hui Wu! Are you all right?

64
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,550
That black-suited scumbag!

65
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,000
What about Seung Hyeok?

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,550
Prosecutor Gu?

67
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,140
Seung Hyeok!

68
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,910
Prosecutor Gu!

69
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,490
Seung Hyeok!

70
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,170
- Are you alright?
 - Yeah, I am.

71
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,930
Sang Man, we should rush to the hospital.

72
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,520
Okay, Hyeong. I'll go bring the car.

73
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,840
Okay.

74
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,090
- Hey, can you stand up?
 - Yeah.

75
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,320
Let's go.

76
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,940
Try some of this.

77
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,150
 Episode 13

78
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,970
Are you hurting anywhere else?

79
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,870
No, I am alright.

80
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,930
Punk...

81
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,610
Hey, Gu Seung Hyeok.

82
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,370
Seonbae.

83
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,180
Are you alright?

84
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,030
Thank God. Look at his face. It's a mess.

85
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,160
A mess?

86
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,110
It's just a figure of speech.

87
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,780
But, only one rib is fractured. Everything else is fine.

88
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,010
I might not be able to fight well, but I'm resilient.

89
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,620
What kind of bastard did this to a prosecutor?

90
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,950
You were lucky today.

91
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,980
That's right. He wasn't a petty gangster.

92
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,770
While I was getting beaten by him, I really thought I could die.

93
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,610
I'll ask the police to cooperate.

94
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,360
Let's check out the CCTV immediately and identify the—

95
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,070
Wait.

96
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,390
Could the two of you step out for a moment?

97
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,520
Sure.

98
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,730
What do you want to say?

99
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,580
Are you asking us to back down?

100
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,930
Yes.

101
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,430
Gyu Ri, you go to the District Prosecutor's Office and release Kim Yeong Il immediately.

102
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,020
From this moment on, you both stay away from the JQ Construction case.

103
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,320
- Hey, Kim Hui Wu!
 - What are you saying?

104
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,910
You want us to stop because of a thug?

105
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,940
Yeah. It would be even better to say you stopped because you were scared.

106
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,190
- Hey!
 - Hey!

107
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,390
Kim Gyu Ri. Gu Seung Hyeok.

108
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,390
You guys trust me and back off.

109
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,000
I promise I will finish off this case.

110
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,680
Do me the favor.

111
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,190
Please?

112
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,580
 Again My Life

113
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,420
I am looking forward to the prosecution you will build.

114
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,250
I will never forget this favor.

115
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,190
But sir,

116
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,600
I am really sorry,

117
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,620
but I want to ask you something.

118
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,680
The one who told you about the Bando Bank investigation,

119
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,200
was it Kim Hui Wu?

120
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,220
Kim Hui Wu ...

121
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,170
He is a capable prosecutor. He is quick-witted and skilled.

122
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,980
Unlike others of his age, he has good judgment skills.

123
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,390
I guess that's why you got it wrong.

124
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,100
Did you think I wouldn't be able to see through him?

125
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,780
I must have looked lax.

126
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:05,010
If you are in my position, you see a lot. You also might hear a lot.

127
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,400
Your thoughts and actions are no exception.

128
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,450
I am sorry.

129
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,320
That's alright.

130
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,820
- Do well from now on.
 - Yes, sir.

131
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,080
 Sir.

132
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,540
Yes.

133
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,830
- Then I will get going now.
 - All right.

134
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,110
What's the matter?

135
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,200
- He failed.
 - Failed?

136
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,230
Someone intervened, and the police showed up.

137
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,570
We are checking all the CCTV from around that area.

138
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,380
Sir, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu wants to meet with you right now.

139
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,230
- Kim Hui Wu?
 -  Yes.

140
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,330
- Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu is here.
 - Come in.

141
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,720
I am sorry for coming so late at night.

142
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,280
- Is there a problem?
 - Yes.

143
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,170
What is it?

144
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,010
I had a fight.

145
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,900
- Fight?
 - Yes.

146
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,270
The Prosecutor who arrested JQ Construction's Managing Director Kim Yeong Il is my colleague.

147
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,470
When I went to convince him to drop the case, I met an unidentified assailant.

148
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,300
- Assailant?
 -  Yes.

149
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,590
So you fought that assailant?

150
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,370
Yes, sir.

151
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,850
Did you manage to convince your colleague?

152
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,430
Yes. I'll have Kim Yeong Il released by the end of the night.

153
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,480
Both prosecutors have decided to stay out of this case too.

154
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,910
Is that why you came to see me?

155
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,440
No.

156
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,940
I came to hear your opinion.

157
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,110
My opinion?

158
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:18,790
Yes. I was taught that a prosecutor should always question everything.

159
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,580
And?

160
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,880
It's an assault case involving a prosecutor.

161
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,440
Obviously, I'm going to go after that assailant from this point on.

162
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,960
But, all of a sudden a thought crossed my mind.

163
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,670
That perhaps the assailant

164
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,000
could be one of your people.

165
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,580
What?

166
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,310
I apologize if I'm mistaken.

167
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,070
But, I wanted to make sure

168
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,140
and receive instructions before taking action.

169
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,390
Whether I can go after that assailant,

170
00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:00,550
or if I should just cover it up.

171
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,380
I'll do as you say.

172
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,160
Don't go after him.

173
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,400
Can I take this to mean that he is one of your people?

174
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,630
You're still young.

175
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,640
It just means that I'll take care of him myself. Understand?

176
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,650
I understand. I will follow your instructions.

177
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,860
You seem very tired. Go home and rest.

178
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,550
Yes, sir.

179
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,060
Kim Seok Hun will be the next prosecutor general.

180
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,700
Will you be okay? The person you're trying to take down will be the next prosecutor general.

181
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,810
If you made that decision, I will trust your judgment.

182
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,690
- Is that right?
 - Yes.

183
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,380
Your faith in me and your hard work so far,

184
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,790
I would like to repay you this time. Tell me what you would like.

185
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,090
- I'm okay.
 - You're okay?

186
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,520
I understand. You can leave.

187
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,000
- Hi Gyu Ri.
 - I let Kim Yeong Il go.

188
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,330
Thank you for believing in me.

189
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,100
Make sure your plan works.

190
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,910
I will.

191
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,780
I understand.

192
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,930
Kim Yeong Il has been released.

193
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,660
Really?

194
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,010
What do you think of Kim Hui Wu?

195
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,350
He seems to have a tendency to succeed in whatever goals he sets.

196
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,810
I like him.

197
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:27,410
The people who seek me out tend to make a lot of noise.

198
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,760
Whining and asking me to solve their problems.

199
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,180
But Kim Hui Wu isn't like that.

200
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,220
He brings me solutions. But something is bothering me.

201
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,370
He doesn't want anything.

202
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,120
He is a young prosecutor. He's not old enough to be able to discriminate between good and bad.

203
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,160
At his age, one should have ambition and aspiration.

204
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,460
He came out on top from the training center, and by looking at all the cases he's been involved in so far,

205
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,040
he's unusual.

206
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,690
That's not all. He figured out my relationship with Park Dae Ho and Bando Bank.

207
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,170
He also figured out that I sent the assailant.

208
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,720
Sometimes, he catches me off guard. He's remarkable.

209
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,420
He also knows he is great.

210
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,230
But, he doesn't want anything?

211
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,370
- Secretary Kim.
 - Yes, sir.

212
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,400
Pick someone who can keep Kim Hui Wu in check.

213
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,280
- Someone skilled and unique from inside the prosecution.
 - Yes, sir.

214
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,590
Those at the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office who backed off, leave them alone.

215
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,680
Yes, sir.

216
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,140
 Daily Newspaper.

217
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,020
 'Principles and Integrity' Kim Seok Hun, Candidate for Prosecutor General.

218
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,590
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Chief Kim Seok Hun

219
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,090
 Don't worry about your son's problem. I will take care of it.

220
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,270
 Get rid of Yun Jong Gi, who is blocking your path.

221
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,130
Come in.

222
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,990
Did you call for me?

223
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,260
- The Bando Bank Investigation. Shut it down.
 - What?

224
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,610
The opponent has figured it out. It's meaningless now.

225
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,260
Yes, sir.

226
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:20,030
I will give you a new target. Your planning skills will be more than enough.

227
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:24,260
Get him. Eastern District Chief Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi.

228
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,790
- Got it?
 - Yes.

229
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,520
- Get started.
 - Yes, sir.

230
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,350
 Chief Director of Prosecutors' Office
 Chief Director Kim Seok Hun.

231
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,070
It's me.

232
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,160
You want to bring down Kim Seok Hun?

233
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,790
Yes.

234
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,800
How?

235
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,830
 Loan Agreement

236
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,700
- This is...
 -  Yes.

237
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:29,550
It's the illegal loan file of Kim Seok Hun's son, JQ Construction's Executive Director Kim Yeong Il and the Bando Bank.

238
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:34,190
It's a card I can't use at the Prosecutors' Office, but I think it's different in political circles.

239
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,850
- Do you want to expose it?
 - No.

240
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,690
Please persuade CEO Kim Jeong Taek.

241
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,810
Persuade him...

242
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:47,130
Will CEO Kim Jeong Taek use this to hold Kim Seok Hun back?

243
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,890
The general election is around the corner.

244
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,960
Nobody knows what kind of variables will come up.

245
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,700
Although he is the leader of the weak opposition party, Kim Jeong Taek already got a taste for power.

246
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,320
He might aim for something more.

247
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,990
For now, just persuade him.

248
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,920
Please do me that favor, sir.

249
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,770
Okay.

250
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,980
 I am sorry.

251
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,770
 I cannot tell you everything yet.

252
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,920
 That Kim Seok Hun is the bait and the target is Kim Jeong Taek.

253
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:38,320
 In my prior life, Kim Jeong Taek was eliminated brutally by Jo Tae Seop.

254
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,230
 After his arrest on a charge of defamation, Great Korea Party head Kim Jeong Taek,

255
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,640
 who accused JQ Construction's Executive Director Kim Yeong Il

256
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,660
 and Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop as being behind  Bando Bank's illegal loan case,

257
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,690
  resigned from politics.

258
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,380
 For causing concern among the public by spreading incorrect information,

259
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,020
 I humbly apologize.

260
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,910
 I, Kim Jeong Taek, will go back to being a citizen from now on.

261
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,790
 Thank you so much for sending so much support and love till now.

262
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,190
 Kim Jeong Taek, former head of Great Korea Party.

263
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,500
 A bridgehead to eliminate Kim Jeong Taek was made.

264
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,630
 Bando Bank's Loan to JQ Construction, Related Documents

265
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,170
 Daehan Party

266
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,890
 A Better Korea

267
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,370
Is this all true?

268
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,860
Everything is factual.

269
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,050
If you find it suspicious, check it with the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.

270
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:37,390
But... why are you giving this to me?

271
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,260
How long are you going to act as Jo Tae Seop's puppet?

272
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,010
How long are you going to be a puppet for the ruling party?

273
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,760
How much has our Daehan Party faced because of Jo Tae Seop, till now?

274
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,590
During the sexual favors scandal, all the assemblymen in the Democratic Party went unscathed

275
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,660
but in our party, two assemblymen lost their positions.

276
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:04,350
Jo Tae Seop has already decided unofficially on Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun as Prosecutor General.

277
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,770
Of course, he's already finished talking with the members of the legislative judiciary committee.

278
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,590
Besides the Assembly, he's trying to gain command of even the Prosecution Service.

279
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,450
We must stop him.

280
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,330
Before the general elections, through Kim Seok Hun, we will reveal flaws in the ruling party.

281
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:25,390
Using that momentum, if we show that the ruling party is a corrupt group,

282
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,520
we can even claim the majority.

283
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:39,960
Assemblyman Hwang, please stop digging up dirt on other people and instead take care of the public welfare.

284
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,970
If you don't, during this party nomination, you cannot be assured of your district.

285
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,180
 Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop

286
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,900
 Great Korea Party
 A Better Korea

287
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,680
Could you excuse me? It's an important call.

288
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,510
Yes, sir.

289
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,470
Ah, I understand.

290
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,650
 Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong

291
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,100
- Yes, sir.
- I've conveyed it to Minority Leader Kim Jeong Taek.

292
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,550
But I don't think he's convinced.

293
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,810
I understand. Thank you for your efforts.

294
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,460
 The wind will start picking up now.

295
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,630
 Have you been well, Minority Leader Kim? You look good.

296
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,390
It's been a while since I last saw you.

297
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,670
Why did you want to see me?

298
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:56,140
The approaching general election. I mean the Daehan Party nominations.

299
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,000
Let you and I discuss who will make that list.

300
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,820
- Sir.
 - Minority Leader Kim.

301
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:08,130
Do you believe Korea is normal right now? Let me ask again.

302
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,820
Do you think it will become normal if it continues this way?

303
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,960
Until when must each party fight like enemies?

304
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,760
As a result of useless fights over pride, the country's competitiveness is falling behind.

305
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,250
Other countries are growing daily. What are we doing?

306
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,180
Postponing marriages, not having babies, giving up on jobs.

307
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,500
Why?

308
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,840
Because the country's assemblymen are only fighting and not doing the work they should be doing.

309
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,950
Now is the time for both parties to combine their strengths.

310
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,370
I mean that it's time for cooperation.

311
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:47,540
You and I will be opening the door to that era.

312
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,040
Toward one goal,

313
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,990
I'd like to run instead of fighting.

314
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,420
Still,

315
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,530
Daehan Party's nominations aren't something I can discuss with an assemblyman of the Democratic Party.

316
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,980
If there wasn't a problem in the first place, would I have set up a meeting like this?

317
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,550
- Manager Han.
 - Yes,  sir.

318
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,390
 Investigation Results for Kim Jeong Taek, the Leader of Daehan Party

319
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,680
Wasn't this matter already over with?

320
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,040
On the condition of not holding me accountable, I also

321
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,140
gave you the list of names of corrupt assemblymen in the People's Party that Assemblyman Hwang Jin Young obtained.

322
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,290
It was an equal trade.

323
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,360
I took action on behalf of the party,

324
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,070
and you took action in order to hide your guilt. Look at the following page.

325
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,180
You again accepted a request to select a business for government property.

326
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,450
You received 1 billion won from two local construction companies.

327
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,230
I also heard that you're making deals these days using Daehan Party's nomination rights.

328
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,220
Sir!

329
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,050
Minority Leader Kim, I, too, am someone who was a prosecutor.

330
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,380
I can't keep my eyes shut after seeing violations of the law.

331
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:11,380
Register the names for the party nominations after discussing them with me.

332
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:26,610
 Daehan Party

333
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,790
 Material regarding Bando Bank's Loan to JQ Construction

334
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,200
How are you? It's me, Kim Jeong Taek.

335
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,220
Could I see you for a moment?

336
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,830
 Material regarding Bando Bank's Loan to JQ Construction

337
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,660
How did you...?

338
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,790
Let me get straight to the point, Chief Prosecutor.

339
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,100
Let's join hands.

340
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,620
Won't the risk be too big? You must know already.

341
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,820
It could also mean that we can gain a lot if we succeed.

342
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:27,180
For you, the Prosecutor General position, and for me, it'll solidify my position.

343
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,510
It's a matter that's already been upended.

344
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,220
But it's never been made an issue of in political circles.

345
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,350
Do you mean that you will stoke the fire?

346
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,910
Yes.

347
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,780
We will bring up the truth at the start,

348
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,490
so please bring it to justice and take care of the end.

349
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,060
Then the name on the next prosecutor general's desk plate

350
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,000
 will be your name, Yun Jong Gi.

351
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,490
Is that so?

352
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:07,070
The prosecution office doesn't always have to be the one to search for the truth.

353
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:13,400
If you work hard, I shall also do my best.

354
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,120
Thank you.

355
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,350
I understand.

356
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,770
Modify the ones I've checked.

357
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:27,550
Yes, sir. I just received a call from Chairman Park Dae Ho.

358
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,850
Kim Yeong Il is holding, as a hostage, the stake in Cheonha Holdings.

359
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,600
He said he wants a business loan.

360
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,160
Tell him to deny it. Kim Seok Hun will take care of it.

361
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,050
All right.

362
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,490
- Manager Han.
 - Yes, sir.

363
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,540
It seems the three Cheonha siblings are being quiet.

364
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,200
Shall I summon Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun?

365
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,760
Just relay my greetings to him.

366
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,700
Yes, I will.

367
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,810
Director.

368
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,830
The National Tax Service's special tax investigation team went to Cheonha Electronics.

369
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,200
What?

370
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,060
Only Cheonha Electronics?  Not the other affiliates?

371
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,430
Just Cheonha Electronics.

372
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,240
They're targeting Oppa, and Jo Tae Seop is behind this.

373
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,760
It's such a sudden investigation that even people in related departments weren't aware of it.

374
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,350
So what's Oppa doing?

375
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,280
Vice Chairman Kim Yong Jun is meeting with the finance team to come up with a plan.

376
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,940
- That's not going to do it.
 - Excuse me?

377
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,980
It's a signal from Jo Tae Seop to go see him.

378
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,430
It means he is slowly going to tighten the leash.

379
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:41,490
I need to send a signal to Jo Tae Seop, too.

380
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,470
It's not going to be easy to hold onto our leashes.

381
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,210
I will do exactly what Jo Tae Seop did.

382
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:55,040
So I was so surprised when I saw her wearing that.

383
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,240
Anyway, what's the amount you urgently need?

384
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Two hundred billion won.

385
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,890
- Two hundred billion?
 - Yes.

386
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,180
I can't.  The amount is too large.

387
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,730
It would be too difficult because the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is scrutinizing corporate loans.

388
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,990
Chairman Park, that's not what we agreed on.

389
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,380
The stake in Cheonha Holdings is in my hands.

390
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,240
What do you want me to do when the FSS is watching with a spotlight on?

391
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,700
Don't even think about trying to convince me.

392
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,200
Why don't you ask your mom for some allowance?

393
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,890
Or go to those wealthy shareholders and beg on your knees.

394
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,980
It's up to you. It's your company, not mine.

395
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,860
 JQ Construction Executives:  Kim Yeong Il, Executive Director

396
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,790
 JQ Construction Trend Briefing No. 13

397
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,950
How many shares of JQ do we own?

398
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,250
About 3.4%.

399
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,660
Approach Kim Yeong Il.

400
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,260
For the amount of shares you own, he will cater to you on his knees with just one call.

401
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,570
Yes.

402
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:15,490
But, Hyeong, there's something you should know.

403
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,300
A few days ago, a big private investor appeared at JQ Construction.

404
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,040
He wiped up the shares after stock market hours, and there was nothing I could do.

405
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,260
Did you find out who it is?

406
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,870
I barely managed to get the name. Park Jong Hyeok?

407
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,390
Park Jong Hyeok...

408
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,220
Okay. He may show up tomorrow, so be on alert.

409
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,640
Yes.

410
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,600
And Yeon Seok, you're Sang Man's secretary and driver.

411
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,890
I'll be his security, too.

412
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,400
I saw on the news that sometimes fights break out.

413
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,140
All right. Make sure to look after him well.

414
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,820
 JQ Construction

415
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,040
 JQ Construction Co., Ltd. Invitational Business Briefing for Shareholders

416
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,830
Have you come for the business briefing?

417
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,850
- Yes, that's right.
 - May I have your name?

418
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,970
 It is Park Sang Man.

419
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,550
Chairman Park Sang Man.

420
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,570
I am Sin Dae Wung, Managing Director of JQ Construction.

421
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,070
Our Executive Director is waiting for you. Follow me.

422
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,570
Yes.

423
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,320
Oh, welcome.

424
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,410
Say hello. This is Executive Director Kim Yeong Il.

425
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,110
Hello. Nice to meet you, Chairman Park.

426
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,570
Yes. What is it?

427
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:29,250
 I guess they are in a rush

428
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,310
He says his father is going to become prosecutor general and he's encouraging investment.

429
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,510
So I promised investment using the shares as collateral.

430
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,840
Good.  Hang around a little before you go home.

431
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,850
Yes, Hyeong. I'll come back early. In the morning.

432
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,500
Aren't you going to work out?

433
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,360
I'm leaving right now.

434
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,880
What is this?

435
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,710
I eat it before I work out.

436
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,500
The color is intense.

437
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,690
Two at a time.

438
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,980
Here.

439
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,200
Thanks.

440
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,910
What for?  Have a nice chat.

441
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,870
But, I noticed you were pensive since earlier.

442
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:51,190
Kim Seok Hun has been nominated to be prosecutor general. It's an affront to the Prosecution Service.

443
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,800
- Are you sure?
 - I heard it from a colleague at the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.

444
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,050
We've collected so much evidence, yet, we couldn't use any of it.

445
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:02,080
The path that Kim Seok Hun travels is a bed of roses.

446
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,410
We need to make it a thorny path.

447
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,120
How?

448
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,500
I'd like to borrow some external help.

449
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,140
External help?

450
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,460
Kim Jeong Taek, the leader of Daehan Party.

451
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,660
Kim Jeong Taek?

452
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,120
Yes.

453
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,020
Politicians are good at biting into and hanging on to other people's corruption.

454
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,900
I... don't trust politicians.

455
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,270
And would that alone be enough?

456
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,990
There is a surefire solution.

457
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,170
Sir, the JQ Construction Corruption documents have reached Daehan Party Chairman Kim Jeong Taek.

458
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,400
How was it leaked?

459
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,100
I'm looking into it right now.

460
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,880
First, we checked the chief prosecutor of the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office and Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

461
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,480
It has been confirmed that they have not contacted Kim Jeong Taek or his close associates.

462
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,430
I suspect it was Yun Jong Gi, the chief prosecutor of the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.

463
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:06,350
It could also be an expression of dissatisfaction with the prosecutor general's internal affairs.

464
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,230
- Make sure to investigate fully.
 - Yes, sir.

465
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,370
Sir, Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun is here.

466
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,190
Come in.

467
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,200
Ah, yes.

468
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,070
Congratulations on being nominated Prosecutor General.

469
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,660
- Thank you.
 - Of course.

470
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:35,160
There will be a hearing soon, so prepare well.

471
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,270
I've put in a good word to the Judiciary Committee of the National Assembly.

472
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,390
If you prepare your answers well, you will pass easily.

473
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,830
Yes, I understand.

474
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,680
I will prepare well so as not to be a hindrance.

475
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,310
And be careful not to become fodder for gossip until the hearing.

476
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,460
Yes, sir.

477
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,090
And... Kim Jeong Taek.

478
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,650
Excuse me?

479
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,160
It's Kim Jeong Taek's nomination scandal. It would be  better if there's another charge.

480
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,520
Just investigate, don't prosecute.

481
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,450
I'll decide when to file the charges, so just keep that in mind.

482
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,620
Yes, I understand.

483
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,710
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

484
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,550
Come in.

485
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,960
You called for me?

486
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,680
Yes.

487
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,180
I am going to be the next prosecutor general.

488
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,120
Oh, congratulations.

489
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,780
I didn't call you to congratulate me.

490
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,010
We're nearly there.

491
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:55,530
The prosecution I've always wanted, beyond everyone's expectations. I'll be able to achieve it soon.

492
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,920
So, I have something I would like you to do.

493
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,090
Give Yun Jong Gi's case to Choi Kang Jin.

494
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,920
 Improper Nomination by Daehan Party Chairman Kim Jeong Taek

495
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,000
It's the details of the nomination scandal of Kim Jeong Taek, the leader of the Daehan Party.

496
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,740
Check the facts and find every detail on Chairman Kim Jeong Taek.

497
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,950
That is your job.

498
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,500
Yes, sir.

499
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,340
You may leave.

500
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,110
 Okay, it's Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong's turn.

501
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,250
You want me to become the party leader?

502
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,750
Yes, sir.

503
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,260
I would like you to become the leader of Daehan Party.

504
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:59,560
I don't like the sound of pushing out Kim Jeong Taek when he's done nothing wrong.

505
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,590
Please take a look at this.

506
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,460
 Daehan Party Chairman Kim Jeong Taek Improper Nomination

507
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,440
 request  for money and valuables, sexual favors

508
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,380
We can't beat Jo Tae Seop because someone like him is leading the minority party.

509
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,640
How did you get...

510
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,070
I've received orders from the chief prosecutor

511
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,870
to look into what Kim Jeong Taek has been doing

512
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,020
all these years.

513
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:50,790
I'm sure the chief prosecutor got his orders from Jo Tae Seop.

514
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:56,620
Kim Jeong Taek has started on the Bando Bank's illegal loans incident.

515
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,020
The wind that you helped create has finally started to blow.

516
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,760
Did you plan all this to make me the party leader?

517
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,750
Is that why you told me to give the file to Kim Jeong Taek?

518
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,260
Yes, sir.

519
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,500
I apologize for not telling you everything in advance.

520
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,100
I'm sorry.

521
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,850
Fine.

522
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:26,620
Then what are you going to do now?

523
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:33,480
I'm going to help Jo Tae Seop and bring down Kim Jeong Taek.

524
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,790
 I will offer him help and cut out his right hand man, Kim Seok Hun.

525
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:43,950
 Then, I will get Hwang Jin Yong appointed as the leader of the opposition party to rival Jo Tae Seop.

526
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,080
Please become the leader of the party.

527
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,810
You...

528
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:54,810
have crossed the line.

529
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:01,380
Do you like fishing?

530
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:08,990
The sun has to set and dew has to settle for fish to come out at this reservoir.

531
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:12,460
Until then, you have to keep throwing bait

532
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,980
and wait.

533
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,300
Just wait a little bit.

534
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:23,520
It'll be night soon and it will be covered in dew.

535
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,130
I apologize.

536
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,020
The trigger has already been pulled.

537
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,940
Wow! It's a big fish before the night dew.

538
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,820
You'll also be able to catch big fish at the National Assembly!

539
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,120
Oh, Sang Man. What's up?

540
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,610
Yes, Hyeong. I discovered something a little weird.

541
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:29,990
- What is it?
  - You know the big JQ Construction investor Park Jong Hyeok that we talked about last time?

542
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,090
I hacked into the system and did some investigating.

543
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,230
That person's IP address...

544
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,100
Are you sure?

545
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,290
Okay.

546
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,020
Prosecutor Kim is here.

547
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,520
Welcome, I was surprised by your sudden contact.

548
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,980
What brings you all the way here?

549
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,570
I needed to check something.

550
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,800
- Confirm?
 - Yeah.

551
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,020
I will step outside.

552
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,750
Hold on.

553
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:20,090
I would like to speak to you.

554
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,030
 Management and Strategy Chief Office

555
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:31,270
I was going to tell you at the right opportunity. You beat me to it.

556
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:37,740
I simply returned to Jo Tae Seop, Park Dae Ho, and Kim Yeong Il what they gave to me.

557
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,070
My name is too well known so I asked Mr. Park.

558
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:44,800
He was a former special agent, so he's been using the alias Park Jin Hyeok.

559
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,540
instead of his real name, Park Jong Hyeok. He was perfect for this plan.

560
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,470
I see.

561
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:57,500
I had no idea it was the Office Manager Park I knew. I thought another major shareholder had surfaced.

562
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,840
I'm sorry for confusing you.

563
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,840
It's fine. This happened because I didn't know your real name.

564
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,550
On the other hand, I'm impressed by your intel source.

565
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,540
You should be impressed.

566
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:16,590
But if I noticed, I'm sure Jo Tae Seop did too.

567
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,250
He'll figure it out soon too.

568
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:23,270
This could be dangerous for you.

569
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:27,560
The only reason Jo Tae Seop left you alone is because you didn't get involved in this game.

570
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,910
But you already got yourself involved.

571
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,260
So?

572
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,910
We have the upper hand now. That's all we should focus on.

573
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:48,640
Do you think I didn't expect this when I started? My dad told me something.

574
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,260
"When the fight starts, only focus on winning."

575
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,720
"Don't deviate even if you bleed."

576
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,050
"Just think about crushing the opponent."

577
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:03,910
I've already stepped into the boxing ring. I can't pull out now.

578
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,850
It's now how risky it is.  I am focused only on winning.

579
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:16,920
How large a stake in JQ Constructions' shares did you gather up through Sang Man?

580
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,800
About 3.4 percent. You?

581
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,460
I have two percent.

582
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,550
That means together we have over five percent.

583
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:29,120
If we buy a little more we should be able to earn management rights.

584
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:34,090
Sang Man invested around 20 billion won with JQ Constructions' shares as collateral.

585
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:38,510
But it seems Kim Yeong Il wants to borrow more than that.

586
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:41,380
Borrow more?

587
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,960
He must not be afraid of debt.

588
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,340
If we are successful in acquiring more shares, we might be able to take over JQ Construction.

589
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,100
Relay this to Sang Man.

590
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:54,590
A big player nuna who wants to invest in JQ Constructions is looking forward to his call.

591
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,960
Okay.

592
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,850
That'll make that kid happy.

593
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,790
Contact me if you ever need me.

594
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,550
Thank you.

595
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,190
- I'll be on my way now.
 - Bye.

596
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,850
Here's the investment contract.

597
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,750
Kim Yeong Il is asking to borrow an even bigger sum.

598
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,760
Lend it to him, since there's already collateral.

599
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,390
Because the amount is so big, it's a bit burdensome.

600
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,800
Should I decrease the burden a bit?

601
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,510
How?

602
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,650
That big private investor. It was one of Hui Ah's people.

603
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:49,350
Yes! I knew it.

604
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,540
Hui Ah says she wants to invest in JQ Construction with you.

605
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,480
Nuna Hui Ah said that?

606
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,150
Happy?

607
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,060
-  Meet up with her and discuss it.
 - She wants to... to meet me?

608
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,750
Hyeong, what has happened to me?

609
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,990
Does she like me?

610
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,260
Yes, sir.

611
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,510
I'm on the way to meet Kim Jeong Taek.

612
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:26,660
If this time things go again as you expect, I will make a bid.

613
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,670
Leader of the party.

614
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,420
I fact-checked the material you gave me.

615
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,010
JQ Construction and Bando Bank's illegal loan.

616
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:43,320
It was true after all.

617
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:48,640
You asked before how long I was going to live as Jo Tae Seop's puppet.

618
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,360
I won't.

619
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:57,990
So I have a request to make.

620
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:02,610
For the moment, I'm going to bow before Jo Tae Seop.

621
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,880
Seizing the opportunity while my opponent is off guard...

622
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,730
 Material Concerning Bando Bank's Loan to JQ Construction

623
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,860
please expose this.

624
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,450
Exactly like the last time.

625
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,960
The outcome will be different

626
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,790
since we also have the prosecution.

627
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,690
 List of Daehan Party Assemblyman Nominees

628
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,030
I will follow your wishes.

629
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:39,640
It's our party's list of nominations.

630
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:50,900
Get ready. It'll come out shortly.

631
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,570
Yes.

632
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,720
 Material concerning Bando Bank's Loan to JQ Construction

633
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,190
Jo Tae Seop.

634
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,900
You underestimated me.

635
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:13,250
He knows my weakness, yet he pretends to act innocent?

636
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,220
Should I contact Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun?

637
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,550
That's alright. Not yet.

638
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:22,460
Making a move now will only be venting my anger.

639
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,570
There's nothing to gain.

640
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,070
Rat-like bastards.

641
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,060
Thank you for coming again. I guess the taste suits you well.

642
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,610
Because it's been a while since you've come,

643
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,040
Hui Wu's mother put out the entire kitchen.

644
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,190
- Here.
 - You always pack up food whenever we come here.

645
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,270
We are the ones who are thankful.

646
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,230
It's me you should say thanks to.

647
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:22,560
It was hard to bring out the entire kitchen. Since I'm the king in the kitchen.

648
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,940
Madam, when it comes to food, mine is tastier, no?

649
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,240
What are you saying?

650
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,010
Hui Wu, tell me honestly.

651
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,360
Between mine and your dad's, whose is tastier?

652
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,030
- Excuse me?
 - Prosecutor, tell us the truth.

653
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,610
That is...

654
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,140
That's it. It's exactly that!

655
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:46,250
- When you get married, don't take anyone's side.
 - Right.

656
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,110
You're right. I didn't think of it. When we got married,

657
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:52,710
I said my mom's food was tasty and suffered at lot at your mom's hands.

658
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:55,330
However, I'm on your side.

659
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,880
Indeed, Prosecutor Ji has sense.

660
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,910
Fake prosecutor, please leave. Get out immediately.

661
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,050
Get out. Get out.

662
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,740
Welcome.

663
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,310
I wasn't saying that to you.

664
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,020
Please sit here.

665
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,330
It's tomorrow.

666
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,520
Kim Seok Hun's confirmation hearing.

667
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:29,890
Right. How sweet. It's been a while since we got together.

668
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,480
- Here, let's drink!
 - Yes.

669
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,130
Chief Prosecutor is coming.

670
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,520
- Goodbye, sir.
 - Goodbye, sir.

671
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,300
Why are you all out here when it's not even anything special?

672
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,360
Let's proceed, Prosecutor General.

673
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:00,390
- Goodbye, sir.
 - Goodbye, sir.

674
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:04,520
- Goodbye, sir.
 - Goodbye, sir.

675
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:31,670
Goodbye, sir.

676
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:47,590
We will now begin the confirmation hearing of the Prosecutor General nominee.

677
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:56,310
"I swear to tell the truth in accordance

678
00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:02,840
with my conscience without evasion and aid.

679
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,620
You may now question the nominee.

680
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:10,720
Making false resident registrations, falsifying contracts, or committing property speculation.

681
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,990
Indeed, it's befitting a candidate for the next prosecutor general.

682
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,980
Thank you.

683
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:19,560
As a prosecutor, I did not do anything that ran counter to my position.

684
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,730
As you're a member of JQ Group, people are concerned

685
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:27,000
that you may go easy on the wealthy.

686
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,610
What do you think in regard to this?

687
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:33,240
I can understand where it's coming from.

688
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,730
While living as a prosecutor for over twenty years,

689
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:39,410
I have never been shaken by improper requests or bribes.

690
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:43,340
Also, my in-laws' and my work are completely separate.

691
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:49,230
If you become the prosecutor general, what would you like to change first?

692
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:54,600
Our agency comes across as rigid and unapproachable.

693
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,870
I want people to see it as a flexible and friendly agency, so the people can freely communicate with us.

694
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,670
Hello.

695
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:05,220
I'm Prosecutor Jeon Seok Gyu of the Central District Office.

696
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,120
I will now begin the briefing about Nominee Kim Seok Hun's son,

697
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,840
Managing Director Kim Yeong Il of JQ Constructions. During this briefing, I'll disclose the corruption behind the bidding

698
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,670
for the construction site as well as the embezzlement of the deposits for apartment units.

699
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,400
Hold on. Did you run this by the public relations officer?

700
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,140
He's in the confirmation hearing to be the Prosecutor General and you're going after his son?

701
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,890
What does that matter?

702
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,440
Isn't telling the truth a journalist's spirit?

703
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,150
If you're not going to write the article, please leave. I will tell the truth by myself.

704
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,650
I guess I'll get an exclusive.

705
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,390
Please continue, Manager Jeon Seok Gyu.

706
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,460
Criminal Investigation Division Five noticed a sign of collusion between public and private sectors

707
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:49,870
and the unlawful involvement of civil servants during the bidding process of development areas in Gusan and launched an investigation.

708
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:54,910
JQ Construction colluded with its competitor to win the bidding with the lowest price,

709
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,660
and they offered bribes to civil servants to look away from this corruption (turn a blind eye).

710
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:02,360
On top of that, they also embezzled the deposits for apartment units.

711
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,250
Therefore, they should be severely punished.

712
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:11,410
Assemblymen, do you have any other questions?

713
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:20,950
 I know it will be hard, but please stay until the end.

714
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,160
A news flash has surfaced.

715
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,190
Please check.

716
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,870
- What?
- What is it?

717
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,970
Sir, please take a look.

718
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:46,430
 Arrest Warrant Issued for Managing Director Kim Yeong Il

719
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,790
Nominee Kim Seok Hun.

720
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:58,110
It's been confirmed that your son, Managing Director Kim Yeong Il, indeed committed corruption.

721
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,610
What's your opinion?

722
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,840
Please tell us.

723
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:42,960
You didn't know about this, okay?

724
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,270
But sir...

725
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:48,520
You are my last stronghold.

726
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,140
It's preparation for when things go bad for us.

727
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,280
Enough. Don't look at me that way.

728
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,090
My wife asked how long I was going to work at the prosecutor's office.

729
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:08,530
You know. Promotions have gone down the drain but it's midnight by the time you leave work.

730
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:13,920
Even the kids say the neighbor is better than you.

731
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,590
I don't have any regrets now.

732
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,120
You kids. Don't make that kind of face.

733
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,970
I put in my years for my pension.

734
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,010
Drink up!

735
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,730
What do you plan to do?

736
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:57,790
The citizens are full of distrust.

737
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:01,440
Do you perhaps intend to see it to the end?

738
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,180
What should I do?

739
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:15,000
Resign voluntarily.

740
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:17,350
Assemblyman.

741
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:20,430
Are you asking me to save you?

742
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:23,000
Is that possible now?

743
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:31,050
I will turn over the Cheonha Holdings shares my son has to you.

744
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,070
Why?

745
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:35,200
I am hoping you will spend it in the national interest.

746
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,370
In the national interest, you say.

747
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,560
- Look here, Manager Han.
 - Yes.

748
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,780
Release Kim Jeong Taek's corruption incident.

749
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,920
Yes, sir.

750
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:54,010
As for you, go and arrest Kim Jeong Taek.

751
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:58,150
Cover your name with Kim Jeong Taek's name.

752
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:59,550
Thank you, Assemblyman.

753
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,130
But that won't be enough.

754
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,470
It won't even make a dent.

755
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:10,020
JQ Construction shareholders and victims won't forget this incident.

756
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,560
There's only one way.

757
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,870
It's to eliminate the cause when there's a problem.

758
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,390
You have a great precedent.

759
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:20,420
Choi Kang Jin does.

760
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:25,000
He himself informed the authorities about his own father.

761
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,050
Arrest your son with your hands.

762
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,020
Sir...

763
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:33,770
Your son broke the law, so you must punish him.

764
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:36,060
Before others arrest him, you arrest him.

765
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:39,030
Think about everything else after you become the prosecutor general.

766
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:43,560
Whether you get him out on probation or keep him in prison,

767
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,770
take care of that as you see fit.

768
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:48,230
Become a righteous prosecutor.

769
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,930
I will turn the public opinion.

770
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:55,490
And Jeon Seok Gyu.

771
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,610
Don't provoke him.

772
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:00,240
For now, embrace Jeon Seok Gyu.

773
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,000
And when it quiets down, kick him out then.

774
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,600
Yes, sir.

775
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:13,610
 Prosecution Service

776
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,170
Come in.

777
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,600
 Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun

778
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:35,830
You called for me.

779
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:40,350
Arrest Kim Yeong Il.

780
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:45,750
Immediately.

781
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,420
Yes, sir.

782
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,330
You were supposed to expose him!

783
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:01,610
Why did you not touch Bando Bank's illegal loan?

784
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:07,200
Kim, I'm not a dog you've raised.

785
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,840
Did you think I wouldn't know what you were thinking?

786
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,760
By ordering me to do the divulging,

787
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,320
what were you going to do?

788
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,610
You probably thought

789
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:22,930
you could make me do the dangerous work and, if things went wrong, you'd get out.

790
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:26,910
Did you think I wouldn't see right through your wickedness?

791
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,060
Assemblyman!

792
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:33,590
A person like you isn't suited to be a party representative.

793
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:34,660
Step down now.

794
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,950
Hwang Jin Yong!

795
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,170
Sir.

796
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,540
 Kim Jung Taek Soon to Be Summoned On Corruption Charges

797
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:54,830
 Prosecutor Yun Jong Gi

798
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,640
 Daehan Party Leader Kim Jeong Taek

799
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,790
 Daehan Party Leader Kim Jeong Taek

800
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:07,180
There's no way I can drown with you.

801
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:15,490
Hwang Jin Yong too. Jeon Seok Gyu, the tiger too.

802
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:17,950
To find a way to live,

803
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:21,550
they did not provoke Bando Bank.

804
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,380
- A comment, sir!
- Any comments?

805
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:30,680
- Please answer our questions!
- Tell us the truth!

806
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,180
Please one comment!

807
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:33,590
Are the allegations true?

808
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:34,820
Did you know about this?

809
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,370
Do you admit to the charges?

810
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:38,870
- Sir! A comment!
 - Please answer our questions.

811
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:40,140
Please answer our questions.

812
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,380
 For corrupt loans,

813
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:46,730
 Executive Director Kim Yeong Il of JQ Construction

814
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,510
 was detained by the Central District Prosecutor's Office today.

815
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:52,040
 Today's detention resulted from Executive Director Kim Yong Il's father and

816
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:56,390
Central District Prosecution's Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun's special order.

817
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,950
 Through a briefing by the prosecution service, Chief Prosecutor Kim

818
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:04,760
 revealed that he tried to be faithful to a prosecutor's duties.

819
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:10,290
Assemblyman, he's arrived.

820
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,600
Did you come together?

821
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,570
Escort him in.

822
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,460
Please come in.

823
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,340
Welcome.

824
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:49,310
You're riding in a nice car.

825
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,700
What is it?

826
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,150
Why don't you ride in the crap car today?

827
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:55,530
I came to escort you, as a prosecutor.

828
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:59,480
Prosecutor Lee Min Su, isn't it about time now to give up?

829
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,840
But I obtained a warrant again.

830
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,500
 Arrest Warrant

831
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,690
I won't give up.

832
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:11,310
Until I catch you. Until the end.

833
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:17,620
 Mirae Electronics' CEO Jeon Il Bo stood trial for bribery and a violation

834
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:21,450
 of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes and was released on probation in his first trial.

835
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:25,210
 He has been detained again by the prosecutors on yet another charge.

836
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,860
Go first.

837
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:39,660
Did you come here to say hello?

838
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,840
So you could order a fancy meal for him again? Too bad.

839
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,690
But it won't work.

840
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:48,270
Jeon Il Bo is mine.

841
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:51,480
I'll give him food and I'll also give him the punishment.

842
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,290
So don't provoke me.

843
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:58,970
If you provoke me, know that your life will also end in a prison.

844
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:03,360
This time, I won't let you off.

845
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,980
 Prosecution Service

846
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,410
Jeon Il Bo was arrested.

847
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,720
Did Kim Seok Hun allow this?

848
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:31,940
I apologize. Prosecutor Lee Min Su is someone difficult to control.

849
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,660
President Jeon Il Bo will soon—

850
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,370
Carry it out according to the law.

851
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:39,680
That bastard Jeon Il Bo has committed too many crimes.

852
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:45,640
And bringing down Jeon Il Bo will look great in your resume for your future title.

853
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,740
Yes, I understand.

854
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:06,960
Kim Hui Wu.

855
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,150
Yes.

856
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:12,700
If you didn't exist, I would have chosen to live having fun.

857
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:17,270
But not now.

858
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,860
Because I found something more fun.

859
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:28,150
Fighting with you.

860
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,990
I am going to work for Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

861
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,950
I know.

862
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:42,350
That the person who framed my father is Jo Tae Seop.

863
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:46,620
But at that time, Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop was a prosecutor

864
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:47,910
and was only doing his job.

865
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:48,920
Seonbae.

866
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,100
Don't worry.

867
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,700
I will keep my mouth shut and help with bringing down Kim Seok Hun.

868
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:57,120
That way, there's the right balance to the game.

869
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,130
Right, Bro?

870
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:08,390
You'll keep quiet and help Kim Seok Hun's fall.

871
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:10,990
Our last partnership?

872
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:16,880
Then, you will fight me?

873
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,470
Yup.

874
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:30,250
Yes, fine.

875
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,160
Let's do it.

876
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:41,970

877
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,830
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

878
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:50,000
♫  We are here to wreck it up  ♫

879
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,020
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

880
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:03,910
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

881
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:07,160
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

882
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:13,200
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

883
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:19,180
♫  Who would ever find out who you really are? Hm  ♫

884
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:22,450
 Again My Life

885
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:25,880
 Let's kick Kim Seok Hun out fast.

886
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,890
 Don't kneel!

887
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:30,670
 Are you going to use him as an excuse?

888
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:36,230
 He saw my weakness. So I need to know at least one of his.

889
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:40,450
 If you want a deal, bring me something worthy,

890
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:42,160
 not your threat.

891
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,390
 Our partnership ends today.

892
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:49,510
 Sit. If you leave now, it won't end with you going home.

893
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:54,330
 Next, I must get rid of Park Dae Ho, Jo Tae Seop's source of funds.

894
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:57,970
♫  Let them get what they want  ♫

895
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:03,160
 Again My Life
