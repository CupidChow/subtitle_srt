00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,530

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,620
 Lee Joon Gi

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,780
 Lee Kyung Young

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,630
 Kim Ji Eun

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,100
 Again My Life

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,960
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,490
What? You're declaring war on Jo Tae Seop?

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,000
- Yes.
 - Are you crazy?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,300
 Episode 16
 So that's why all those ridiculous personnel transfer orders came about.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,850
He's trying to isolate me.

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,640
It's a threat to stop right now.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,250
But I won't stop.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,650
I'll keep going. Then ...

14
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,290
the answer will probably come from Jo Tae Seop's side.

15
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,240
No matter what the answer is, please don't try to stop me.

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,670
Crazy jerk. Are you really going to keep at it?

17
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,380
- Yes.
 - Fine. What are you going to do moving forward?

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,710
I should release the things I have prepared.

19
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,010
- Is this it?
 - Yes.

20
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,570
I prepared it ever since Sang Man acquired JQ Construction.

21
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,560
It's Sang Man's stock as well as the merger and acquisition documents.

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,630
It feels a bit empty since we're doing this without Sang Man.

23
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,460
He'll understand.

24
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,580
Cheonha will make the first official announcement.

25
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,010
You have to become the CEO and protect Cheonha.

26
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,180
Yes. I will.

27
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,580
It appears that Cheonha Group will be buying JQ Construction.

28
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,940
The CEO of JQ was Park Sang Man, right?

29
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,870
Then, this must also Kim Hui Wu's doing.

30
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,660
Summon Prosecutor General Yun Jong Gi.

31
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,270
I need Kim Hui Wu to learn about the world a bit more.

32
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,440
Train in America?

33
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,510
Yes. An order to go to the US for training came down.

34
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:24,170
It'll happen early next month. They tell me it will be a good opportunity for you.

35
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,920
I'll follow the orders. Please pass along the message that I will go to the US training.

36
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,780
What a nice world. A prosecutor orders the chief prosecutor around.

37
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,400
I understand.

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,260
Before I leave, I'll cut off Jo Tae Seop's right arm.

39
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,300
Could I ask you for a favor?

40
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,570
 Let's meet up. We can discuss Kim Hui Wu while we eat.

41
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,940
Hold on.

42
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,320
If you are on your way to meet Chief Prosecutor Jeon Seok Gyu, talk with me first.

43
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,270
- What did you have to say?
 - It was you, wasn't it?

44
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,030
The person who did that to Sang Man.

45
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,300
So, are you going to get revenge?

46
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,080
- Yes.
- Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu. You need power to seek revenge.

47
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,420
Without power, there's nothing you can do.

48
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,420
That's for me to worry about.

49
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,940
Do it if you can.

50
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,710
The more you try, the more desperate you’ll feel.

51
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,330
Then you will feel powerless to do anything.

52
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,340
You're right. I'm already feeling that powerlessness.

53
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,730
So I'm going to stop being a prosecutor.

54
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,930
You used to be a prosecutor, so you must know well.

55
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,260
When a prosecutor has resolved to quit, he can catch anyone.

56
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,250
But, I couldn't catch Jo Tae Seop.

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,080
So, I've decided to give up on catching Jo Tae Seop.

58
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,780
But... the sword was drawn.

59
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,050
So I should at least chop something up.

60
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,770
 Breaking News: Investigation into the acquisition of helicopters for the army. The suspect is a broker named Kim.

♫  You make me bad with cowardly words  ♫

67
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,360

71

In exactly an hour, every TV station will receive an original copy without your face blurred.

72
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,810
Your face will be made public.

73
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,510
Also, I enjoyed listening to your conversation with Jeong Seo Yeon.

74
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,680
The amounts you talked about were so astronomical that it would be enough to enrage the public.

75
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,470
There's even the image of you putting money in the trunk, so you have no way out now.

76
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,690
♫  Oh Bring it on Bring it on  ♫

♫  Bring it on Oh Yeah  ♫

78
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,660
I know that the bribe wasn't from a broker.

79
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,940
But you know, too, that this is a pretty good scenario.

80
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,190
I copied your style.

81
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,600
What? Do you think you can stop the media by putting pressure on them?

82
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,050
Get out of my way.

83
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,850
- Wait.
 - Get out of my way, scumbag!

84
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,370
What now?

85
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,850
The cellphone is in my hand now. Huh?

86
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:11,930
You surely don't think that's everything I have on you.

87
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,290
Illegal loans through loan companies, manipulation of real estate speculation, assaulting landowners,

88
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,270
blackmailing various politicians and business leaders, money laundering,

89
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,320
that’s all the crimes on your shoulders.

90
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,080
You’ve always been the hunter, right?

91
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,420
Now see what it feels like

92
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,220
to be the prey.

93
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,260
 The prosecution plans to request an arrest warrant for Kim, the prime suspect,
  - Sorry? Yes.

94
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,620
 who committed corruption during the process of introducing the army helicopter.
- Yes.

95
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,140
Yes, I understand.

96
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,130
What's going on?

97
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,410
The informant said he would identify the broker next.

98
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,770
So, the media didn't know that he was Office Director Kim Jin Wu.

99
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,550
Tell them to take it down immediately!

100
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,430
Yes, sir.

101
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,030
Sir, it's Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

102
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,990
Did you manage to stop the media?

103
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,010
I wanted to send you on a trip to the US,

104
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,820
but it appears you didn’t want to go.

105
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,110
I don't like long flights.

106
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,940
If you had tried to send me somewhere closer, I would have happily gone.

107
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,640
Do you still intend to fight me?

108
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,010
Once you start, you have to see it to the end.

109
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,810
I’m in a different weight class. You’re making a mistake, Prosecutor Kim.

110
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,660
What if I'm not?

111
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,720
Why? Are you afraid of me?

112
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,650
Well, I don't need to know what you think.

113
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,340
Let me tell you what I think.

114
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:19,310
I put a collar around your faithful dog, Kim Jin Wu's neck.

115
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,880
He'll be arrested soon.

116
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,790
But, I'm curious.

117
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,260
Will your faithful dog keep his mouth shut until the end?

118
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,970
I imagine you’re also curious

119
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:40,440
whether that faithful dog will keep wagging his tail or betray you.

120
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:48,710
I’ll get you sooner or later. So be ready for it.

121
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,990
Don’t lay a finger on Director Kim!

122
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's not say such conventional things when we have no good feelings towards one another.

123
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,260
Jin Wu, where is he now?

124
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,740
I can't reach him.

125
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,840
- Find him! Find him right now!
 - Yes, sir.

126
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,080
 Arraignment

127
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,970
 If you don't want to be prey, hunt.

128
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,220
 Bite your master, Jo Tae Seop.

129
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,820
 I'll wait at the cafe on the first floor. When you make up your mind, come down.

130
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,700
 Arraignment

131
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,590
I'll take responsibility for everything.

132
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:15,590
Sir, please change the world...

133
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:45,990
 Defense broker Kim, who was suspected of bribery, was found dead.

134
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:51,000
 According to the police, Mr. Kim, jumped from a hotel in Ganghyeon-gu, Seoul, at around 7:30 pm today,

135
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,920
 amid mounting pressure with the official launch of the prosecution's investigation.

136
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,090
 Mr. Kim was part of a foreign company that was in the process of introducing a new military helicopter

137
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,250
 to the defense department through lobbyists and was suspected of accepting money and valuables

138
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,000
 from the agents to ensure

139
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,340
  the purchase of such transport.

140
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,200
Punk...

141
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,140
Why...

142
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,970
Why did you make that foolish decision?

143
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,350
I...

144
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,020
I...!

145
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,070
Jin Wu,

146
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,130
don’t snoop around here and there while on your way

147
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,900
and just follow the white light.

148
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,890
Just follow...

149
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,790
the white light.

150
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,590

151
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,540
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

152
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,210
What is this?

153
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,220
It's my resignation letter.

154
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,200
You know I can't go to the United States.

155
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,960
I understand.

156
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,840
Well done, Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu.

157
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,420
 Prosecutors' Oath

158
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,250
Are you really leaving?

159
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,940
I made up my mind.

160
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,620
- Well done.

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,870
Thank you.

162
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,500
Let me use my nomination rights.

163
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,060
I owe a debt. Just give me a throwaway nomination.

164
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,530
He just needs to run, that's all.

165
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:27,130
Oh! I would love for him to run in Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's district.

166
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:32,870
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's district? That's going to be a definite loss then.

167
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,260
Sure. Please go ahead then.

168
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,820
But, who is it?

169
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,010
 I have a favor to ask.

170
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,240
 - A favor?
 - Yes.

171
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,380
 It can be easy and also difficult.

172
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,740
  Tell me.

173
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,380
 I heard you have a nomination right.

174
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,620
 Nomination right?

175
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,800
 Yes, I do. And?

176
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,980
 When I resign from being a prosecutor,

177
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,800
 please nominate me.

178
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,260
  Are you serious?

179
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,120
 Yes.

180
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,130
 Even if you’re nominated, there’s no guarantee you’ll win.

181
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,770
  Sir, I don't want be a lawmaker.

182
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,230
 I want to catch Jo Tae Seop.

183
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,590
 Please nominate me in the same district as Jo Tae Seop.

184
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,060
You don’t need to know who it is. Will you give it to me or not?!

185
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,960
In Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's District! Work hard.

186
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,350
Are you saying Hwang Jin Yong nominated him?

187
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,100
Okay. All right.

188
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,810
Kim Hui Wu is my opponent.

189
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,000
How cute. Call him and tell him that I'd like to have lunch with him tomorrow.

190
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,840
I will.

191
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,510
You're going too far. You can stop joking now.

192
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,500
Joke? It's not a joke.

193
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,960
We both can't stand the sight of each other, so I'm sure you didn't call me to have lunch.

194
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,350
Let's get to the point.

195
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,800
Why did you call me?

196
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,400
I was really curious as to why you're after me.

197
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,480
Why do you think?

198
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,300
I want to bring you down since you're a criminal, that's all.

199
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,020
I wanted to do that as a prosecutor,

200
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,180
but I couldn't do it.

201
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,800
Do you think you can bring me down?

202
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,230
Why couldn't I?

203
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,560
You resemble me.

204
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,230
I’m sure you don’t want to hear this, but you're a lot like me.

205
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,240
You remind me of my days as a prosecutor.

206
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,270
I gave up being a prosecutor for a similar reason.

207
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,850
I'm glad to hear that.

208
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,760
I thought I had to turn into someone like you in order to bring you down.

209
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,900
You can't do it. Why?

210
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,930
You don't have power. Get that first.

211
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:23,140
Invest five, ten years in your election, and re-election, and gain political influence.

212
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,290
Then you will have the power to bring me down.

213
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,680
I'll help you get that power to bring me down.

214
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,520
I’m a man who values ability. And I hope your ability is used to build a strong nation.

215
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,160
After that, I don’t care if you bring me down.

216
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,850
If that's for the sake of the country.

217
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:54,090
Ah, you are severely delusional.

218
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,720
I'm sure you know that my goal is not politics better than anyone.

219
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:07,240
I'm going to make sure to bring you down.

220
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,150
Director Kim Jin Wu.

221
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,610
How did he look in his last moment?

222
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,790
You must already know.

223
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:01,390
There's no way for you to win against him.

224
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:07,980
It's a fight between a tiger and a rabbit. It's not too late to... ask for forgiveness.

225
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,970
I have three questions for you.

226
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,870
One. Would he leave me alone if I gave up?

227
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,580
Two. Do I look like a rabbit?

228
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,800
Three. Why are you telling me this now?

229
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,240
I believe that there needs to be someone like you, that's all.

230
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,460
So let me tell you something, too.

231
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:49,060
You’re preparing something to catch Jo Tae Seop, aren't you?

232
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,360
Don't do it.

233
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,440
You'll die, Manager Han.

234
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,350
It's out of concern.

235
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:10,280
I don’t want anyone else to get hurt or die anymore.

236
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,740
Just watch. I'll catch him.

237
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,870
That was our agreement.

238
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,810
Though, you may not remember it.

239
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:33,530
I’d like to see you in private. If you believe what I'm saying, call me.

240
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,930
Kim Hui Wu is quite impressive. I was afraid Jin Wu might have died because of a lightweight.

241
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,400
If I shed that punk's bloody tears on Jin Wu's grave, I think he'll be satisfied.

242
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,820
I have to help him let go of his grief.

243
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:18,280
When the general election is over, sharp wind will blow.

244
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:24,390
Kim Hui Wu's and Hwang Jin Yong's blood will stain the party's name.

245
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,520
I’m going to step on that blood and run for President.

246
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:37,780
I told you, didn't you?  I will show you before Jin Wu's soul leaves.

247
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,270
 The candidate Jo Tae Seop of the Democratic Party for Haero-gu,

248
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:52,910
 known as Seoul's political center, launched his election campaign today.

249
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,340
Thank you.

250
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,370
Please look this way.

251
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,420
Please take care of me, honored guests.  Thank so much!

252
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,950
It's a no-brainer that you'll win again. Please help us out, sir.

253
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,750
How’s my opponent, Kim Hui Wu?

254
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,270
You have nothing to worry about.

255
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,260
Ah! He doesn't do anything. The election campaign is really simple, too.

256
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,360
He hasn't done anything?

257
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,400
He should come by to meet with these ladies, too.

258
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,700
Yes. Thank you!

259
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,800
Please take care, Assemblyman.

260
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,890
Aigoo. Hello.

261
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,660
- Sir, we believe in you!
 - Thank you!

262
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,860
 Always speaking up for the people

263
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,190
 Jo Tae Seop with the people

264
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,850
 Jo Tae Seop!

265
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,100
I found out what Kim Hui Wu’s intention is.

266
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,670
Don’t worry. Whatever his intention, the result will be the same.

267
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,810
Sir, Prosecutor Lee Min Su, wants to see you.

268
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,280
- Tell him to come.
 - Yes, sir.

269
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,410
Sorry.

270
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,340
You asked me to take down Kim Hui Wu, but I failed.

271
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,930
I almost got him, but he quit and ran for election.

272
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,270
Did you come to say that?

273
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,900
I had prepared this to take down Kim Hui Wu.

274
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,830
I hope it helps your election campaign.

275
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,320
Kim Hui Wu seems to have been in some fights during his school days.

276
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,650
He frequented the police station, too, during the time he was studying for the exams.

277
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:35,210
This is a witness statement video of Im Jong Il, Ma Yong Seok, and Lee Tae Hun who were his victims.

278
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:40,020
They went to a birthday party at a club and were assaulted for no reason by Kim Hui Wu.

279
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,840
The video also shows that he carried a drunk woman out of the club.

280
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,350
School violence, rape...

281
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,980
And Kim Hui Wu went to college and participated in auctions of foreclosed properties.

282
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,090
He squeezed every last penny out of people in financial trouble.

283
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,260
You'll find the complaints inside as well.

284
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,080
Good job.

285
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:05,300
- Prosecutor Lee.
 - Yes, sir.

286
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,470
Do you think I'll believe this? Huh?

287
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,700
You can believe it.

288
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,160
I will accept this card.

289
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,720
Since I now have a reason to destroy Kim Hui Wu.

290
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,940
- Director Han.
 - Yes, sir.

291
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:29,200
Fact check everything in here and turn Kim Hui Wu into a demon.

292
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,020
 Hello, change brings hope!

293
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,110
 You have a dinner meeting with the party leader tonight.

294
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:41,130
Please check the schedule of the lawmakers in your party and find out if they can attend the upcoming election campaign.

295
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,390
Candidate! Candidate!

296
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:52,760
 Allegations of school violence have surfaced against former Central District Prosecutor Kim Hi Wu,

297
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,000
 opponent of Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

298
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,900
 It's correct that Kim Hui Wu was a bully.

299
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,500
 I am also one of his victims.

300
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:06,100
 I was scared when I heard such a person became a prosecutor. I can't believe that kind of person is running to become an assemblyman.

301
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,980
 I wouldn’t live in a district where he was an assemblyman.

302
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:17,400
 The approval rating is dropping rapidly. Real-time comments say, "Stop being so fake!"

303
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,680
 Ah! Damn it!

304
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,730
 Kim Hui Wu's School Violence Scandal Causes Controversy

305
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,680
Release another one. Make Kim Hui Wu a complete piece of crap.

306
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,140
Yes, sir.

307
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,740
 Candidate Kim Hui Wu is suspected of participating  in illegal real estate deals.

308
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:46,200
 He accumulated wealth by purchasing properties in real estate auctions and selling them with huge markups back in college.

309
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,770
Now, let's play a game, Ji Ho.

310
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:55,570
Guess which hand the candy is in.

311
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:02,200
Ta-da! Where is it?

312
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,780
Really?

313
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,620
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

314
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,020
Now, here!

315
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,710
Wow, it's here! You're a genius.

316
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,550
Give me five!

317
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,870
Say thank you.

318
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,380
- Thank you!
 - Let's go.

319
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,620
Bye.

320
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,180
Are you happy fooling the kids?

321
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,780
A good-faith lie. A virtue of a politician.

322
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,360
What are you doing?

323
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,360
Cracks are forming in the image of a candidate who is campaigning as someone who sympathizes with youth and integrity.

324
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,910
Shouldn't you release an article countering that? Aren’t you going to do an election campaign?

325
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,930
I'm doing it right now.

326
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,350
I'm meeting with a journalist right now.

327
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,920
Stop joking around.

328
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,750
Anyway, what happened to you?

329
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,190
Should you be here like this?

330
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,600
You were only recently transferred to the Japan office.

331
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,420
Well, the politics section couldn’t go on without me.

332
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,620
The director called me two days ago and begged me to come back, so I said okay.

333
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,450
When the "ace" was missing, he realized how precious I was.

334
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,280
Oh, "ace"?

335
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,610
Sure, welcome, Kim Han Mi.

336
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,330
 I would like to see you. Han Ji Hyeon

337
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,720
Do you really think you can bring down Jo Tae Seop?

338
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,620
Yes.

339
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,620
That's why I'm even more curious.

340
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,080
Why you're not responding to our attacks.

341
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,420
Do I have to tell you that?

342
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,370
The two of us could end up in the same boat.

343
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,200
Before that, let me ask you how you knew.

344
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,680
That I was preparing myself.

345
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,050
Because I'm a prosecutor.

346
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,970
No.

347
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,050
Because I was a prosecutor.

348
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,530
That's not a satisfying answer.

349
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,600
It doesn't make sense either.

350
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,210
Is the world satisfying?

351
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,840
Does everything in the world make sense?

352
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,550
There are things in this world that don't make sense.

353
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,730
Just trust me.

354
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,730
You have to believe in me

355
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,180
to save yourself.

356
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,810
And you'll realize.

357
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:25,310
That I am the only one who can handle Jo Tae Seop.

358
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,730
I'll take my time preparing

359
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,040
and tie him up perfectly.

360
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,850
And I'll show him that hell

361
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,020
can also exist while he is living.

362
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,600
To the attacks...

363
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,470
I'm going to start responding now.

364
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,890
First, I'm going to get married.

365
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,720
Married?

366
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,380
Yes.

367
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,940
 Kim Hui Ah, the head of Cheonha Group's business strategy division

368
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,110
 made a surprise wedding announcement.

369
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:15,090
Honey! Hui Wu's mom.
  The groom will be Kim Hui Wu, a former prosecutor and candidate for the National Assembly.

370
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,820
  Director Kim has stated that she has found the person she wants to spend the rest of her life with.

371
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,300
That guy isn't our son, is he?

372
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,830
Of course, he's your son.
   He protected and cherished her throughout several difficult moments.

373
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,980
 She told Kim Hui Wu that she had fallen in love with him

374
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,390
 and wanted to get married.

375
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,870
 They originally wanted to announce their marriage

376
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,840
What is this, is he really getting married?
  after the elections

377
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,520
Oh, my gosh...
   We take the recent reports

378
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,050
  against Kim Hui Wu quite seriously

379
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,740
 He has stated

380
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,410
What are you doing?
  that he will hold a press conference to share the truth about the matter.

381
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,360
You must be busy. We're grateful that you came today.

382
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,330
I will start taking questions now.

383
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,300
This is a question for Kim Hui Wu.

384
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:54,020
Don't you have anything you want to say to the victims who have come forward?

385
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,210
I guess my marriage announcement has become a press conference to deal with gossip about me.

386
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:10,160
The negative press about me has gone too far, so I want to take this opportunity to tell everyone.

387
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,340
The rumors that have been going around about me

388
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,150
are all false.

389
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,390
 Can you take responsibility for what you just said?

390
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,280
That fox-like bastard.
  Yes.

391
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,990
He keeps bullshitting.

392
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,980
 It's too early to say who's telling the truth.

393
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,200
 Please don't treat Hui Wu as a suspect.

394
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,210
He really succeeded at making an issue.

395
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,440
If the rumors are false, why do new ones keep coming up?

396
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,230
There is an organized movement to cause me harm.

397
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,460
It's probably the work of someone

398
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,670
who isn't happy to see me get into politics.

399
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,870
Are you referring to one of your competitors?

400
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,640
It would be nice if I was wrong.

401
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,600
Candidate Jo Tae Seop, don't hide in the back and do this.

402
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,050
Come talk to me in front of the voters.

403
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,150
I'll be waiting.

404
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,950
 National Assembly candidate Kim Hui Wu announces marriage to Cheonha Group's Kim Hui Ah.

405
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,820
 Daehan Party candidate Kim Hui Wu proposes an open discussion with Jo Tae Seop

406
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,400
 The world will focus its attention on me.

407
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,310
 After that, we'll propose a televised forum

408
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,940
 so that Jo Tae Seop can't refuse.

409
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,470
A televised forum and a wedding announcement?

410
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,800
It looks like Kim Hui Wu is trying to get me to the colosseum.

411
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:34,330
Someone has to die in a life-or-death duel

412
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,840
for it to end.

413
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:43,040
Sir, with your high approval rating, I don't think you need to respond to his provocation.

414
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,530
You should just ignore it.

415
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,430
Let's go.

416
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,380
- Contact the National Elections Commission. Let's do it.
 - Sir.

417
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,050
I can't hide like a dog.

418
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:57,010
How can the people trust me if I ignore that newbie's taunts?

419
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,570
Politicians are people who fight for the citizens.

420
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,620
You lose that identity if you avoid the fight.

421
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,490
Kim Hui must be

422
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,260
sharpening his sword right now to kill me.

423
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,480
But what I have isn't a sword.

424
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,570
It's a gun.

425
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:27,890
There are candidates receiving a great deal of national attention in this election cycle.

426
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,530
Those are seasoned politician, Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop,

427
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,570
and former prosecutor Kim Hui Wu, who proposed this conversation.

428
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:38,830
I'll go to candidate Jo Tae Seop first.

429
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,640
Please begin.

430
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:46,200
I was very happy to hear that we had a younger contender

431
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,150
in this race.

432
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,270
I wanted to hear fresh insights that only the voices of the younger generations can provide.

433
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,910
But, what is this?

434
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,720
The allegations surrounding Kim Hui Wu aren't simply negative press.

435
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,770
School violence, rape, robbery and countless others

436
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,510
are crimes.

437
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:09,660
If you have a conscience, you should step down yourself.

438
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,370
Are you talking about conscience?

439
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:17,360
A few years ago, Bando Bank, one of the three biggest banks in our country

440
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,370
ended up in the hands of Park Dae Ho, the CEO of DH Money.

441
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:26,520
It was a really shocking incident at the time.

442
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,310
Let's talk about the topic at hand.

443
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,090
What does that situation have to do with me?

444
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,170
Wasn't that because in order to take over the financial sector,

445
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,460
you teamed up with members of the Financial Supervisory Services?

446
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,950
I'm disappointed that you're taking such an expected route.

447
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,430
You wanted to expose me and harm me, never mind if it's not true?

448
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,150
Did you propose a discussion just to do this?

449
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:51,190
No. I want everyone to see your true colors.

450
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,870
Shouldn't the voters know that?

451
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,270
I submitted a video in advance.

452
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,910
If it's ready, please take a look.

453
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,860
It's too unfair for me to cover up all of the embezzlement.

454
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,700
I was just a cover for Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

455
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:13,590
Even with a 15% stake in Cheonha Holdings, how would I have enough money to buy the bank?

456
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:17,520
I was just used by Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop.

457
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,350
The video you just saw was taken with Park Dae Ho's consent.

458
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,250
The rest will be turned over to the press

459
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,350
after the discussion.

460
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,640
It is possible for intimidation or threats to have played a role.

461
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:37,410
And I can also see the possibility of trying to use false testimony to hurt me.

462
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,380
Do you really think that's possible?

463
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,700
There is so much evidence.

464
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,820
It's a shame.

465
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,690
You've been poking around in politics even as a prosecutor.

466
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,970
It seems like you've only learned how to do bad things.

467
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,850
And our citizens

468
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,360
won't fall for such cheap tricks.

469
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,030
The voters are the ones who will make the decision.

470
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,110
The voters are also the ones who will make the final judgment about the candidates.

471
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,680
That's true.

472
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,190
I'm no longer someone who fights in a courtroom.

473
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:09,810
This isn't a court of law.

474
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:13,500
But, the people have the right to know the truth

475
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,380
and make their decisions.

476
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:20,120
It looks like these two are going after each other ruthlessly.

477
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,610
I would now like to ask the two candidates about their political goals.

478
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:27,560
Candidate Kim Hui Wu of the Deahan Party can go first.

479
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,860
Okay.

480
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:36,550
I only had one reason for getting into politics.

481
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:42,400
That was to end the dirty and rotten things happening in politics.

482
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,410
People who want to belittle politicians,

483
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,070
wanting to become politicians themselves

484
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,980
is a great contradiction.

485
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,080
Even bigger contradictions exist.

486
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,930
You have typically argued that your goal

487
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,940
is to make a stronger Republic of Korea.

488
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,460
Yes. That's is my mission.

489
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,460
What do you think about making a few sacrifices for that greater mission?

490
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,220
Sacrifice is what I do.

491
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,850
I can't allow anyone else but me to make a sacrifice.

492
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:17,190
Then why did you try to take businessman Wu Yong Su's assets?

493
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,870
Why did you sacrifice Kim Chan Il of Cheonha Telecommunications and actress Cho Yun Ah?

494
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,880
Candidate Kim. Do not confuse the voters with your groundless assumptions.

495
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,980
Instead of conjuring ways to slander me, you should've prepared your policy and vision.

496
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,400
Confusion?

497
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,350
I'm simply telling the truth.

498
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,460
This here is the cellphone of Director Kim Jin Wu, the late secretary of Candidate Jo,

499
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,900
who committed suicide after being questioned for committing defense industry corruption.

500
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,590
In here, Candidate Jo,

501
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:54,690
is the truth and filth you have desperately been trying to hide.

502
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,340
Candidate Jo.

503
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,450
Do you still claim innocence?

504
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:08,690
Moderator. I ask that you don't allow unverified personal information

505
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,620
to be leaked.

506
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:16,240
Candidate Kim, please refrain from leaking unverified personal information during a live broadcast.

507
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,350
- Understood.
- Candidate Kim.

508
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,040
This is truly deplorable.

509
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,940
No matter how eager you are to win,

510
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:31,430
you shouldn't resort to such a vulgar tactic of using evidence from a suicide case and threatening to leak it.

511
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,590
You should know better as a former prosecutor.

512
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,020
A vulgar tactic?

513
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,300
This isn't vulgar.

514
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,480
It's illegal.

515
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,510
It's clearly illegal.

516
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,710
However, I had no other choice. Or else,

517
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:51,150
Candidate Jo, you would silence the press again and conceal and manipulate through the prosecution again.

518
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,280
What do you mean, cover up and manipulate?

519
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,410
Apologize this instant and take back what you said.

520
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,350
I will gladly accept my punishment.

521
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,900
So,

522
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,420
Candidate Jo should pay now for all your past crimes.

523
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,920
 The last one, number 3.

524
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,400
 We will die together.

525
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:26,050
I am certain that my late secretary did not commit suicide.

526
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,360
I can't shake off the reasonable doubt

527
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,930
that Candidate Kim right here was deeply involved with his death.

528
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:39,180
The reason I didn't refute his absurd claims today was not because I had no rebuttal.

529
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,570
But I wanted to show respect to my colleagues and opponents.

530
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,750
Please show the file I prepared.

531
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:53,300
This was the last time Kim Jin Wu was seen alive.

532
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:58,560
The person with him at that time was a prosecutor. They even got into a physical altercation.

533
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,180
That prosecutor was none other than Candidate Kim right here.

534
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,020
Answer me this.

535
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,250
What exactly happened that night?

536
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,390
What kind of horrible threat did you make

537
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:13,160
that pushed him to take his own life?

538
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,080
Candidate Kim! A person is dead!

539
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,430
Give your excuses  to the prosecutor and repent in prison.

540
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:29,390
You don't deserve to be here.

541
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,400
That is all.

542
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,180
Okay.

543
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,260
As to the reasonable doubts Candidate Jo has voiced, I empathize with him.

544
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,610
I will reveal the truth about all the doubts raised about me

545
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:46,820
regarding Office Director Kim Jin Wu's death

546
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,780
through future investigations.

547
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:55,000
I ask the people to make a level-headed judgment.

548
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,040
Are the claims that Candidate Kim made true?

549
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,050
Please give us a comment!

550
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,150
What about Manager Han?

551
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,790
There's no contact.

552
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:09,020
 The debate between the two Haero-gu candidates is wrapping up.

553
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,490
I've brought someone special to the  Site of Current Events 24 .

554
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:16,610
She's someone who's known to be candidate Jo Tae Seop's closest aide.

555
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,620
You said you'll make an important announcement today to the citizens.

556
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:25,730
 Yes. I am Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's executive assistant, Han Ji Won.

557
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,620
 The assemblyman is someone who always worries about our country's future.

558
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,720
 And he is someone who's sincere.

559
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,700
 However, there's something I have come to know while standing beside the assemblyman for over ten years.

560
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,060
 Political power

561
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,090
 I need your help, Hui Ah.

562
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,560
 It's an opportunity to catch Jo Tae Seop.

563
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,900
Reporter Kim Han Mi has done something amazing.

564
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,980
 I won't say that I have no regrets.

565
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,470
Viewership will increase and it'll also become an issue. Isn't it good, Director?

566
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:53,780
If it goes wrong, the risk to us...

567
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:58,000
Which side's risk do you think, will be greater?

568
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,950
Whatever the circumstance, don't end the broadcast.

569
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,580
If you want to continue to get our advertisements.

570
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,900
I won't say that it was wrong from the start.

571
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:14,480
However, there were certainly problems in Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's process.

572
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,910
While I don't know if the objective was right, he was not upright in his methods.

573
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,200
To maintain power, he moved enormous sums of government funds,

574
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,550
and I also very clearly witnessed people being sacrificed.

575
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:35,870
 He has a lot of shops and villas around here.

576
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:40,750
 The bastard's wealth is about 200 billion, but if we take out the debt, it should be about 100 billion.

577
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:45,080
 Since you, CEO Park, do banking, you know how to set the table.

578
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,610
 - Right?
 - Should I bring you everything?

579
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:50,800
 He seemed to be a man of a certain age,

580
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,690
 so that he can use his wealth properly for his country at last,

581
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:55,820
 assist him.

582
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,560
Building political funds.

583
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,940
 I suggest you offer him a carrot first.

584
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,620
 By giving the position of the Central District Prosecutor and cultivating Kim Seok Hun,

585
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,380
 continue to maintain command over the prosecution, you say?

586
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,400
Command over the prosecution.

587
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,390
 Manager Han, isn't there anything that's prepared?

588
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:11,150
 A man installed hidden cameras to spy on newscasters.

589
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,600
 Go with that.

590
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,660
Driving public opinion.

591
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,160
 Kim Hui Wu, that bastard, doesn't he appear dangerous?

592
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,200
 Find out, from beginning to end.

593
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,490
 Investigate him without leaving out a thing.

594
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,720
Investigations into individuals.

595
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:35,400
And the assemblyman has made my older brother into a murderer.

596
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,100
We cannot change the world through the assemblyman's methods.

597
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,380
 Please stop now, Assemblyman.

598
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,630
Do not become more of a monster.

599
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:49,850
I beg you.

600
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:59,450
Assemblyman, is Manager Han's disclosure the truth? Please give us a comment.

601
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:04,040
I am sorry to the public for not providing a policy discussion

602
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,440
but a debate only filled with suspicion.

603
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,360
And now, they are using my confidante as well.

604
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,820
It's a regrettable night.

605
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:21,230
Dear citizens, until the entire truth is brought to light,

606
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,430
I hope you will maintain objectivity.

607
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,570
I trust you, dear citizens.

608
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,610
How do you know CEO Park Dae Ho of DH Money?

609
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,960
- How do you know CEO Park Dae Ho?
- Excuse us.

610
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,220
Excuse us.

611
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,030
Give us an explanation.

612
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,380
Please make way.

613
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,820
Sir, give us a comment.

614
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,330
What do you have to say?

615
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,210
- Do you admit you did it?
 - Is it true?

616
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:42,310
It's me.

617
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:45,570
Assemblyman, do not worry.

618
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,500
I'll get everything dismissed for lack of evidence.

619
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,210
Alright.

620
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:58,480
Give us a comment, please.

621
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,160
Bring Manager Han.

622
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,230
Please get in, candidate Kim Hui Wu sent us.

623
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,750
We are being followed right now.

624
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:41,920
 The political world is wavering after the claims made by a former prosecutor.

625
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,890
 Former prosecutor Kim and Assemblyman Jo's associate,

626
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:48,500
 Manager Han Ji Won's testimony and evidential material.

627
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,890
 Countless allegations of Jo accepting billions in bribes and claims of abusing his power

628
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:55,980
 will greatly affect his future.

629
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,720
 The shocking revelations made by former prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

630
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,160
 brought focus on the deeply rooted collusion between politics...

631
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,180
Let's go.

632
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,730
Stop now. I'm not going.

633
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:45,750
The assemblyman says he wants to see you.

634
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,910
Go alone.

635
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,050
Then, I can't help it.

636
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,600
Let go of Manager Han Ji Won.

637
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,310
It's finished. It stops here.

638
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,820
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop will end up going to jail.

639
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:34,340
The assemblyman, not you, decides the end.

640
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,290
Yeon Seok, are you okay?

641
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,160
 From my memory,

642
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,730
 I erase you today.

643
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,780
Hyeong, hurry!

644
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,630
Stop!

645
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,750
Stop, please.

646
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:45,190
He's my older brother.

647
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:49,650
The one who can't remember me.

648
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,630
I admit it.

649
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:27,380
Assemblyman, I'm sorry.

650
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,550
I failed.

651
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,630
I understand.

652
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:45,010
Go. It's the assemblyman's order.

653
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,980
Here.

654
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:03,970
It's me, Kim Hui Wu.

655
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:06,020
I told you

656
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:11,670
that you can't catch me. Maybe if you had eliminated me,

657
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:16,650
leaving me like this means you weren't able to change the present.

658
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:21,010
It means you weren't able to accomplish the mission you were given.

659
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:26,150
The accountability for that is not something you can mete out.

660
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:31,170
It's me, Jo Tae Seop. It's something I myself must call to account.

661
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,490
I'll wait and see

662
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:38,190
for the Republic of Korea that you will make.

663
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,370
Now you won't need to hide.

664
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:16,220
I'll go...

665
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,820
to jail.

666
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:28,570
In working with Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop, I also committed a lot of wrong things.

667
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:32,590
If there is no witness, you won't be able to catch him.

668
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:38,720
You know. That Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop is someone like that.

669
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,790
Have I come too far?

670
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,400
Manager Han.

671
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,250
Manager Kim.

672
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,710
 While Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's whereabouts are unknown,

673
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:39,050
 Jo Tae Seop-Gate has gone beyond the world of politics and to the prosecution.

674
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,300
- A comment, please.
- - Move!

675
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,600
 Prosecutor General Yun Jong Gi

676
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:47,280
Shall we go?

677
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,640
A moment to smoke a cigarette?

678
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,350
Quit, you bastard!

679
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,140
Proceed.

680
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:10,100
 Seoul Central Detention Center

681
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:14,510
Although it's prison life, I feel good.

682
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:17,470
Now I'm going to live completely for myself.

683
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:23,070
I'll help you so that you can live a splendid life after you finish your sentence.

684
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:31,540
Then, will I, like you, also be able to have good friends beside me?

685
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:37,210
I was envious of Reporter Kim Han Mi and Chairwoman Kim Hui Ah.

686
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,750
That there were friends like them.

687
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,160
I'll help you with that too.

688
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,100
But there's something I'm curious about.

689
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:54,820
Why did you decide to do the expose?

690
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,680
You said so yourself.

691
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,300
 I know now.

692
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:07,100
 That, if I decide to live, what I won't be able to catch is Jo Tae Seop.

693
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:16,350
 Unless it's a monster even worse, the devil

694
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:19,050
 cannot be caught.

695
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:24,150
I only had the thought that I will have to expose Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop's crimes someday.

696
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:29,690
The truth was that I was an assistant who received Assemblyman Jo's orders and carried out evil deeds in his stead.

697
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:34,930
One who couldn't get away from him despite knowing it was wrong.

698
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:39,480
However, to catch Jo Tae Seop, to safeguard justice,

699
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,940
throwing away everything, you jumped into the fire with Jo Taep Seop.

700
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:48,080
While I watched you, I felt a pang of conscience.

701
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:51,690
I didn't want to beg for my life anymore.

702
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,650
What you said and did during that time,

703
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:58,990
seeing you who read my thoughts exactly.

704
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:03,630
While I couldn't understand it, I thought if it was this person.

705
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:10,220
Perhaps if it is this person, it might even be possible.

706
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:17,060
Approaching Han Mi at that time was an excellent choice.

707
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,960
It's because I knew she was your friend.

708
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,420
I thought she was someone I could trust.

709
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:27,540
Yes, the timing was the best.

710
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:31,760
Because of the thought that there may never be an opportunity if it wasn't this time,

711
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,620
I didn't have time to hesitate.

712
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:38,380
I was also certain that you would take care of what's left.

713
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,520
Thank you for trusting me.

714
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,850
 Let's meet.

715
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,390
Silent to the end.

716
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:01,930
Then, can we view it as meaning that you acknowledge all charges?

717
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:09,380
If I'm guilty of something, it's that I could not complete the assemblyman's orders.

718
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:14,120
That's not something for you to decide.

719
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,390
This one's crazy. Crazy...

720
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:20,910
This one's crazy.

721
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,920
But what can we do. I'm also crazy.

722
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,450
How does it feel to eat in the prosecutors' cafeteria coming in as an outsider?

723
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:39,950
It doesn't feel real. And as if I must go up to the office right away and work.

724
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:45,970
Hey, I watched a debate with anxiety for the first time ever.

725
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,110
What kind of person was Jo Tae Seop.

726
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:51,060
The look in his eyes felt as if it were penetrating even into my heart.

727
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:54,520
If I weren't a genius at acting, it probably would have been really obvious.

728
01:00:56,290 --> 01:01:00,000
 Kim Hui Wu. I need you to be my ticket.

729
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,790
 - Ticket?
- Mmhm.

730
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:09,800
 Let me ask you. Have you really bowed? To Jo Tae Seop?

731
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:15,190
 Do you really mean to have a go at me?

732
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:19,870
 Hui Wu, I don't like people around me getting hurt.

733
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:26,180
 So leave it to me and stop. At this point.

734
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:30,310
 Seonbae, you will never be able to win against Jo Tae Seop.

735
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:34,730
 Even before fighting, you are getting worried about me.

736
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:43,040
 What can we do? Since I can't tell you to stop.

737
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:49,090
 To win over Jo Tae Seop, I will do whatever.

738
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:54,480
 Even if you get hurt, I'll pretend not to know.

739
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,600
 Will you still do it?

740
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,880
 Of course, a life-or-death game is fun.

741
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,410
Thank you.

742
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:11,580
Thanks to you leaking material about the bullying, my work became much easier.

743
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:14,910
But wasn't it really bullying?

744
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:18,830
No way. I can swear to the universe that there isn't a single speck—

745
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:20,550
There must be.

746
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:23,210
- There isn't.
 - There probably is.

747
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,930
 Despite the joint search by the prosecution and police,

748
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:29,990
 the whereabouts of the former assemblyman, Jo Tae Seop, are unknown.

749
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:36,200
 But a dead body, presumed to belong to Former Assemblyman Jo, has been found on a nearby shoreline of Daemyeong Beach.

750
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,910
 The police requested a DNA test...

751
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:41,960
Do you think the person who was discovered there is really Jo Tae Seop?

752
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,450
I confirmed the report that the DNA matched.

753
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:48,570
Only in games, he could come back to life.

754
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,400
This is so annoying.

755
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,810
We got all of them. But why don't I feel relieved?

756
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:59,150
It's probably because there's no one who's received proper punishment.

757
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:02,360
They weaseled their way out or left the world behind.

758
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,210
Jang Il Hyeon, probation and a fine. Park Dae Ho, probation and a fine.

759
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:09,070
Kim Seok Hun, a special pardon on Independence Day.

760
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:12,550
They say even Jeon Il Bo could get out. Does this make any sense? This?

761
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:17,220
Of course, it doesn't make sense. So we have to catch them a hundred, a thousand times and lock them up.

762
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:21,510
Bro, you're not a prosecutor anymore.

763
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:24,020
Ah. That's right.

764
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,500
Right.

765
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,150
Leave that to me, and you?

766
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:31,920
Make a world worth living in.

767
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,890
Yes, I'll do so.

768
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:38,060
I'm blinded.

769
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,430
 Assemblyman's badge.

770
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:42,550
Ah, I apologize.

771
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,780
Let's eat.

772
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:48,820
"Politics isn't about filling people's deficiencies. But it's about creating what people need."

773
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:54,100
"That way, people will vote for me again to treat another deficiency they have."

774
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,390
 "The Walk of the Day"

775
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:01,400
Hey, Park Sang Man. I bet this is what you want to tell me. Right?

776
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,620
What's so interesting about this that you're reading it?

777
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:07,130
I, I don't think I can read this.

778
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:10,660
If you want to read it, wake up and read it yourself.

779
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,610
Kid.

780
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,720
 Closed for today, Sorry!

781
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:55,470
All right. A man I have such deep respect for, Mr. Wu Yong Su, is here today

782
01:04:55,470 --> 01:05:00,550
along with many of my acquaintances who must be busy.

783
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:03,600
I'll tell you why I called for this meeting.

784
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:10,230
We will postpone our wedding.

785
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:11,740
- But why?
- But why?

786
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:15,870
Actually, we just started dating.

787
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:19,030
We just need some time to get to know each other.

788
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:23,570
To be honest, we weren't really dating when we announced our marriage.

789
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:26,870
We felt hurried while we were trying to catch Jo Tae Seop.

790
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:30,240
To bring him down, we met often and spent a lot of time together.

791
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,180
♫  frozen time  ♫

792
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,620
♫  I really want  ♫

793
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:35,390
And we ended up dating.

794
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:39,590
The order of things happened to get reversed.

795
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:41,190
♫  And if I get another chance  ♫

796
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:43,400
Then what's this?

797
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,670
Oh, that. You can open it now.

798
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:47,870
♫  I'll let it burn fire  ♫

799
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:50,270
What? Then why did they print wedding invitations already?

800
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:52,090
Bali.

801
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:52,840
Bali?

802
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,250
 Bali Pasut Beach
♫  I wanna rise higher  ♫

803
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,870
Yes.

804
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:58,890
You must have been shocked because of our news.

805
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:03,910
As a way to apologize, I'm going to send you on a trip!

806
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:08,850
Why don't we all go to Bali, paradise on earth?

807
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:13,850
I knew it. That's why I've been practicing Bali dance.

808
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:16,340
Wait. I have another announcement!

809
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:19,710
Chairwoman of Cheonha Kim Hui Ah will bring you to Bali

810
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:22,510
on a chartered plane!

811
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:31,580
♪  I've got peace like a river  ♪

812
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:35,490
♪  I've got peace like a river  ♪

813
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:39,600
♪  I've got peace like a river  ♪

814
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,760
♪  Oh, peace  ♪

815
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,300
My cologne.

816
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:02,800
Great.

817
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:07,460
This is the best cologne to get rid of the smell of blood.

818
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:19,060
By the way, people these days are so rude. You know?

819
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:23,010
Hey. You!

820
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:31,100
Who signs your paychecks?

821
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,460
Chairwoman Cheon signs your paychecks.

822
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:37,800
Then how dare you run to the prosecutor

823
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,470
and expose her embezzlement?

824
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:44,090
Does the prosecutor pay you?

825
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:57,130
- Take care of him.
- Yes, sir.

826
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,380
Why the long faces?

827
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,890
We're not at a funeral.

828
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,380
Hey.

829
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:43,670
I'm sure you all know

830
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:48,210
I had to jump through so many hoops

831
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:50,970
to get you out of Kim Hui Wu and his crew's clutches.

832
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,410
So show me some smiles.

833
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:58,250
Then all my hard work will feel rewarding. Okay?

834
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:02,140
Hey, Choi Kang Jin. Smile.

835
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,560
Okay.

836
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:07,730
Lawyer Cha. I want your explanation.

837
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:10,260
Why did you bring us here?

838
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:17,670
Chairwoman Cheon Ho Ryeong will be here soon.

839
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:20,980
She will tell you why you're here.

840
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:26,270
And you just need to be careful of one thing.

841
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:28,280
Don't shake your leg.

842
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,990
She hates it because it chases away good luck.

843
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,950
The chairwoman is coming in.

844
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:46,540
It's been a while.

845
01:09:56,990 --> 01:10:01,110
You must be curious why I brought you all here.

846
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:03,950
I want to help you

847
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:07,350
go back to your old lives.

848
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:14,940
The secret club Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop made.

849
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,160
I would like to bring it back.

850
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:22,280
As for that, Hwang Jin Yong and Kim Hui Wu are watching us like hawks.

851
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,900
What can't money solve?

852
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:32,370
Kim Seok Hun. If you want, I'll get you your job back in the prosecution.

853
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:36,730
Gu Wuk Cheong. If you want, run in the next general election.

854
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:40,200
What? Are you serious?

855
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:42,600
But, ma'am.

856
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,240
What? Do you want your old job back?

857
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,850
Desperately.

858
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:51,050
But you were never interested in gaining power.

859
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:53,390
I'm still not interested.

860
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:56,020
I just want one thing.

861
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:00,720
That no one dares challenge Jehwang Group even if I'm not around.

862
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:04,950
Even if Hwang Jin Yong and Kim Hui Wu try to bring it down with their petty sense of justice,

863
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:08,770
Jehwang Group will not falter.

864
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:15,250
A world where my son, my daughter, and my grandson can rule forever.

865
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:21,190
You can get the power you seek. And I can make an ironclad company.

866
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:26,370
We'll be good partners because we want different things.

867
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:32,760
Do you know why Assemblyman Jo failed?

868
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,770
Because he tried to have everything.

869
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:40,720
Power, money, and even the justificiation.

870
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:46,620
I'm different. Power belongs to you. You can keep it.

871
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,040
I

872
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,050
only need money.

873
01:11:55,950 --> 01:12:00,030
All right. Join hands with me.

874
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:03,560
Jang Il Hyeon.

875
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,790
Stop shaking your leg.

876
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:15,690
All right. Why don't we raise our glasses?

877
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:21,990
Cheers to Chairwoman Cheon Ho Ryeong of Jehwang Group!

878
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:24,180
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

879
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:36,720
Gosh. Come on, smile.

880
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:40,050
Choi Kang Jin, aren't you happy?

881
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:03,660
 Trash that I must get rid of still remains.

882
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:16,340
 A country can survive even after a war.

883
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:21,410
 A country can also survive disease and poverty.

884
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:28,390
 But a country without justice will not be able to survive in the end.

885
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:33,990

886
01:13:35,090 --> 01:13:39,090

887
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,930

888
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:49,020

889
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:54,080

890
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:59,470

891
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:05,720

892
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:12,080
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

893
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,340
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

894
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:21,410
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

895
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:31,090
♫  Who would ever find out who you really are? Hm  ♫

896
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:39,070
 Again My Life
♫  You'll never know that I will throw off your disguise  ♫

897
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:41,490
♫  Oh let me show you how to start  ♫

898
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:49,230
♫  Wait, Till the end I don't care what they say  ♫

899
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:55,250
♫  At the end, They'll know there's no where to hide  ♫

900
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:02,610
♫  Oh I'll wait for now  ♫

901
01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:06,110
♫  Let them get what they want  ♫

902
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:11,320
♫  At the end, I'll get that chance to beat them  ♫

903
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:15,890

904
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:17,850
 Again My Life
