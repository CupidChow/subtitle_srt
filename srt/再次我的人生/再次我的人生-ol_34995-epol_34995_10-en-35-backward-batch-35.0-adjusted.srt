1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,790
 Lee Joon Gi

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,880
 Lee Kyung Young

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,300
 Kim Ji Eun

5
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:35,270
 Again My Life

6
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,600
 Episode 10

7
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,250
He'll need every assemblyman's help.

8
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,500
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

9
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,180
 What's this?

10
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,930
 Pandora's box.

11
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,290
 Public Officials' Children who evaded Military Service

12
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,460
 - This is...
 - Yes.

13
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,130
 It's as you see.

14
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,600
 What do you want me to do?

15
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,620
 Bring it up at the National Assembly.

16
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,510
 This will destroy the country.

17
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,040
 But you will gain power again.

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,600
 You're the only one...

19
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,960
 who can open this box.

20
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,150
 The moment you open the box, the world will be in an uproar.

21
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,730
 But people will be able to see the last ray of hope.

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,900
Assemblyman Hwang. Stop objecting just for the sake of objecting.

23
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,510
The Minister of Justice position...

24
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,170
shouldn't be left vacant for too long.

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,280
If the candidate was truly qualified for the position,

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,850
you'd have nothing to worry about.

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,590
 Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong remains strongly opposed.

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,770
 They will yet again struggle to reach an agreement at the confirmation hearing for the Minister of Justice candidate.

29
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,330
 Here's the Legislation and Judiciary Committee, where the hearing is being held.

30
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,320
 We will now begin the confirmation hearing for the Minister of Justice nominee.

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,560
 Pandora's box is about to be opened.

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,980
 Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong.

33
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,500
 You may ask questions.

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,770
Yes. What are your thoughts on public officials' children...

35
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,100
purposely evading their military service?

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,220
Pardon?

37
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,630
I received this list from an informant who wishes to remain anonymous.

38
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,910
This list includes the names of high-ranking public officials' children who

39
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,750
avoided military service through a broker.

40
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,050
It contains the names of 37 people,

41
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,820
which includes the children of some of the assemblymen

42
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,280
who are here now.

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,730
It is of utmost importance that public officials

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:36,010
always act with ethical awareness. Yet their children are guilty of military service evasion.

45
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,790
Are you confident that you can handle this fairly and justly?

46
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,690
I am asking you if you can do it.

47
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,990
The nation is watching.

48
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,410
Please answer my question.

49
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,160
Yes. If they broke the law, they should—

50
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,740
Assemblyman Hwang! Can you take responsibility for what you're saying right now?!

51
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,060
Responsibility? Yes, I can and I will.

52
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,910
However, you'll be under investigation too, Assemblyman Park.

53
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,710
And of course, the 37 people on this list, including your son,

54
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,310
will be re-examined for military enlistment.

55
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,680
I have another question for the nominee.

56
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,080
What are your thoughts on narcotics law violations committed by

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,800
some celebrities and high-ranking public officials' family members?

58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,270
- Narcotics?
- Yes.

59
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,070
Narcotics.

60
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:22,530
In this document are names of about 50 drug offenders,

61
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,830
which includes the children of the lawmakers present.

62
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,870
How will you proceed?

63
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,600
I will follow the procedure established by the law—

64
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,440
Forget it.

65
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,880
Lastly, let me ask one more question to the Minister of Justice nominee.

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,490
Nominee, have you ever received sexual favors?

67
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,300
"Sexual favors"?

68
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,040
Assemblyman Hwang, are you here to cause trouble?

69
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,850
Why bring up something irrelevant and make everyone uncomfortable?

70
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,380
Be quiet. I'm not done talking.

71
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,000
Nominee, I asked if you ever received sexual favors.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,330
- No, never.
 - You're lying.

73
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,380
Never? Are you sure?

74
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,230
 Jo Tae Seop

75
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,750
I'm asking because your name is on this sexual bribery list.

76
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,670
Assemblyman Hwang, stop talking nonsense!

77
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,190
How dare you spread false information?

78
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,830
Did you say "false information"?

79
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,800
False information? Assemblyman Kim, Assemblyman Yoo.

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,270
Your names are on this list too!

81
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,820
- What?
- What did you say?

82
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,090
Assemblymen, do you think this is normal?

83
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,500
These people are not qualified to be participating

84
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,890
in this confirmation hearing for the Minister of Justice nominee.

85
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,240
They have no right to be judging anyone's qualifications.

86
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,220
All right. Now,

87
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,880
I will read out the names on this list one by one.

88
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,020
Assemblyman Hwang! Have you lost your mind?

89
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,420
Hey! Turn off the cameras!

90
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,880
- Turn off the cameras!
- Hey, the cameras!

91
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,800
Park Su Nam,

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,630
Choi Hyeon Min,

93
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,710
Han Il Gu,

94
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,650
Park Ju Hyeon.

95
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,820
Stop!

96
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,850
- What are you doing?
- Calm down!

97
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,560
Order! Please be seated!

98
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,260
Order!

99
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,000
Order!

100
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,750
Assemblyman Lee! Go back to your seat!

101
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,330
Go back to your seat!

102
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,800
 Minister of Justice Nominee Alleged to Have Received Sexual Favors

103
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,880
It's begun.

104
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,410
- Let's move on it.
 - Okay.

105
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,710
What happened to the search warrant for SHC Entertainment?

106
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,060
The chief said not to worry. It will be issued soon.

107
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,900
Okay.

108
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,530
- Check the witnesses involved in sexual favors again!
 - Yes, ma'am

109
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,910
 What?! A search warrant?!

110
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,050
Crazy wench!

111
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,440
Yes, I understand, Father.

112
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,160
I’ll take care of the most urgent things first. Yes, Father.

113
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:06,140
Hey Kim Hui Wu, I have to go out for a sec. Let me know if you need me.

114
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,710
Is something wrong?

115
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,510
Nothing special.

116
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,740
An obstacle coming from someone I never imagined.

117
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,950
Is there anything I can help you with?

118
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,980
It's fine.

119
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,490
Just stay here and figure out what's going on.

120
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,060
At times like these, you sure move fast.

121
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,580
When I needed your help, you didn’t even return my calls.

122
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,540
A prosecutor came by. She was curious.

123
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,190
Drugs and celebrity sexual favors, and you, who are behind it.

124
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,030
- Which prosecutor?
 - Well...

125
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,430
Is that important now?

126
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,410
It looks like what matters now is how you feel.

127
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,340
Tell me how you feel. Are you ready to make a deal?

128
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,600
 Public Officials' Children Who Evaded Military Service

129
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,100
Sir, it's the Prosecutor General for you.

130
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,100
Did you say SHC Entertainment? Stop all activities.

131
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,570
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office will take charge of the investigation.

132
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,840
I’ll check the list here. Okay.

133
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,460
Military evasion, drugs, sexual favors.

134
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,890
The whole Republic of Korea is covered in corruption.

135
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,170
How many in total?

136
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,450
Related persons have 37 irregularities in military service, 50 are involved with drugs,

137
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,920
and 16 are involved in bribes with sexual favors.

138
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,010
In total, there are about 100 people on the list.

139
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,760
Of these, about 20 people are involved with SHC Entertainment.

140
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,620
Who do we have to take care of?

141
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,770
I think it’s a little over ten people, but it’ll be difficult to save all of them.

142
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,170
Especially for Assemblymen Kim and Yun who received attention at the hearing over sexual favors,

143
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,620
an investigation is inevitable.

144
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,740
What a waste.

145
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,280
- The press?
 - It'll be hard to stop.

146
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,000
Assemblyman Hwang's comments are spreading quickly over the internet.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,640
I see.

148
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,130
Then let the media do what they want instead of stopping.

149
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,790
I'm sure Assemblyman Hwang thought

150
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,070
that the revelation cut off my limbs.

151
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,020
But his judgment is faulty.

152
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,300
This incident will make me even stronger.

153
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,850
Only some of the contents of Hwang Jin Yong's list have been revealed.

154
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,750
All the guilty ones are probably feeling nervous right now,

155
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,670
wondering whether their names are on the list or not.

156
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,740
Tell the people on this list

157
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,770
that if they want to live, come see me.

158
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,540
Yes, sir.

159
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,740
- Connect me to Kim Seok Hun.
 - Yes, sir.

160
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,570
Yes, Assemblyman. I understand. I'll do that.

161
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,140
- Prepare a press conference.
 - What?

162
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,820
Our office will take over the investigation of Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong's list.

163
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,090
Not the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office?

164
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,150
They are only going to investigate the SHC Entertainment case.

165
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,630
Yes, sir.

166
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,570
Tell all the reporters that we'll tell them everything Assemblyman Hwang didn't get to say.

167
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,970
- Yes, sir.
 - It’s a golden opportunity to change the negative opinion about the prosecution.

168
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,180
We’ll be busy for a while. Get ready for it.

169
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,310
Oh, and also investigate Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong.

170
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,060
Whether there were any illegal actions taken in order to get his hands on the list.

171
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,000
You get my meaning?

172
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,950
Yes, sir.

173
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,040
Then get to work. Also,

174
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,780
tell Kang Jin to come see me as soon as he gets back.

175
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,860
Yes, sir.

176
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,490
Our district office took over the investigation of the list.

177
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,440
You're also going to be investigated on how you got that list.

178
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,650
That was expected.

179
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,620
Yes. But, it was Jo Tae Seop who gave the order.

180
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,990
What? Jo Tae Seop?

181
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,340
So he did...

182
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,410
 It wouldn't be enough for him to stop the investigation, but he ordered it?

183
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,530
Jo Tae Seop did...

184
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,130
Yes.

185
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,490
 Again My Life

186
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,880
Have you come to your senses now?

187
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,420
Sunbae, please save me.

188
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,340
I never thought the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office would target my father's company since I was focused on Kim Hui Wu and the Gimsan gang.

189
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,470
Launching a sneak attack by using his university colleague...

190
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,970
As expected, Kim Hui Wu is smart.

191
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,270
So, what did you do with Jo Yun Ah?

192
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,320
I managed to calm her down and hid her away, but it won't last long.

193
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,550
If she decides to talk, there's nothing I can do to stop her.

194
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,820
I'm sure.

195
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,770
The president of the production company who made her take propofol habitually by using plastic surgery as bait

196
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:18,780
and used that against her for sexual favors.

197
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,020
And the prosecutor who kept all that under wraps.

198
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,740
It's perfect gossip for busybodies.

199
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,420
I wanted Kim Hui Wu to end up here with me,

200
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,570
- but it looks like you might.
 - Sunbae!

201
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,540
I hear you perfectly well, so don't yell, you bastard.

202
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,980
Sunbae, you won't be able to get out if I end up here, too.

203
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,950
If you help me out this once,  I swear that I'll get you out.

204
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,430
Well, there is one solution.

205
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,460
 There is only one person who can save you now.

206
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,680
  You know it's not free, right?

207
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,670
 Don't try to pull one on me and do it properly.

208
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,180
 How could this happen out of the blue?

209
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,670
- Who knew?
- Goodness.

210
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,730
Assemblyman Jang!

211
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,770
How did this happen?

212
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,130
The ones in power who came to see the assemblyman are here to save themselves.

213
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,460
Thanks to Assemblyman Hwang, the assemblyman has become more powerful.

214
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,890
 I think citizen distrust of leadership will continue to grow.

215
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,130
 There are sexual favor scandals and military corruption.

216
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,550
 I wish lawmakers and assemblymen would be a little more ethical in their actions.

217
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,190
There's been a commotion all day.

218
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,630
I apologize. Since you instructed us not to respond to the media—

219
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,460
No. You did well.

220
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,650
The media wants to do their part, so let's just leave them alone for now.

221
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:30,410
Thanks to them, weeding becomes easier.

222
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,540
I never thought Assemblyman Hwang would end up helping me.

223
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,060
With real cooperation over this incident...

224
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,640
the parties will become united.

225
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,380
- Should I go welcome the guests?
 - Yes.

226
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,550
I mean seriously. Look at what happened to him.

227
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,920
I told you.

228
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,760
I'm watching intently.

229
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,360
Sinners should not be standing!

230
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,680
Should I stop them for you?

231
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,510
Answer me! Should I stop them?

232
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,700
Yes.

233
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,260
- Assemblyman Kim.
 - Yes?

234
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,690
How did you get here?

235
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,660
Wh-Wh-What happened was—

236
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,600
Are you too embarrassed to even say it?

237
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,770
If you know to feel shame, how could you give in to momentary pleasure so easily?

238
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,130
It was my mistake.

239
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,890
- Assemblymen Jang and Park!
 - Yes.

240
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,930
Didn't you oppose my bill last time?

241
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,040
It'll never happen again.

242
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,080
- Never.
 - Please forgive us.

243
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,840
Do you understand what a politically sensitive and dangerous time this is?

244
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,320
For the nation to properly function, the politicians must come to their senses!

245
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,870
Is being a representative of the people something to take so lightly?

246
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,320
- I'm sorry.
 - I was wrong
 - I apologize.

247
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,330
Regardless of political party, aren't we all the people who should be leading the country?

248
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,330
I've debated it all day.

249
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:30,000
How I should save you all, who have worked with me to serve this country.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,430
My conclusion is that true cooperation and

251
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,420
sincere public service. Only people who

252
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,020
pledge this will have their names removed from the list.

253
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,180
Thank you.

254
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,410
But! I can't save all of you.

255
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,450
If I did that, the people wouldn't trust us.

256
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,550
Some of you need to be prepared.

257
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,440
Don't feel resentful. Instead, do some self-reflection.

258
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,850
I hope that you think of it as you having saved another.

259
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,680
I, Jo Tae Seop, promise you.

260
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,870
The people who have sacrificed for the greater good,

261
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,260
I'll take care of you until the end.

262
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,360
Call Kim Seok Hun here.

263
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,530
Yes, sir.

264
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,430
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,500
 It feels ominous.

266
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,160
We've only just begun. Why are you putting a damper on it?

267
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,620
I went to see a doctor involved in the military service evasion to secure him as a witness.

268
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,320
Wasn't that doctor going to testify?

269
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,560
Yes, but I can't get in touch with him.

270
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,930
What did you say?

271
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,990
The hospital says he's away on vacation, and his family says he's away attending a seminar.

272
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:04,650
He was definitely working at the hospital to yesterday but suddenly disappeared.

273
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,620
Let's check the departures list tomorrow.

274
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,850
Since it happened today, he couldn't have gone far.

275
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,690
We should double check our witnesses, too.

276
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,090
Don't worry, I'll make sure to take care of it.

277
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:20,490
Choi Kang Jin's arrest warrant came out. I'll summon him tomorrow.

278
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,960
Gyu Ri, don't be mistaken. Choi Kang Jin is not an easy target.

279
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,200
Sunbae, I'm not that easy to deal with either.

280
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,500
I'm already looking forward to whatever scheme Choi Kang Jin will come up with.

281
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:47,070
I'm offended. I don't like people who show up without an appointment.

282
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,760
I apologize for offending you.

283
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,550
This is the price of my life.

284
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,890
Please take a look and make your judgment.

285
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,630
I'll look at it later.

286
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,790
Do you want to live?

287
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,130
Then bring your father's head.

288
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,130
- Choi Kang Jin.
 - Chief Prosecutor!

289
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,080
- Did you come to beg for your life?
 - It ended up that way.

290
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,660
How dare you come here?

291
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,740
The assemblyman is waiting for you.

292
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,780
Come to my office as soon as you get to work tomorrow.

293
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,090
- You only need to investigate the people on this list.
 - Yes.

294
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,240
-  I'll take care of the rest.
 - Yes, sir.

295
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,390
Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin stopped by.

296
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,110
Yes. I met him outside.

297
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,270
He was really scared.

298
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,470
I apologize. It was disrespectful to you.

299
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,640
It's not that.

300
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,820
He must have been feeling desperate to come looking for me.

301
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,700
- Yes, sir.
 - I gave him an assignment.

302
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,740
So make your decision after checking that assignment.

303
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,060
Whether I can use him instead of Jang Il Hyeon.

304
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:46,990
Now his life is in your hands.

305
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,670
You decide whether to end him or to let him live.

306
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,870
Yes, sir.

307
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,730
You should have come to me first.

308
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,120
I apologize. I was in a rush.

309
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,040
So, you went to see Jo Tae Seop directly?

310
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,930
I'm so sorry.

311
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,020
I won't let you off twice.

312
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,010
Yes, it won't happen again.

313
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,130
I need to teach you a lesson first. The Eastern District Prosecutors' Office has a warrant, so answer the summons.

314
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,070
Chief Prosecutor...

315
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,220
I just got off the phone with the East District Chief Prosecutor.

316
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,970
Before that, you need to keep the promise you made to Jo Yun Ah.

317
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,180
Yes, sir.

318
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,170
And I've already spoken to my father.

319
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,990
Come in.

320
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,300
 List of children of high-ranking officials for corruption in military enlistment

321
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,500
 Among the people Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong exposed,

322
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,710
 the most important figures have been excluded.

323
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,270
 This is a list with only the minor players who've been abandoned.

324
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,120
Make sure to punish those on the list.

325
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,580
- Yes, but...
 - What is it?

326
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,690
It seems to be different than what Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong revealed.

327
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:31,400
Assemblyman Hwang only brought up the suspicion. All we need to do is investigate the facts.

328
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,940
If there is an omission, there must be a reason for it.

329
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,180
Stop questioning it and proceed.

330
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,500
- Yes, sir.
- You can leave.

331
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,560
Is Kim Gyu Ri the prosecutor who issued my arrest warrant?

332
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,060
Is that right?

333
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,120
Isn't it amazing?

334
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,000
As soon as Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong exposed the list,

335
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,520
the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office went into action. That means

336
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,420
the investigation into this matter had already been under way.

337
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:31,190
Who possibly could have given the list to Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong?

338
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,340
I’m planning to find out. The chief prosecutor instructed me to as well.

339
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,640
You're smarter than that.

340
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,500
It's obvious. It must have leaked from the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.

341
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,790
Or someone tipped off Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong and the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office at the same time.

342
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,100
If you're curious to know, I will report back to you after I carry out the investigation.

343
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,890
Okay. Make sure you do.

344
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,500
Yes, sir.

345
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,460
This is the indictment filed by prosecutor Choi Kang Jin against Choi Soo Hyeok, the CEO of SHC Entertainment.

346
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,860
He saved himself by giving up his father.

347
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,290
What happened to the witnesses?

348
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,480
The doctor who was involved in the military service evasion corruption left the country today.

349
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,010
And on the sexual favor matter, I’m in the process of contacting the celebrities and wanna-be celebrities involved.

350
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,320
They're young people with dreams. Support them well so that they don't raise any issues.

351
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,150
Yes, sir. I'll get them to settle for a transfer of agency or cancellation of penalty for breach of contract.

352
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,590
Okay.

353
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,210
Since it's such a sensational issue, it may be hard to cover up.

354
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,720
We'll have a plan B ready using what prosecutor Choi Kang Jin gave us.

355
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,740
- Have you gathered the representatives from both parties without the press?
- Yes, sir.

356
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,360
Let's go.

357
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,910
The sky is very clear today.

358
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,300
Let's go.

359
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,430
Hello, sir.

360
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,900
Please take a seat.

361
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,690
The moment we have to work together has finally come.

362
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,320
Thanks to Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong, the country is up in arms.

363
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,290
I'm sure you've all heard already.

364
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,560
I've been turning the nation's attention to other things for the time being.

365
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,510
But you can't cover the sky with your palm.

366
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:35,910
Before I got here, I tried to cover the sky with my hand because it was so bright out.

367
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:42,450
But the light came through. I couldn't help but see the sunlight coming through my fingers.

368
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:48,550
A question here. Is there a way to cover the sky with the palm of your hand?

369
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,860
Yes, if you take a palm

370
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,650
and cover both eyes.

371
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,640
Then you can't see the sky even if you tried.

372
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:10,600
So, have you found a way to soothe the exploding public sentiment?

373
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,580
Turn people's attention to problems that affect their livelihood!

374
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,860
Leak it out to reporters that you're working on a bill that will raise taxes significantly.

375
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,990
Raising cigarettes' or soju prices are all good.

376
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,780
Tell them that you're raising the price of all goods.

377
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:31,590
Wouldn't raising taxes suddenly cause a revolt?

378
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,080
With the elections around the corner, I'm not telling you to actually raise the taxes.

379
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,040
Just spread the rumor is what I'm saying!

380
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,060
So you're saying we should shift the focus from corruption to taxes, right?

381
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,940
That's right!

382
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,980
Why do you think people are paying attention to Hwang Jin Yong’s list right now?

383
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:52,480
You're saying it's because they don't have immediate worries?

384
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,100
Finally, we're seeing eye to eye.

385
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:01,420
When public opinion turns its attention to taxes, we will not increase them but reduce them.

386
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,250
The central objective of our party is to lower taxes!

387
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,770
Yes. Do you get it now?

388
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,150
I'm suggesting that we change the focus.

389
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:14,990
Then the problematic kids of all the assemblymen will be forgotten.

390
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,720
Ah! And in the next nomination, don't include anyone who was caught in the corruption.

391
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,790
It's best to leave any flaws behind.

392
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:26,730
Since a new administration is going to be in office anyway, let's change the political circle.

393
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,350
- Okay?
 - Yes, sir.

394
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,400
You’re making a big mistake right now.

395
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,670
A mistake?

396
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,250
Prosecutors don’t punish innocent people.

397
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,610
We only punish criminals who have sinned.

398
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,610
Hey Kim Gyu Ri! Watch it. It sounds like you're talking about me.

399
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:50,830
Watch yourself, too. In here, I'm not Kim Gyu Ri but Prosecutor Kim Gyu Ri.

400
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,440
I don’t know why you're suddenly targeting me,

401
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,380
but you're making a huge mistake right now.

402
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,230
You’re the one who made the mistake.

403
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,600
You’re going to regret it soon.

404
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,070
People who are guilty talk more. You also have too much to say.

405
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,680
Watch yourself or you'll get hurt.

406
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,770
Let’s start the interrogation.

407
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,450
Go ahead, Prosecutor Kim.

408
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,820
Mr. Choi Kang Jin,

409
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:23,220
did you ever arrange a meeting between politicians and artists from SHC Entertainment?

410
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,480
I've never done that.

411
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,990
What favor did you receive in exchange for gifting sexual favors?

412
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,160
I have nothing to do with gifting sexual favors.

413
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,330
I've never even been interested in the entertainment business.

414
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:37,020
Many of the celebrities in the agency said they know you.

415
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,550
Really? Who? Bring them here.

416
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,720
Mr. Choi Kang Jin.

417
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,650
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

418
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,780
Why do my ominous premonitions always prove themselves right?

419
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:12,030
That doctor related to military corruption left Korea early this morning.

420
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,980
 Certificate of Entry &amp; Exit

421
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,320
That was quick. This means he took action right after the scandal broke.

422
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,750
That means he has someone big behind him.

423
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,960
That's right.

424
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,290
That's one thing. Gyu Ri must be panicking too.

425
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,540
- Panicking?
 - Oh my, you didn't know?

426
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,420
Search Jo Yun Ah online.

427
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,560
 Jo Yun Ah, beautiful farewell with SHC Entertainment

428
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,300
Everyone on our team got sucker punched.

429
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,380
Why? Do you have a problem too?

430
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,280
 List of children of high-ranking officials suspected of corruption in military enlistment

431
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,350
 Kim Hyeon Su, National Assembly. Second son. Exempted

432
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:06,470
- Hey, this is...
 - Yeah. They left us with a shell.

433
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,600
It's such a disgusting world.

434
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,250
I expected this, but it's worse than I thought.

435
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,820
I thought I'd at least be able to cut the tail off, but I couldn't even do that.

436
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,720
They're all nobodies.

437
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,200
I didn't do all that just to see these no-name players get locked up.

438
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,630
I'm sorry.

439
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,110
No, you have nothing to be sorry about.

440
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:43,440
I expected this from the moment you handed me the list.

441
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,410
Jo Tae Seop already took over the mass media, and knows how to use it as well.

442
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:53,580
He also knows how to cover the citizens' eyes, and how to block their ears.

443
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,760
I understand how you feel, sir.

444
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,940
However, please wait just a little while.

445
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,420
I'll arrest every one of those who escaped.

446
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,530
After seeing the way Jo Tae Seop works, have you still not realized?

447
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,690
No matter how much you try to beat him with your strength,

448
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:18,450
it's useless until the rotten prosecutor's office is completely replaced.

449
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,340
We need time.

450
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,630
We're going to bring down a huge dam with a small crack.

451
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,260
Your help is vital to make it happen.

452
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,850
Now is the beginning.

453
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:40,490
Prosecutor Kim, are you just brave or reckless?

454
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,740
I only make promises I can keep.

455
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,720
I will reveal Jo Tae Seop's real identity to the world.

456
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,220
I'll also be sure to make him pay for his crimes too.

457
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,930
I hope it's a promise you can keep.

458
00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:00,760
To be honest, I don't have much time left in the political field.

459
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,310
Do you think you can succeed within that time?

460
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,710
It's more than enough time.

461
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:11,670
I don't like the prosecutor's office, but I feel like I can trust you.

462
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:30,910
I don't like politicians, but I also feel like I can trust you.

463
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,470
One more!

464
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,200
Gyu Ri, calm down. You must be very upset.

465
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,530
She's not upset, she's livid.

466
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,450
I know.

467
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,060
Leave me alone tonight

468
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,610
since I'm feeling destructive.

469
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,980
If you say that in front of the braised chicken, you'll startle it.

470
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,550
Of course sir, braised chicken is the way to go.

471
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,090
Gyu Ri, where are your manners?

472
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,660
As I expected, you are my son.

473
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,540
How many sons do you have?

474
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,470
You said Sang Man was your son too last time.

475
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,030
Anyone who likes braised chicken is my son.

476
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:20,620
- What about Hui Wu?
 - We'll kick him off our family tree since he likes pork belly, and Min Su, who knows braised chicken is the way to go, will be...

477
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,370
He said he liked beef last time.

478
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,730
Beef?

479
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,650
Min Su, what is this?

480
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,210
Did you betray me by any chance?

481
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,800
Gyu Ri, it's not right for you to frame me like this.

482
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,580
I am a prosecutor who only speaks the truth, sir.

483
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,880
I ate chicken porridge this morning also.

484
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,390
Then, prove it.

485
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,330
Give us two more servings.

486
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,710
You are definitely my son.

487
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,950
Three additional servings please!

488
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,740
You are my best son.

489
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,270
- I hope you guys become my children soon too.
 - Okay.

490
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,800
Three more servings!

491
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,470
 OPEN: 11:00 AM
CLOSE: 10:00 PM

492
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,320
 Sir, has the additional order finished cooking?

493
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,830
I'm here.

494
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,390
Here's my savior.

495
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,460
Sorry I'm late.

496
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,420
It's okay.

497
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,520
Are you alright?

498
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,800
I should've thrown a resignation letter at the chief prosecutor.

499
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,950
Not enough evidence they said. The reason for Choi Kang Jin was acquittal.

500
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,520
I mean, how many more witnesses and pieces of evidence do they need?

501
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,410
 "If they committed a crime, I won't let it slide, even if it's family."

502
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:30,440
 A true prosecutor, who indicted his own father's company, SHC Entertainment.

503
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,710
 It is no other than Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin.

504
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,880
 There are even talks that the anonymous informant who provided data to Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong

505
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,390
 was Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin.

506
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,260
Choi Kang Jin has become a hero.

507
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,290
Yeah. That bastard.

508
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,450
I'll get him.

509
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,130
Choi Kang Jin. I'll get him for you.

510
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,480
Now, now, you know that when our brother here says he'll get him, he will, right?

511
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,640
Now is not a time to be down.

512
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,680
We should be preparing for the second round.

513
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,920
At this point, haven't we become 'The Avengers' amongst prosecutors?

514
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,450
Now! Let's cheer up!

515
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,330
To eradicating evil!

516
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,530
Cheers!

517
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,490
♫  What kind of gang came at me?  ♫

518
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,100
♫  Stopped in your tracks  ♫

519

522

526
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,380

527
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,340
Guard!

528
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,420
Good!

529
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,910
Good job.

530
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:14,400
Hey, how could you throw me like that?

531
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,280
When did you get so good? Both of you are acting like you're in a real match.

532
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,720
It's thanks to Hui Wu.

533
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,170
I need a lot more training.

534
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,310
What brings you here...?

535
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,990
Have a good talk.

536
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,190
Yes, thank you.

537
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,300
Should I start exercising too?

538
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,870
Director, Hui Wu is really cool, don't you think?

539
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,170
It's good to see you taking care of yourself.

540
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,500
I can see that your actions at Gimsan weren't a coincidence.

541
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,250
I'm still far from perfect.

542
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,450
By the way, what brings you two here?

543
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:09,160
Where should I even start? The director said he wanted to see you since early this morning, so...

544
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,980
I barely managed to wash my face.

545
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,980
I came here because there are too many prying eyes at the prosecutor's office.

546
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,800
There are a few things I want to ask you.

547
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,790
I also have something to tell you.

548
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:25,000
You go ahead. I think it'll be something I want to hear.

549
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,520
I met Assemblyman Hwang Jin Yong yesterday.

550
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,590
Assemblyman Hwang?

551
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:35,840
As I expected. I was wondering where Assemblyman Hwang got such information to share.

552
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:41,310
In that case, the investigation of SHC Entertainment at the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office must be your work too.

553
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:45,070
Yes. I'm sorry I didn't tell you ahead of time.

554
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,890
It's okay.

555
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,900
I expected as much when you said you were going after Choi Su Hyeok first before going after Choi Kang Jin.

556
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,600
I was curious how you were going to go about it, because it hasn't been so long ago since you arrested Jang Il Hyeon.

557
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,280
Did you satisfy your curiosity?

558
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,460
But are you okay though?

559
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,290
Excuse me?

560
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:06,380
We heard the chief prosecutor gave you a list with only the no-name players on it.

561
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,050
Another chance will come by again. Catch your breath and wait for it.

562
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,590
Jang Il Hyeon, Choi Kang Jin... both of them suffered losses, big and small.

563
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:19,300
However, be careful. Kim Seok Hun may feel that something's off since he's quick-witted.

564
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,890
You need to control your pace.

565
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,900
Especially if your final goal is a bigger villain.

566
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,620
 He's sharp as expected.

567
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,510
 He seems indifferent, but did he already know everything?

568
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,370
Okay. I'll keep your words in mind.

569
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,940
I can tell you're well mannered and nice, but I can't tell what you're thinking.

570
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,710
If I could, I might be of some help, you know?

571
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,800
You two are already helping me a lot.

572
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,910
Really.

573
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,760
You can swear a bunch if you're angry.

574
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,560
It's pretty obvious that you're holding back your feelings.

575
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,760
I can see why you were sparring so fiercely this early.

576
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,580
You're the type of guy who can't just sit back after seeing someone who committed a crime.

577
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,430
Is it really that obvious?

578
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,540
- Yes, very much.
 - Yes, very much.

579
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,770
Looking at your expression, it seems that things went well.

580
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,390
It's all thanks to you.

581
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,540
The answer to your survival is now out,

582
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,160
so you should keep the agreement you made with me.

583
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,030
Yes.

584
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:39,760
I'll get you on probation even if I have to kneel in front of that bastard Kim Hui Wu.

585
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,370
Good.

586
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,360
I trust you.

587
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,340
- Welcome back.
 - Thanks.

588
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,480
Hui Wu.

589
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,470
Yes?

590
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:12,300
I know the Chief of Prosecutor made you take care of Seonbae Jang.

591
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,270
What can we do, but do as the higher-ups order us to?

592
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:19,980
You have to look after your own side. We're directly on the Chief Prosecutor's side.

593
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,750
We should support and help each other after what happened to Seonbae Jang.

594
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,280
- Don't you think?
 - Yes.

595
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,370
So... I want to let Seonbae Jang out, no matter what it takes.

596
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,680
He can't go back to being a prosecutor even if he's released.

597
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,350
Isn't it a bit much to disqualify him from being a lawyer?

598
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:45,040
We used to work together, so it's not right for us to ruin his way of earning money, right?

599
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,410
Are you telling me to manipulate the evidence?

600
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:52,740
Hey! If you say that so directly, I'll look like a weirdo.

601
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,820
You're in charge of it,

602
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:01,210
so you could make a loophole in the paperwork to help him get out.

603
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,100
And then?

604
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,620
Why don't you concede this time around?

605
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,280
You can't?

606
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,960
No, never mind.

607
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,840
I don't want to dirty my junior's hands.

608
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,200
I'll take care of it. Go on with your business.

609
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,410
Jang Il Hyeon wants to be a lawyer?

610
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm going to end Jang Il Hyeon for good.

611
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,190
 Southern Detention Center

612
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,140
If you came here to talk about Jang Il Hyeon, I'm done.

613
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:58,320
That's too bad. I came to help you.

614
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,580
Get to the point.

615
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,300
Aren't you curious?

616
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:11,330
The reason why Jang II Hyeon made his betrothed Seong Jin Mi into a liar and con artist.

617
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,450
I was tricked by Chairwoman Seong Jin Mi.

618
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:20,420
How do you think I knew about the corruption of the National Foundation for the Arts University? It was all fabricated.

619
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,930
Are you referring to the National Foundation for the Arts University embezzlement?

620
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,510
I've been used is all.

621
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,300
Ms. Seong Jin Mi claimed that she used the embezzled money together with you.

622
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,400
I didn't know. I was only used by that woman.

623
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,890
 Ms. Seong Jin Mi used you? What does that mean?

624
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:38,320
It's because he knows. If he puts the crime on your shoulders,

625
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,470
he knows that the weight of his crime becomes lighter.

626
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,410
Now, by flipping that,

627
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:50,950
if you put your crime on his shoulders, what would happen?

628
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,640
It'll make your own shoulders lighter, right?

629
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,060
You're saying you'll help me?

630
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:03,690
I'm sick and tired of prosecutors,

631
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,150
but I am curious what kind of help you would be.

632
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,090
Come to the prosecutor's office tomorrow to be interrogated.

633
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,740
Okay.

634
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,460
Ms. Seong Jin Mi, Ms. Seong Jin Mi, let me ask just one question!

635
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,050
What do you think of the scandal between you and former prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon?!

636
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:19,160
There's a rumor that you two agreed to be married. What's the truth on that!?

637
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,050
Former Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon said that he was only used by you.

638
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,290
Is there anything you want to say?

639
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,870
 - Do the same thing.
 - What do you mean?

640
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:38,460
  Copy what Jang Il Hyeon did.

641
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,530
 "Jang Il Hyeon made me do everything."

642
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:44,970
Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon made me do everything.

643
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,840
 "However, Jang Il Hyeon is not to blame."

644
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,370
However, Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon is not to blame.

645
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,700
 "I'm the sinner for not being able to stop him."

646
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,870
I'm the sinner for not being able to stop him.

647
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,280
 "I thought that was love."
 - I thought that was love.

648
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,980
 "Also..."
 - Also...

649
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,860
 Cry.

650
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,360
I'm sorry.

651
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,820
Are you pregnant by any chance?

652
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,490
Does Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon know about it?

653
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:29,000
 The rest will be taken care of by the media.

654
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,000
 Sponsor Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon / Prosecutor's Office Ethics Flawed / Shameless Prosecutor Used Pregnant Fiancée to Negotiate Sentence

655
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,500
Come in.

656
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,030
- You wanted to see me?
  Under allegations of bribery,

657
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,760
 under the act on the aggravated punishment of specific crimes,

658
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,030
 former Prosecutor Jang Il Hyeon's additional crimes are being revealed one by one.

659
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,170
 During this, Seong Jin Mi, the chairwoman of the National Foundation for the Arts University,

660
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,620
 who attended the prosecutor's witness interrogation, revealed a shocking fact.

661
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,750
 While the ethics of the prosecutor's office are once again being questioned,

662
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,590
 it remains to be seen how this will affect the outcome of the trial.

663
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:08,380
The public opinion isn't good. Stop dragging it out,

664
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,060
and finish Jang Il Hyeon's trial as soon as possible.

665
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,330
Okay, understood.

666
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,390
Using the title of prosecutor,

667
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:26,590
the defendant Jang Il Hyeon is charged with accepting bribes

668
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:31,750
and turning a blind eye and taking part in his fiancée, National Arts Foundation Chairman Seong Jin Mi's

669
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,540
illegal activities.

670
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:39,540
The court will hereby sentence him to seven years in prison

671
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,350
for violation of the Act on Aggravated Punishment, etc.,

672
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:47,570
and violating the Act on the Prohibition of Illegal Solicitation and Acceptance of Money, etc

673
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,260
 Seven years?

674
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,000
He needs more than seven years!

675
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,960
Let go. Let go!

676
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,890
Kim Hui Wu... get him.

677
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,860
Thank you Kim Hui Wu, for getting rid of Seonbae Jang.

678
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:51,090
Thanks to you, I've gained wings.

679
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:56,470
Is there still nothing from Kim Yong Jin?

680
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:58,280
Not yet.

681
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:03,060
If he can't find the answer, I should give him a hint.

682
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:06,930
Open the gift bag that Choi Kang Jin brought.

683
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:09,220
Yes, sir.

684
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:21,860
It becomes quite a bit expensive if it's within a week, will that be okay?

685
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:26,400
Understood. We'll lead a real-time response as well.

686
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,420
You're working overtime for this coming week.

687
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:41,160
 Chaebol C's shocking fact! Affair with a top actress?

688
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:58,600
Office Manager Park, is there something going on?

689
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,520
The ward atmosphere is a bit strange today.

690
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,230
Rumors about your brother are being spread indiscriminately

691
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:05,540
on social media and in the mass media.

692
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,090
Oppa?

693
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,280
Don't look. It'll calm down soon.

694
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,400
It's family business. I should at least know what it's about.

695
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,530
"The Scene of the Successor of Company C and Actress A's Affair"?

696
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,580
This is a video.

697
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,220
This isn't just a tabloid.

698
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:25,820
I think your oldest brother was illegally filmed.

699
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,880
Prevent the newspapers from going into father's room.

700
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,770
And tell him that the TV is being fixed for a moment.

701
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,990
He can't find out about this.

702
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,720
Nuna, you are here.

703
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:48,070
- When did you get here?
 - Just a moment ago.

704
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:50,250
I had something to report to father.

705
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:52,360
Father, I'll head out now.

706
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,950
Okay.

707
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:04,800
Hui Ah, start going to the group management planning office starting tomorrow.

708
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,560
Don't say you don't want to, and don't say you can't. Just do as I say.

709
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,080
Dad, I told you already.

710
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,430
- I just want to be a family member–
 - I'm telling you because you are family!

711
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,110
The so-called directors are busy checking on what Yong Jun wants,

712
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,580
and Seong Jun, that boy is just drooling, looking to see if there's anything to eat up off the ground.

713
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,800
Who do you think can stop them?

714
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:28,300
I'm not saying this out of anger, I'm speaking with reason.

715
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,320
Hui Ah!

716
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,700
I'll do it.

717
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,600
I'll participate in management.

718
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,200
It's been a while.

719
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,400
So that's how you feel.

720
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,780
I always felt as if you were with me the whole time.

721
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,930
Monks shave their heads when they leave behind worldly desires.

722
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:10,600
So I'm here to do that.

723
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,070
You.

724
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:17,830
I'm here to say goodbye.

725
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:20,010
As a friend.

726
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:22,350
I thought about you from time to time.

727
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:25,930
"What would have Hui Wu done in this situation?"

728
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,520
But I'm going to stop now.

729
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,790
I wanted to come back to an ordinary life,

730
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:41,030
have a drink like ordinary people, argue like everyone,

731
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:46,900
and become happy when a guy buys me a stuffed animal on the street.

732
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,450
I wanted an ordinary life like that.

733
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,650
But I don't think that's possible now.

734
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,050
Bye.

735
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,670
Okay.

736
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,090
Kim Hui Ah.

737
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,280
If you get upset, unload on this guy. And you just be yourself.

738
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,510
Okay.

739
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:09,050
When things are tough, come to me. I'll buy you another one.

740
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,560
Thanks.

741
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,350
I'll get going then.

742
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:17,010
Okay.

743
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:38,760
How could you do this, you jerk?

744
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,750
Get your hands off me!

745
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,810
Hey! Kim Seung Jun!

746
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:43,440
Oppa, calm down. The housekeepers will hear you.

747
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,420
I don't care about people's opinions of me right now.

748
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,320
Dad must have scolded you, but don't fool yourself.

749
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,640
He was bound to find out. I only told him because it would be better coming from his son, than a random stranger.

750
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,210
I knew Nuna wouldn't tell him about that.

751
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,770
Come on, Oppa. Let go of him. Let's talk it out.

752
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,720
Oppa.

753
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,970
Family? You don't think I know you've been meeting recently with the shareholders?

754
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,200
What? Is someone backing you?

755
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,590
I'm working hard for our company. Don't accuse me of that.

756
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:09,340
You're the one who messed up.

757
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,460
Do you know how much our stock price plummeted?

758
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,270
What?

759
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:15,140
Besides, you don't have any right to say that to me.

760
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,140
You haven't done anything to help the company. You're just a risk to the company.

761
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,310
Kim Seung Jun, you...

762
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,160
Oppa.

763
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,160
Yes.

764
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,540
What?

765
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,280
Okay.

766
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:42,110
Hey, Kim Hui Ah. Are you really the new director of Management and Planning?

767
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:43,130
What?

768
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:45,180
Nuna. Is that true?

769
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,070
Yes.

770
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:48,540
Is this Father's doing?

771
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,350
Yes.

772
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,330
You said you weren't interested in management.

773
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,890
Now, I am.

774
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,360
Are you challenging me?

775
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,110
Yes. I want to work together with you.

776
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:59,850
I'll help you. I'll cooperate,

777
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,590
so you can do a good job.

778
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,540
Forget it.

779
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,030
I'll see you at work.

780
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:10,210
Oppa.

781
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,930
You're scary, Nuna.

782
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:15,320
Seung Jun.

783
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:52,310
Should I drive you home, sir?

784
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:54,140
Yes.

785
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,130
No.

786
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,630
My apologies for my late introduction.

787
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,410
That's understandable.

788
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,420
Sit down.

789
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,730
Have some tea.

790
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,760
This is the perfect temperature.

791
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,980
Oh, okay.

792
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:53,200
In life, missing an opportunity's window can result in lowering its value.

793
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,140
Right.

794
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,080
So there is something I hope you can increase the value of.

795
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,400
What could that be?

796
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,790
Chunha Distributions is preparing to set up a premium outlet.

797
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:09,940
And?

798
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,120
I want you to select the location for the outlet.

799
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,780
I'm just a politician. What do I know about land?

800
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,760
The general election is around the corner.

801
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,840
Information on the location of the outlet will be very useful to your people.

802
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,350
I'm sure you want something from me. Go ahead and tell me.

803
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:37,340
I want to wash away the disgrace on my shoulders.

804
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:40,580
And I want to stay where I am.

805
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,660
Please help me.

806
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:48,030
I'm not interested in the outlet.

807
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:50,440
You can pick the location of your choice.

808
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:55,200
But I heard Chunha Distribution will go through restructuring.

809
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,690
I want you to stop that.

810
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,960
You might think that restructuring is a good option

811
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,450
to cut costs and get rid of freeloaders at the company.

812
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:10,620
I want to join hands with those who have national interest in mind and who work for the country,

813
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,950
not those who view people as tools to further their personal gains.

814
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,780
And I believe someone similar ought to lead the company.

815
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,750
Do you think you can do that?

816
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:30,630
If the answer is yes, I'll join hands with you.

817
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,460
He wants to wash away the disgrace?

818
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,690
He wants to stay where he is?

819
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:06,130
Now that we've joined hands, I ought to grant him his wish.

820
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:13,020
Get ready. A great star

821
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,020
will fall soon.

822
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:23,000

823
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:28,460
♫  Dear, All your things you've done  ♫

824
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,720
♫  We are here to wreck it up  ♫

825
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:37,810
♫  Who knows, how will it go?  ♫

826
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:45,480
♫  Hiding in black and white  ♫

827
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,640
♫  We are here to find the truth  ♫

828
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:54,700
♫  Give up, I warn you so  ♫

829
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,560
 Again My Life

830
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,760
 The next target is Kim Hui Ah.

831
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,310
 I set things up.

832
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,140
 What is it that you want?

833
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,750
 Look into Hui Wu.

834
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,660
 Find out if he met with Assemblyman Jo.

835
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:10,730
 Give me a bit more time.

836
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:13,560
 I will soon be able to keep my promise to you.

837
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,240
 I'm asking for help one last time.

838
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,670
 Start the investigation.

839
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:21,960
 I'm sorry about your father.

840
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,830
 I see it as an opportunity.

841
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:26,470
 Let's bring down Kim Seok Hun.

842
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:28,920
♫  There's no where to hide  ♫

843
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,240
 Again My Life
