1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:09,940

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,850
 Lee Joon Gi

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,780
 Lee Kyung Young

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,370
 Kim Ji Eun

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,320
 Again My Life

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,950
 Help!

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,710
 Oppa...

8
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,450
 Oppa! Oppa!

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,640
 Please help!

10
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,590
 Oppa. My oppa is here, too.

11
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,610
 Go outside! Get out!

12
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,880
 Come on!

13
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,590
 Wake up!

14
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,290
 - Are you okay?
 - Yes.

15
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,630
 Good. Let's get out of here.

16
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,800
 Right now.

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,110
 You have changed public opinion about you.

18
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,230
 By your saving these kids, your approval as a candidate shot up.

19
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,500
 I told you not to do anything dangerous! Revealing the  corruption at the orphanage was enough!

20
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,540
 I would do anything for you, sir.

21
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,200
 If I had to set myself on fire instead of the orphanage to get the job done,

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,770
 - I would have done it.
 - But the kids got hurt!

23
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,460
 That kid even has amnesia due to the shock from the fire!

24
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,160
 I feel bad for the kids, but I had no other options.

25
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,900
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

26
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,530
Take your hands off the case. Turn over the investigation into Chief Prosecutor Kim Seok Hun

27
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,720
to Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin.  And

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,380
starting now, you'll be working at the 5th Investigative Division where Prosecutor Ji Seong Ho is.

29
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,920
Sorry, Hui Wu.

30
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,430
You're the one who set the table, but I get to serve the meal.

31
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,370
I won't forget to give you credit, so don't feel too bad.

32
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,240
- Chief.
 - You may leave.

33
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,080
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,770
 5th Investigative Division
 Prosecutor Ji Seong Ho
 Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

35
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,810
Wow, this is unbelievable.

36
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,180
Do you know what he said to me?

37
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,450
 Seong Ho, can't you resign?

38
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,800
 I've thought long and hard. Being a prosecutor doesn't suit you.

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,480
Exactly what's going on?!

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,350
I'm sure he has a plan.

41
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,170
To succeed maybe.

42
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,830
He's decided to fight against authority.

43
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,140
That was in the past. He's changed.

44
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,540
What did he say to you? Did he tell you to resign, too?

45
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,180
No.

46
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,170
He told me to take my hands off of Kim Seok Hun's case.

47
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,380
This is BS. What a load of crap! So?

48
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,000
I was given orders, so I have to obey.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,020
I'm going to take my hands off of the Kim Seok Hun investigation.

50
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,110
- In return...
 - In return?

51
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,650
I'm going to get Park Dae Ho.

52
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,040
Since I didn't receive orders to stop the investigation into Bando Bank.

53
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,670
The acquisition of JQ Construction is going off without a hitch, right?

54
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,380
Yes.

55
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,570
I heard there's a fly in the ointment. Is there a problem?

56
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,260
No, there isn't a problem.

57
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,350
I see. Good.

58
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Chairman Park.

59
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,260
You must succeed in the JQ Construction acquisition this time.

60
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,480
When Kim Yeong Il's shares fell into Kim Hui Ah's hands

61
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,010
it was a major setback to Assemblyman Jo's plans.

62
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,960
The assemblyman may be able to forgive you with his generous heart, but not me.

63
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,820
I won't allow someone who habitually makes mistakes to work with the assemblyman.

64
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,320
Of course. Please don't worry. I'll work hard.

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,240
No. Do it with desperation.

66
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,180
That way, you can survive.

67
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,500
I got all the Cheonha Life Insurance board members together and set the fire.
   Episode 15

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,990
Cheonha Life Insurance can provide as much as Park Dae Ho wants, right?

69
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,500
Of course. There are lots of loan products at an insurance company.

70
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,900
When the bank denies you a loan, the next place you usually go to is

71
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,640
the insurance company.

72
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,570
Since the interest rate is much lower than in the loan industry or the private sector.

73
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,350
All we have to do now is steer Park Dae Ho well, who's prevented from borrowing from Bando Bank.

74
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,280
That's right.

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,130
I leaked information out to the loan industry about  Cheonha Life Insurance expanding its loan division,

76
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,570
so we should hear back soon.

77
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,930
You know the loan industry people have a knack for smelling money.

78
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,350
True.

79
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,560
When money is urgently needed, you get sensitive to information.

80
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,420
So do you think he'll make a risky move?

81
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,010
Yeah, definitely.

82
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,280
I wonder what kind of wind blows someone here

83
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,720
saying he's going to join the powerful and gets rid of his subordinates.

84
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,160
My Yong Ho, I must have let you down a lot. Sorry.

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,770
I'll use this opportunity to pay back everything I've owed you.

86
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,830
I hear Cheonha Life Insurance is expanding their loan business.

87
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,600
You haven't changed one bit. Only coming to see me when you need me.

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,030
You and I should scoop up all the money.

89
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,050
With loans, the quickest ones get it all.

90
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,370
It's easier said than done.

91
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,110
Well, how?

92
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,840
The construction you and I used to do.

93
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,440
It's your boys' specialty, after all.

94
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,680
Let me use your hidden card just one more time.

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,760
You won't regret it.

96
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,770
I just need three billion won.

97
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,360
The rest, Yong Ho... President Park, you can have it all.

98
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,900
It's beneficial for us both. Let me have ten of your boys.

99
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,300
Director.

100
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,180
It's a list of people who applied for loans from Cheonha Life insurance.

101
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,440
I've emailed Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu a copy.

102
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,340
Great job.

103
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,380
Hi, Hui Wu. I just emailed you the list.

104
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,730
Yeah, I just saw it.

105
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,310
Thanks.

106
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,610
It's me. I just sent you an email. Have you seen it?

107
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,500
You want me to identify suspicious people and let you know?

108
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,210
That's right. We have too many eyes here, so it's too hard for me to look into.

109
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,890
They might have used the same person who took out a loan in the past.

110
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,890
Is it possible to get a loan when you have an existing one at Bando Bank?

111
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,850
We have circumstantial evidence that Park Dae Ho has manipulated records to clear loans.

112
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,850
Please find any person on both lists and get me their personal info.

113
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,670
- By tomorrow.
 - What?

114
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,710
- By tomorrow?
 - That's right.

115
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,390
- Please do me this favor.
 - Hold on!

116
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,720
 Again My Life

117
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,220
- Yes, Investigator, sir.
  - I've combed through the list you gave me.

118
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,290
 There wasn't anyone with a criminal record but some caught my attention.

119
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,120
- Suspicious?
 - Yes.

120
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,710
There was someone who was reported missing but got a loan.

121
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,750
 Really?

122
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,900
I've emailed you the person's info, so verify it.

123
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,800
Good job. I'll treat you to a meal.

124
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,610
I've never seen anyone actually follow through with that promise.

125
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,310
No, I promise I will.

126
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,600
Then do it now.

127
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,510
- Investigator-nim
 - Investigator Oh, sir!

128
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,100
There you go.

129
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,360
Reserved.
  Reserved

130
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,470
I wonder who Hui Wu's bringing.

131
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,630
I know. I wonder who it is. He's never made this kind of request before.

132
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,130
He asked to make the meal especially delicious saying it's someone he's indebted to.

133
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,660
Maybe he's bringing his girlfriend.

134
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,880
Right! Girlfriend.

135
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,380
I shouldn't be standing here like this. I should go put on the yellow shirt we bought at the department store.

136
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,660
I should put on a bow tie, too, and sunglasses.

137
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,400
But when he's so busy, when did he have the time to date?

138
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,230
Aigoo, come on.

139
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,630
Don't you remember long ago when we were dating?

140
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,200
You came to see me after working all night and then went to work after barely any sleep.

141
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,630
That's why I thought living together would be better and got married, but that was the start of a tragedy.

142
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,270
What? You're ending up at a weird conclusion.

143
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,050
You said you couldn't live without me back then!

144
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,750
You call this living? We have alcohol piled up there to sell,

145
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,820
but I can't even freely drink! I'm living like an animal.

146
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,240
Welcome!

147
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,420
We're here.

148
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,030
So... the special person is him?

149
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,530
Yes. He's the investigator who helped me out a lot in Gimsan.

150
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,740
Hello. I'm Oh Min Guk.

151
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,520
Hello.

152
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,370
I thought he was bringing a girl.

153
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,220
Maybe his identity is...

154
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,660
- What?
 - Never mind.

155
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,270
You asked for a special table, but all we have are ordinary ones. Please sit.

156
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,300
Please sit.

157
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,940
But the food is special!

158
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,550
Now.

159
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,670
It's been so long.

160
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,620
About a hundred years!

161
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,150
Did you get transferred to the Central District Prosecutors' Office?

162
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,380
Yes. I applied for a transfer and got lucky.

163
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,620
Let's have a drink.

164
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,080
Nice to see you!

165
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,510
Oh, but the people you asked me to investigate...

166
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,630
there were lots of suspicious things.

167
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,030
The person was reported missing, but soon after got a loan and bought a car.

168
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,950
There's even a record of the person having worked at a service company.

169
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,190
What was the name of the company?

170
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,250
Big Tiger Outsourcing.

171
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,850
Looking into it, it's a company run by Park Dae Ho's informant.

172
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,600
He probably faked his employment in order to get the loan.

173
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,980
That's right. Since you need a job in order to get a loan.

174
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,640
I think we have an angle of sorts.

175
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,250
How should we approach it?

176
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,950
From ground up.

177
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,130
 Jeonghan 3- Gil 47

178
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,810
Hello?

179
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,040
Anyone home?

180
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,700
Who are you?

181
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,680
I'm a prosecutor.

182
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,750
You reported Lee Chang Su missing, right?

183
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,540
Have you found him?!

184
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,800
Have you found my husband?

185
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,140
So you're saying your child was born with congenital heart disease,

186
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,270
and you got a loan to pay hospital bills?

187
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,500
Yes.

188
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,090
In the end, we owed more than we could pay back.

189
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,100
The daily pressure to pay it back was killing me,

190
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,590
but one day, my husband said something strange.

191
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:47,120
Not to worry since he paid off the loan.

192
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,210
How?

193
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,620
He said he received an advance from his new job.

194
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,520
Then a week later, he went missing.

195
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,790
He never called you?

196
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,430
No.

197
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:04,280
I don't even know where he was working. He just disappeared into thin air.

198
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,840
Please find him for me.

199
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,150
Our daughter misses her dad so much.

200
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,820
Yes. I'll try to find your husband.

201
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,270
I hope you can help.

202
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,450
Yes, Sunbaenim.

203
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,920
 I found Lee Chang Soo.

204
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,020
He's been working as a recruiter for voice phishing at Park Dae Ho's subordinate's studio.

205
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,160
 Investigator Oh says he's basically being held captive.

206
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,620
 Big Tiger Outsourcing.

207
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,130
Wouldn't it be best to ask for police cooperation?

208
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,750
No. We have to do this one secretly.

209
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,360
It won't be too late to make a request after we get the president and Lee Chang Su out first.

210
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,980
We could get killed secretly, too...

211
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,610
If you're that worried, you can stay here.

212
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,350
I'm just kidding. I can't miss this.

213
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,620
Seonbaenim?

214
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,390
Good timing. Backup arrived.

215
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Are we running a charity?

216
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,570
What's with a 15% commission? Raise it right now!

217
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,600
Then the outsourced staff might file a complaint with the Labor Office.

218
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,400
This bastard. Are you a newbie to this business?

219
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,970
Find out their weaknesses. Their weakness.

220
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,420
Who are you?

221
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,110
I came to see Lee Chang Su.

222
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,880
Lee Chang Su! Lee Chang Su!

223
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,200
Lee Chang Su!

224
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,010
Yeon Seok.

225
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,870
Hey!

226
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,390
Hey, who are you?

227
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,720
Oh, hold on.

228
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,340
Kids, come greet our guests over here.

229
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,560
Oh, really?

230
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,250
♫  Hey, you're so cold.  That evil leer  ♫

231
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,140
♫  You clearly intend something nasty  ♫

232
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,520
♫  Lie lie lie gradually it will come out  ♫

233
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,530
♫  Standing up standing up  ♫

234
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,490
♫  Standing up  ♫

235
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,380
♫  What kind of gang came at me?  ♫

236
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,220
♫  Stopped in your tracks  ♫

237
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,050
♫  Stay there and wait just for me  ♫

238
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,390
♫  Even if you fool everyone else with that innocent face  ♫

239
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:27,010
♫  You can't get away from me.  ♫

240
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,180
B-Back up...

241
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,880
Just send over everyone who's available for backup.

242
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,710
♫  Bring it on Oh Yeah  ♫

243
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,950
Mr. Prosecutor, seeing how you came here instead of going to the Prosecutor's Office,

244
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,500
you also must know who is behind me.

245
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,540
Yup, I know too well.

246
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,160
Park Dae Ho.

247
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,170
Then let's stop here.

248
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,630
If we end it here, I, too, will—

249
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,570
Think with that head of yours, punk.

250
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,010
If I was planning to stop, would I have caught you?

251
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:09,230
Also, why do you think I brought you here?

252
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,000
In the interrogation room, they can record you,

253
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,770
but here, there isn't anything of the kind.

254
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,070
It's pleasant.

255
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,810
Now, listen up.

256
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,750
How you'll get on the news is

257
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,210
a man whose child was suffering from congenital heart disease had to take a loan

258
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,980
to pay for her hospital bills, and like garbage you kidnapped him,

259
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,460
confined him, beat him up,

260
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:42,100
and made him take an illegal loan that's impossible to pay off.

261
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,350
So, no complaints, right?

262
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,800
Since it's 100% fact with no lies.

263
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,070
Sure.

264
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,520
Thanks to you, I'll become a righteous prosecutor who arrested an illegal loan shark.

265
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,680
And you

266
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,820
just

267
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,990
will be screwed.

268
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,310
Laugh now.

269
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,600
But... I'm curious about something.

270
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,850
When something like this happens,

271
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,370
will Park Dae Ho save you?

272
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,340
I mean, will your family get off scot-free?

273
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,410
You know how netizens are. It's a piece of cake to get their hands on personal info.

274
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:43,060
You have a daughter. If her criminal father appears on the news,

275
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,520
will she be able to attend school normally?

276
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,520
Now, you get the situation, right?

277
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,350
If you do, talk.

278
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,550
List all the crimes Park Dae Ho has committed so far.

279
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,410
If I tell you, then what? What will you do to Dae Ho?

280
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,050
I'll send him to jail.

281
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,250
You can't.

282
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,350
The media won't cover it, and no one will listen to you.

283
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,440
That's not your problem.

284
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,990
You just worry about your problem, you bastard.

285
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,440
Hey, Mr. Park.

286
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,420
Why are you hesitating?

287
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,900
You're a selfish punk.

288
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,260
When Park Dae Ho had a private loan business,

289
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,040
you pocketed a lot of money while acting loyal to his face.

290
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,210
The building near Namdaemun. You bought it with that money.

291
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,200
Am I wrong?

292
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,640
Park Dae Ho is all stressed because of three million dollars right now.

293
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,690
If he finds out about this siphoning, he'll lose it.

294
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,150
It'll be a fun show to watch.

295
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,830
You see, I know scumbags like you very well.

296
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,060
People like you are always prepared for the worst-case scenario.

297
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,260
You already prepared everything

298
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,810
to threaten him in case you got caught like this.

299
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,450
Right?

300
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,820
Call Park Dae Ho.

301
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,150
You're the only one who knows his burner phone number.

302
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,900
Hold on.

303
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,370
 Hyeongnim Dae Ho

304
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,310
- Hyeongnim, it's me.
  - Yes.

305
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:21,280
Chunha Life Insurance has approved the loan application.

306
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,510
I'll send you the approval details.

307
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,930
You can send it to my finance director. When will we get the money?

308
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,620
Tomorrow.

309
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,880
Okay, good job.

310
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,040
Well done.

311
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,050
Thanks for that.

312
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,830
Hui Wu.

313
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,710
Hand him over.

314
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,110
Chief.

315
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,860
Get out.

316
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,350
You want to do it alone again?

317
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,830
I heard everything.

318
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,060
Investigator Oh.

319
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,320
I'm sorry, sir.

320
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
I told him everything.

321
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,050
 He's been flying solo.

322
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,310
 He'd soar even higher if he had someone helping him by his side.

323
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,690
 I heard you'd been helping Kim Hui Wu.

324
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,640
 - I hope you can help him more easily now that you work here.
- Thank you, sir.

325
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,680
 He will surely get himself into a dangerous situation.

326
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,190
 I can take the bullet. I don't want anyone else to get hurt.

327
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,770
I told you to get out.

328
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,580
Sir.

329
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,480
Hui Wu. Will you arrest Park Dae Ho and call it quits?

330
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,190
No, right? You still have to take down Jo Tae Seop.

331
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,750
If you get what I'm saying, get out.

332
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,910
Hide your claws and back off.

333
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,450
I got Park Dae Ho.

334
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,350
Sir, there's breaking news.

335
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,210
 Earlier today,

336
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,510
 the prosecution arrested a group of loan sharks

337
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:49,010
 who also ran a scam call center disguised as an outsourcing agency.

338
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,180
 They assaulted and harassed debtors who failed to meet

339
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,350
  their payment deadlines and even took out loans

340
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,630
 in their names by using their personal information.

341
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,320
 The prosecution's investigation into this group of illegal moneylenders

342
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,250
 has also revealed that Mr. Park, the CEO of B Bank,

343
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,520
 may have had some involvement in the case.

344
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,690
 The prosecution plans to summon Park in the near future.

345
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,980
Where is Park Dae Ho now?

346
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,050
We can't track him down at the moment.

347
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,730
What?!

348
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,150
What? Are you saying Park Dae Ho is missing?

349
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,720
We're checking all the security footage to track him down.

350
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,610
We'll find him soon.

351
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,030
We must find him before Jo Tae Seop does.

352
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,750
Hey, what's up?

353
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,100
Sir, I think I know where he might be.

354
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,760
I'll text you the address.

355
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,500
I'm on my way there now. Please send backup.

356
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,750
Hey, bastard! I told you not to step in!

357
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,210
We have no time. I'm asking for backup.

358
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,410
 In my previous life, Park Dae Ho fled to his hiding place right before he was summoned.

359
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,950
 And that was where he was found dead.

360
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,210
 If that's where he is now,

361
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,430
 he will die this time too.

362
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,810
Yes, I undestand.

363
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,230
Sir, they've managed to locate Park Dae Ho.

364
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,260
Find a dead body that can pass as mine.

365
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,530
I have to make it look like I'm dead.

366
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,790
I'll pay you more than enough.

367
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:51,000
As for the boat ride to Japan and the hotel, I'll—

368
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,510
 Who are you? You scumbag.

369
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,230
Let go, punk!

370
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,520
 I won't allow someone who habitually makes mistakes to work with the assemblyman.

371
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,690
I can kill you. Where is Park Dae Ho?

372
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,890
I don't know, you jerk.

373
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,720
Finish him off.

374
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,230
Sir, Chief Prosecutor Jeon Seok Gyu is here.

375
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,450
Release Park Dae Ho.

376
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,260
I cannot do that.

377
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,100
The arrest warrant has already been issued.

378
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,690
Are you disobeying my order?

379
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,610
His charges have already been made public.

380
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,650
If our investigation proves that he's not guilty, we'll let him go.

381
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,950
I commend you for acting on your belief and pushing ahead.

382
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,960
But in your position, it's more important to be flexible.

383
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,470
Listen carefully.

384
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,800
Whether you're after a person or an animal, you must keep an exit open when cornering them

385
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,420
to make sure you can catch them unscathed.

386
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,340
I'll heed your advice, sir.

387
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,110
That look on your face tells me that you won't listen to me no matter what I say.

388
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,990
You may leave.

389
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,790
 Then guarantee this for me.

390
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,760
 For the office to have authority over investigations and personnel.

391
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,340
 I will reconsider then.

392
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,410
Is this why he made such a request?

393
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,430
According to Prosecutor Choi Kang Jin, the orders all came from Chief Jeon.

394
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,010
So he won't betray his convictions.

395
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:25,660
Prosecutor Ji Seong Ho from Gimsan is in charge of the case.

396
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,070
Should it be assigned to someone else?

397
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,480
Tell them to put Kim Hui Wu in charge.

398
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,610
Jeon Seok Gyu will concede because he thinks that Kim Hui Wu is loyal to him.

399
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,560
This is actually good.

400
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:45,250
This way, we can see whose side Kim Hui Wu will take.

401
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:52,990
Now, Jeon Seok Gyu can't even return to his old post.

402
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,170
Manager Han. Tell Prosecutor General Yun Jong Gi to make room for dinner on his schedule.

403
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,690
Yes, sir.

404
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,610
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

405
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,000
Kim Hui Wu speaking.

406
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,020
Park Dae Ho's case. You'll be put in charge of the investigation.

407
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,580
 Release him.

408
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,660
 It's Assemblyman Jo's order.

409
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,480
You prosecutors are quite gentlemanly.

410
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,810
I appreciate that you're guaranteeing my safety like this.

411
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,080
A jail sentence is also guaranteed

412
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,790
because you've done a lot of bad things.

413
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,820
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu, right?

414
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,900
Anyway, thank you.

415
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,060
You saved my life.

416
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,440
That scumbag yesterday... Wow, he was really something.

417
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,440
My bodyguard is tough, but he couldn't even fight back.

418
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,330
He wasn't bad.

419
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,790
I was a skilled fighter when I was young.

420
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:09,870
It takes one to know one, you know?

421
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:17,140
Do you know why I went to such trouble to save you?

422
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,190
To keep you alive so you can pay for everything you did.

423
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,470
To you, even death is too much of a luxury.

424
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,790
Watch your mouth, you brat.

425
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,830
Clearly, you have no remorse.

426
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,350
Hey, do you actually think you can put me in jail?

427
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,660
Okay, fine.

428
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,570
Let's not talk about me.

429
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,650
What about Assemblyman Jo though?

430
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:02,490
With just one word, he can make you vanish right here without a trace.

431
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:10,200
You see, he ordered me to release you.

432
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,730
I think he wants to see you as soon as possible.

433
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:17,400
So if I release you as per his order,

434
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,160
what do you think will happen?

435
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,400
Prosecutor Kim.

436
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:27,150
Don't worry. I'll buy you some time, a week.

437
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,720
Use that time to think hard to figure out a way to survive.

438
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,080
If you won't tell me anything...

439
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:43,620
A week from now, you'll have to face the assemblyman.

440
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,490
You must be busy settling in. I hope I'm not being a nuisance.

441
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,970
Of course not, sir.

442
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,380
You will always be my priority.

443
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,940
You're much more enthusiastic now that you're Prosecutor General.

444
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,070
This is all thanks to you, sir.

445
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,850
I'll get to the point then.

446
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:17,160
Tell me, what do you think about Chief Prosecutor Jeon Seok Gyu?

447
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,970
I'm having doubts about my decision.

448
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:25,760
How about giving him some time before you decide to replace him.

449
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,290
It's already been reported to the press. People will talk if I replace him.

450
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,220
I used a losing card.

451
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,910
He's naturally a wild animal, so he bites his owner as he pleases.

452
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,420
I think you should catch your breath.

453
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,770
I will make sure the issue doesn't blow up.

454
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,810
I'll make it so that it was Park Dae Ho's solo corruption case.

455
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,350
- Also...
 - Also?

456
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,910
I will strike Chief Prosecutor Jeon at his Achilles heel.

457
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:07,750
If the staff doesn't obey the Chief Prosecutor, he's nothing but a paper tiger.

458
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,490
- Make him nothing but a shell with a title?
- Yes.

459
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,790
- Manager Han.
- Yes, sir?

460
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,760
Did anything newsworthy happen?

461
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,470
There was a self-harm attempt by an assemblyman who had issues with Daehan Party's election nominations.

462
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,920
Assemblyman Hwang's leadership is proving to become a problem.

463
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,620
I'll see to it that it makes the news.

464
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,160
Prosecutor General Yun, I'm counting on you.

465
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,020
Chief Jeon voluntarily resigning would be the best-case scenario.

466
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,700
Yes, sir.

467
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,520
Sit down.

468
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:57,450
We've received orders from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office to close Park Dae Ho's case.

469
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:01,630
I'm sure you already knew to a certain extent.

470
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,980
And one of you probably received orders from them too.

471
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,900
You each have your survival methods, so I won't force you.

472
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,190
However, I want you all to know

473
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,900
that your junior colleague is fighting a tough battle in order to protect justice.

474
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,960
Sir, although I know it's a good cause...

475
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,810
I know.

476
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,920
The fear you have of potentially ending your careers by teaming up with a powerless chief prosecutor.

477
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,820
There are no disadvantages. You may leave if you don't believe in this cause.

478
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,700
Chief Prosecutor, no, Seonbae. You struggled to get this position.

479
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,790
Please bend your will just this once.

480
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,980
Chief Prosecutor, there's always next time.

481
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,660
It's all right.

482
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,640
You two may also leave.

483
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,510
I'll fight this battle until the very end.

484
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,030
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I'm sorry, sir.

485
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,250
We expected it anyway.

486
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:53,590
Chief Prosecutor. Hang on a little longer,

487
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,930
I mean,

488
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,720
please hang on until the end.

489
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,130
Do you know what my speciality is?

490
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,330
It's to lie low and wait for the right time.

491
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:14,310
Don't worry. I'll be defending this position while you're out fighting crime.

492
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,640
Fight.

493
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,950
And make sure you win.

494
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,580
Yes, sir. I promise.

495
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,520
Did you hear?  The chief prosecutor was humiliated.

496
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,890
Yes.

497
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:47,410
I didn't like hearing it but it's probably worse for you living and eating together.

498
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,110
Brother, if you also feel bitter, how about a drink?

499
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:54,060
Did Jo Tae Seop tell you to see how I'm doing?

500
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:58,020
He must like you. He's so curious about your state of being.

501
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:04,850
Come be my drinking buddy. I don't enjoy drinking alone.

502
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,150
Let's go somewhere quiet.

503
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:25,420
When I drink at a place like this, it makes me feel like I've succeeded.

504
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,820
Even though, I'm actually a fan of soju.

505
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:35,390
I'm going to release Park Dae Ho.

506
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,060
We could face harsh criticism from the public,

507
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,960
so after everything's over and done with and the public has forgotten about him.

508
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,190
What are you saying? Why Park Dae Ho all of a sudden?

509
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,710
When I go to Jo Tae Seop, I can't go empty-handed.

510
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,450
You can tell him you heard me say that.

511
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,440
I'm tearing up that you're giving me such amazing intel.

512
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,420
But,

513
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,540
are we actually fighting against each other?

514
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,520
No. We don't have time for a fight.

515
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,770
I can't fight because I don't get mad when I see you.

516
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,460
Excuse me.

517
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,650
Hello? Yes.

518
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,500
Oh, you're that person from the restaurant last time, right?

519
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,790
Oh, yes.

520
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:38,210
Thank you for that day. The road you showed me was nice and interesting.

521
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,300
Really? That's good.

522
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,240
Oh... if perhaps you're alone, can I join you for a moment?

523
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,540
Ah, but I am with someone today. Oh, here he is.

524
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,870
Oh, I see. Nice seeing you again.

525
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,310
Likewise.

526
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,780
Who's that? Were you flirting?

527
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,900
No. She was just asking a question.

528
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,390
What a shame. She's totally my style.

529
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,580
I just told everything to Office Manager Han.

530
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,130
Yes, thank you.

531
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,740
No, I should thank you.

532
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:35,170
Can I join you? Now I am alone.

533
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,060
I'd like that.

534
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,790
Cheers.

535
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:52,680
Shall we go elsewhere to drink?

536
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,410
Somewhere private?

537
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:13,360
- You are a prosecutor, aren't you?
 - Yes.

538
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,220
Then, do you know a lot of people?

539
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,120
I am not sure.

540
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:23,860
Didn't I tell you what I do?

541
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,190
Didn't you say you were in the trade business?

542
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,860
When you're doing business, there are times you need connections.

543
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:40,210
So, if you know people like entrepreneurs, politicians...

544
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,510
You want me to introduce you to them?

545
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,720
If it's not too much to ask.

546
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,770
What is our relationship?

547
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,310
Flirting? Or...

548
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,240
Wrong.

549
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:04,550
Then... are we dating?

550
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,010
Wrong again.

551
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,690
Then what?

552
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,530
A criminal and a prosecutor.

553
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,370
Lobbyist Jeong Se Yeon.
 (TN: Lobbyist is person or group of persons who exert pressure in favor of certain interests.)

554
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,640
 Rooftop of Prosecutor's Office.

555
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,810
 Jeong Se Yeon dead at hotel

556
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:33,340
 Lobbyist Jeong Se Yeon is dead? It makes no sense.

557
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,840
 Jeong Se Yeon was not the type of woman to commit suicide.

558
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,840
 Especially, the day before the prosecution investigation.

559
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,580
 I just needed a little more time!

560
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,830
 Then I could have jailed that devil Jo Tae Seop.

561
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:02,850
 That's the way Gu Seung Hyeok was charging toward Jo Tae Seop without hesitation.

562
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:10,710
 - What did you say?
- Check the news right now.

563
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,350
 Okay.

564
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:17,270
 The driver who died today in the traffic accident in Cheonghyeon-dong, Haero-gu,

565
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,780
 was revealed to be Prosecutor Gu Seung Hyeok of the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

566
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:26,510
 The police revealed that Gu's blood-alcohol level was 0.13 percent at the time of the accident

567
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:31,750
 and are investigating the possibility that he was drunk and drowsy.

568
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,170
 Jo Tae Seop.

569
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,930
 That's how Gu Seung Hyeok died.

570
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:06,480
If I do as you ask, I'll become a criminal just like you,

571
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,350
as someone who plays a decisive role in your lobbying activities.

572
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:15,250
And that would become my leash, wouldn't it?

573
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,070
Illegal activities to sell weapons.

574
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,350
I think it's sufficient to send you to prison.

575
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,550
 Jeong Se Yeon Profile

576
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:55,340
Tell me. Did Jo Tae Seop order you to do it?  To approach me?

577
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:00,340
But, too bad. I don't want to sit at Jo Tae Seop's game table.

578
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:06,450
I'm going to start a new game. Make a choice. Which table will you sit at?

579
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,360
If you sit at the one I set,

580
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,540
there will be no harm to you.

581
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,770
But if you sit at the one Jo Tae Seop set,

582
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,030
that seat will be prison.

583
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:42,060
Go tell Jo Tae Seop you succeeded.

584
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,860
That Kim Hui Wu fell for it.

585
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:50,340
And sell the weapons you want. Whether a helicopter or a bullet,

586
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,970
I'll make up the evidence you need to show him.

587
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:02,170
There. The table's been set.

588
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,730
It's time for you to make your choice.

589
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,940
Is that a threat?

590
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,210
Choice.

591
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,180
Then, let me threaten you.

592
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:15,490
If I go straight to Jo Tae Seop and tell him everything you just said,

593
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:17,440
what will happen?

594
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,510
My illegal activities?

595
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,020
I think Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop will block everything.

596
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,830
Try it. Will Jo Tae Seop block them for you?

597
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:41,400
You seem to misunderstand. To Jo Tae Seop, you're just something to use.

598
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:48,040
Oh, that's not it. When you're no longer useful, you'll get discarded.

599
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,510
Like a disposable.

600
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,920
- Mr. Kim Hui Wu!
 - Ms. Jeong Se Yeon.

601
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,510
I know what it is that you're really trying to sell.

602
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,500
Military helicopter? That's a smoke screen.

603
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,110
The real object is a new non-nuclear EMP bullet that converts electronic equipment into a black hole.

604
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,640
Who are you?

605
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,710
But... you have no intention of making a deal with Jo Tae Seop. Why?

606
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:15,490
Because he charges a very high commission.

607
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:20,220
However, if you sell the weapon without Jo Tae Seop's knowledge,

608
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,950
you will end up dying.

609
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:41,220
The domestic arms dealer you contacted without Jo Tae Seop knowing, Kwon Chang Gyu.

610
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:49,270
He also contacted Jo Tae Seop.

611
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:55,290
Don't trust this person. He will sell your name to live.

612
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,830
How refreshing.

613
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:03,970
I've met people who make deals with money, but you're the first person to make a deal with my life.

614
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:09,110
You have only one life, and you also get to make a choice only once.

615
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,360
Looks like it.

616
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:16,240
And you won't lose anything

617
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,310
by helping me.

618
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:23,510
You give me the information I need, sell your weapons,

619
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,640
and you can leave.

620
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,730
What do you say?  I think it's quite a good deal.

621
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,010
Fine. I have one condition.

622
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:48,170
Please proceed after I leave Korea.

623
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,230
Deal.

624
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:10,020
There.  It's the leash for Kim Hui Wu that you want.

625
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,550
It's a recording of Kim Hui Wu, in order to win my heart,

626
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:16,270
giving me details of the corruption investigation and

627
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,610
giving me contact information to use

628
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:24,610
of the Minister of Defense, generals, and relevant politicians.

629
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,380
I told him to give it to me the day I leave for the US.

630
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,910
Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu did?

631
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,130
Did you think he would be different?

632
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:41,490
He promised to cooperate entirely in what I do for the rest of our relationship,

633
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:44,260
with confidentiality, surely.

634
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,900
You'll see when you check the file.

635
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,770
Okay.

636
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,520
So now, let's talk business.

637
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,990
We should.

638
00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:00,170
If it is successful, I will give you a 5% rebate.

639
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:05,390
You are too greedy.

640
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:08,070
I know this business is worth 1.5 trillion won.

641
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,080
You will take over 20% of it for yourself.

642
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,750
5% of that's just 15 billion won?

643
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,810
I'm offering you the industry average.

644
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,040
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop did not

645
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,670
introduce you to the Minister of Defense

646
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,160
because of some pocket change.

647
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,440
Ten percent.

648
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,070
Thirty percent.

649
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:30,960
Ninety billion. No deal for less than that.

650
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,400
Do you want this to be a one-time thing?

651
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,530
I met with Jeong Se Yeon.

652
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,580
It's Kim Hui Wu's leash.

653
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,370
I confirmed it.

654
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:48,540
It's nice to be young.

655
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,700
Assemblyman, there is something you need to see.

656
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:00,170
Park Sang Man, CEO of PSM Investment, became the new CEO of JQ Construction.

657
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,210
Park Sang Man?

658
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,000
 An unknown young businessman acquires JK Construction
 PSM Investments: 'We'll focus on a new JQ Construction."

659
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,600
Park Sang Man, right?

660
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:16,680
If you stop, no one will get hurt.

661
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,610
You're the one who made Sang Man the CEO of JQ Construction, right?

662
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:21,240
I only pulled the trigger.

663
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,400
It's gonna be a great show.

664
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,050
Yes.

665
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,950
The whole country will be shaken up.

666
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:31,160
Don't get hurt.

667
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,140
Yes, tell me.

668
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,550
Jo Tae Seop is digging into Park Sang Man.

669
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:54,250
The new CEO of JQ Construction is the same person as the owner of Kim Young Il's shares.

670
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,750
Jo Tae Seop can only be curious, so...

671
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,180
 Be careful.

672
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:03,150
We'll keep our mouths shut but... our opponent is Jo Tae Seop.

673
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,440
Ah, push it.

674
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,350
Oh, you're here?

675
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:10,160
Park Sang Man,

676
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:14,940
Jo Tae Seop.

677
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,380
Jo Tae Seop may try to contact you.

678
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,020
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop?

679
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,050
Yeah.

680
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:26,860
Don't take any calls from him. And never meet him even if he asks to.

681
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,140
If possible, don't go outside.

682
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:33,760
And if you do go out, make sure Yeon Seok is with you. Understand?

683
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,530
What's going on? You're scaring me.

684
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,360
Do as I ask.

685
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,870
Manager Han.

686
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,410
Yes, sir.

687
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:53,960
- Contact Park Sang Man.
 - Yes, Assemblyman.

688
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,760
Hello, this is Park Sang Man.

689
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,800
Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop would like to meet you, CEO Park.

690
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,170
If he asks one to come, is it mandatory? We are in a democracy.

691
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,850
The decision is yours to make, however

692
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:22,350
we don't know what will happen to you if you reject.

693
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:25,270
I'll put you down for 7 pm then.

694
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:31,770
What do you think he'll do?

695
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:36,590
Will Park Sang Man accept my drink?

696
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,380
He'd better.

697
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,970
Are you really going? It seems dangerous.

698
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:49,320
Of course, it is dangerous. That's why I'm going by myself.

699
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,210
So, don't tell Hui Wu.

700
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,340
 Hui Wu

701
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,630
I didn't call him.

702
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:08,580
I hate you.

703
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,670
Hello, Hyeong.

704
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:14,750
Don't go.

705
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,080
This is my issue.

706
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,140
I am the CEO of JQ Constructions.

707
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,170
Don't go!

708
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,580
Hyeong.

709
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,400
A guest has arrived.

710
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,410
Send him in.

711
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,170
What's the meaning of this?

712
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:10,380
Why do you ask when you already know?

713
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:15,060
The one who instructed Park Sang Man and planned everything is me.

714
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:20,460
So... don't go after an innocent man,

715
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,980
but talk to me instead.

716
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,040
Do you understand what you're saying?

717
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,800
A declaration of war.

718
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:32,340
I'll punish you for all the crimes you've committed.

719
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,830
Crimes? Punishment?

720
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,270
Yes.

721
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:40,240
I don't know what you misunderstood, but nothing I do

722
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,150
is out of my own greed.

723
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:46,240
- It is for all the nation...
- Ah!

724
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,120
Stop this "for the nation's sake" speech.

725
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,290
I'll give you a chance.

726
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:58,090
I am a person who looks at one's potential besides their past mistakes.

727
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:02,360
Get up and kneel. Beg for forgiveness.

728
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:11,860
And if I do that, will you forgive me entirely?

729
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,360
I am sorry.

730
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,290
But, it's too bad.

731
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:43,030
I tend to be petty, so even if you get up, kneel and beg for forgiveness,

732
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:45,550
I'm not willing to let this go.

733
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,910
Let's not waste our energy.

734
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:51,630
Let me get straight to the point.

735
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:59,410
I am going to arrest you.

736
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,180
Do you have the ability to do that?

737
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,800
Let us see about that.

738
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,480
What a waste. It's really a waste.

739
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:20,480
Well, since you said not to waste our energy, it seems difficult to convince you anymore.

740
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,020
How should I do it?

741
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,860
Should I get you fired,

742
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:28,170
or should I set up a nice branch office in the middle of a desert island?

743
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,720
I also have a suggestion.

744
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,580
Which prison should I send you to? Do you have any private jail you'd prefer?

745
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,800
You see, how powerful people go to prison and live like kings,

746
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,020
I'd rather not see it because it's disgusting.

747
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:49,260
Therefore, I'll make it so that you

748
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:53,360
share the same cell with other prisoners.

749
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,500
You're good with that, right?

750
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,590
You are a great politician.

751
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:01,380
So you can be the leader of the cell.

752
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:08,380
Look here.

753
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:13,580
I'm very curious as to why you're doing this to me.

754
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:19,020
Considering your actions, it seems like you hold some kind of grudge.

755
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,810
I do.

756
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:29,280
However... even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

757
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:35,160
I am saying this to you purely as a prosecutor to a criminal.

758
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,080
You shouldn't be out here.

759
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:41,430
The prison suits you better.

760
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:46,030
I like it.

761
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,160
So now I am very curious...

762
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,580
on how this will end.

763
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,950
If you're finished, you can go.

764
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,740
Okay.

765
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,640
Let me tell you one thing.

766
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:21,390
Going after the weakest spot of your opponent is how politicians fight.

767
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,750
If you cared about Park Sang Man,

768
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,750
you shouldn't have come here.

769
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:43,050
 The phone number dialed is unavailable...

770
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,750
Where are you?

771
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:50,760
In the office.

772
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,580
And Sang Man?

773
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:54,670
He went to buy some food at the restaurant because he was hungry.

774
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,780
Check on him right now.

775
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:02,760
I want just one thing from you. To teach Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu

776
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,740
how it feels to be betrayed by a trusted friend.

777
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:09,190
Just expose Kim Hui Wu.

778
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:11,180
If there is nothing, we can make something up.

779
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,750
Truth is not something to be found but created.

780
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,080
I promise you.

781
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:23,980
You can have as much money and even more power as you want.

782
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,910
I don't think it's a difficult choice.

783
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,750
Is that not right?

784
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:33,650
Hey. Braised chicken doesn't taste good if it's cold.

785
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:49,800
Hold on! Please!

786
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,620
Please, no! Ah!

787
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,980
If you can't betray Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu,

788
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:03,570
then I can use you to break his heart.

789
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,680
Choose.

790
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,650
Is it life or death?

791
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,780
You must live.

792
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:23,520
Only disobedient children make their parents bury them first.

793
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,010
Will you give me money?

794
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:26,790
You can become a chaebol (heir to a conglomerate).

795
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:30,890
You just need to say one thing about Kim Hui Wu.

796
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:35,410
True. There is no one who knows him

797
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,830
better than I do.

798
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:41,950
Keep your promise.

799
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:43,900
Making me a  chaebol.

800
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,630
Let me ask you one thing.

801
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:06,650
Can I assume that this promise is coming from Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop?

802
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:12,340
I need to know who's at the top to do my work. Don't you agree?

803
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,740
Am I right? Is it Assemblyman Jo Tae Seop?

804
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:24,060
What's the matter?

805
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,330
What? What are you doing?

806
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,420
What? Hey! No!

807
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,170
Can't I ask a question? Hold on! No!

808
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:30,730
Hold on!

809
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:31,710
Hey, wait a moment!

810
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:33,200
Hey!

811
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:43,020
You caught me.

812
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,900
Forget it.

813
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,850
I just...

814
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,950
want to remain Hui Wu's friend.

815
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:16,430
 Operating Center

816
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,700
How did it go?

817
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:00,900
I can't promise that the patient

818
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,370
will regain consciousness.

819
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:57,570
Jo Tae Seop.

820
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:59,340
 Kim Hui Wu.

821
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:04,130
It's been a while since I met a fun match.

822
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:09,450
Sir. I think you are overestimating him.

823
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,460
Do you think I fear anyone?

824
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:16,550
Hwang Jin Yong? Or the next President?

825
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:21,060
No. People in their old age don't scare me.

826
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:24,250
The older they get, the more they have to protect

827
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,580
and the more they think about saving face.

828
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,940
But it's not the same with youngsters.

829
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:31,680
They have no need to save face,

830
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,110
be afraid, or protect anything.

831
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:38,980
But Prosecutor Kim Hui Wu can't be a match for you.

832
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,730
And you sent him a warning through Park Sang Man.

833
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:45,680
You think he will see it as a warning? No.

834
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,490
He will challenge me

835
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:52,940
until his last breath.

836
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,090
But he will regret it soon.

837
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:59,610
And when the morning comes, he'll realize.

838
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:03,870
What being powerless means.

839
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:07,490
- Manager Han.
- Yes?

840
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:09,890
Get Kim Hui Wu's call history.

841
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:13,050
- And find out about all of his personal relationships.
- Yes, I got it.

842
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:14,120
Manager Kim.

843
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,550
Tell the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Justice I want to see them immediately.

844
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:19,150
Yes, sir.

845
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,210
 Prosecution Service

846
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:25,640
Gimsan Branch Office?

847
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,900
I've never heard of that city.

848
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,190
He must be going far.

849
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,620
I don't know what happened.

850
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:32,630
- Over there.
 - Maybe he did something wrong.

851
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:40,070
 Notice of Appointment

852
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,590
Both of them are getting transferred?

853
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:44,250
To Gimsan?

854
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,450
I think so.

855
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:48,050
Why all of a sudden?
   Han Mi

856
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,550
Yes?

857
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:52,540
They suddenly want me to go to Japan as a correspondent.

858
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,610
- Seonbae.
- You're here.

859
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:06,680
- Investigator Oh.
- You're here.

860
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,990
We'll meet again soon.

861
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:17,430
It's fine. I'd rather stay somewhere with fresh air than this uptight Seoul.

862
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:20,950
Same here. I think Gimsan is more my scene.

863
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:24,110
Make sure to win.

864
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:27,630
Good luck, Prosecutor Kim.

865
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:39,160
 Gu Seung Hyeok

866
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:41,660
Yes, Seung Hyeok.

867
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,750
I'm going to Gangwon Province.

868
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,630
I'm going to Gimsan.

869
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:49,020
Let me know if there are any good restaurants.

870
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:52,330
You heard her, right? Good luck.

871
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:59,550
 Kim Hui Wu will be completely alone.

872
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:07,650
So he will be in despair as if he's standing at a cliff and feel powerless because there's nothing he can do.

873
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:10,690
He's making an example out of Kim Hui Wu

874
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:15,170
to let the other prosecutors know the assemblyman is to be feared.

875
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:17,810
I'm sure you know it too.

876
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:23,040
It's so easy for fear to turn into respect.

877
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:38,750
 Let me officially introduce myself.

878
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:41,560
 My name is Park Sang Man.

879
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,890
 It's because I like you. I'm more grateful.

880
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:48,620
 You cleared my father's name.

881
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,350
 Fine. Let's do this.

882
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:56,290
 Anyone who breaks the law should be punished.

883
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:58,420
 I knew you were a woman warrior.

884
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:00,430
 Shut it, you brat. I'm your senior.

885
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:02,490
 You punk. I missed you.

886
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:04,360
 Thank you, Hui Wu.

887
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,700
 Someday, hopefully, I can tell you everything.

888
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,890
 I'll wait for that day.

889
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:12,260
 I don't want to stop here.

890
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:16,810
 This darn world where the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer...

891
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:17,820
♫  till the war  ♫

892
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,280
 I want to change that world.

893
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,000
 Kim Hui Wu. Let's do this right.

894
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,250
 Yes, sir.

895
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:26,750
♫  I won’t lose control  ♫

896
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:31,160
♫  Till the day I die  ♫

897
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,870
♫  well it’s freaking tragedy  ♫

898
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:38,120
♫  Why you gonna еlude  ♫

899
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:42,070
♫  Looking at the end you choosе  ♫

900
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:44,760
 I don't have anyone around me anymore.

901
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,890
All of my colleagues and friends are getting hit

902
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:51,830
by the prosecution service and the press.

903
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,710
And the word has spread

904
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:59,430
that whoever works with me will end up getting burned by Jo Tae Seop.

905
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:03,940
I expected this, but I didn't think that

906
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,480
I would be completely isolated like this.

907
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,890
What about you? Are you okay?

908
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:14,650
I also didn't expect it to turn out like this.

909
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:17,900
That it would be to this extent.

910
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:23,630
"I regretted a bit."

911
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:28,160
Maybe I should've left Jo Tae Seop be.

912
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:33,350
Then things wouldn't have gone to this extent.

913
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:39,660
No one would have gotten hurt or died.

914
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:48,950
But I can't turn back time.

915
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:52,770
So I'm going to give

916
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:57,760
Jo Tae Seop a taste of pure misery.

917
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:08,090
I would like to ask for a favor.

918
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:09,250
A favor?

919
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,510
Yes.

920
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,240
What is it?

921
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,430
Tell me.

922
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:19,440
It could be easy or hard.

923
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:23,240
Good work, Prosecutor General Yun.

924
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:27,570
I won't have to get involved with the transfers for a while now.

925
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:29,150
Okay.

926
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,780
Kim Hui Wu wants to bring me down.

927
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:40,140
Do you think you can bring him down?

928
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,710
Yes.

929
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,770
Is there anything you want?

930
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:53,590
I want to follow in my father's footsteps.

931
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:55,290
You want to be a politician?

932
01:10:55,290 --> 01:11:01,460
Not yet. But someday, I want to restore my father's honor.

933
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:11,040
Kim Hui Wu will be your ticket to get a seat in the National Assembly.

934
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,340
Bring him down.

935
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:16,970
Yes, sir.

936
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:29,780
Kim Hui Wu is my ticket.

937
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:53,380
Hey, Brother.

938
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,020
 Prosecution Service

939
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,290
They were transferred out.

940
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:02,250
Seeing what happened here, I feel bad breaking the news.

941
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,650
But I must deliver it.

942
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:09,880
Okay. Go ahead.

943
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,690
Kim Hui Wu.

944
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:16,350
I need you to be my ticket.

945
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:19,340
A ticket?

946
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:21,020
Yes.

947
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:38,050

 I must show him the world I will create.

957

 Don't think that you can stop the press.

958

 You can't catch a devil unless you are more wicked than the devil himself.

 I will do anything to beat Jo Tae Seop even if you get hurt.

 Games are fun when lives are on the line.

 Make Kim Hui Wu the biggest scumbag Korea has seen.

 So I'm going to quit being a prosecutor.
