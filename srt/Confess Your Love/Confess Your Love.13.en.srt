18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,160
We're ready to live together.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,320
We're already living together.

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,400
What?

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,280
Are they really living together?

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,360
Oh, yes.

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,520
That was quite fast.

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,000
Who'd say otherwise?

25
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,680
Yes.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,320
We're already living together.

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,600
Living together!

28
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,600
They're actually living together.

29
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,320
How can we fight them?

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,040
Well...

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,840
The truth is, I quite like you.

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,520
Liu Yan,

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,440
I would like to seriously date you.

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,480
Why do you only have love in your brain?

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,480
We're attached to create hype

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
and popularity.

37
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,320
Will dating you

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,800
make me more popular?

39
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,780
(There is information you want
at Jiangbei Hospital VIP1008)

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,240
It's over. It's over.

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,280
There are at least three paparazzi teams

42
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,440
watching from outside right now.

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,160
What?

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,680
Didn't they already
snap photos of us getting in?

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,000
Why aren't they leaving yet?

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
President Lu, you see.

47
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,120
Lin Wan isn't really good at speaking.

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,320
So, now things have turned awkward.

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,040
What plans do you have?

50
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,960
It's like this.

51
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,080
They have no way to verify

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
that you've both met the parents

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,920
but they will definitely keep a close eye

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,720
on the fact that you're living together.

55
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,320
So, we're thinking,
is it possible for you

56
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,160
to pretend you are both living together?

57
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Living together?

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,400
I guarantee

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,880
I won't disturb your lifestyle.

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,880
I'll move out
as soon as the topic dies down.

61
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,520
About the changes to the contract,

62
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,920
we've already modified it.

63
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,960
(Mock Couple Contract)
In general, the content is about

64
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,320
your status as a real couple

65
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,640
who are now living together

66
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,520
for a duration of half a month.

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,520
After half a month, your popularity
and attention will decrease

68
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,080
which will naturally lead to a breakup.

69
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,440
As for the reward...

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,240
President Lu,

71
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,880
that 115,000 is all that I have.

72
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,280
I still need to pay you in installments.

73
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,800
How about this?

74
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,320
If you agree to one condition from me,

75
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,880
I don't need the agreed upon reward.

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,640
What is it?

77
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,960
From today onward,

78
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,640
other than necessary filming,

79
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,120
you will not go out as you wish.

80
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
If you want to go out,

81
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,520
you must inform me.

82
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,520
And you must always
have someone to accompany you.

83
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
Otherwise, you will have to pay

84
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,520
the 115,000 we previously agreed on.

85
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,320
No problem.

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,880
That's a deal, then.

87
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,720
You're off tomorrow.

88
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,040
There's filming at Jiangbei University
the day after tomorrow.

89
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,480
I'll come to pick you two up.

90
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,880
Not the day after tomorrow!

91
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,320
Come here, I need to talk to you.

92
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,480
Give us a minute.

93
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,920
I have two exams the day after tomorrow

94
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,560
and a practical exam the next day.

95
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,920
If I'm absent, I can't graduate.

96
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,080
Can I take a day off from the show?

97
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,960
Don't panic.

98
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,480
Right now,

99
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,640
they've fixed their eyes on you.

100
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Taking a day off
is going to look suspicious.

101
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,240
What time is your exam?

102
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,080
3 to 5 p.m.

103
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
You're already
at Jiangbei University, right?

104
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,640
When the time comes,

105
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,560
I'll think of a way to give you time off
so you can sneak out.

106
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,360
That way, both sides won't clash.

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,720
I admire you.

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320
Right, I finally got the day off tomorrow.

109
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,640
I want to visit Lin Wan.

110
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,040
Okay.

111
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,800
You must not let Lu Xun find out.

112
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,640
Okay.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,040
President Lu,

114
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,600
you're up early.

115
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,360
Where are you going?

116
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,880
I'm going to the company.

117
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,920
Where are you going?

118
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,560
I think I caught a cold.

119
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,040
I want to go to the hospital.

120
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,720
I'll send you.

121
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,480
No need. No need.

122
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,280
I'm really fine.

123
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,880
Violating the condition where
you must be accompanied by someone

124
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,640
will result in a penalty.

125
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,080
Miss Lin, are you paying it
in cash or with a transfer?

126
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,480
I won't get down

127
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,760
and only send you there.

128
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,440
Besides, the paparazzi are still outside.

129
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,280
Okay.

130
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,440
Why are you dressed like that today?

131
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,000
Just trying out the tyrant boss fashion.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,480
What's this? Do you want
to try working from a car now?

133
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,720
Oh right, Lu Xun.

134
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,760
Is that news about living together
real or fake?

135
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,680
You didn't sign
another contract again, right?

136
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,240
The thing.

137
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,360
Oh.

138
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,120
I found the footage for you.

139
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,520
The incident happened to take place
at the staircase in a blind spot.

140
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,720
There was nothing on it.

141
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,360
I only found footage
outside the hotel entrance.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,080
It was him.

143
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,480
Who is it?

144
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,080
He can't be that man
who injured you six years ago, right?

145
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,160
He got out of prison?

146
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,120
Will he take revenge on you?

147
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,840
What should we do?

148
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,120
Why don't we report this to the police?

149
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,240
Check whether his information

150
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,760
is on the hotel's guests record.

151
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,600
Oh, okay.

152
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,360
I'll get to it.

153
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,360
Did President Lu
really fetch you here just now?

154
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,400
He didn't suspect you at all?

155
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,280
No.

156
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,000
She lost so much weight.

157
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,760
Of course.

158
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,040
She is relying on
nutrient fluid everyday now.

159
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,760
As long as I finish
filming this dating show,

160
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,480
her job will be secured.

161
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,520
She can keep doing what she loves.

162
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,880
Oh right.

163
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,000
Lately, I've been browsing

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,280
the Lin Lu Couple super topic

165
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,400
and read a few fan fictions
about you two.

166
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,320
Let me look for it.

167
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,960
That's my glass.

168
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,600
It's exactly the same,
so don't get it wrong.

169
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,040
Where is it?

170
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,080
It's exactly the same,
don't get it wrong.

171
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,400
What's wrong?

172
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,320
Meng Jiao.

173
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,960
Do you think

174
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,160
someone came after me

175
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,280
but mistook Lin Wan for me?

176
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,520
Our society is ruled by laws.

177
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,320
How could you have so many enemies?

178
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,520
Who did you provoke?

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,080
I remember

180
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,560
when I was five years old,

181
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,840
there was a boy in my neighbor's house.

182
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,840
Yanyan, what will we find here?

183
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,440
That person kept sending me messages.

184
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,680
Maybe it really has something
to do with Lin Wan.

185
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,920
No harm checking it out.

186
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,640
Okay.

187
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,120
Liu Yan?

188
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,880
Why is she here?

189
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,600
Where?

190
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,320
Hurry, think of a way to notify them.

191
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,440
Oh, okay.

192
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,480
Why though?

193
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,600
(Lu Xun) Those are the people
I provoked at the age of 21.

194
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,280
When I was 22 years old,

195
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,440
I saw a kid getting beat up on the road,

196
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
- then I went over and...
- Stop!

197
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,640
You're making my head hurt.

198
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,760
According to you,

199
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,600
you couldn't even get a day off

200
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,000
if everyone wants to settle
their scores with you.

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,480
Why are you always thinking nonsense?

202
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,840
Fine.

203
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,800
I'm going to the restroom.

204
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,840
Lu Xun?

205
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,480
Liu Yan is outside.

206
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll go distract her.

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,040
Stay here and don't move.

208
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,080
It's you again.

209
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,600
How is this?

210
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,400
I look like a tyrant boss this time, right?

211
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,800
Are bosses so free?

212
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,120
Free?

213
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm the vice president of SW.

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,840
I deal with business...

215
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Meng Jiao?

216
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
What are you doing here?

217
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,240
I came to the hospital to take care of

218
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,360
my soon-to-be-paralyzed boyfriend.

219
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,760
Do I even need to report that to you?

220
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Paralyzed?

221
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,240
Your boyfriend?

222
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,400
That's right.

223
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,600
Do you have a problem?

224
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,680
A boyfriend has to be the type

225
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,360
who only loves me

226
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,920
and will never leave me.

227
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,320
Say, are you that unpopular now?

228
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,680
Don't you have any work to do?

229
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,920
Why are you so free to be running around?

230
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,320
That's none of your concern.

231
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,280
Hey!

232
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,920
You!

233
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,640
Lu Xun?

234
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,280
Lin Wan?

235
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,840
Why are you here?

236
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,720
I'm here

237
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
for a jab.

238
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,160
What? Do you have a problem with that?

239
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
You had a plastic surgery?

240
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,240
Is there anything else, Miss Liu?

241
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,880
She came here for plastic surgery.

242
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,240
What about you?

243
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,280
Make payment.

244
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,040
Can't you tell I dislike you?

245
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,040
Leave.

246
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,880
I'm not sending you out, goodbye.

247
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,440
Why are you blushing?

248
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,240
Have you never kissed a girl?

249
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,480
I-I-I... N-No...

250
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,320
No way that's possible.

251
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,400
I've kissed plenty, okay?

252
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,480
You just don't know.

253
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,040
There was a Max, Collie, Sophie...

254
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,120
Wow, so many.

255
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,240
Did they also have two more sisters

256
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,440
and they all went bankrupt?

257
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,240
You...

258
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,520
Okay, stop pretending.

259
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,960
But I can take responsibility
for what I did to you.

260
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,640
At worst, you can kiss me.

261
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
How dare you consider it?

262
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,000
- I didn't, I didn't!
- How dare you consider it?

263
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,160
So you two are twin sisters.

264
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,840
So you really are the president's brother.

265
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,800
Yes, yes.

266
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,040
This is my younger sister, Lin Chen.

267
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,280
Let's hurry up and leave.

268
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,040
The visiting hours for Lin Wan is up.

269
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,720
Family members should leave soon.

270
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,320
Oh, she is Lin Wan.

271
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,800
