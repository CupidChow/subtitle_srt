18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,240
100,000?

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,760
Isn't that too little?

20
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,120
What is it? Do you know me?

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,160
I don't know you.
I've never seen you before.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm sorry, I've bothered you.

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,280
Oh, Lu Xun.

24
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,880
Why are you here all of a sudden?

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,400
I thought you never cared about
the family business.

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,120
I can't do this anymore, I need to go.

27
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,200
Wait, what happened?

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,160
Does Lu Xun know Lin Wan?

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,480
Lin Wan went away as a trainee
during high school.

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,960
Not many people know
we're identical twins.

31
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,000
Wait. Isn't that fine?

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,960
Just pretend you got the wrong person.
What is so awkward about it?

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
I had a crush on him in high school.

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,720
I confessed to him.

35
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Lu Xun, for you.

36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,520
Fine, I get it!

37
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,360
You got rejected?

38
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,200
What's the big deal?

39
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,960
Well...

40
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,280
Why don't you just
start hating me from now on?

41
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,760
What did I just do?

42
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,840
Lin Chen, what kind of a person are you?

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,960
That was so embarrassing.
I need to transfer schools.

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,200
Mom, I want to transfer schools.

45
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,840
No, I want to leave Jiangbei.

46
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
No, no, no!

47
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,400
I need to get out of Asia!

48
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,280
Didn't I say it was super embarrassing?

49
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,400
He must think I'm a pervert.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,640
Don't! He could only think of what you did

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,440
as a negative outburst of love.

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,520
It's no big deal.

53
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Really?

54
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,640
You! For you! Read it now!

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,920
I have something for you!

56
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,080
That's fine too, I guess.

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,720
Are you crazy? What is inside your brain?

58
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,120
This way,
it wouldn't be too embarrassing.

59
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,400
If he came to ask

60
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,640
why I teased him,

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,760
then I can answer

62
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,360
that it was all just a prank.

63
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
He wasn't the only one who fell for it.

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,800
Wow, you're so smart.

65
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,080
So, he really never pursued you?

66
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,120
Where is Lu Xun?

67
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,640
Lu Xun? I heard he transferred,
it was quite sudden.

68
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,520
So, that means,

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,400
you teased him

70
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,840
and he transferred overnight.

71
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,880
We lost contact after he transferred.

72
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,360
And I just handed him a love contract.

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,520
I can't live on this planet anymore.

74
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,600
Okay, you made sense.

75
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,480
Let's just pack up.

76
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,800
We can't do this anymore.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,320
Pack that. That's money.

78
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,880
Meng Jiao. Meng Jiao.

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,040
The show is about to start filming soon.

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,720
Since we don't have
an introductory couple here,

81
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,540
she'll only be given an appearance.

82
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,560
As for the tasks afterwards,
Miss Lin might not

83
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,640
be able to participate at all.

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,160
Thank you for the good news.

85
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,960
I'll wait for you at the entrance.

86
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,080
Miss Lin, when you're onstage,

87
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,360
we want to focus on your reaction.

88
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,680
So it's better to exaggerate a little.

89
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,320
That way, not everything will be cut out.

90
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,440
- I got it.
- Okay.

91
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,480
Here, get the cameras ready.

92
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Introducing our first guest, Meng Ya.

93
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,600
Introducing our second female guest,
Liu Yan.

94
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,880
Why are there two of you?

95
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,160
I do feel sorry for the girl

96
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,400
behind Door Number 3,

97
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,680
but this time

98
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,320
I came here for you.

99
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,080
Miss Liu Yan, please pick a partner.

100
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,440
The person who didn't get picked

101
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,400
may have to temporarily leave the show.

102
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,000
What would Lin Wan do then?

103
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,400
Miss Lin, I'm sorry.

104
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,800
I've decided to pick Liu Yan.

105
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,960
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,480
Reaction.

107
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,520
Your reaction.

108
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,880
Why is this happening?

109
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,400
If no one picks me, then I'll leave.

110
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,320
I'll pick you.

111
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,800
Why are you spacing out?

112
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,400
Don't recognize me anymore?

113
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,560
President Lu?

114
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,080
President Lu will join
the show as a guest.

115
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,120
The contract is being finalized.

116
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,520
Everyone can move onto the group tasks.

117
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Then I'll pick Lin Wan.

118
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,440
Miss Lin,
do you still remember that contract?

119
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,480
But this hug

120
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,320
should cost you 5,000 more, right?

121
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,680
3,000.

122
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,480
6,000.

123
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,280
3,500.

124
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,040
7,000.

125
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,640
Aren't you a president?

126
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,720
Why do you want to earn spare change?

127
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
It's because I care about spare change

128
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,720
that I can become the president.

129
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,840
Fine, 5,000 it is.

130
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,320
Unfortunately, Zhao Chen doesn't have
a partner, please leave the stage.

131
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,240
This is the task card for today.

132
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,520
Just read it out loud.

133
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,580
(Three Day Lovers)

134
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,200
Everyone, please head to the next location

135
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,520
and enjoy the first autumn camping.

136
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,360
This is great, we can go camping.

137
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,160
Let's go.

138
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,880
Lin Chen's life is not in danger

139
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,240
but she has brain injury.

140
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,720
She is in a coma for now.

141
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,640
I got it.

142
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,560
Lin Chen and Lin Wan

143
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,280
are really alike.

144
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,680
If it was anyone else, they would've thought
it was Lin Wan who got injured.

145
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,600
You must keep this a secret
and don't tell anyone else.

146
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,480
Of course.

147
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh, wow!

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,080
What's happening?

149
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,240
Let's have a toast!

150
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,080
I haven't come out to have fun in a while.

151
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,440
This is really exciting.

152
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,280
Meng Ya, let's take a walk by the lake.

153
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,320
Sure, let's go.

154
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,720
Liu Mo, what is wrong?

155
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,120
I think

156
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,880
I got bitten by a bug.

157
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,320
Don't worry, I brought ointment.

158
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,960
So much drama.

159
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,640
Did you get bitten by a bug too?

160
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,280
What? Did you bring ointment too?

161
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,240
That's a hassle.

162
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,520
See? Do this
and it won't be itchy anymore.

163
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Put my jacket on, don't catch a cold.

164
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,880
You're really considerate.

165
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,160
You're sweating.

166
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,840
I'm not.

167
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,400
Hey, Liu Mo.

168
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

169
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,160
Why do you apologize?

170
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,440
I lost.

171
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,120
Do you want to win?

172
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,400
