18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,560
Is this the first time
you confessed to me?

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,680
No.

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,320
You mean,

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,480
you kissed me

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,960
but it's not the first time you confessed?

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,600
Yes.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,960
You're angry? Why?

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,680
What are you doing?

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,080
I didn't want to kiss you.

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,400
You got hit?

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,600
Looks like Meng Jiao doesn't love you.

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,880
Little Lin doesn't love you too.

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,920
Hey, Lu Xun. Do you remember
why she got angry yesterday?

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,640
I said this wasn't
the first time I confessed.

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,560
But it really isn't.

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,880
You kissed her, she hit you.

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,120
Then that means she doesn't love you.

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,800
Why did Meng Jiao get angry?

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Well,

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,640
I accidentally
kissed Meng Jiao yesterday.

38
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,040
I told her I didn't want to kiss her.

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,560
No, actually I want to kiss her.

40
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,960
No, I didn't want to kiss her.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,440
I mean, I didn't kiss her on purpose.

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,480
I just...

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,840
She hates me now, right?

44
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,680
What are you afraid of?

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,960
Go ask her yourself.

46
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,160
I dare not.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,920
I feel awkward for you
when I remember that you still have

48
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,600
a special engagement episode
to record tonight.

49
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,440
What are you doing?

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,560
I'll go ask her myself.

51
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,120
Hey, where are you going?

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,720
Miss Lin has a schedule
to stick to today.

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,080
She is going back to university
for her final exam.

54
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,880
I'll send you.

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,400
No need, President Lu.

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,880
We are just business associates.

57
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,280
It's better to keep
our distance in private.

58
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,400
But we're getting engaged tonight...

59
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,280
No need to worry, President Lu.

60
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,520
We will definitely attend all events

61
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,320
mentioned in the contract on time.

62
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,680
After all, we've been
working together for so long.

63
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
We will put on this act

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,760
until the end of the contract.

65
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Lu Xun, why did you get cold feet?

66
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,680
Do you want your credit card
frozen forever?

67
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,360
Lu Xun, I think you can still salvage this.

68
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,000
He kissed and didn't admit
it is a confession.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,160
He kissed and didn't come over
for a talk.

70
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,560
What kind of person is that?

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm glad I didn't confess first.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,320
Otherwise, I'd be so embarrassed.

73
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,080
Not one of these two
from Lu family is good.

74
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,440
Yes. Isn't Lu Feng pretty good?

75
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,560
Yesterday, weren't you two
covered under...

76
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,720
Remember this.

77
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,880
Don't mingle so much
with your classmates.

78
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,000
Try not to get recognized.

79
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,440
Come out immediately after the exam.
I'll be waiting here for you.

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,560
We still need to go filming
in the evening.

81
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,720
Got it.

82
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,980
(Lu Xun & Lin Wan
Engagement Press Conference)

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,600
President Lu.

84
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,080
President Lu, you came early.

85
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,640
Lu Xun, you need to do well
during tonight's

86
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,680
special engagement episode.

87
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,880
You might still have a chance.

88
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,800
I want to make a confession.

89
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,360
Looks like something big
is going to happen tonight.

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,920
I'll go arrange it.

91
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,880
Lu Xun, didn't we discuss this?

92
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,120
You cannot confess first.

93
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,720
Besides, you're doing it
in front of so many...

94
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,320
Oh, I know now.

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,000
You purposely want to do it
in front of many people.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,520
In case your confession fails,

97
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,280
Little Lin wouldn't publicly reject you.

98
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,400
So you'll still have a chance.

99
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,320
Lu Xun, you're a real scum.

100
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,300
(Liu Yan: I have information on him)

101
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,920
Hey!

102
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,560
You're here. Come in.

103
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
You're here for the practical?

104
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,200
Have you gotten the rabbit for today?

105
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,240
Not yet.

106
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,360
Come get it with me.

107
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,560
He is coming for you.

108
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,240
I know that.

109
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Lu Xun,

110
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,320
take Lin Chen and leave.

111
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,480
He will come harder at you two.

112
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,400
I don't need the wine.

113
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,680
If you have no information,

114
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,560
then I'm leaving.

115
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,640
You're very cautious, aren't you?

116
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,360
You didn't drink the drugged wine.

117
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
How dare you come to my hotel?

118
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,040
Hello, President Lu.

119
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Get the security.

120
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,280
Looks like,

121
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,760
you don't care about Lin Chen.

122
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,600
President Lu,
where do you want security to go?

123
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,480
Their university has a cold storage.

124
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,800
Here's a fun fact.

125
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,040
The lowest temperature a human can survive

126
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,520
is -20°C.

127
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,760
This isn't the warehouse.

128
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,480
Open the door.

129
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,320
Professor, open the door.

130
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's have a nice chat now, shall we?

131
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,920
President Lu,
where do you want security to go?

132
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,680
That's right.

133
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,040
It's just a small dose of sedative.

134
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,840
You will only pass out.

135
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,400
When you wake up,

136
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,480
you would've fallen
from a privileged person

137
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,680
to a criminal who molested Liu Yan.

138
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,120
As long as you cooperate,

139
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,760
I will have Lin Chen released.

140
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,400
Oh, right. Humans can only survive

141
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,320
in -20°C for only

142
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,840
20 minutes.

143
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,480
You only have two choices now.

144
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,800
You will either be charged for molestation

145
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
or let Lin Chen die.

146
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,560
I can tell you love her quite a lot.

147
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,600
Why don't you sacrifice yourself?

148
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,360
Do you think I'll choose

149
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,960
because you want me to?

150
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,200
Do you think you can be
the hero to save her?

151
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,480
It takes more than

152
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,800
20 minutes to get there from here.

153
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,200
I'd advise you not to fail
to protect either one.

154
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
That's why I won't be
wasting time here with you.

155
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,600
Hello, President Lu.

156
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,480
Lin Chen is in the cold storage.
Find someone now.

157
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,320
What?

158
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,360
She is locked in the university's freezer.
Get the security to save her.

159
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,980
(Cold storage temperature display -19°C)

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,840
Then give me the keys.

161
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,760
- I'll go in by myself.
- Where is Lin Chen?

162
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,160
All the way to the end.

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,800
What are you doing? Stop!

164
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,100
Lin Chen!

165
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,920
- What are you doing? Stop!
- Lin Chen!

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,960
What are you doing?

167
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,720
If you keep doing this,
we'll call the police.

168
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,600
Do it again and we'll call the police.
