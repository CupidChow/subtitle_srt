I...

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,640
Liu Yan,

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
why do I see you everywhere?

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,440
Is your sister here too?

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,720
You sisters

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,320
must both be in the university.

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,560
I've told my sister

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,800
everything you've done.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,640
You knew it.

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,880
My sister isn't as kind as I am.

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,000
Do you still want to meet her?

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,080
Just film your show.

31
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,200
Let's go.

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,160
How is it? Did she fall for it?

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,440
Don't turn your head.

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,240
Did you know how dangerous it was

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,040
to do that?

36
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,880
You knew you have an allergy
and you still do it.

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,680
If...

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm not criticizing you.

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,520
What I meant was...

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,920
I'll send you back.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No need.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,480
I still have another exam.

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,880
Then I'll wait for you.

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,800
No need.

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,080
Meng Jiao will pick me up.

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,080
What's wrong with you?

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,120
You've been spacing out

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,480
during filming today.

49
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,320
I think

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,720
I've fallen for Lu Xun.

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,800
Please.

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,320
You have a meet-and-greet tomorrow.

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,480
We haven't even decided

54
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,600
on your outfit for the day.

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,520
Now you're telling me

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,360
you think you've fallen in love

57
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
with your childhood crush again.

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,360
No way.

59
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,840
Why have I fallen

60
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,160
into the same trap again
after six years?

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,440
So

62
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,560
she is angry?

63
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,760
Of course.

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,360
You spoke so fiercely to her.

65
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,840
How can anyone not get angry?

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,200
(Three Day Lovers)

67
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
I got too anxious then.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
Being anxious is not an excuse.

69
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,320
If you really love him,

70
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,480
why don't you just ask him?

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,560
Ask what?

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,200
I've already confessed to him once,

73
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,240
if I get rejected again,

74
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,400
I'll be so embarrassed.

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,600
Our contract hasn't ended yet.

76
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,160
I still need to live
in the same house with him.

77
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
I feel so awkward.

78
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,040
Fan fiction!

79
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,480
What's a fan fiction?

80
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,800
Meng Jiao sent me this.

81
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,760
Look at this.

82
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,920
These are all written by your fans.

83
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,880
(#TyrantBossCourtsPamperedWife)
One of them

84
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,720
is about you making her angry.

85
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,280
And then

86
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,720
by relying on three criterions,

87
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,920
you successfully persuaded her.

88
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,440
Have you been

89
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,880
reading these nonsense all day?

90
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,440
Don't mention about fan fiction anymore.

91
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,600
Do you know
how embarrassed I was yesterday?

92
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,880
Oh, let me tell you.

93
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,600
Fans nowadays are really talented.

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,040
Let me show you

95
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,120
the one I read two days ago.

96
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,180
(#LinLuCouple  #ContractCouple
#MarriedFirstThenFallInLove)

97
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,920
What is written here is about you two

98
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
being a contract couple

99
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,000
and falling in love
after getting married.

100
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,240
The female lead isn't sure
if the male lead

101
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,720
is really in love with her

102
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,880
so she decided to test him.

103
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,840
Test?

104
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,320
You have to know

105
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,000
whether Lu Xun
is interested in you or not.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,720
If he is, then you can ask him.

107
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,000
Things like confessing

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,080
are just like fighting.

109
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,880
You have to land the hit first
before you shout your move.

110
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,160
Doing the opposite
will never win a fight.

111
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
That makes sense.

112
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,880
How do I test him?

113
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,680
(Miss Lin is personally)

114
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,960
(making dinner for Mr. Lu,)

115
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,840
(gracefully and demurely.)

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,960
What are you doing?

117
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,280
Making dinner.

118
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,800
You?

119
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,720
(To create an intimate contact,)

120
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,920
(Miss Lin intentionally says:)

121
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,240
I don't have a rubber band.

122
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,480
Can you do my hair for me?

123
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
(Mr. Lu uses his hand)

124
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,760
(to gently gather Miss Lin's hair.)

125
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,040
(The two of them stand extremely close.)

126
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,720
(No one dares to move.)

127
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,880
(They are afraid one move)

128
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,480
(will expose how fast their heart beats.)

129
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,720
(Miss Lin knows)

130
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,600
(Mr. Lu will keep
holding her hair like this)

131
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,560
(because none of them
wants this moment to end.)

132
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,040
I have.

133
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,680
(Number one)

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,240
(is to be prepared)

135
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
(with everything that a girl needs)

136
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,960
(to show that you care.)

137
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,560
Eat this on your own.

138
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,640
(Miss Lin deliberately
slips her sexy lingerie)

139
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,000
(into Mr. Lu's clothes.)

140
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,160
Sexy.

141
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,000
President Lu,

142
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,920
here are your clothes, do put them away.

143
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,400
(Mr. Lu discovers Miss Lin's lingerie.)

144
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
(He blushes as his heart beats fast.)

145
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,480
Did I ruin this?

146
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,160
(Mr. Lu opens the door)

147
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,760
(and faces a shy Miss Lin.)

148
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,800
Don't you have anything to say to me?

149
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,240
I think I misplaced my clothes.

150
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,960
Did I mix it up with yours?

151
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,320
(Number two.)

152
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,400
(You must not make
a single mistake today.)

153
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
(Otherwise, your girlfriend will be)

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,280
(even more displeased with you.)

155
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,560
No.

156
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,840
I don't see it at all.

157
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,320
That's strange.

158
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,320
Where could it have gone?

159
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,560
(Miss Lin deliberately
tries on a dress.)

160
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,640
Are you seated?

161
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,320
Yes.

162
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,960
(Mr. Lu's heart races when he sees)

163
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,080
(the beautiful Miss Lin.)

164
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,720
(But he is afraid Miss Lin
will notice him acting strangely.)

165
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,160
Meng Jiao wants me to try on the outfits

166
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,560
for the meet-and-greet tomorrow.

167
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,760
(He could only silently think:)

168
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,880
(It doesn't look good.)

169
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,840
Does it look good?

170
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,240
Looks good.

171
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,680
(Point number three is the easiest.)

172
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
(You must go along with her.)

173
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,680
(Do not have a different opinion.)

174
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,040
What about this?

175
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Yes, looks good.

176
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,240
Looks good.

177
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,680
(Miss Lin wears a sexy dress.)

178
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,440
(Mr. Lu seems jealous)

179
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,560
(but he can only pretend
he doesn't care)

180
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,880
(and tells Miss Lin to wear a coat.)

181
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,200
Isn't this outfit a bit...

182
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,440
A bit, what?

183
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,280
(Remember.)

184
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,640
(You must go along with her.)

185
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,720
It looks good.

186
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,660

How is it?

223
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,840
