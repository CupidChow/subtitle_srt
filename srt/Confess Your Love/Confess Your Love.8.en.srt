18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,520
What about you, Miss Lin?

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,120
Have you learned anything new
about Mr. Lu?

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,920
Mr. Lu is...

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,760
I'm sorry, I need the restroom.

22
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,280
Okay. Everyone, stop rolling.

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,360
Take a break where you are.

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,000
What's wrong?

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,840
I have an allergic reaction.

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,600
What's going on?

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,400
I clearly told them

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,000
that you can only drink fruit juice.

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm fine.

30
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,720
I don't think I had a lot.

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,600
The first time I ate
a bar of chocolate as a kid,

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,000
I almost went into shock.

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,920
Just cover up my neck and it'll be fine.

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,640
Okay.

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,000
Then go buy me some
anti-allergy medicine.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,640
Okay.

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,800
Wait for me, I'll be quick.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,520
My God, why is it so serious?

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,800
Lin Wan,

40
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,880
why are you hiding in the restroom

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,320
and refuse to come out?

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,600
What are you doing here?

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,520
I don't have work today.

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,240
So I came here to learn
acting skills from Lin Wan.

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,920
You are sweet and gentle in one moment,

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,200
then you are smart
with a sharp tongue the next.

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
Just like a pair of twins.

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,800
Oh, I forgot.

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,840
You really do have a twin sister,

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,040
in line with my theory.

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,760
Are you spinning a story?

52
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,880
We don't have time to waste on you.

53
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,760
Let's go.

54
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,640
Wait.

55
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,480
Hey.

56
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,760
I lived with Lin Wan

57
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,000
for four years overseas.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
She has a serious case of
low blood sugar level

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,760
and always has chocolates on her.

60
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,760
Whether I'm spinning a story or not,

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,280
we'll know after you eat this.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,720
Lin Wan.

63
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,400
You wouldn't have yourself substituted
to lie to everyone, right?

64
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,000
If that really is the case,

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,640
then you're all out of options.

66
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,960
From now onwards,

67
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,400
it's impossible for Lin Wan to survive
in the entertainment industry.

68
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,200
Are you quitting acting?

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,240
Since you can spin stories,

70
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,240
why don't you become a screenwriter?

71
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,440
No more nonsense.

72
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,720
Whether you're lying to your fans
or I'm spinning a story,

73
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,600
it will all be recorded in the video.

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,680
No matter how smart you are,

75
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,600
you cannot change it.

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,760
If you really have an allergic reaction

77
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,560
and die because you
insisted on eating this,

78
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,240
then you can't blame me.

79
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,480
You said I'm not Lin Wan, right?

80
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,000
Fine.

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,360
If I turn out fine,

82
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,640
you will hide as far away as possible

83
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,920
whenever you see my face.

84
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,200
Also, you're not allowed

85
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,920
to scheme behind my back.

86
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,800
Sure.

87
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,800
Don't forget what you said.

88
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
This is impossible.

89
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,720
You clearly had a huge change
in personality.

90
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,800
Let me tell you something.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,360
No matter how good-tempered a person is,

92
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,040
they will want to beat you up
after spending some time with you.

93
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,320
You...

94
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,760
Lin Wan.

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,400
Lin Wan, let me look at you.

96
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,180
♪I need someone to take my heart♪

97
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,220
♪I need someone to change my mind♪

98
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,200
President Lu.

99
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,280
Miss Lin,

100
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,760
you injured my arm last night.

101
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,720
I need to go to the hospital today.

102
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,040
I can't go on filming the show today.

103
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,720
You...

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,080
Miss Liu, is there anything else?

105
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,660
♪You got something special,
my heart is crying for you♪

106
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,480
Lin Chen.

107
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,960
Lin Chen.

108
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,840
You're awake.

109
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,800
You scared me.

110
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,480
Come on.

111
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,280
Gently now.

112
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,720
Liu Yan didn't find out, right?

113
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,120
No.

114
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,400
She wouldn't dare bully Lin Wan anymore.

115
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,000
Just take a good rest.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,160
If something happens to you,

117
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
how am I going to explain it
to your sister?

118
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,480
I can't always be unable to protect

119
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,840
even one of you sisters, right?

120
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,320
You're exaggerating.

121
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,640
Did Lu Xun send me here?

122
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,400
Yes.

123
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,680
But he has already left.

124
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,720
Don't worry.

125
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,320
Lu Xun told the production team

126
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,840
that he needed some rest today

127
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,880
because of his injury.

128
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,160
So you don't need to go back to film.

129
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,840
I think I heard him

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,440
calling me Lin Chen.

131
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,520
That's impossible, right?

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,880
Wasn't your crush

133
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
just a prank?

134
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,280
Why would he remember you?

135
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,400
Don't put it that bluntly.

136
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,440
Right.

137
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,360
Speaking of Liu Yan,

138
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,160
she usually doesn't look that smart

139
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,200
but how did she notice that tiny detail

140
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,680
about the chocolate?

141
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,640
We need to be extra careful next time.

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,120
Hello.

143
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,440
Yes, that's me.

144
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,920
Okay, no problem.

145
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Thank you.

146
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,360
Remember that web drama I told you about?

147
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,000
They want to meet us.

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,560
We can have dinner with them tonight

149
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,720
right at SW Hotel.

150
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,400
Didn't you say

151
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,160
I only need to film this dating show?

152
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,120
You wouldn't understand this.

153
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,480
We need to start
getting in touch for this project

154
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,160
and wait for it
to get the green light for filming.

155
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,600
That might not be until

156
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,560
next year

157
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,360
or even the year after.

158
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,640
By then,
Lin Wan must have already woken up.

159
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,240
You wouldn't know

160
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,880
how much Lin Wan had wanted

161
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
to play the supporting female
in this project.

162
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,960
But they just ignored us
even though I spent months

163
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,760
trying to get in touch with them.

164
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,880
Fine.

165
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,200
I'll go fight for it.

166
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,200
Hey, wait.

167
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,720
Right now, we need to turn you

168
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,960
into a celebrity.

169
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Huh?

170
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Just a slip. Let's move on.

171
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,760
Are you okay?

172
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,680
I didn't break my promise, okay?

173
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,240
The producer wanted me to come.

174
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,320
I couldn't refuse, right?

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
Fine, this doesn't count.

176
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,320
What are you doing here?

177
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,240
Are you here for the supporting female?

178
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,240
You're aiming for supporting female too?

179
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,720
Here, President Liu. This way.

180
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,360
Everyone is here.

181
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,640
Good, good.

182
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,960
Don't stand on ceremony.

183
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,200
Please, take a seat.

184
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,280
With two beauties sitting by my sides,

185
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,240
this room has turned dazzling.

186
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,600
Everyone,

187
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,320
in order to keep the script confidential

188
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,480
and prevent any leaks,

189
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,560
we are taking precautions

190
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,680
and I will temporarily

191
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,960
keep your phones.

192
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,080
Please cooperate.

193
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,600
Please cooperate.

194
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,480
My apologies.

195
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,480
My apologies.

196
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,080
He is our investor,

197
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,640
President Liu.

198
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,280
Everyone, do speak freely.

199
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,640
Okay.

200
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Today,

201
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,920
we won't talk about anything else.

202
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,400
Let's just make merry.

203
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,080
You must drink

204
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,240
this first toast!

205
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,360
- Come.
- Okay.

206
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,720
We haven't got to talk about business yet

207
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,440
and we're already drinking?

208
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,800
I'm telling you,

209
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,880
just play it by the ear.

210
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm raising the second toast

211
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,360
to our fateful meeting.

212
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,920
Whoever doesn't drink

213
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,760
would be disrespecting me, okay?

214
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,960
Who would do so, President Liu?

215
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,840
Here is a toast.

216
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,720
Good.

217
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
I like your straightforward personality.

218
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,960
Come.

219
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,680
Come, come.

220
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,560
She drank too much.

221
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,920
President Liu,

222
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,560
Wanwan

223
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,240
can't hold her liquor well.

224
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,120
I'll drink in her stead.

225
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,920
Cheers.

226
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,880
Good.

227
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,560
Good!

228
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
You're a good drinker.

229
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,360
I'll be right back, then we'll leave.

230
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,240
Female celebrities

231
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,200
are really pretty.

232
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,800
Miss Liu,

233
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,000
let me hear

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,120
your opinion.

235
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,720
How do you interpret this role?

236
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,880
This role

237
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,720
will definitely go to either one of you.

238
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,000
Look.

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,200
If you don't drink,

240
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
that means you disrespect me.

241
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,400
You're no fun.

242
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,520
Miss Lin,

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,160
tell me.

244
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,040
How do you interpret...

245
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you doing, Miss Lin?

246
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,640
Isn't it obvious enough?

247
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,240
Of course, I want you to sober up.

248
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,200
Miss Lin, you're very brave.

249
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,040
You've offended me

250
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,240
and you still want to remain
in this industry?

251
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,800
You're behaving so disgustingly

252
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,120
and you dare threaten others?

253
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,360
Why pretend to be virtuous?

254
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,480
Let me go.

255
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,320
Where is President Lu?

256
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,560
Let me go.

257
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,800
Keep pretending.

258
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,200
Lin Chen.

259
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,960
It's okay now. It's okay now.

260
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,560
When did you know

261
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,880
that I'm Lin Chen?

262
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,460
