Let's tune into the dating reality show

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,320
brought to you by SW,

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,440

(Three Day Lovers SW)

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,280
Miss Lin, this is
the information on the male guest.

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,000
You can only open it at the start
of the official filming.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,040
Thank you.

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,680
Wanwan.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,960
This dating show is the final notice.

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,040
If we still can't
make a splash this time,

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,400
the company will really
stop giving us resources.

31
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,400
Meng Jiao, don't worry.

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,600
I will perform well this time.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
I want him.

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Hey, Director.

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,560
The best person who can influence
the popularity of this dating show

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,920
(Liu Mo: New generation male actor)
must be our Yanyan, correct?

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,560
Please come this way, Director.

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,640
Let's have a word outside.

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,480
This Liu Mo

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,320
played the supporting male
in a recent hit drama series.

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,880
He must be someone popular.

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,680
There will be more headlines
if I coupled with him.

43
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,400
Liu Yan, are you joking?

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,720
You are breaking the rules of the show.

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,840
Rules

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,000
are for extras like you.

47
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,080
Liu Yan.

48
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,440
Are you crazy? Why did you hit her?

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
Would you believe me
if I say I'll make this viral?

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,600
Are you really that naive?

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,840
I have 6 million fans.

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,120
And you only have 60,000.

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
Popularity is all that matters
in this world.

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,760
Would anyone even believe you?

55
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,800
Lin Wan, while we're abroad,

56
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,880
you stole my debut role.

57
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,640
Now that we're back,
I won't let you have it easy.

58
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,960
Don't even dream of becoming famous
by squeezing your way into a dating show.

59
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,360
With me around,

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,920
you will never rise to fame.

61
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,120
Upcoming popular sweetheart

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,600
has another side to her.

63
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,240
I've even thought of
a trending topic for you.

64
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,880
Top that with this video,

65
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
what do you think will happen?

66
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:17,880
You...

67
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,760
Can't you even tell a pair of twins
when you see one?

68
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,720
You can't be

69
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,120
that rumored dumb beauty, are you?

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,040
You little...

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,480
Hey, why are you angry?

72
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,160
Even though I said you're dumb,

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,040
I didn't deny that you're beautiful.

74
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,720
While I'm hammering you,

75
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,120
I'm also helping you
to turn things around.

76
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm such a kind beauty.

77
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,480
Liu Yan, she is my younger sister.

78
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,520
She isn't in the industry.

79
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,080
You don't need to...

80
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,320
Yes, I'm not in the industry.

81
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,080
That's why there are
a lot of things I can do.

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,280
That envelope.

83
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Give it to me.

84
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,480
You dare blackmail me?

85
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,160
How is this a blackmail?

86
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,360
Using your own blackmail materials

87
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,800
to exchange for something
that doesn't belong to you

88
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,880
is called a special deal.

89
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,200
Miss Lin, here are your dresses.

90
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
I'll hang them here for you.

91
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,760
During the photo shoot later,

92
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,480
do not wear red.

93
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,000
Hear that?

94
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,240
Is Liu Yan insane?

95
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,000
You all stayed in the same dorm before.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,720
You even trained overseas together
for five years.

97
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,960
She couldn't get a debut spot,

98
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,400
then blamed it all on Lin Wan.

99
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,320
In the end, she came back all depressed.

100
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,760
How can someone like her become popular?

101
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,680
If you didn't have a case of
low blood sugar level towards the end

102
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,800
and were forced to quit,

103
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,920
would she get a chance?

104
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,240
Liu Yan isn't really a mean person.

105
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,360
She is just short-tempered.

106
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,080
Okay, I'll go change. Let's talk later.

107
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,560
Good thing you're here today.

108
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,840
Otherwise, there's no way
we could fight back that easily.

109
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,880
She dares to bully Lin Wan.

110
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,800
How could I let her off so easily?

111
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,840
Good, good. Excellent.

112
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,000
Next, let's have
the other three female artists

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,400
for the main poster.

114
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
Liu Yan.

115
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,400
You look better in person than on TV.

116
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,040
Thank you.

117
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,240
Where is Lin Wan? Where is Lin Wan?

118
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,040
Lin Wan!

119
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,160
Didn't I tell you not to wear red?

120
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,760
Just now, my younger sister

121
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,360
got the white dress dirty.

122
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,720
So I can only wear this.

123
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
You all did it on purpose, didn't you?

124
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,120
What is going on?

125
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,600
What's happening?

126
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,080
We're just chatting.

127
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,520
Let Miss Lin sit in the middle.

128
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,200
That way, dresses of the same color
will create a sense of layers.

129
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,960
I...

130
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,360
Oh.

131
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,600
Lin Wan is the most prominent protagonist.

132
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,760
Where are they?

133
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,240
Careful.

134
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,440
Gently, gently.

135
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,880
Lin Wan, what happened?

136
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,840
She might have slipped and fell down.

137
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,720
Get to the hospital.

138
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,400
Wait.

139
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
The show hasn't
officially started filming.

140
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,280
If they find out that something
has happened to Lin Wan,

141
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,640
they will switch her out on the spot.

142
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,520
What do you mean?

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,160
This is Lin Wan's last chance.

144
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,600
If she misses this chance,

145
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,320
she will only be suspended by the company

146
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,800
until her 10-year contract ends

147
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,440
or be hit with a huge penalty.

148
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,200
If that happens,
even after Lin Wan wakes up,

149
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,040
she will face a dead end either way.

150
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,880
Why don't we give this a shot?

151
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,320
You'll be Lin Wan.

152
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,960
Will this work?

153
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,600
Your semester hasn't started, right?

154
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,120
This dating show will only take a month.

155
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,840
Give this a shot, and go out with a bang.

156
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,200
You have to do this.

157
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,880
Meng Jiao, Miss Lin,
I found you at last.

158
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,560
There is a last minute change.

159
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,320
Well,

160
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,480
Liu Mo's team is now unwilling

161
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,080
to be coupled with Miss Lin's team.

162
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,320
Without a male guest,
Miss Lin can only appear at the beginning.

163
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,080
So, there isn't much for her to film.

164
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,640
Liu Yan must have done something.

165
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,040
So the production team wants us

166
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,440
to voluntarily pull out, right?

167
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
As long as I have a partner,

168
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,120
I can continue to be on the show, correct?

169
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,520
Logically speaking, yes.

170
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,080
But look at the situation right now.

171
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
How would you know it won't work
if you don't try?

172
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,120
President Lu, we didn't expect you
to come in person.

173
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,200
(Mock Couple Contract) Have you
made inquiries on the third male guest?

174
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,160
Room 809, Zhao Chen.

175
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,640
Are you sure he'll be your partner?

176
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,960
Participation in this show
is all about self-promotion.

177
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
He is also a small-time artist.

178
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,080
Maybe he might not listen to Liu Yan.

179
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,560
Okay.

180
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,920
Liu Yan wants to force
Lin Wan out of the way.

181
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,280
Then I'll make her stay on.

182
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Let's go!

183
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,720
Zhao Chen,

184
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,720
I understand that Liu Yan told you

185
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,080
that you can't be my partner.

186
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,120
But she already has plans
to attach herself to Liu Mo.

187
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
Why don't we help each other out

188
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,760
and form an introductory couple?

189
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,600
The show swaps couples every three days.

190
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,520
As long as you help me
to remain in the show,

191
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,760
you can have other plans
after that three days is up.

192
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,480
I'm willing to offer you
a reward of 100,000.

193
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,240
Just think of it as making some money.

194
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,520
I know this sounds a bit outrageous

195
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
but...

196
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,360
Lu Xun, for you.

197
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,040
100,000? Isn't that too little?
