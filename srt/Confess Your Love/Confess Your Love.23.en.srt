Deliberately damaging
the property of others

33

is a criminal offense, do you know that?

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,960
Lin Chen and Lu Xun are murderers.

Your clothes.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,880
This fits perfectly

43
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,280
with my identity as a New York artist.

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,960
What a load of bull.

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,400
Why did you buy a cake?

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,640
Birthday?

47
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,320
I never celebrate my birthday.

48
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,240
I know but you see,

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,600
so many things had been going on lately,

50
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,960
let's celebrate your birthday

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,280
and maybe it'll turn things around.

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,800
I put a lot of thought
into selecting this cake.

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,160
It must have gotten damaged
in the fall just now.

54
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,160
It's fine, I'll make you birthday noodles.

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,480
It's fine, I'll see what we have
in the house

56
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,440
and I'll cook.

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,400
It's okay. We still have candles.
The candles.

58
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
We'll just make do with these.

59
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,560
It's fine, I'll just go buy some.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,120
We'll go.

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,400
You two should stay at home.

62
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,520
It's safer that way.

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,000
Wait, why should we settle like this
for his birthday?

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,680
But outside...

65
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,960
Lu Xun didn't do anything wrong,

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,320
so we shouldn't stay hidden at home.

67
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,000
I impersonated Lin Wan

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,280
and lied to everyone,

69
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,720
so I should bear the consequences.

70
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,520
The bad guy should be afraid.

71
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,920
We should stand tall and proud outside.

72
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,880
He wants us to be afraid,
I just won't be.

73
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,360
Mr. Lu, what do you think?

74
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,200
This birthday sounds good.

75
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,240
Besides, it might not be that bad.

76
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,640
Look, I managed to buy a birthday cake.

77
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,840
I bought roses too.

78
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,000
Is that for me?

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,480
Yes.

80
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,480
Thank you.

83

I'm hungry.

84
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,360

85

Can we borrow a light?

88
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,320
Let's just eat.

89
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,760
I'm fine, I'll eat something else.

90
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,720
Manager, come here.

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
What is wrong with your food?
Is this on purpose?

92
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,640
This is what we serve.
Don't eat if you don't want to.

93
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,520
Honestly, we don't welcome you here.

94
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,440
If you won't eat, then leave.

95
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,080
You...

96
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,440
- Good job, Manager.
- You did great, Manager.

97
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,000
Well done, wonderful!

98
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,880
Let's go.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,040

100

to buy us something to eat.

The reality is

104
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,640
it's a bad idea to come outside.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,120

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,760
No.

107
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,920
You don't want our business too
because we...

108
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,000
I only have one left.

109
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,840
Then, just give us one.

Yes, of course.

111
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,640

158
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,160
I don't know how to tell you in person.

159
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,040
I've always known

160
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,840
that a girl saved me

161
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,600
in that alley six years ago.

162
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,360
At that time,

163
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,040

164

I'm sorry.

I've been trying so hard
to forget everything

167
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,240
from six years ago.

168
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,040
I want to escape the darkness

170

that he would appear again.

171
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,680
Maybe this is my punishment

172
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,360
for running away that time.

173
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,000

174

if you don't mind your own business.
