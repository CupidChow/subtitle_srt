18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,680
Actually,

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,880
there is a girl I've always loved.

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,800
I've loved her since high school

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,000
but she just never knew about it.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
Honestly,

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,080
I dare not tell her too.

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,440
I'm afraid that everything would change

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,400
if I tell her.

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,640
We might not be able
to be friends anymore.

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
I might even

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,120
not be able to appear in her life.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,960
I could only follow her life

30
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,840
through her social media

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,520
and guess how she feels.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,520
So, I've always been acting carefully.

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
I was afraid

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,320
to reveal my feelings

35
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,120
and get an answer too soon.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,120
So I bought her a shop.

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,480
But

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,160
I never got a good reason
to give it to her.

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,240
I...

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,520
You have money to buy a shop?

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,680
You worked for less than two years.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,520
Do you make money so easily?

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,960
Should I have chosen
to major in dentistry back then?

44
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,000
Is that the point?

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Oh, sorry. You continue.

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,120
Go on.

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,440
So, I want to tell you.

48
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,960
Is it Du Xiaojing?

49
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
You love Du Xiaojing?

50
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,760
No wonder you kept looking for her
in high school.

51
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,880
So that's it.

52
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,040
I looked for her
because she was in your class.

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,680
So, it's Lin Yumeng from my class?

54
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,520
But didn't she go to a university
in Hai City?

55
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,920
Did you buy a shop in Hai City?

56
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,520
Has it never occurred to you
that this person is...

57
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,560
Lu Xun? Why are you here?

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,600
Didn't you go to the hotel?

59
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,200
That's right.

60
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
Why would President Lu grace this place?

61
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,680
You wouldn't come here
on purpose, would you?

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,040
I have a toothache.

63
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,840
So I dropped by on the way.

64
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,880
I didn't know this is Zheng Ziyan's clinic.

65
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,220
(Zheng Ziyan Dental Clinic)

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,320
Really?

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,200
Since we bumped into each other,
let's go back together.

68
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,160
Wait, don't you have a toothache?

69
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,720
Let me take a look.

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,480
No need.

71
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Zheng Ziyan's dentistry is really good.

72
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,640
He opened up two shops in one year.

73
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,440
You came to a dental clinic
but won't see a dentist,

74
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,000
you wouldn't have
any other motive, right?

75
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Let's hear it.

76
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,120
Lu Xun, you just had your teeth filled.

77
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,400
You should rest.

78
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,040
Why don't you go back first?

79
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,520
Lin Chen and I still have
something to talk about.

80
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,680
Just say it.

81
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,160
This is between the two of us.

82
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,720
If you two got caught together,

83
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,640
it will easily lead to
unnecessary misunderstanding.

84
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,240
This shop is my friend's.

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,800
I've reserved it for the evening.

86
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,480
If you have something to say,
feel free to do so.

87
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,240
Xun,

88
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,920
long time no see.

89
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
You're too kind, President Zhang.

90
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,520
You must be Miss Lin, correct?

91
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,280
Yes.

92
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,880
His father and I are old friends.

93
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,320
His father has gone abroad
for over 20 years.

94
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,400
I even carried him
when he was younger.

95
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,560
In the blink of an eye,
he's about to get married.

96
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Miss Lin,

97
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,000
let me toast you.

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,760
Sure.

99
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,120
President Zhang, she can't hold her liquor.

100
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,560
I'll drink in her stead.

101
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,280
And you are...

102
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,120
My fiancée

103
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,480
doesn't need others to drink
in her stead.

104
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,160
President Zhang, allow me
to thank you in her stead.

105
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,240
Lu Xun,

106
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,480
you just had a filling.

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,360
It's better not to drink.

108
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,120
President Zhang.

109
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,160
Don't you know best

110
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,440
whether I need a filling or not?

111
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,880
Why didn't I pull out

112
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,320
all four of your wisdom teeth today?

113
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,360
President Zhang, cheers.

114
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,960
The property on which
you opened your clinic

115
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,720
is owned by SW.

116
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,880
Let's have a toast.

118
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,240
Okay, I'll wait for you here.

119
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,640
Both of you can't hold your liquor

120
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,000
and still drank so much.

121
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,240
I'll go get you some water.

122
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,360
Wait.

123
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Lin Chen, I have something to tell you.

124
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,280
No, you can't say it.

125
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,480
We're leaving.

126
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,560
Why? I'm talking to my friend here.

127
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,640
There are no paparazzi here

128
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,760
or anyone watching.

129
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,560

I have something to tell you.

Sure, I don't have a reason

156

But I understand

158
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,240
that all of this is wrapped up

159
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,200
as a grandiose excuse.

160
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,360
I don't know what you've written

161
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,480
in that letter from six years ago.

162
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,760
You! Stand right there!

Why did Zheng Ziyan

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,320
receive the same thing too?

165
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,840
Why don't you just
start hating me from now on?

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,360
You said

167
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,840
you wanted me to start hating you

168
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,120
but when have I ever hated you?

169
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,280
I want answers to these questions

170
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,920
but I'm also afraid

171
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,640
to know the answers.

172
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,520
If I asked,

173
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,520
I'm afraid

174
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,640
I would lose all pretense

175
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,400
and excuses.

176
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,320
I could only slowly
get close to you again

177
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,640
and delay what could happen

178
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,400
between the two of us.

179
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,000
This is all because I'm afraid.

180
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,720
I'm afraid

181
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,160
that you don't love me

182
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,840
as I love you.

183
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,720
I'm sorry, I really don't love you.

184
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Don't look.

185
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,760
She went to the restroom.

186
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
So,

187
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,480
she didn't get to see
your expression just now.

188
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,760
What a bore.

189
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,200
About that letter,

190
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,600
it was blank.

191
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,760
Honestly,

192
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,160
you're so stupid.

193
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,480
How did you get first place in school?

194
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,320
Why are you telling me this?

195
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,520
Because

196
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,520
I got my answer.

197
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,000
That answer is

198
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
not me.

199
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,040
Anyway, I got to see

200
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,760
a silly expression on President Lu.

201
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,440
That was pretty nice too.

202
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,240
Why are you here again?

203
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,680
In the end,

204
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,880
I still need to give you two a hand.

205
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,520
Zheng Ziyan, where are you going?

206
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,520
What is it?

207
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
