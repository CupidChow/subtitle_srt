20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,880
President Lu,

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,800
I wasn't slacking.

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,980
(Seven Ravine Shelter for Stray Animals)

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,920
Lin Chen?

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,960
Do you know her?

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,480
This is just a general number.

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,760
Even her name is just an alias.

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,260
(Three Day Lovers  10 days before filming)
Our target audience

28
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,200
is the younger people.

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,880
So the dating show
is a very suitable start.

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,160
Dissemination of follow-up advertisement

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,880
and short videos have also begun

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,560
to solidify SW's popularity
within the country.

33
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,160
Good.

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,280
There are other guests
at the hotel during filming.

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,920
Remember,

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,320
both must not interfere with one another.

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,120
Of course, Vice President Lu.

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,320
These are

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,360
the guests on the show.

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,360
Choco, chocolate.

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,240
Choco, chocolate.

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,080
Choco, chocolate.

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,960
Choco, chocolate.

44
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,600
It's so delicious...

45
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
- I can't stop.
- Wait.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,320
What is her name?

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,800
Lin Wan.

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,680
She is a small-time artist
with just one advertisement.

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,440
What is it, Lu Xun?

50
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,260
(On the day of filming dating show)

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,960
Zhao Chen.

52
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,440
I understand that Liu Yan told you

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,760
that you can't be my partner.

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,520
But she already

55
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,920
has plans to attach herself

56
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,040
to Liu Mo.

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,960
Why don't we

58
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,080
help each other out

59
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,680
and form an introductory couple?

60
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,760
The show swaps couples every three days.

61
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,640
As long as you help me
to remain in the show...

62
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,880
When did you know

63
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,120
that I'm Lin Chen?

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
I've known it

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,000
all along.

66
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,800

President Lu.

71
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,600
This is a misunderstanding, President Lu.

72
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,000
A misunderstanding.

73
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,480
Get out.

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,760
Don't let me see you again.

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,360
My head hurts so bad.

76
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
You're awake.

77
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,160
Who wouldn't?

78
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,960
My head is about to explode.

79
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,200
Why did President Liu

80
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,880
keep making us drink last night?

81
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,680
I don't even know

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,200
how we got back to our room.

83
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,400
That old pervert

84
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,200
wanted to take advantage of us.

85
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,920
Good thing it was me.

86
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,320
What if it was Lin Wan instead?

87
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,640
There I was wondering
why they took our phones.

88
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,120
He did it on purpose.

89
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,960
And that producer too.

90
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,720
That producer was bad news too.

91
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,680
How disgusting.

92
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,720
You're fine, right?

93
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
You...

94
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,440
Me?

95
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm so strong.

96
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,120
Of course, I didn't...

97
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,880
Yesterday,

98
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,200
did Lu Xun come save me?

99
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,840
And then?

100
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,480
I can't remember.

101
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,240
I've never drank so much in my life.

102
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,360
You can't remember.

103
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,600
Who is it so early in the morning?

104
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,840
Coming.

105
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,640
Coming, stop knocking.

106
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,560
What are you doing here?

107
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,620
(Thanks)

108
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,400
This needs to be spoken out loud, right?

109
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,760
Lin Wan,

110
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,480
we'll let bygones be bygones.

111
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,160
From now onward, I will not

112
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,240
stab you in the back.

113
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,600
There's a "but", right?

114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,880
But I still hate you!

115
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,480
If I get my hands on
any evident information about you,

116
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,120
I will trample you under my feet

117
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,040
so you'll never rise to fame.

118
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,320
I expected nothing less.

119
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,400
Look at her go.

120
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,960
She just had to be mean.

121
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,240
How annoying.

122
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,400
Who is it?

123
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,560
Miss Lin, it's time to do your makeup.

124
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,880
You are to go to the cafe today

125
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,840
to continue filming the last interview.

126
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,120
Got it.

127
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,080
You'll go do your makeup first.

128
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,840
I'll go puke again.

129
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,360
Wait up!

130
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,080
President Lu.

131
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,240
Feeling nauseous?

132
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,760
President Lu,

133
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,920
I didn't expect to bump into you here.

134
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,840
What a coincidence.

135
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,120
This is my hotel

136
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,320
and we have a dating show
to film together.

137
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,840
Is it a coincidence?

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,280
Yesterday...

139
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,240
Thank you for yesterday, President Lu.

140
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,120
I remember you came to look for me.

141
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,520
What else?

142
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,040
What else?

143
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,840
You can't

144
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,480
be pressing me for money, right?

145
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,360
I can't remember anything else

146
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,520
but

147
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,160
this thing about money...

148
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,960
Don't you remember anything else?

149
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,760
What exactly is it?

150
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,640
Why don't you say it again, President Lu?

151
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,840
- This time, I will definitely...
- It's fine if you've forgotten it.

152
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,600
Why are you so petty?

153
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,120
Is it that tiring to repeat it?

154
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,160
Hello. May I help you?

155
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,560
Lin Wan is filming a show here, correct?

156
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,120
Yes.

157
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,800
Who are you?

158
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,440
- Non-personnel are not allowed in here.
- Lin Wan.

159
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,640
You damn mistress!

160
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,920
What are you doing?

161
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,040
Are you insane?

162
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,840
Look at that!

163
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
A mistress

164
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
dare treat me like that.

165
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,640
Mistress?

166
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,440
What mistress?

167
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,280
I don't know.

168
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,240
She even barged in here.

169
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
Look at this yourself!

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,480
I've seen many small-time artists

171
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,840
like you.

172
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,840
Did you think you can get the main role

173
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,360
using such dishonest method?

174
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,280
Today,

175
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,880
I'm here to expose your true colors

176
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,080
to everyone here.

177
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,280
I haven't settle the score with him

178
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,720
but this wicked man
wants to settle with me first?

179
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,600
He invited us for dinner

180
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,400
under the pretense of filming

181
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,240
to take advantage of us.

182
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Now he wants to bite back?

183
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,520
I have the photographs.

184
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,320
You aren't going to just
rely on your words, are you?

185
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,360
He kept our phones.

186
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,560
How would I have proof?

187
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,960
Look at this.

188
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,920
In this photograph,

189
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,000
Lin Wan didn't look reluctant at all.

190
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Ask Liu Yan if you don't believe me.

191
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,400
Yanyan isn't feeling well,
so she won't be going.

192
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,040
Thank you.

193
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Yanyan.

194
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,440
You're right for not going.

195
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
Even if you speak out,

196
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,160
President Liu will be criticized at most,

197
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,360
it will have no major effect on him.

198
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,920
Once you get involved with these
in this industry,

199
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,240
I'm afraid you might not
get much resources for the year.

200
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,960
Whoever got involved in these
will be ruined.

201
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,520
Once a scandal happens,

202
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,640
no one will care about the truth.

203
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,440
Give me my medicine.

204
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,040
I couldn't fall asleep last night
even after taking two tablets.

205
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,840
Yanyan.

206
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,960
Why don't you take less
of these sleeping pills?

207
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,120
You've been taking them for four years.

208
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,600
How did it go?

209
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,520
Miss Liu Yan said

210
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,560
she isn't feeling well

211
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,120
and that she is unsure
what happened last night.

212
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,040
That Liu Yan.

213
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
What's going on?

214
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,480
Big news! Big news!

215
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,200
Look. Look at this.

216
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
Lin Wan turns out to be a mistress.

217
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,200
No way. How could she be a mistress?

218
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,740
(Lin Wan turns out to be a mistress)

219
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,800
Liu Yan wouldn't speak.

220
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,920
No one can

221
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,240
bear witness to your words.

222
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,040
Just admit it!

223
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,560
- Why should I admit?
- Wanwan.

224
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,160
Whatever you say right now

225
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,880
can be taken out of context.

226
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,200
You leave first, I'll handle this.

227
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,360
Why should I?

228
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm not leaving.

229
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,480
If I leave,

230
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,360
it'll look like I'm running away

231
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,800
for doing something wrong!

232
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,240
You don't get it.

233
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,440
Mistress Lin Wan

234
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
is already trending on the hot topics.

235
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,640
We can't feed it.

236
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
Be good, leave now.

237
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
I'm sorry, everyone.

238
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,520
Miss Lin still have work to carry out.

239
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,920
You can ask me
if you have any questions.

240
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,000
- You go first.
- Stop.

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,640
If no one can prove

242
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,760
that you're not a mistress today,

243
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,040
none of you can leave.

244
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,920
I'll prove it.

245
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,200
President Lu is here.

246
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,160
President Lu,

247
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,120
how will you prove it?

248
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,520
I was also there last night.

249
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,920
Why can't I prove it?

250
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,960
At first, everyone was
indeed drinking normally

251
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,520
but nobody expected President Liu
would later get into a drunken frenzy

252
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,160
and started harassing Miss Lin.

253
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,280
Impossible.

254
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,400
My husband said

255
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
that you weren't there

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,120
at dinner yesterday.

257
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,880
President Liu and I are simply sticking
to our own versions of the incident.

258
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,560
Who could prove that I wasn't there?

259
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,000
I know now.

260
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,840
I've also watched

261
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,280
a bit of your show recently.

262
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,880
You two are

263
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,800
a couple on the show.

264
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,920
What happened yesterday

265
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,480
took place at your hotel.

266
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,680
You're only saying all this because
you're afraid of being implicated, correct?

267
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,160
Otherwise,

268
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,280
do tell me.

269
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,800
Why would you be at the dinner yesterday

270
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,880
if you aren't part of the production crew?

271
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,240
It's because she is my girlfriend.

272
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Isn't your show

273
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,560
all fake?
