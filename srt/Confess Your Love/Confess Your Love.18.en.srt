A vague post like this

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,520

Why didn't she tell me
she went out so early in the morning?

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,200
Lu Xun,

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,680
you must stay calm.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,240
Lu Xun, this doesn't mean anything.

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,560
If you ask first,
then you're being led on.

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,280
There's no response.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,960
Did he not see it
or really have no response?

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,160
Why don't I just tag him?

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,920
Calm down.

42
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,040
If you tag him,

43
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,960
even a fool can tell what it means.

44
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,320
That means you're being led on.

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,840
Nothing, I pressed wrongly.

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,440
That's good, be careful.

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm hanging up.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,480
Lu Xun, you must remain
unaffected by changes.

51
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,720
Remember what I told you, okay?

52
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
Don't get cold feet later.

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,400
Go.

The second move

55
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,360
is to deliberately
create physical contact

56
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,760
to instigate the other party
to confess.

57
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,880
What are you doing?

58
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,080
Nothing.

59
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,920

60
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,520
Don't worry, it'll work this time.

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,640

this line from the script,

62
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,760
we can strike back at once.

Oh, this audition clip is very important.

64
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,880
You have to practice hard
while at home.

Lu Xun,

66
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,640
can you be my practice partner?

67
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,400
Didn't you say you'll only film
until the end of the dating show?

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,720
This is a chance
we had a hard time earning.

69
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,840
It's better to be prepared in advance

70
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,240
in case Lin Wan wakes up.

71
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,080
What are you scheming?

72
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,440

80
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,320
Do you know

81
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,960
why koalas look dreamy?

82
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
Because they got poisoned.

83
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,960
The eucalyptus leaves they feed on

84
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,880
are poisonous.

85
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,800

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,400

Why don't I help you?

99
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,960

that there is something urgent
at the company.

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,760
Okay, okay. Okay!

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,120
Just look at yourself.

You're arrogant, narcissistic,
and a coward.

133
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,160

some new characteristics.

148
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,480
go easy on the alcohol.

149
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,440
The company said

150
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,760
you can take a vacation for now.

151
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,520
I need to accompany Feifei filming.

152
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,480
You take care of yourself.

153
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Don't make me worry.

154
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,240
I'm going now.

155
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,240
He's back.

156
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,720

157
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,160
Hey, stop taking sleeping pills.

158
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,960
It's bad for your health.

159
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,440
I'll come back as soon as
Feifei is done filming.

160
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,360
President Lu.

161
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,040
Are you here to add salt to my wound?

162
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,400
Do you know where he lives?

163
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,000
Or have any other information on him?

164
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,760
Zhang Ping.

165
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,560
How do you know?

166
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,560
You know my past?

167
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,440
I advise you to stay away from him.

168
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,000
If you have any information on him,

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
contact me right away.

170
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,960
Wait.

172
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,200
how is she?

173
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,640
I know she is Lin Chen.

174
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,520
I won't tell anyone.

175
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,800
You don't need to worry.

176
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,840
You only need to know

177
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
that you will never have
another chance to go near her.

178
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Lin Chen,

179
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,040
there is something

180
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,400
I don't know how to tell you in person.

181
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,800
Zheng Ziyan?

182
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,240
Little kitty.

183
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,480
Are you ill?

184
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,160
You said a kitty is ill over the phone.

185
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,000
Is this it?

186
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,760
Look who it is.

187
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,120
It's the kitty from the barbecue stall
that day, right?

188
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,440
You brought it here?

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,880
Have you been spayed?

190
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,760
Oh no, I need to operate on you myself.

191
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,120
So cute.

192
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,640
Lin Chen,

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,120
are you really engaged to Lu Xun?

194
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,440
Yes.

195
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,040
That's part of the contract, right?

196
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,280
I guess.

197
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,080
After you finish this act with Lu Xun,

198
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,480
you still need to go back
to being Lin Chen.

199
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,600
Come on, down you go.

200
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,280
Look over there.

201
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,120
What's that?

202
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,000
Your veterinary hospital.

203
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,000
What do you mean?

204
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,900
(Zheng Ziyan)

205
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,420
(Zheng Ziyan)

206
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,720
She is just saving cats.

207
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
That's very normal.

208
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,600
Zheng Ziyan wouldn't stand a chance.

209
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,800
No way.

210
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,480
It's impossible for Zheng Ziyan.

211
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,480
What's so good about him?

212
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,480
Just ignore him.

213
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,960
Didn't I tell you before?

214
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,760
I'll open a dental clinic here

215
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,480
and you'll open
a veterinary hospital next door.

216
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,360
We will conquer Jiangbei together.

217
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,640
Did you think I was kidding?

218
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,800
How reliable.

219
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,440
Let me think about it.

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
But

221
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,480
this place here must be
very expensive, right?

222
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,680
My savings are definitely
not enough to afford it.

223
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,960
Lin Chen,

224
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,040
I have something to tell you.

225
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,200
Actually, I...

226
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,600
Actually,

227
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,400
