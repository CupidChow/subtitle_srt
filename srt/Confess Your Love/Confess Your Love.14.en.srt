18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,120
The visiting hours for Lin Wan is up.

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,680
Family members should leave soon.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,200
Oh,

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,720
she is Lin Wan.

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,120
Then you are...

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,040
Huh?

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
What does this mean?

25
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,560
I remember I have a schoolmate
back in high school named Lin Chen.

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
She does look like you.

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,440
What a coincidence.

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,520
My former schoolmate, yeah!

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,920
You still remember me?

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,320
Miss Lin, what you did
when you were younger

31
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,760
makes it really hard to forget you.

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,560
Why are you still holding a grudge?

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
Isn't this a case of situational emergency?

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,000
If I don't impersonate Lin Wan,

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,040
Lin Wan will either get suspended

36
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,960
or pay the penalty.

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,600
So I can only choose
to impersonate Lin Wan.

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,400
But don't you worry.

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,880
There won't be any changes to our contract.

40
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,560
After half a month,

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,080
we can go back to being normal.

42
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,480
Please don't sell us out.

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,400
Please don't call the wrong name.

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,480
I am Lin Wan.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
I want to wash up.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,920
Okay.

47
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,600
I'll go do revision.

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,760
I have exam tomorrow.

49
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,240

(Take a look.)

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
What's a fan fiction?

Nothing.

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,640
Did you get an anonymous message
or a call?

58
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,960
No, no. It's really nothing.

59
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,720
Let me see.

60
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,280

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,600
No.

63
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,360
- Let me see.
- There's nothing at all.

64
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,720

(Lu Xun swiftly presses her
onto the bed.)

78
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,920
So, when you said you're doing revision,

79
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,560
you're revising this.

80
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,840
No.

81
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,320
That's not what happened.

82
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,680
No!

83
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,880
A fan wrote this.

84
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,280
Meng Jiao sent this to me.

85
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,480
No need to explain.

86
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,680

(Jiangbei University)

88
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,880
Just put this here, that's it.

89
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
Director, Director.

90
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,360
I don't feel too well.

91
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,480
I need to go see the campus doctor.

92
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,320
Is your blood sugar level low again?

93
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,280
Hurry, go to the hospital.

94
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,720
It's just the same old problem.

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,520
I'll just have the doctor take a look.

96
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,440
Yes, yes.

97
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,760
But I'll need two hours.

98
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,600
Sure, hurry up and go.

99
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,360
Your health is important.

100
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,040
Okay, no need to have us
for the next task.

101
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
- Oh, okay. Thank you.
- Sure, go.

102
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,360
Stop.

103
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,960
Are you trying
to rob someone dressed like that?

104
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,760
No, no.

105
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,280
I'm here to take the exam, sir.

106
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,600
Show me your student card.

107
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,580
(Student ID  Lin Chen

108

Where have you been recently?

112
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,320
I sent you messages but you didn't reply.

113
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,920
Recently,

114
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,480
I found an internship
at a veterinary hospital.

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,240
Do you have something
you're not telling me?

116
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,360
Do you have

117
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,080
a twin sister who is a celebrity?

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,920
Lin Lu Couple!

119
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,680
Lin Wan looks exactly like you.

120
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,960
You can't deny this.

121
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,120
That is my elder sister.

122
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,520
My God.

123
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,960
I actually know the relative
of a celebrity!

124
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,200
No more talking.

125
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,080
Lin Chen.

126
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,360
Lin Chen, where are you going?

127
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,040
Don't we have another exam later?

128
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,520
I need the restroom.

129
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,320
Is it real between Lu Xun
and your sister?

130
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,040
I'm not sure.

131
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,520
Can I take a photo with your sister?

132
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,120
When we get the chance next time, okay?

133
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,560
Don't say next time.

134
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,160
Aren't they filming
at the university today?

135
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,920
That's right, Lin Chen.
We're all classmates.

136
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,960
Besides, they're just downstairs. Why not?

137
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,280
Yes, yes.

138
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,440
It'll just take five minutes
and they're right there.

139
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,000
Come on, stop dallying.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,200
What excuse do you have?

141
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,800
Yeah, just one photo.

142
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,880
Just one photo, okay?

143
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,640
Just one, just one.

144
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,480
Wait.

145
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,120
I have a stomachache.

146
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,840
I need to go to the restroom.

147
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,060
(Ladies)

148
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,820
(Anti Allergy)

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,960
While Lin Wan isn't around,

150
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,120
hurry up and finish filming the rest.

151
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,400
Okay, I'll speak
to the director right away.

152
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,760
I'm sorry, everyone.

153
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
I have a sudden allergic reaction.

154
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,160
I really can't do it today.

155
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:23,840
My God.

156
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,920
You need to go to the hospital.

157
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,280
Hey, I'll go with you.

158
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,080
No need, no need.

159
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,280
Thank you.

160
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Lin Chen, Lin Chen!

161
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,840
Lin Chen, your purse!

162
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Why must I come this far
to use the restroom?

163
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,600
It's cleaner here.

164
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,440
Lin Chen!

165
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,920
Why aren't you going to the infirmary?

166
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,640
Stop calling my name.

167
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,560
- What?
- I'm really fine.

168
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
- I...
- Just go away.

169
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,480
What's going on with you?

170
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,080
Go away.

171
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,320
I'm really fine.

172
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,760
Can you just go?

173
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,360
Did I just hear Lin Wan's voice?

174
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,000
Didn't she go to the hospital?

175
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,720
Lin Wan, is that you?

176
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,880
Lin Wan?

177
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,960
Liu Yan, are you that free?

178
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,160
Didn't you go to see the doctor?

179
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Why are you hiding here?

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
I...

181
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,520
messed up my makeup.

182
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,080
You're hiding here to fix your makeup?

183
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,440
How sly.

184
