18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,800
Miss Lin,

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,000
will you become Mrs. Lu?

20
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,560
Really? He's proposing?

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,700
(Zheng Shu  Meng Ya)

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,700
Is this for real? My God!

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,880
I came for details and got a big scoop.

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
My God, coming here was worth it.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,440
Your expression.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,320
I will.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Isn't this sacrifice too big?

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,680
President Lu,
are you taking the fans for fools?

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,240
Why wouldn't they believe in
a black and white contract

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,800
and instead believe in a couple of words

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,800
that the two of you are truly in love?

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,000
Who said it was just a couple of words?

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,960
I've already bought the ring.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,560
How can this be fake?

35
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,440
You're saying that the small gift
you randomly gave her

36
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,800
is a token of engagement.

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,360
You're such a storyteller, President Lu.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,840
Businessmen are all for profits.

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,320
I wouldn't simply gift a ring

40
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,120
worth US$900,000 for fun.

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,600
- What?
- What?

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,640
Liu Yan.

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,800
Liu Yan.

44
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,680
How dare you, Lin Wan.

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,200
Yanyan, lower down your voice.

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,560
The crew are all over the place.

47
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,520
I've been thoroughly embarrassed today.

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,040
How am I supposed
to stay in this industry now?

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,160
Hello.

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,320
What? I'm coming right away.

51
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,800
What's the matter?

52
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,400
The production team calls for a meeting.

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,240
Do they want me to quit the show?

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,960
Yanyan,

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,840
don't panic.

56
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,440
The agent is on the way here.

57
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
I'll attend the meeting first.

58
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,720
You must not post anything

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,960
on social media platforms.

60
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,640
I've already ordered you
a cup of coffee.

61
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,560
It'll be here soon.

62
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,980
(Unknown Number)

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,480
Who are you?

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,320
You are so useless.

65
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,920
You still have the nerve to call me?

66
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
You are with Lin Wan, aren't you?

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
You purposely set up a trap
to embarrass me.

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,800
I'm warning you.

69
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,440
Don't ever call me again.

70
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
And you are?

71
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,840
The twins are swapped.

72
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,080
The lovers are faked.

73
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,320
You had such a good chance
and you missed it.

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,480
How dare you come here?

75
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,720
What do you want?

76
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,280
I'm calling the police.

77
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,160
I remember

78
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
you have a mole

79
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,680
on your chest.

80
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,040
Don't come here.

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,280
I've already called the police.

82
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,440
Mind your own business.

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,000
It has just been six years

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,280
and you've already forgotten me?

85
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,920
That night

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,800
should be unforgettable.

87
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,200
You're obedient.

88
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,560
Once you know I have photographs,

89
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
you didn't call the police

90
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,800
or sue me.

91
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,720
But I don't have

92
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,800
just one photograph of you.

93
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,840
Don't worry.

94
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,080
We're in this together.

95
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,360
This time,

96
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,240
Lu Xun got out of this safely.

97
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,760
It's a real pity.

98
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,000
I want you to ask him out.

99
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,160
And then,

100
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,440
accuse him of assaulting you.

101
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,080
No.

102
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,680
No?

103
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,920
Liu Yan.

104
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,440
That is not your real name, is it?

105
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,160
A gorgeous
and beautiful celebrity like you

106
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,760
is most afraid of others
knowing your past.

107
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,160
You already know

108
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,760
that I have

109
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,880
your most dreadful past in my hands.

110
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,840
Right?

111
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,480
But you don't have to be afraid.

112
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,880
As long as you listen to me,

113
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,320
I guarantee

114
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,400
that I will not speak a word of it.

115
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,760
I'll give you three days.

116
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,520
Oh.

117
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,040
That's right.

118
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,200
I realized that this entire incident
is really interesting.

119
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,880
Did you know

120
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,240
that the person who saved you back then

121
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
was Lin Chen,
the one you've been pushing around?

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,240
President Lu,

123
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,400
even if you're engaged now,

124
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,280
that doesn't prove

125
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,840
that you didn't lie to
your fans before this.

126
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,200
Three days later,

127
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,520
we will be officially engaged.

128
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,680
When that time comes,

129
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,400
SW will select a few
outstanding members of media

130
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
to participate and ask questions.

131
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,640
At the same time, we will
broadcast it as part of the show.

132
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,280
Let's go.

133
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,220
(Zheng Shu  Meng Ya)
Excuse me, when did you two get together?

134
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,220
Please answer our questions.

135
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,880
President Lu, how did your relationship
develop to this stage?

136
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,340
When is the wedding?

137
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,940
- Have you already met the parents?
- President Lu.

138
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,880
Lu Xun.

139
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
Go back and wait for me.

140
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,480
Remember, don't leave the house.

141
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,320
What's wrong?

142
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,680
Send them back.

143
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,000
Then give me a name list of everyone

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
present at the event.

145
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,800
I'll go tell the driver to send you back.

146
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,480
Lu Xun.

147
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,000
Lu Xun.

148
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,560
Then, we'll leave first.

149
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,080
President Lu,

150
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,840
all the media and fans who were present

151
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,080
confirmed their attendance in advance.

152
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,720
Got it.

153
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,320
Go back to work.

154
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,840
Yes, President Lu.

155
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,680
Lu Xun,

156
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,280
I've looked into it.

157
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,960
On the first day of filming,

158
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,280
he didn't enter the hotel

159
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,400
as a guest or a personnel.

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,600
Also,

161
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,000
there is only record of him leaving.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,440
I don't know how he managed to enter.

163
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,600
Why are you here all of a sudden?

164
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,440
I thought you never cared about
the family business.

165
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,640
Because

166
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,160
he has some other plans.

167
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,520
If he has your pass,

168
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,280
he can take my private lift.

169
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,720
Have you hired

170
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,360
any new staffs
in the last three months?

171
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,480
Vice President Lu asked me
to send you home first.

172
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Zhang Ping!

173
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,680
Who is he?

174
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,960
He's my driver.

175
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,160
We're doomed, Lu Xun.

176
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,040
You two are now
taking six hot topic searches.

177
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,720
Look.

178
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,760
(Weibo Hot Topics)
Lin Lu Couple from fake to real.

179
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,680
Liu Yan is rumored
to be replaced in new drama.

180
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,400
Lin Lu Couple proposed.

181
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,760
I can't believe

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,040
Lu Xun is really that smart.

183
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,320
With just

184
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,600
a freebie ring,

185
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,560
he could make up a story on the spot.

186
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,960
He's really something.

187
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,960
Be gentle with that.

188
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,520
This ring is an important item,

189
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,040
don't break it.

190
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,140
(Lu Xun)

191
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,480
It's a real diamond.

192
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,360
A US$900,000 diamond!

193
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,400
Let me touch it.

194
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,480
Let me touch it, okay?

195
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,400
Is this real?

196
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,080
I can't even...

197
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,280
Lu Xun,

198
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,360
human resources have verified

199
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
that all his information is fake.

200
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,520
Feeling panic?

201
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,000
What are you going to do?

202
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,440
She still

203
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,600
hasn't changed at all.

204
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
How do you feel?

205
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
How do you feel?

206
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,160
If you dare touch her,

207
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,120
I will not let you leave Jiangbei alive.

208
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,440
Are you panic already?

209
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,760
Don't be.

210
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,720
I am just getting started.

211
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,280
It's no fun

212
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,480
if you start panicking now.

213
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,120
Oh, right.

214
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,520
Don't think about contacting me.

215
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,560
My information is all fake.

216
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,680
You cannot find me.

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,320
There were paparazzi outside.

228
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,600
Oh.

229
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,720
I suddenly feel thirsty.

230
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,520
I need the restroom.

231
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,640
I feel a mild headache.

232
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,000
I need to rest in your room.

233
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,120
Something is wrong.

234
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,600
Something is definitely wrong.

235
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,480
With the way Lu Xun was looking at you,

236
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,920
he is most probably in love with you.

237
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,080
But he didn't seem
interested in me at all yesterday.

238
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,200
If he doesn't love you,

239
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,880
then why would he give you a ring worth

240
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,160
6.4 million?

241
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,960
Does Lu Xun

242
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,280
love me?

243
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,960
Maybe.

244
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,480
Maybe she doesn't really love you.

245
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,040
Just now you rushed up
to give her a hug.

246
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,560
I think

247
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,040
Little Lin must have gotten a fright.

248
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,680
What should I do then?

249
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,720
But when I confessed in high school,

250
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,920
he already rejected me.

251
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,120
If he rejects me again,

252
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,400
how am I going to continue
existing on this planet?

253
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,280
You suspected that she confessed
to you in high school

254
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,560
but it turned out to be
a confession practice, right?

255
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,960
During these days,

256
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,280
she hasn't treated you
any differently, correct?

257
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,360
Right now, you two seem like
you're about to get engaged

258
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,440
but it just looks like
a plan of convenience, correct?

259
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,640
From my point of view,

260
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,360
you have absolutely no chance.

261
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,560
So you're saying, I should confess?

262
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,480
Are you silly?

263
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,840
I'm not telling you to confess.

264
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,200
What you need to do now

265
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,760
is to find out for sure
if he really does love you.

266
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,720
If you impulsively confess
and get rejected,

267
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,360
then all your planning
would be for nothing.

268
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,200
You might not even
be friends with her after that.

269
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,080
What should I do?

270
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,000
You must let the other person
say it first.
