=Episode 22=

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,920
I'm not Lin Wan, I'm Lin Chen.

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you now admit that you're Lin Chen?

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
Liu Yan's accusation back then
was true after all?

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,640
You've been using Lin Wan's identity
to lie to the public.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,960
Where is the real Lin Wan?

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,200
Why were you there at the crime scene?

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,800
Were you at the crime scene
to save Liu Yan?

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,120
Or did you turn a blind eye?

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,040
Yes, I know I lied to everyone.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,920
My sister, Lin Wan, is in a coma.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,440
She doesn't know anything about this.

29
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,520
I am responsible for all of this.

30
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,720
I admit to this wrongdoing.

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,760
But I'm telling the truth

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,840
to the incident six years ago.

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,680
At that time, I accidentally
saw that man.

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,880
I'm sure he wasn't Lu Xun.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,240
Lu Xun wasn't even there.

36
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,220
He was at the crime scene.

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,200
President Lu,
is this a photograph from that time?

38
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,960
President Lu, were you
at the crime scene six years ago?

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,080
Yes, I was.

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,720
Even though I was there that year,

41
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,480
I was the one who reported the incident.

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,000
I am absolutely not the perpetrator.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,240
This was documented.

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
As for Liu Yan,

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,840
the authorities will
release a statement

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,240
to clear this up with everyone.

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,680
How can she prove it?

48
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,920
She even lied about her own identity.

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,560
Liu Yan's accusation at that time was true

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,080
but was forced to commit suicide.

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,120
Lin Chen, you must be held responsible
for Liu Yan's death.

52
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,600
Yes, you must be held responsible.

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,400
Lu Xun, the board of directors is here.

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,600
They want you there.

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,000
Leave using my private elevator.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,160
Head over to Meng Jiao's home first.

57
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,560
It's not safe anywhere else.

58
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,240
Don't worry, just go.

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,160
Will Lu Xun be okay?

60
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,760
Just worry about yourself first, okay?

61
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,400
It's all going downhill from now onward.

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Wait here for me,
I'll drive President Lu's car over.

63
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,740
(You're minding other people's
business again.)

64
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,480
Don't come here.

65
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,160
I've already called the police.

66
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,880
Mind your own business.

67
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,180
(Unknown)

68
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:35,608
(Unknown)

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,240
Mind your own business.

70
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,280
It's you.

71
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,640
I knew

72
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,400
you wouldn't forget me.

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,640
You set Lu Xun up.

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,880
Yes.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,920
Lin Wan.

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,000
Cold storage.

77
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,200
It was all you.

78
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,440
You finally got it.

79
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
The public opinion about you

80
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,960
and SW is disadvantageous now.

81
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
The company's stock price
suffered a huge drop

82
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,160
and Liu Yan died here.

83
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,320
The hotel will be greatly affected.

84
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
Xun, we can still fix this.

85
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,440
We'll just issue an announcement

86
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,560
saying you are completely unaware

87
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,200
that Miss Lin had been
hiding her identity.

88
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,480
That you are also a victim.

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,160
As for Liu Yan's case,

90
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,880
I know you have nothing to do with it.

91
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,400
The police are here now.

92
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,280
When the time comes, we will
just go along the same lines

93
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,320
as Liu Yan's team

94
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,920
and say it was all caused by Lin Chen.

95
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,960
Impossible.

96
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,920
I will not release such a statement.

97
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,160
President Lu, you cannot
just think for yourself.

98
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,000
SW will definitely be greatly affected.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,080
We've only entered
the local market for six months.

100
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,520
I'll resign.

101
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,800
Lu Xun!

102
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,320
This is my own choice,

103
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,280
I will bear the consequences myself.

104
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,840
There are so many people in SW.

105
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,720
I cannot allow anyone
to be implicated because of me.

106
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,840
After this,

107
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,760
Lu Feng will take my place.

108
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,320
What exactly do you want?

109
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,640
The case from six years ago
is already closed.

110
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,440
You cannot shift the blame onto Lu Xun.

111
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,920
How would I be so naive

112
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,720
as to shift it onto Lu Xun?

113
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,760
What I want

114
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,880
is for you two
to be the center of attention.

115
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,440
With Liu Yan dead,

116
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,120
no one can testify
to what happened back then

117
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,200
while you and Lu Xun

118
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,520
are pushed into the limelight

119
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
with just a few words.

120
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,600
And now that she is dead,

121
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,720
no one will ever sue me again.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You

123
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,920
killed Liu Yan.

124
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,320
She was mentally weak

125
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
and committed suicide.

126
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,560
What has that got to do with me?

127
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,400
You said

128
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,240
as long as I bring Lu Xun to you,

129
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,440
you will return the photographs.

130
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,320
I'm leaving Jiangbei now.

131
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,160
I told you to make Lu Xun stay.

132
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,960
What use were you?

133
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,840
You want to run?

134
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,920
You play an important role

135
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,480
in my plan.

136
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,840
If you don't want
your rape to be exposed,

137
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,480
then just behave.

138
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,000
In the last six years,

139
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,360
I have nightmares every night.

140
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,040
In the month after that,

141
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,920
I tried to kill myself 16 times.

142
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,920
Up until today,

143
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,720
I had to rely on sleeping pills
to fall asleep.

144
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,640
Every day, I wanted to forget
about that rainy night.

145
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
I swore that I would become

146
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,680
a huge celebrity that everyone envies.

147
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,600
I will live glamorously
under the spotlight forever.

148
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,880
So?

149
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,240
So

150
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,960
I will not be threatened by you again.

151
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,560
I want to call the police.

152
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,760
Back then, Lu Xun wanted
to sue me for rape.

153
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,160
You left overnight

154
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,680
so there was no hard evidence.

155
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,880
If you really wanted to call the police,

156
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,360
you wouldn't wait until today.

157
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,040
Call them.

158
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,400
Do you want me
to help you make the call?

159
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,320
I understand you too well.

160
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,520
You dare not.

161
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,080
You're afraid your photographs
will get exposed.

162
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
You fear

163
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,360
being stripped bare
and shamefully judged.

164
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,920
You worry

165
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,240
your glamorous appearance
will shatter into pieces.

166
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,240
Call the police?

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,640
You even record this?

168
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,800
Such cheap tricks.

169
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,480
Why?

170
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,320
Why?

171
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,960
Why did you come back again now

172
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,480
after raping me six years ago?

173
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,800
Why can't I escape from you?

174
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,960
Thank you for saying that.

175
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,320
I told you.

176
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,640
You play an important role

177
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
in my plan.

178
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,360
The truth is,

179
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,160
it's fine even if Lu Xun didn't drink

180
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,560
the wine,

181
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,720
as long as you drank it.

182
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,160
You really shouldn't have

183
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,080
a habit of eating sleeping pills.

184
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
Lu Xun,

185
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,560
the show is only about to begin.

186
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
To testify as witness,

187
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,840
you will reveal your identity.

188
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,120
By then,

189
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,880
you are just a greedy and vain person

190
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
who lied to the public.

191
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,000
And Lu Xun

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
was involved in the incident
six years ago

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,640
and was also the last person

194
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,400
to enter Liu Yan's room before her death.

195
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,760
Naturally, he will be the final straw

196
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,320
that forced her to death.

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,920
You faked your identity.

198
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,120
No one would believe you

199
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,880
even if you testified.

200
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,720
And he

201
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,320
will become a suspect of an old case

202
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,360
and can no longer
protect you by himself.

203
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,840
None of you can escape.

204
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,160
Public opinion

205
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,440
cannot hide the truth.

206
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,440
What good does the truth do?

207
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,720
When the news hits,

208
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,040
everyone will only read the headlines.

209
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,120
No one will really click

210
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,160
and read the details.

211
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,840
Right now, one of you is a liar

212
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,240
and the other, a scum.

213
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,000
You two will forever bear

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,720
the allegation of forcing
Liu Yan to death.

215
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,000
Even though

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,440
you two won't be charged

217
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,720
but you can never explain yourselves.

218
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,200
You two can never regain

219
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,280
your standing in society

220
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,000
and

221
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
never be able to live your normal lives.

222
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,800
This is hell.

223
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,440
This is the price Lu Xun has to pay
for stopping me back then.

224
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,280
Are you afraid now?

225
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,760
No, I'm not afraid.

226
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,040
We didn't do anything wrong.

227
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,600
Why should we be afraid?

228
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,320
You're the one who should be afraid.

229
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,680
Public opinion can only
temporarily hide the truth.

230
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,040
In the end

231
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
you will pay for everything

232
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,600
you have done.

233
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,200
Do enjoy

234
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,760
the dark life that is coming for you.

235
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,240
Lin Chen. Lin Chen.

236
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,000
Are you okay?

237
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,640
Who was that?

238
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,200
Meng Jiao, will Lu Xun
be affected by my doing?

239
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,120
Lu Xun, don't act so impulsively.

240
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,240
Maybe this isn't as bad as you think.

241
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,360
Did Zhang Ping take advantage of
the chaos and escape?

242
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,520
Yes.

243
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,080
We got information

244
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,160
that the criminal
from the cold storage case

245
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,680
did not confess it was Zhang Ping.

246
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,120
And all surveillance footage
in the hotel today

247
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,400
has been overwritten.

248
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,680
We have no evidence

249
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,560
of Zhang Ping entering
and leaving Liu Yan's room.

250
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,160
Will Lin Chen

251
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,640
be affected by my doing?

252
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,360
Lu Xun, you must be held responsible
for Liu Yan's death.

253
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,160
You all forced Liu Yan to choose death.

254
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,240
You're a liar! Liar!

255
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,280
You must be held responsible
for Liu Yan's death.

256
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,080
You all killed Liu Yan.

257
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,720
- Yes, it was you.
- You liar.

258
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,320
Lu Xun.

259
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,400
It's Lin Chen.

260
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,960
Lin Chen, you liar.

261
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,160
- Liar.
- You killed Liu Yan.

262
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,040
Lin Chen, I...

263
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,760
You wouldn't put up that act, right?

264
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,040
That act where

265
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,960
you'll say mean things to me
so I'll leave you

266
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,400
because you're afraid of
getting me involved.

267
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,040
I was afraid you would
pull that act yourself.

268
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,440
It's too old-fashioned.

269
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,080
Lin Chen, you liar!

270
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,080
Liar.

271
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,560
Stop making trouble. Go.

272
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,960
You liar.

273
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,120
Lu Xun, no matter what happens,

274
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,360
I will face it with you together.

275
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,120
