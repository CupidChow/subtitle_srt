18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,640
Lu Xun,

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,640
you know who she is,

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,960
don't you?

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,720
Yes.

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,080
You're too late.

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,760
You've disappeared without a trace
for six years.

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,040
I was the one who stayed by her side.

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,560
I understand her lifestyle.

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,480
I know her preferences.

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,480
I became a part of her life.

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,360
But you

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,480
are just her schoolmate from high school.

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,360
I didn't hear that you two got together.

31
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,720
I'll admit it.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,000
We didn't

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,200
turn out to be what I had hoped.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,680
You clearly know who she is

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,880
but still pretend not to.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,960
What are you afraid of?

37
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,280
Let me guess.

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,680
It's because

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,480
you totally have no idea

40
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,920
whether she liked you or not

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,440
during high school.

42
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,920
Even if she liked you,

43
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,720
that feeling

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,160
would have been long gone
after six years.

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,200
That's why you can only keep testing her.

46
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,960
It's because you're afraid.

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,640
You're afraid of the answer you'll get.

48
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,240
What was written

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,680
in that letter?

50
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,000
You! Stand right there!

51
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,720
So, you saw me then.

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,200
What was it?

53
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,920
I won't tell you.

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,200
Come on.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,520
How about some music?

56
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,320
- Sure.
- No.

57
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,840
It's so hot, Lin Chen.

58
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,600
Turn on the air-conditioning.

59
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,360
No.

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,120
President Lu,

61
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,480
why don't you head back first?

62
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,000
I still have something
to speak with Lin Wan.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,240
Goodbye, President Lu.

64
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,160
You're going back to the hotel, right?

65
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,120
Did you fight with Lu Xun?

66
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,960
I can't be bothered with him.

67
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,720
But what's up with you today?

68
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,440
You don't seem quite yourself

69
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,560
since you've gone to the hospital.

70
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,800
Maybe it was the rain.

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,400
I recalled that incident again.

72
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,400
Hear me out.

73
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,160
You're always
taking the bulls by the horns.

74
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,680
How could you go up
against something like that alone?

75
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,080
If the police hadn't shown up so quickly,

76
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,280
you might be dead.

77
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,440
I heard

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,920
that girl moved away that night.

79
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
That criminal

80
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,920
didn't plead guilty for rape in the end

81
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,240
but for other crimes

82
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,600
and got imprisoned for a few years.

83
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,000
If I hadn't gone up against him,
she'd be dead.

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,280
But

85
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,560
it really was a coincidence

86
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,560
that the police showed up.

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,400
Lu Xun.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,760
Lu Xun.

89
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
What is the fuss about?

90
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,920
Lu Xun,

91
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,720
I just had a supernatural encounter.

92
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,480
I saw Lin Wan at the hospital.

93
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,000
She was filming the show with you
during the day

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,440
then turned into a vegetable at night.

95
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,760
I see.

96
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,000
What is it?

97
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,120
So that's why she replaced Lin Wan.

98
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,360
What?

99
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,040
Go and check

100
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,880
the hotel's surveillance footage
on the first day of filming.

101
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,040
Someone in Lin Wan's team
got injured that day.

102
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,680
Perhaps that wasn't an accident.

103
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,840
All crews who came in and out
on that day must be...

104
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,400
What are you doing?

105
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,280
Lu Xun,

106
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,840
how should I dress up

107
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
so I'd look like a tyrant boss?

108
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,320
Lin Wan is here. Everyone, look!

109
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,680
Okay.

110
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,200
(Lin Wan)
Lin Wan, I love you. I love you!

111
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,800
May I have your autograph?

112
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,640
(Lin Wan)
Take a photo with us.

113
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,320
Thank you, everyone.

114
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,960
(Lin Lu Couple) We won't disappoint you.
Thank you for your support.

115
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,600
Good luck to us both!

116
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Looks like she really got popular.

117
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,480
Even my own friends are asking

118
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,880
if they really are a couple.

119
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,120
You...

120
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,760
When we were training overseas,

121
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,680
everyone in the company loved Lin Wan.

122
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,040
They said I can never debut

123
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,920
and never become a celebrity.

124
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,360
Now I want them to see me

125
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,880
standing at the most stellar of places.

126
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,720
And Lin Wan

127
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,960
is nothing.

128
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,760
It is strange.

129
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,880
Lin Wan used to be very quiet.

130
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
Recently,

131
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,280
she seems like a different person.

132
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,720
You...

133
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,560
Can't you even tell a pair of twins
when you see one?

134
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,600
Liu Yan,

135
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,080
she...

136
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,760
she is my

137
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,560
younger sister.

138
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,360
Is it possible

139
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,480
that she isn't Lin Wan?

140
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,440
Huh?

141
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,960
How is that possible?

142
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,280
You looked inside her bag that day,
didn't you?

143
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,640
Was there any chocolate inside?

144
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,640
I don't think so.

145
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,440
Lin Wan has low blood sugar level.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,200
She always has chocolates
inside her bag.

147
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,800
Not only didn't we see it recently,

148
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,040
her expression when she had
to eat the cake that day

149
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,200
was very unnatural.

150
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,400
It was as if...

151
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,560
That's right.

152
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,040
Is Lin Wan allergic to something?

153
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,680
I stayed with her in the same dorm
for four years.

154
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,720
She isn't allergic to anything.

155
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
But she has an annoying

156
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,760
twin sister.

157
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,840
We can't be sure.

158
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,200
Where is Lin Wan going tonight?

159
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,320
Today is a couple's interview extra

160
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
for members-only.

161
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,600
We've prepared some questions.

162
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,320
If you answered wrongly,
you'll be zapped.

163
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,400
It's better if you two can have

164
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,720
some banter when answering.

165
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,120
Okay, all departments, get ready.

166
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
We will start filming shortly.

167
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,720
Is your arm alright?

168
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,360
It's fine.

169
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,760
Miss Lin, we'll start now.

170
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,440
Okay.

171
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,920
Ready. 3, 2, 1.

172
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,560
Start!

173
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,600
Question:

174
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,360
What is your initial ideal type?

175
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,240
The total opposite of President Lu.

176
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,120
Is this spoilt?

177
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,400
It's spoilt, right?

178
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,920
Can you tell us specific details?

179
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,760
First of all,

180
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
(he must be handsome.)

181
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,660
♪The sunlight scattered the endless night♪

182
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,700
♪When your smile is everything I see♪

183
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,020
♪My heart skipped a beat,
and it became obvious♪

184
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,900
♪I was also fantasizing your past♪

185
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,640
(Secondly,)

186
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,320
