18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,280
Lu Xun!

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,400
So I didn't break your leg back then.

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,800
Did you know

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,880
what kind of life

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,480
I had in jail for the last five years?

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,920
If you hadn't held me back,

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,600
I wouldn't have to live through that.

25
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,040
I lost a finger.

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,320
I suffered for five years.

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,520
I thought I can
start a new life after prison.

28
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,680
But I never expected

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,360
my mother died of illness,

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,200
my wife ran away with someone else,

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,720
and my son committed suicide.

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,000
I became alone.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,280
I lost everything.

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,800
There is no place

35
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,680
for me in this world again.

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,560
You should have
thought of the consequences

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,200
when you committed crimes back then.

38
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,240
Don't claim the moral high ground.

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,480
I was just momentarily drunk.

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
It was all because of you!

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,200
If it weren't for you,

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,680
how would I end up in prison?

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,920
You even want to sue me for rape.

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,080
Even that girl

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,440
didn't dare to sue me.

46
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,400
I was only charged with

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,040
intentional injury.

48
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,120
What do you want to do?

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,800
Now that you mention it,

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,680
it's quite funny.

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,960
At first,

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,680
I will just keep on living like that.

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,920
But I happened to see...

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,480
(Choco, Chocolate)
Choco, chocolate.

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,520
that little girl
who overestimated herself.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,680
Choco, chocolate.

57
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,680
That's when things
start to get interesting.

58
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,450
I can't stop.

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,960
At first,

60
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,720
I wanted to kill her to vent my anger.

61
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,280
Then I suddenly realized
I got the wrong person.

62
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,840
Then coincidentally,

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,960
I saw you,

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,000
the high school student
who called the police.

65
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,600
Right now,

66
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,320
one is the president of a chain of hotels

67
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,440
and the other is masquerading
as a small-time artist.

68
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,120
You're living a luxurious life.

69
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,800
It's a life

70
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
totally different from mine.

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,320
I feel terribly frustrated!

72
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,800
Did you think I am still
that student from six years ago?

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,160
I will never allow you

74
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,320
to lay a finger on her.

75
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,080
Don't worry, I won't kill you two.

76
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,800
What I want is for you two to lose everything

77
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,880
and be abandoned by society.

78
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,840
Soon,

79
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,240
you will experience everything
I've gone through.

80
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000
Lu Xun.

81
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
Let's take our time playing this game.

82
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,660
(Lu Xun)

83
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,720
I think

84
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,760
you had better finish up
this show as soon as possible.

85
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,640
It's fine. It's only for a month.

86
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,240
Besides, I need a reason to quit.

87
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,800
Otherwise, I'll have to pay the penalty.

88
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,640
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

89
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,800
- I didn't mean it.
- Are you okay?

90
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,160
I'm fine.

91
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,000
How about we waive your bill today?

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
I'm fine, just go.

93
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,280
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

94
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,320
You're scalded and you said you're fine?

95
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,520
Are you dumb? Why are you smiling?

96
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,960
It was boiling hot soup, you know?

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,800
If I avoided it, what about you?

98
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,440
You're a girl.

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,520
If you have a scar on your hand

100
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,760
nobody would want to marry you.

101
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,880
I'm handsome,
now I look cooler with a scar.

102
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,280
The only person
who looks cooler with a scar

103
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,440
is Harry Potter.

104
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,160
Why are you drenched?

105
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,080
What happened?

106
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Nothing. I lost the umbrella.

107
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,480
How did you even lose it?

108
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,680
Why aren't you eating?

109
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,280
I lost my appetite.

110
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,760
He is tyrant boss.

111
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,120
How could he be satisfied with these?

112
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,200
The food is fine,

113
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,600
I just can't stand the company.

114
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,520
What's wrong?

115
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,240
Have a drink?

116
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,560
Here, cheers.

117
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,440
Lin Wan?

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,080
Lu Xun?

119
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,200
I super love you two.

120
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,520
Can I take a photo with you?

121
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,840
Well,

122
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,440
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,400
We're having a meal.

124
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,680
It's inconvenient for them.

125
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,880
Who are you?

126
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,160
I was on TV too.

127
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,520
There are 12 fans

128
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,880
following Lin Wan and I as a couple.

129
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,920
Then you take a photo for me.

130
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,280
Hurry up.

131
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,000
Thank you for sending me home, President Lu.

132
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,720
Today was all thanks to you.

133
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,800
Goodbye, President Lu.

134
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,360
Is something wrong?

135
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,440
Can Meng Jiao stay with you tonight?

136
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,480
She has gone back
to the company for work.

137
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,400
Besides, I've been living on my own.

138
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,160
I'm staying the night.

139
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,200
President Lu.

140
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,320
Why?

141
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,680
It's too late, there are no more taxis.

142
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,120
You're a president.
Don't you have a personal driver?

143
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,840
It's raining.

144
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,640
But he can still drive.

145
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,440
My driver is having a baby.

146
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,920
I remember now.

147
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
There is a hotel right next door.

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,040
I'll send you the address.

149
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,120
I never stayed in another hotel.

150
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,160
You had better not offend anyone lately.

151
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,600
If you see anyone suspicious, you must...

152
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,760
The most suspicious person is you.

153
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,280
What?

154
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,120
President Lu, you can't stay in my house.

155
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,320
I only have one bedroom, and...

156
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,040
I remember you still owe me 115,000.

157
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,840
President Lu, are you tired?

158
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,600
Do you want a drink? Water? Tea?

159
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,840
I have everything in my house.

160
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,000
This man is so strange.

161
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,200
Why does he want to stay in my house
in the middle of the night?

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,600
The photographs.

163
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,960
President Lu, let's have some tea.

164
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,360
So you have a twin sister.

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,560
You really do look alike.

166
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,840
Yes.

167
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,680
Even our mother
can't tell us apart sometimes.

168
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,400
Jiangbei No. 47 High School.

169
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,760
What a coincidence.

170
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,200
I studied at that high school too.

171
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
What is your sister's name?

172
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,120
Maybe I know her.

173
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,480
Actually,

174
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,720
my sister might be adopted.

175
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,880
We're not close at all.

176
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,240
So, whatever she did
is none of my business.

177
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,720
Let's get out of here.

178
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,920
What's wrong?

179
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,840
I'm fine.

180
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,600
You look really pale
and you still say you're fine?

181
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,800
You have a fever.

182
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,960
Here, let me help you.

183
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,880

R-Really?

201
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,000
Lu Xun.

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,640

He needs surgery immediately.

207
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,400
His humerus and tibia are broken,
and he has necrosis of the hip.

He needs a hip replacement.

Doctor,

210
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,880
is his life in danger?

211
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,800
It's a Level 4 surgery,
so there will be risks involved.

Additionally,

213
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,240
the surgery may not guarantee

214

a full recovery of the hip movements.

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,840
After the surgery, it's best
to go for systemic rehabilitation.

216
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
But we don't have that

217
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,440

It's time for your father to do his duty.

Did he think he can neglect you

222
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,160
