18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,480
I was accompanying my girlfriend

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,840
and the dinner was at my hotel.

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,120
Is there a problem?

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,520
Impossible.

22
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,360
You're only saying that
because you want to cover up

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,520
for Lin Wan.

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,880
I have the proof!

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
As for these so-called proof,

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,560
these are just a few shots
with misleading angles

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,600
out of the many photographs.

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Why don't you go back and tell
President Liu to give you all the photos?

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,440
Then, we'll know who is lying.

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,440
Besides, if Miss Lin
really wanted to gain something

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,880
using President Liu,

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,760
why would she do so
with that many people around?

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,320
Doing it privately
would give her the best chance

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,200
and wouldn't leave
any so-called proof behind.

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Oh, right. President Liu
drank too much yesterday

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,320
and was about to harass Miss Lin

37
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,880
so I gave him a kick

38
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,440
on his right shoulder.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,240
Mrs. Liu, why don't you go back
and check it yourself?

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,880
It's official! It's official!

41
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,720
What?

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,160
The Lin Lu Couple is real.

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
They admitted it. My God!

45
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,580

going official!! Lin Lu Couple is real!!)

46
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,000
(This is great! My sisters!)

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,260
(I hope they'll stay together
forever and ever)

48
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,140
So she did it?

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,960
If Mrs. Liu still has doubts,

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,880
you may ask President Liu
to meet me in person

51
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,400
and talk about what happened yesterday.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,080
However, that depends on
whether he dares to or not.

53
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,640
If President Liu dares not come,

54
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,840
then it is clear

55
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,120
who is lying.

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,080
Now that this situation
has been cleared up,

57
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,640
we want to look into accountability.

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,560
All of you barged into
our hotel without permission

59
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,080
and disturbed our guests.

60
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,240
Our legal department will take down
your information

61
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,520
and maintain the right to investigate.

62
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,440
- This is a misunderstanding, President Lu.
- We'll leave right away.

63
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,240
President Lu, it's just a misunderstanding.

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,520
- We're leaving now.
- We're leaving now.

65
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,360
Okay, we'll do that.

66
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,640
We've troubled you.

67
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,840
Okay, okay.

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,720
The show will temporarily
suspend filming.

69
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,200
We'll issue a joint statement
with the production team

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,960
and then decide what to do next.

71
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,040
Why didn't I return that slap to her?
What a bummer.

72
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,480
Isn't it because we're new

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,680
and have little under our belts?

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,160
As soon as we take one wrong step,

75
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,480
then we're doomed forever.

76
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,840
We really have President Lu
to thank for today.

77
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
Why does his brain work so fast?

78
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,160
If President Lu hadn't spoken up,

79
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,040
we couldn't explain things even if we did.

80
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,520

are you?

How is that possible?

87
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,160
Why did you drop by so suddenly?

88
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,600
I was passing by.

89
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,400
That might be Meng Jiao.

90
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,160
You could've just said

91
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,760
you went there to say hello as the boss.

92
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,280
Why did you have to say
you're her boyfriend?

93
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,600
I forgot.

94
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,720
Really? Was the kiss even necessary?

95
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,880
What do you think I should have done?

Oh, I forgot.

98
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,240
President Lu,

99
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,200
you're not involved in this matter, right?

100
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,800
Why are you helping her so kindly?

101
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,360
President Liu is backed by
Smart Alliance System.

102
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,560
Under it is a chain of top hotels
within the country.

103
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,480
The incident took place at SW.

104
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,720
If I allowed them to slander Lin Wan,

105
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,040
Smart Alliance will definitely
turn this into an issue with SW.

106
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,000
This is business.

107
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,640
What if they step up to prove

108
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,080
that you weren't at the dinner?

109
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,760
Don't worry.
The others wouldn't dare speak up.

110
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,960
They dare not make President Liu angry

111
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,760
much less offend SW.

112
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,920
President Liu will not
publicly issue a statement.

113
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,040
Everyone will know who was lying.

114
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,040
Then, that's good.

115
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,440
Let me ask you.

116
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,240
Have you offended anyone lately?

117
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,840
I haven't. Why?

118
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,480
I'm sorry, everyone. I feel hungry.

119
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,080
I'm hungry too.

120
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,360
I remember you have noodles here, right?

121
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,960
Yes, I happened to have tomatoes.

122
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,240
You can add some vegetables too.

123
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,120
President Lu, do you want to eat too?

124
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,080
Let's eat outside.

125
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,000
Is anyone going to go grab umbrellas?

126
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,360
Leave you two alone down here

127
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,560
while I go upstairs?

128
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,960
No way, not going.

129
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,160
Not going.

130
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,560
Fine.

131
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,640
I'll go again.

132
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,800
I've figured it out.

133
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,200
President Lu,

134
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,800
you usually pretend like you don't care

135
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,880
but you're actually full of schemes.

136
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,240
That's better than someone
who looks stupid

137
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
and is actually stupid.

138
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,280
Don't get ahead of yourself.

139
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,000
Before she voices out her intention,

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,800
you're just a schoolmate back in the day

141
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,080
who suddenly transferred schools.

142
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,640
And, since you're so shrewd,

143
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,560
why didn't you just

144
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
ask Lin Chen herself

145
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,680
what was written in the letter?

146
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,520
Let's go. It's my treat.

147
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,120
Thank you for your help today.

Why don't I treat?

Or we split the bill?

150
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,560
No need.

151
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,360
What is it?

152
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,360
Zheng Ziyan, take Lin Chen upstairs
and stay there.

153
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,800
What's going on?

154
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,840
Something urgent came up.

155
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,560
Remember, don't leave her side.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000

(Chemistry Book  Year 3 Class 8  Lin Chen)

159
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,840
Don't touch her.

You're just a brat

161
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,640
and you dare try to be a hero?

163
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
You know her?

Every wrong step you take

165
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,280
will mean another year in prison for you.

170
