18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,840
I didn't expect her to leave
a ticking bomb behind.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,160
Speak.

20
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,440
What is inside?

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,080
Zhang Ping,

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,680
don't keep on making mistakes.

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,320
It's not important what it is.

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,800
The police will find out about

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,200
this phone sooner or later.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Why don't you

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
solve this for me?

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,800
Even if they find out something
is wrong with Liu Yan's death,

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,800
someone would have already
committed suicide to escape the crime.

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,600
It's just some sedative,

31
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,960
no need to be afraid.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,400
There won't be pain, just a quick death.

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,480
Wait! Did you think there is

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,680
only one flash drive?

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,360
We made backups.

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,120
How would I know
you're not lying to me?

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,400
Do you dare bet on it?

38
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,000
Liu Yan said it very clearly inside

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,120
that Lu Xun and I saved her.

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,640
There is also a photograph.

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,080
As soon as these get exposed,

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,880
you will pay for all that you've done now

43
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,080
and to Liu Yan six years ago.

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,760
I think

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,720
you don't have what it takes to bet.

46
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:31,980
Curse you.

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,840
Lin Chen.

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,160
Where is Lin Chen?

49
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,480
With me, of course.

50
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,880
Lu Xun, call the police.

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,920
Don't hurt her.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,200
If you don't want her dead,

53
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,640
then you'll bring the backup photo
and video to me.

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,560
I do have the backup

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,200
but you have to guarantee her safety.

56
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,400
No more tricks.

57
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
If you call the police,

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
then she is as good as dead.

59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,000
Where is the item?

60
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,000
Let Lin Chen go first.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,360
Do you think I'm a fool?

62
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,680
Let her go.

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,560
What if you gave me a fake

64
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,120
or have other backups?

65
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,240
If I hand it to you,

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,360
how would I know
you will let her go as promised?

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,280
Don't touch her.

68
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,480
Clearly,

69
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,040
you don't have the power to negotiate.

70
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,680
Buy time.

71
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
The laptop is there.

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,240
Play it for me.

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,160
If you dare lie to me,

74
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,680
both of you cannot escape.

75
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,400
Lu Xun.

76
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,080
Didn't I say

77
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
I would get the car with you?

78
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,600
But you insisted on making me
wait for you at the entrance.

79
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,320
How would I know he was outside?

80
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,920
This was also unexpected.

81
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,360
Then, if we survive this,

82
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,320
can I not pay you the money
in the contract?

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,520
No.

84
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,320
Aren't you a president?

85
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,880
Why are you always so stingy?

86
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,800
I resigned

87
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,120
so I need to save money.

88
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
Stop talking, hurry up.

89
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,080
Actually, I have had a crush on you

90
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,120
since high school.

91
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,680
I know.

92
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,600
It's just that you don't know.

93
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Know what?

94
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,600
You don't know

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,840
that I wrote you a love letter.

96
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,000
You don't know

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,280
that I loitered around

98
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,480
after school every day

99
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,000
so I could take the same bus as you.

100
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,760
You don't know

101
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,520
that before you love me,

102
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,040
I've already loved you.

103
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,680
Loving you makes me happy

104
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,400
and also makes me a coward.

105
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,480
I worry that these six years
would be too long.

106
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,920
So long that you would've forgotten me.

107
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
So long that

108
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,800
you would've fallen out of love with me.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,840
Lu Xun.

110
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,760
I'm not here to listen to

111
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,880
your sappy stories.

112
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,520
Hurry up, no more tricks.

113
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,700
(This folder is empty.)

114
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,840
Give it here.

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,920
Let me see it, turn it around.

116
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,080
You tricked me!

117
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,400
Freeze, police!

118
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,760
Get up, don't move.

119
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,200
I told you,

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,160
I am no longer that student
from six years ago.

121
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,240
You dare call the police?

122
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,560
Did you really think
you can threaten me?

123
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,680
I really have a backup.

124
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,440
You're doomed.

125
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,520

Understand?

128
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,760
No.

129
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,800
- I won't lose.
- Take him away.

130
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,720

No.

How could I joke about this?

182
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,520

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,920
was you.

186
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,600
It had always been you.

187
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,880
I used to be afraid
if my confession failed,

188
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,920
we wouldn't be friends anymore.

189
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,120
Zheng Ziyan,

190
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,600
The person I love is Lu Xun.

192
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,080
I know but I still want to say it.

193
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,560
Because I realized

194
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,360
I don't want to be just your friend.

195
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,440
So from now onward,

196
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,840
we're not friends.

197
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,960
I'm just

198
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,160
a person who loves you.

199
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,520
I'll be going abroad for training.

200
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,800
You don't need to contact me.

201
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,840
I'll be fine on my own.

202
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,880
I hope you will too.

203
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,320
Goodbye, Lin Chen.

204
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,040
Why so passionate?

205
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,920
What's that to you?

206
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,080
Mrs. Lu's business is also my business.

207
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,640
Who is Mrs. Lu?

208
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,640
Have you forgotten

209
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,680
what you agreed to in front of everyone?

210
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,400
We're getting married tomorrow.

211
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,160
What are you doing?

212
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,280
Lin Chen, I sent you a file.

213
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,120
Just listen to it.

214
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,480
You don't want him to leave?

215
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,000
No.

216
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,120
(Voice file)
Shall we

217
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,280
continue what we were doing just now?

218
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,480
(I don't know what you've written)

219
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,040
(in that letter from six years ago.)

220
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,160
(Why did Zheng Ziyan)

221
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,320
(receive the same thing too?)

222
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,960
(You said)

223
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,760
(you wanted me to start hating you.)

224
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,680
My injury hurts.

225
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,920
I need to rest.

226
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,600
(I'm afraid that you don't love me)

227
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,320
(as I love you.)

228
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,600
You must be Lin Wan's family, right?

229
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,640
You look exactly like her.

230
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,520
She just woke up.

231
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,360
She woke up?

232
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,600
Lin Wan!

233
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,120
Lin Wan!

234
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,240
You're finally awake!

235
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,320
You're

236
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,680
injured.

237
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,760
What happened?

238
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,480
Have a lot of things happened
during this period of time?

239
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,600
It's okay, take your time and tell me.

240
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,840
You're still injured.
Why do you have to take a shower?

241
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,440
Mind your injury, okay?

242
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,880
What's wrong? Did you fall down?

243
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,320
Are you okay?

244
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,880
Sorry, I'm going.

245
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,520
What is it?

246
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,240
Mrs. Lu, have you forgotten

247
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,080

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,160
does anyone wish to object?

289
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,840
None.

290
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,000
You aren't thinking of leaving me
at the altar, are you?

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,120
You dare?

292
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,600
You said

293
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,920
you wrote me a love letter

294
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,480
when you were in high school.

295
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,360
I have a sudden urge to know

296
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,680
what was written in it.

297
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,360
It happened when I was young,
I forgot.

298
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,120
Then I'll have to consider this.

299
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,000
It's fine if you want to know.

300
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
But only if you first tell me

301
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,360
what was written
in the love letter you gave me.

302
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,200
Isn't this the one I gave you years ago?

303
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Read it.

304
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,160
It's been so many years

305
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,480
and you still kept it.

306
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,520
Hurry up and just read it for us. Right?

307
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,400
Yes, read it.

308
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,160

322
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
You didn't say
whether you liked me or not?

Yes.

324
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,400
Lin Chen, we've been delayed
for far too long.

325
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,880
