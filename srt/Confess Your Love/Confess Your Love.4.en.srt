Please calm down.

188
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,920
Your show is slandering
our product in public.

189
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,120
Do you even respect us?

190
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,760
I'm sorry, President Wang.

191
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,560
Miss Lin didn't mean to slander

192
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,920
your brand on purpose.

193
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,120
I don't want to hear anymore.

194
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,360
I want her to quit the show.

195
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,640
Otherwise, I'll pull out my money.

196
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,480
If not,

197
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,040
I want make this matter public.

198
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,160
How can your show

199
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,040
hire an unqualified artist like her?

200
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,080
President Wang.

201
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,040
I was in the wrong just now.

202
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,440
But

203
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,840
it has nothing to do
with the production team.

204
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,000
And I won't quit.

205
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,680
I formally apologize to you.

206
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,920
What good is an apology?

207
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,680
So many people heard you.

208
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,880
How are we going to

209
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,040
recoup this loss?

210
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,440
Will an apology solve it?

211
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,760
You must quit this show.

212
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,720
Otherwise, I will post it up online

213
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,120
and have the public comment on it.

214
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,680
If you make it public,

215
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,000
then all the netizens are going to know

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,400
that your product tastes horrible.

217
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,360
Who is he?

218
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,800
He is the main sponsor of our show,

219
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,520
President Lu of SW Group.

220
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,280
President Lu,

221
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
what did you mean by that?

222
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,560
Nothing.

223
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,640
I heard an advertisement
is being filmed

224
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,000
in our garden today.

225
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,440
For occupying my hotel's property
for filming without permission,

226
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,360
I suggest you
to find a lawyer immediately

227
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,520
to discuss this with us.

228
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,880
President Lu,

229
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,120
the weather is nice today

230
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,600
so we moved it into the garden.

231
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,920
We've already informed you.

232
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,520
But that's not in the contract,

233
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,280
correct?

234
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,160
Are you threatening me?

235
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,640
We are both businessmen,

236
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm sure we will
work together in the future.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,320
You wouldn't offend me

238
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,400
over a small-time artist, right?

239
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,360
My apologies.

240
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,080
Judging by your assets,

241
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,520
I don't think there is any chance
at working together.

242
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,520
We SW want to be exclusive sponsor.

243
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,040
We have no need for useless things,
get rid of them.

244
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,160
It'll make our hotel cleaner too.

245
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,640
Yes, President Lu. I'm on it.

246
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,520
Lu Xun!

247
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,760
President Wang,
if you like the tea in SW,

248
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,240
please have another cup or two.

249
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,560
President Lu.

250
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Thank you for today.

251
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,800
No need.

252
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,760
After all, if anything happens to you

253
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,040
I won't get paid.

254
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,080
I won't go back on my debt.

255
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,280
I'll pay you after we're done
with today's filming.

256
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,280
Just one part.

257
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,760
But

258
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,320
can I pay the balance in installments?

259
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,440
Why today?

260
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,920
The first three days are over.

261
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,480
We'll have to pick
a partner again tonight.

262
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,720
I've told you.

263
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,200
As long as you help me remain
at the start of the show,

264
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,080
you can choose anyone
you want after that.

265
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,200
