Lu Xun, what are you doing?

I haven't eaten what I made myself.

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,680
I didn't do that.

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,440
Why are you like this?

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,320
I'll just return it to you.

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,000
Nobody asked you to return.

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,080
Can this be aired?

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
My God, they're too sweet!

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,440
I think they're in this for real.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,680

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,440

Who could have thought he would do that?

Kitty!

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,080
How cute!

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,400
Kitty, you're so cute.

34
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,000
Kitty.

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,040
Say,

36
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,720
you guys are quite gutsy.

37
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,280
You replaced Lin Wan just like that.

38
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,680
What about university?

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,760
It's a practical semester anyway.

40
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,480
I'll just take the exam
at the end of the semester.

41
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't go spreading this, okay?

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,840
Do you even need to remind me?

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,760
If you had to,

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,880
then our years of friendship

45
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,720
would be in vain.

46
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,480
Why do you think Lu Xun

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
came back from abroad so suddenly?

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,120
It's such a coincidence

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,400
for him to be a guest.

50
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,160
How would I know?

51
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,560
You couldn't

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,800
be still in love with him, right?

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,360
No way that's possible.

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,040
That was when I was younger.

55
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,440
That's it.

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,560
That Lu Xun

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,160
grew up with a scowl.

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,880
He transferred school

59
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,280
without a warning six years ago.

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,640
He disappeared without a trace.

61
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,040
Why don't you love me instead?

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,840
Look at me.

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm handsome

64
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,760
with a good personality.

65
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,840
When the time comes,

66
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,400
I'll open up a dental clinic

67
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,480
and you'll open a veterinary hospital
next to mine.

68
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,320
The two of us

69
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,160
will take care of everyone in Jiangbei

70
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,840
and their pets.

71
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,960
I was kidding.

72
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,480
You've been telling that joke

73
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,440
since we were in high school.

74
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,920
Did you think I'll fall for it?

75
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,520
Did you see through me again?

76
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,100
(Jiangbei Hospital)

77
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Your recovery is going quite well.

78
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,520
Your rehabilitation

79
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,160
in the US these years
hasn't been in vain.

80
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,440
Why did you suddenly come back?

81
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,280
Because

82
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,960
he has some other plans.

83
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,100
(Three Day Lovers
Ahh! I ship! I ship!)

84
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,400

85
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,560
Why don't you just
reintroduce yourself to Little Lin?

86
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,120
That's none of your business.

87
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,600
Oh.

88
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,640
My dear brother,

89
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,080
you must have some self-confidence.

90
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,080
You might not be as handsome as I am,

91
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,240
but if I say I'm the most handsome

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,480
then you definitely come in second.

93
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,680
Little Lin

94
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,520
might still be in love with you.

95
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,040
(Your credit card has been frozen)

96
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,520
Why is my credit card frozen?

97
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,080
Because all other ways to deal with you

98
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,840
are illegal.

99
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,040
I'll just return it to you.

100
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Nobody asked you to return.

101
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,000
Who are you?

102
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,360
Hey, I was talking to you.

103
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,120
Who are you?

104
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,680
What?

105
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,160
That guy is probably
not a real doctor, right?

106
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,200
She only said he wore black gloves

107
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
and was unsure of everything else.

108
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,840
Okay, I'll go check it out.

109
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:46,096
(Chemistry book Lin Chen)

110
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,560
Don't come here.

111
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,000
I've already called the police.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,160
Mind your own business.

113
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,880
Lu Xun?

114
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,440
No damage to the bone

115
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,920
but there was a nail on that broom.

116
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
So let's give you a tetanus shot

117
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,040
just to be safe.

118
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,200
I didn't know it was you.

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,800
Hey.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,720
Aren't you two the Lin Lu Couple?

122
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,000
Miss Lin will change
her partner at any time.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,600
We're not necessarily a couple.

124
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,000
Huh?

125
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,560
It wasn't just at any time.

126
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,960
Hey, doctor.

127
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,480
Coming.

128
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,640
Give me a second.

129
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,320
Why don't you start explaining, Miss Lin?

130
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,800
You just renewed the contract

131
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,080
then you picked Liu Mo right after that.

132
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,960
What was that all about?

133
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,520
It costs money to renew the contract

134
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,880
but I'd make money not to renew.

135
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Of course, I didn't.

136
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,720
When did I ever say I want money?

137
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,640
What are you doing at the hospital?

138
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,240
Meng Jiao is feeling unwell.

139
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,840
I'm here to visit her.

140
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,680
Why are you at the hospital too?

141
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,440
Lu Feng is ill.

142
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,840
Hm?

143
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,440
Why do you have another scar here?

144
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,400
Another?

145
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,160
So Miss Lin knows

146
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,680
there wasn't a scar here.

147
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,180
(Zheng Ziyan)

148
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,440
I'll be outside.

149
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,360
Ouch.

150
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,400
You should get going if you're busy.

151
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,920
I can handle this myself.

152
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,800
I didn't mean it that way.

153
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,440
I'm not busy at all.

154
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,960
Why are you here?

155
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,840
I've been looking for you.

156
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,000
I called you but you didn't pick up.

157
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,880
Lu Xun?

158
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,520
How did you two meet here?

159
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,080
I'll tell you later.

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,640
Well...

161
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,320
I've checked it out.

162
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,600
That person isn't from this hospital.

163
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,760
They don't know why he is here either.

164
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,080
Meng Jiao has transferred Lin Wan

165
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,960
to the VIP ward.

166
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,520
Okay.

167
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,640
President Lu,

168
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,880
why don't you take a rest here?

169
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,640
We'll be leaving now.

170
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,920
Hello?

171
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,400
Oh, you've gone back?

172
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,320
Oh, okay.

173
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,640
I'll head back on my own later.

174
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,120
Your brother left?

175
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,960
Oh, it's fine.

176
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,880
This won't do.

177
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,160
Your arm is injured.

178
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,640
It's better to have us accompany you.

179
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,480
I'm fine.

180
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,040
I haven't gone back.

181
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,400
What did he mean?

182
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,880
Isn't that Little Lin?

183
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,600
Why is she a vegetable now?

184
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,560
Are you a stalker?

185
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,720
How did you find this place?

186
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,880
Stalker?

187
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,840
I'm this handsome

188
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,000
and you're calling me a stalker?

189
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,960
I am the younger brother

190
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,320
of SW Group's president.

191
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,640

Wearing like this,

193
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,160
loitering around,

194
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,240
just like a chicken.

195
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,200
Are you taking me for a fool?

196
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,600
Who is a chicken?

197
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,640
I'm warning you.

198
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
Don't go spreading this around.

199
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,440
Otherwise, I'll beat you up
every time I see you.

200
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,560
Go drive the car here.

201
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,120
Fine, I'll drive.
