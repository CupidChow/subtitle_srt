=Episode 12=

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,440
Miss Lin, why are you
sneaking a peek at me

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
instead of sleeping?

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,720
Mosquitoes.

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,560
There are mosquitoes.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,040
I was just

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,640
afraid you don't feel
comfortable in my house.

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,120
I'm keeping the mosquitoes
away from you.

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,680
That was a huge mosquito.

26
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,320
It almost got you, President Lu.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm just a wonderful host, okay?

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,320
Thank you, Miss Lin.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,440
President Lu, take a good rest.

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,640
Keep at it.

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
Miss Lin, did you suddenly quit
being a wonderful host?

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,280
Of course not.

33
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,240
Why are you still sleeping?

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,160
You're going to be late for the show.

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,440
What a lazy bum.

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,960
Oh my.

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,120
President Lu.

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,480
What's going on?

39
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,600
Are you two living together?

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,240
What?

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,920
President Lu just stayed the night.

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,120
That's perfect then.

43
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,240
I can send you two to film the show.

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,320
Today will be the first segment
after the official announcement.

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,920
They want to film a special date.

46
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,680
I'll wait for you outside.

47
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,340
(Liu Yan)

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
Was President Lu present
at President Liu's dinner?

49
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,160
Can you give us a comment?

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,320
Were you aware that Lu Xun and Lin Wan

51
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,640
were dating during the filming
of the show?

52
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,400
Are you and Lin Wan
considered best friends in the industry?

53
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,120
My apologies, everyone.
I cannot comment on it.

54
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,080
Give us a comment, Miss Liu Yan.

55
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,720
How annoying.

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,960
Just ask Lin Wan herself.

57
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,560
I didn't expect her to be fine
after the mistress scandal

58
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,360
and even got official with Lu Xun.

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,000
Now she'll get all the attention.

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,160
Soon after the announcement,

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,520
she got 200,000 more fans.

62
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,920
Her popularity puts her
12 ranks above us. Look.

63
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,820
(A new segment of "Three Day Lovers" begins!
Lin Lu Couple reunites!)

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
This latest segment's cover and headline

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,840
are all about her.

66
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,440
Didn't it always feature me?

67
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,960
This cannot go on.

68
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,640
Have you spoken to Liu Mo's team?

69
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,600
They've agreed.

70
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,900
Lin Wan,

71
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,720
I will snatch back this spot.

72
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,660
(There is information you want
at Jiangbei Hospital VIP1008)

73
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,640
What is that?

74
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,880
What are we filming today?

75
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,520
A double date.

76
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Lin Wan and Lu Xun are dating at a mall

77
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,600
(Three Day Lovers) and then bump into
a friend who is also on a date.

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,280
This is also a situation
many people encounter in their lives.

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Give me more interaction.

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,080
- And then...
- Huh?

81
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,560
Must we really bump into someone else?

82
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,080
A friend on a date?

83
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,920
When did I even lose my own name?

84
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,400
Miss Liu,

85
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,920
the point is, many people want to see

86
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,440
the daily life of a real couple
after the announcement.

87
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,160
You two are also a popular couple.

88
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,840
Filming together

89
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,880
is an advantage for you too, right?

90
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,520
All departments, get ready.

91
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,720
Prepare to start filming.

92
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,800
Lin Wan.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,440
You're not getting any exposure today.

94
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,600
Really?

95
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
We'll see about that.

96
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
Bestie, I didn't think I'd see you here.

97
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,880
Yes, what a coincidence.

98
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,360
We happen to be on a date,
so we're leaving.

99
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,400
Wait, I happen to have something

100
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
to share with you two.

101
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,640
I don't want to hear it.

102
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,440
I officially got together with Liu Mo.

103
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:21,800
Yes.

104
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,920
We have officially started dating.

105
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,000
Are you two officially announcing this?

106
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
- Yes.
- That's right.

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,160
We met because of this show.

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,440
Of course we should announce it
to everyone here.

109
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,480
We have two pairs of real couples.

110
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,200
Heaven has chosen our dating show.

111
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,520
You're amazing!

112
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,040
Why can't you get a single one?

113
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,720
This is my first time.

114
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,200
Lin Wan, I wanted to give you one

115
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,760
but Momo got these

116
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,080
so I can't bear to.

117
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,160
I don't need it.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,200
Stay focused.

119
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,960
You joined this show

120
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,120
to advertise for your hotel

121
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,400
while I'm here to make a name for myself.

122
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,560
We need to work together.

123
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,320
Would you believe me if I say
we only got 30 seconds' worth of footage

124
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,800
after trying the claw machine for two hours?

125
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,960
We need to do everything we can today

126
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,280
to snatch back the exposure on the show.

127
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,960
Let's team up for the win, okay?

128
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,080
So, do you want these plushies?

129
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,760
You got another one.

130
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,880
As long as there is one you like,

131
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,840
I'll get it for you.

132
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,680
I love it, thank you!

133
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,480
What are you doing?

134
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,480
You're not going to make her
give it to me, right?

135
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,800
Don't do it, thank you.

136
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,840
President Lu, do you want me
to give one to Lin Wan?

137
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,960
Let's go.

138
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,080
Are you done playing?

139
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,440
Miss Lin, you can pick anyone you like.
These are all yours.

140
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,120
President Lu has bought them all.

141
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,760
All mine?

142
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,280
Liu Yan, how about
I let you catch two more?

143
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,000
But you'll have to pay up.

144
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,400
No need.

145
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Wait for me.

146
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,840
Mr. Lu, you're incredible.

147
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,080
Happy?

148
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
Of course.

149
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,560
But I won't reimburse you, okay?

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,600
I saw it first.

151
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,200
You'll look ugly in it.

152
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,760
- Give it to me.
- No.

153
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,200
Give it to me.

154
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,800
Darling, you'll buy this for me, right?

155
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Of course, just use this.

156
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,160
President Lu, you wouldn't
buy all the dresses

157
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,280
just like you did
with the claw machines, right?

158
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,000
That's not how you spend money.

159
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,120
I'll say this first.

160
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Aside from this dress,

161
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,920
Lin Wan can pick anything else.

162
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,960
It's fine even if President Lu
buys them all.

163
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,800
I don't like them anyway.

164
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,720
This darned Liu Yan.

165
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,880
I have an idea.

166
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,600
Do I look beautiful?

167
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,520
Very beautiful.

168
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,160
There is a sense of unparalleled beauty

169
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,520
when you wear this dress.

170
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,760
Thank you, President Lu.

171
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,760
Lin Wan, you're doing this on purpose.

172
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,080
You said I can't buy it for Lin Wan

173
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,640
but you didn't say
I can't buy it for anyone else.

174
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,520
Oh right, Liu Yan.

175
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,680
This is for you.

176
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,880
My gosh, is it a special day today?

177
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,120
I give you gifts

178
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,520
because I want you to have them.

179
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,680
Everyday feels like

180
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,000
Valentine's Day when I'm with you.

181
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,000
Can you put it on me?

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,560
