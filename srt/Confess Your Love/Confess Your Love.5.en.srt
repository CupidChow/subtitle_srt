Did I say I want to swap?

19

You don't?

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,480
If Miss Lin wants to renew the contract,

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,200
I can consider it.

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,840
Lin Wan.

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,800
I need to talk to you.

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,480
What do I have to talk to you about?

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,360
When we start filming later,

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,560
you'll pick Liu Mo.

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,680
I want to pick Lu Xun.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,160
Are you taking me for a fool?

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,560
Lu Xun is the financial backer.

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,960
The exposure won't be minimal.

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,080
You already have enough shots
in the last segment.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,080
I want Lu Xun's popularity.

33
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,920
You were behind
that voice recording just now, right?

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,080
I haven't settled this score with you yet

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,880
and you want to talk to me about...

36
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,720
200,000.

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,600
I'll give you 200,000.

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,720
On the condition,
you are not allowed to pick Lu Xun

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,040
as your partner for the next three-day round.

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,560
But...

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,320
500,000.

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,760
I'm not...

43
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,040
1,000,000.

44
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,120
Do you want to swap partners,
President Lu?

45
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,880
No.

46
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,880
Then do you think

47
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,280
Miss Lin will swap partners?

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,160
She will not swap.

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,960
You won't film anymore?

50
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,200
I had the company
go all-in to promote you

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,320
joining a dating show.

52
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
I've sent out all the materials.

53
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,800
Now you're telling me
you won't film anymore.

54
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
Could it be

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,320
because Lin Wan wants to swap partners?

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,120
Has your brain rotted?

57
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,480
I only left you for a while

58
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,520
and you swapped your partner.

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,320
This is great.

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,720
Leaving Liu Yan with Lu Xun as a couple,

61
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,160
she'll be up to all sorts of tricks.

62
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,680
But she'll give me 1,000,000.

63
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,160
It takes money to renew the contract
with Lu Xun.

64
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,440
Minus the amount to be paid to him,

65
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,280
115,000.

66
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,760
I still have a balance of 885,000.

67
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,020
(Just you wait.
Don't worry!)

68
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,320
She really transferred the money to you?

69
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,200
Now we don't have to worry about
Lin Wan's medical expenses.

70
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,880
This is just the first payment.

71
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,520
Three days later,

72
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,800
she will transfer the rest.

73
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,280
We signed this contract for just 300,000.

74
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,680
If we calculate this,

75
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,280
then we've made
an extra 700,000 for nothing.

76
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Now that we put it this way,

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,000
it's not impossible to let her

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
have Lu Xun for three days.

79
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,480
We'll just take him back
after three days.

80
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,960
It's a sure win deal.

81
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,000
Right?

82
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,120
I've always had a feeling

83
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,040
that you've been treating
Lin Wan differently.

84
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,920
But

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,720
haven't you always been in love

86
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,800
with that girl in high school

87
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,400
who you suspected
has confessed to you?

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,520
Now you have a change of heart?

89
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,880
Oh, it's her!

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,840
But I haven't understood it
after all these years.

91
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
What do you mean by "suspected"?

92
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,040
Fine, I get it.

93
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,280
Why don't you just
start hating me from now on?

94
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,200
You!

95
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,080
For you!

96
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,920
Read it now!

97
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,840
You!

98
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,920
Stand right there!

99
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,680
Have you seen it?

100
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
Lin Chen from Class 8
went up to a few boys,

101
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,280
gave them letters
and even hugged them.

102
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,040
Is she practicing her confession?

103
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
After she has had enough practice,

104
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,680
will she go up to the boy she likes

105
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
and confess?

106
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,280
You're leaving already?

107
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,520
Deduct the penalty for leaving the show

108
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,640
from my account.

109
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,880
It's fine, you can leave.

110
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
After this,

111
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,040
it's all couples-only tasks.

112
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,200
If you leave,

113
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,640
you'll only give others a chance.

114
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,240
Miss Lin, I'm done.

115
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,320
Thank you.

116
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,120
Miss Lin,

117
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,040
there has been a sudden incident.

118
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,480
Liu Mo got injured

119
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,240
and will be absent for today's task.

120
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,600
We made adjustments to our plans.

121
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,280
You will follow Lu Xun and Liu Yan.

122
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,680
That way, the headlines will blow up

123
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,120
since you two have just swapped partners.

124
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
He got injured?

125
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,400
Yes, that's right.

126
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,760
I can't make it

127
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,280
to today's couples-only task.

128
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,640
My leg hurts.

129
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,840
I broke my leg.

130
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,880
His leg broke?

131
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,080
They have a baking task today.

132
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,560
We wrote you a setting
of a chance encounter

133
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,040
to heighten the drama.

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
If you interact more with Mr. Lu,

135
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,960
you will get more shots.

136
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,560
But I can't interact with him.

137
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,680
I haven't received the balance.

138
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,960
Are you there? This is an emergency!

139
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,720
3, 2, 1, start.

140
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,120
Thank you.

141
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,880
On your first date,

142
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,520
please make your very own tiramisu.

143
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,520
Did you know?

144
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,400
My biggest dream as a child

145
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,160
was to open a dessert shop.

146
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,280
That way, I will always be surrounded

147
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,920
by sweetness while at work.

148
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,120
Lin Wan?

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,520
Why are you here?

150
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,160
You're not here
to bake with us, are you?

151
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,720
Of course, not.

152
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Why would I ruin this for you two?

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,240
You...

154
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,320
What are you guys filming here?

155
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,120
This is so lively.

156
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,560
Zheng Ziyan.

157
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,440
You!

158
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,760
Stand right there!

159
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,040
Aren't you my old schoolmate, Lu Xun?

160
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,040
Do you two know each other?

161
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
Not from the same class

162
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,240
but we were the top two

163
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,760
in our school.

164
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,560
I was first.

165
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,640
I got first too.

166
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,600
Just one time.

167
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,840
We're really sorry,

168
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,720
Mr. Zheng.

169
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,960
We're filming here today.

170
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
Oh my.

171
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,720
Aren't you Zheng Ziyan?

172
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,120
Since we got to meet,

173
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,400
why don't you come here
and help me complete my task?

174
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,840
Do you also know him, Miss Lin?

175
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,400
Yes.

176
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
He is my...

177
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,520
sister's high school friend.

178
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,560
Miss Lin,

179
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,040
you can't simply add another person,
I'm afraid...

180
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,000
Mr. Zheng,

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,600
you may stay and film with us.

182
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,520
Having an amateur join at the last minute
isn't going to give us much shots.

183
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,480
Haven't you seen the reaction on Lu Xun?

184
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,680
Miss Lin,

185
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,800
you're amazing.

186
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,240
This Lu Xun

187
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,720
is just like when he was in high school.

188
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,440
Always with a scowl.

189
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,600
I see you two were schoolmates
from high school.

190
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,160
What a coincidence.

191
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,920
Right now, Mr. Zheng

192
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,000
is a dentist

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
with a chain of clinics.

194
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,840
Oh no.

195
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,920
We're making tiramisu today.

196
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,280
These numbers look complicated.

197
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,080
I went away

198
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,600
to become a trainee during high school.

199
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,320
My math might not be good.

200
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,800
Can you help me?

201
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,000
You can use a calculator.

202
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,880
Okay, everyone.

203
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,560
Next, you will need to finish your cake

204
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,600
within one hour.

205
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Remember to interact with each other.

206
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,160
Why don't we have

207
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
cinnamon powder on our side?

208
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,000
Can you go over there and borrow some?

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,160
I can't disturb them.

210
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,280
Lu Xun,

211
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,160
let us use some of your cinnamon powder.

212
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,720
No.

213
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,840
Here.

214
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,240
Hey, you!

215
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,560
I used it all.

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,800
The production team is up to something.

217
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,200
Only their side has milk.

218
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,400
Thank you.

219
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,000
It's all gone.

220
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,400
Okay, time's up.

221
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,760
Everyone, you may now

222
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,640
put down your things

223
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,120
and taste each other's cake.

224
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,080
Lin Wan,

225
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,920
here.

226
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,240
Aren't you allergic to chocolate?

227
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,920
I'll eat it.

228
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:17,960
You...

229
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,120
You...

230
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,360
You ate it all.

231
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,200
There's one bite here.

232
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,320
I remember you love chocolate the most.
