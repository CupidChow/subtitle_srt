Hello,

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm Lin Wan.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,760
Wait.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,440
Miss Liu Yan,
do you have something to say?

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:24,880
We can wait until...

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,000
I only have one question.

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,240
Are you

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,400
really Lin Wan?

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,520
If I'm not Lin Wan, then are you?

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,440
I said

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,480
don't let me get my hands on
any evident information about you.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,800
You cannot blame me.

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,240
You all must not be aware yet.

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,680
Lin Wan has an identical twin sister

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,920
named Lin Chen.

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,920
On the first day of filming the show,

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,000
their team claimed

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,280
that a crew member had fallen
and was admitted to the hospital.

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,400
I suspect that person to be Lin Wan.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,200
In order to continue filming the show,

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,280
they had the younger twin
to impersonate the other

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,720
and lied to everyone.

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,120
Miss Liu,

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,560
do you understand what it means

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,480
to slander her in public?

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,080
President Lu,

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,320
would I dare expose this

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,520
at the meet-and-greet

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,280
without any proof?

47
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,360
Vice President Lu, bad news.

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,400
Something has happened
at the meet-and-greet.

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,800
The public relations department
has gone ahead.

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,960
The driver is waiting downstairs.

51
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,160
Should we head straight over there?

52
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Okay.

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,560
I'll go talk to them first.

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,320
Yes, of course.

55
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,000

making this real?)

00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,520
Something unexpected
has occurred at our event.

58
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,680
So today's artists...

59
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,200
Lin Wan.

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,360
Oh, no.

61
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,040
Lin Chen.

62
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,200
Shouldn't you explain this

63
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,880
to everyone here

64
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,760
or announce your withdrawal

65
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,320
from the entertainment world?

66
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,040
Your video can only prove

67
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,280
that I have a twin sister.

68
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,240
I've never denied it.

69
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,360
How do you prove that I'm Lin Chen?

70
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,920
I've already made inquiries.

71
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,280
Lin Chen took the exams
at the university yesterday.

72
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,080
So, you don't have

73
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,520
a comatose twin sister

74
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,840
who looks exactly like you,

75
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,640
correct?

76
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,440
So,

77
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,520
can you make a video call for us?

78
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,520
Let us all take a look

79
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,200
at that comatose person

80
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,080
who looks exactly like you.

81
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,320
And what if

82
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,520
you're wrong?

83
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,640
It's no use turning it around.

84
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,680
You must make this video call today.

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,000
But that person

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,360
might not be able to answer.

87
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,280
There must be someone beside her, right?

88
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,760
Have that person hold the phone up.

89
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,280
Make the call. Make the call.

90
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,560
Just make the call.

91
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,440
Make the call. Make the call.

92
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,720
Put it up on the big screen.

93
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,080
Let everyone see it.

94
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,240
What is it?

95
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,720
- Why are there so many people?
- She answered. She answered.

96
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,100
They're really twins.

97
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,300
They're so alike.

98
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,400
Someone said we swapped identities.

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,640
So I'll need to bug you.

100
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,000
Did Liu Yan ask you
about your identity today?

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,440
No.

102
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,640
Something is wrong.

103
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,360
What's wrong?

104
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,320
You slipped up too much today.

105
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,840
She has been suspicious of you.

106
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,960
It's impossible she hasn't noticed.

107
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,480
Do you think she has noticed?

108
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,200
If something were to happen,

109
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
the meet-and-greet tomorrow
will be her chance.

110
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,120
At that time,

111
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,440
she will catch you off guard.

112
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
What do we do?

113
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,360
Let me think of something.

114
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,280
Remember.

115
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,560
At that time, you must

116
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,680
time every sentence perfectly.

117
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,960
If the conversation timing goes off,

118
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,840
the others will realize
this is a pre-recorded video.

119
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,640
Everything will be beyond saving.

120
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,960
What if Liu Yan

121
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,080
wants to talk to me?

122
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,280
It'll happen in a flash.

123
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
I don't think
anyone can react that fast.

124
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,520
We can only bet on it.

125
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,360
What is it?

126
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
Why are there so many people?

127
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,080
I'm so tired after the exam yesterday.

128
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,400
The doctor wants me to rest more.

129
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,920
Why are there so many people?

130
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,240
Did you finally become famous

131
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,280
while I was comatose?

132
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,960
What are you talking about?

133
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,880
I'm hanging up.

134
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,560
I have a score to settle with someone.

135
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,440
Good thing it went through.

136
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Impossible.

137
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,400
I saw it with my own eyes yesterday.

138
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,600
I brought the PR team.

139
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,560
Thank you.

140
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,640
But

141
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,760
it's settled now.

Let's go.

145
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,480
Wait.

146
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,400
Assuming I made a mistake

147
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,600
about you being the other twin,

148
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,720
are you and Lin Wan

149
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,040
a real couple?

150
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,560
Miss Liu,

151
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,840
we don't have time

152
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,480
to play this game
of real or fake with you.

153
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,780
What is this?

154
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,540
My God, are they really a fake couple?

155
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,760
They're really fake.

156
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,280
Aren't they lying to the fans?

157
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
How could they do this?

158
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,260
They're playing with our feelings.

159
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,520
This is written in black and white

160
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,560
and clearly states

161
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,720
that Lu Xun and Lin Wan
are a pair of contract couple

162
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
right from the beginning of the show.

163
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,680
They agreed to be a fake couple.

164
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,840
One wants to make a name
for herself in the entertainment world.

165
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,280
One wants to hype up
the reputation of his hotel.

166
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,320
It's a win-win deal

167
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
to lie to the fans for traffic.

168
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,240
So, if anything happens to one of them,

169
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,400
the other one will be affected.

170
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,440
At the dinner with President Liu,

171
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,520
Lu Xun cannot vouch

172
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,320
for what Lin Wan has done.

173
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,240
After all, they are partners in crime

174
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
through thick and thin.

175
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,760
If Lin Wan is branded a mistress,

176
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,320
where would Lu Xun's reputation

177
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,840
as a boyfriend even go?

178
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,160
Am I wrong?

179
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,800
I brought the PR team.

180
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,640
Go.

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,920
How do you feel now,

182
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,240
President Lu?

183
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,160
I told you.

184
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,000
I won't kill you.

185
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,040
I only want you two

186
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,520
to lose everything.

187
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,960
This is just the beginning.

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,800
Enjoy it.

189
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,000
Please give us a response
regarding this contract.

190
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,420
(Boycott SW Group
Lin Wan and Lu Xun As Contract Couple)

191
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Anti-SW hot topic search terms
have sprung up.

192
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200
We cannot suppress it.

193
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,680
There are three other searches
related to them.

194
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,200
A total of four searches
are on the top ten.

195
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,640
The contract has now been shared

196
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,360
all over the Internet
more than 900,000 times.

197
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,160
This must be the work of Liu Yan.

198
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,120
Don't respond, tell them to leave.

199
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,320
Hello, Lu Xun.

200
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,040
PR team said
don't say anything right now.

201
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,880
Whatever you say now

202
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,440
will affect SW.

203
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,040
We will issue a statement
through the legal department.

204
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,400
Lu Xun, you must not
respond any questions.

205
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,440
I can respond.

206
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,720
We're being hammered here.

207
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,960
What are you responding for?

208
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,320
Yes, I admit it.

209
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,240
We are indeed
in a contractual relationship.

210
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,120
Liu Yan singled out Lin Wan

211
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,680
and wanted her quit filming.

212
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,240
So Lin Wan could only
come to me for help

213
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,080
to remain working.

214
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,800
You don't need to tell the truth, right?

215
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,760
This show

216
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,640
was originally about being fake lovers.

217
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,280
We only signed a contract

218
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,160
to protect both our interests.

219
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,120
President Lu, are you admitting
that you're a fake couple?

220
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,720
You're lying to your fans.

221
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,600
You're after the attention.

222
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,480
But after that I realized

223
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,600
the contract couldn't stop our feelings.

224
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,750
The fake became a real deal!

225
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,800
Since everyone wants to question us,

226
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,760
then

227
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Miss Lin,

228
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,520
