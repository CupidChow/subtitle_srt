Liu Yan is upset now.

One kiss

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,480
will cost you 10,000.

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,720
It's a bargain, right?

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,800
I knew it.

29
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,000
What?

30
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,360
Were you expecting something else,
Miss Lin?

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,880
You had better...

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,080
Let me go.

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,920
I need to go to the restroom.

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,280
You're really something.

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,640
The exposure in this segment
is sure to be enough.

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,600
But it's really strange.

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,400
Why would President Lu play along?

38
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,520
Could he have recognized you?

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
Impossible.

40
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,880
We didn't talk to each other
in high school.

41
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,040
Then that means

42
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
he really agreed

43
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,440
to your weird contract.

44
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,400
I really didn't expect this.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,560
Tyrant presidents nowadays

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,880
try profit from everything.

47
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,640
I lost 15,000 in just one day.

48
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,720
I only have 120,000 to my name.

49
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,840
I had them saved up
to open a veterinary hospital.

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,040
You have to reimburse me.

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,480
We'll talk about it later.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,040
Be serious now.

53
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,360
Later, when you go back,

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,800
you must not feel shy or awkward.

55
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,680
This way, you'll get more shots.

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,720
Shots in the car are the easiest
to cut out.

57
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,400
Why would I feel shy or awkward?

58
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,000
There is a bottle of water down there.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,040
You can drink it.

60
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,760
Okay.

61
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,560
Miss Lin, don't panic.

62
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,880
I didn't.

63
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,280
(Three Day Lovers)

64
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,880
You have to twist to open.

65
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,520
I know.

66
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,720
Do something that can be aired.

67
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,800
Ask questions and get answers,
this is a dating show.

68
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,520
What is your last name, President Lu?

69
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,080
Where are you from, Miss Lin?

70
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,440
From Jiangbei.

71
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,240
Oh, what a coincidence. Me too.

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,080
Oh, I see.

73
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,680
But I went to New York after high school.

74
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,640
Oh.

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,920
So he went to the US.

76
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,280
Miss Lin,

77
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,640
you look familiar.

78
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,880
Have we met before?

79
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,800
I look like every average girl.

80
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,120
What are you doing?

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,280
We've arrived.

82
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,080
I've asked around.
Lu Xun joined the show out of the blue.

83
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,560
The team wasn't informed ahead of time.

84
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,680
How did Lin Wan
manage to rope Lu Xun in?

85
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,760
She didn't just get to read
the task card today,

86
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,680
she even kept interacting with Lu Xun.

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,520
She will get all the exposure
in this segment.

88
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,480
This is her final notice.

89
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,800
She must be desperate
to make something out of this.

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
I'll go talk to Liu Mo's team again.

91
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,000
I've said it before.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,040
As long as I'm around,

93
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,480
she cannot gain a footing.

94
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,080
Then what are you planning?

95
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,200
When did our President Lu turn into
a male guest on a variety show?

96
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,480
When did you start telling me around?

97
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,080
Lu Xun, I think you're acting weird.

98
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,880
Don't tell me
you've fallen for this Lin Wan.

99
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,200
I can teach you how to go after her.

100
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,720
Have you ever been in love?

101
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,880
Does a military adviser

102
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,520
need to fight his own battles?

103
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,640
Another word from you

104
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,080
and I'll freeze your credit card.

105
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,560
Don't do that, Lu Xun.

106
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,760
I can't find the bracelet.

107
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,160
That's a sponsored item.

108
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,760
What?

109
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,200
Look carefully.
We still need to return it.

110
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,560
It's really missing.

111
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,880
I had this bag with me the entire time.
I only left it here to pick you up.

112
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,800
You have to find it today.

113
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,720
Since we lost it in this room,

114
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,000
it must still be inside here.

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,360
Everyone, please help us look for it.

116
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,080
Lin Wan.

117
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,760
You're not going to help me find it?

118
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,080
Miss Lin, please help us.

119
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,440
Isn't it over there?

120
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,040
So this show was for me.

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,320
You know,

122
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,520
your acting is really bad.

123
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,160
Are you acting tough now
because President Lu has your back?

124
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,760
You never talked to me like that before.

125
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,040
Let me check your bag.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,240
This kind of set-up is too obvious.

127
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,560
Why don't we just call the police?

128
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,120
No need for the police.

129
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,560
It's broken.

130
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,160
Even if you didn't take it,

131
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
you threw it down just now.

132
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,360
Look, it's broken.

133
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,000
You're really willing to
go the extra mile.

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
This material will need an electric saw

135
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,840
to break.

136
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,960
I'm warning you.

137
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,920
It's very hard for you
to explain this situation

138
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,240
and easy to offend sponsors.

139
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,360
So you must
take responsibility for it today.

140
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,640
How do you want me to do it?

141
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,960
I want you to quit the show.

142
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,080
You...

143
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,600
The security is here.

144
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,160
What request do you have, Miss Liu?

145
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,200
Please say it.

146
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Lin Wan broke my sponsored item.

147
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,960
She should pay it back, right?

148
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,520
President Lu,
you came here in such a hurry.

149
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,480
Are you trying to
cover up for your partner?

150
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,240
If this gets out,

151
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,720
my fans will never accept it.

152
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,560
You worry too much.

153
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,840
How can you prove

154
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,560
that your bracelet broke from my throw?

155
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,120
Then how can you prove that the bracelet

156
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,840
didn't break from your throw?

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Makes sense.

158
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,920
It should be compensated accordingly.

159
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,120
You're fair indeed, President Lu.

160
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,240
Lin Wan, that's 70,000.

161
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,880
And you have to
apologize to the sponsor in person.

162
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,280
Let's see if they'll still allow you
to be on the show.

163
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,240
My coat got dirty.

164
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,680
Whose coffee is this?

165
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,280
Liu Yan's.

166
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,400
My apologies, Miss Liu.

167
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,080
I'll need to send this coat
to Paris for cleaning.

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,600
I...

169
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
I did hit this table

170
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,200
but that doesn't prove

171
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
that I spilled the coffee.

172
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,920
You can't prove

173
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,320
that you didn't spill the coffee,
can you?

174
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,760
Add the round-trip flight ticket

175
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,040
to the cleaning and maintenance fee,
that's a total of 120,000.

176
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,360
After deducting the price
of your bracelet,

177
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,520
you still need to fork out 50,000.

178
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,200
Additionally,
as the main sponsor of the show,

179
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,480
I think Miss Lin can remain on the show.

180
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,320
Do you have anymore questions, Miss Liu?

181
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,480
Fine, 50,000 then.

182
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,160
President Lu, I'll add you on WeChat.

183
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,280
Transfer it to her.

184
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,280
Don't forget the 50,000.

185
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,800
President Lu, thank you.

186
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,320
Did you plan on
keeping that money to yourself?

187
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,640
No.

188
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Also, the contract you brought
was not signed.

189
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,000
In that case, the rights
for both parties cannot be exercised.

190
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,000
Now you cannot go back on your debt.

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,760
Am I right, Miss Lin?

192
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,400
Why would I do that, President Lu?

193
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,360
Why is Lu Xun so mean?

194
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,000
I think he won't be satisfied until
he has scammed all my hard-earned money.

195
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,720
(Liu Yan)
Oh, wow!

196
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,520
She really made the transfer.

197
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,960
Look, she really transferred it
to Lin Wan.

198
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,240
(Lu Xun)
What a relief!

199
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,040
Here, I went and bought you this to try.

200
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,880
Dark chocolate.

201
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,400
It wasn't easy to buy one.

202
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm allergic to chocolate.

203
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,240
Seriously?

204
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,800
So you and Lin Wan
only look exactly the same

205
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,640
but you are total opposites
in everything else.

206
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,080
Lin Wan always brings chocolates with her

207
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,400
every time she goes out

208
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,000
to replenish her sugar level.

209
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,760
Now that I think about it.

210
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,320
This is just like a dream.

211
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,680
We actually managed to fool them.

212
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,880
No one noticed that you aren't Lin Wan.

213
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,260
(Lu Xun)

214
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,600
- Huh?
- This...

215
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,560
- Oh, no!
- This...

216
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,360
Hey, hey, hey!

217
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,120
This...

218
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,920

219
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,320
