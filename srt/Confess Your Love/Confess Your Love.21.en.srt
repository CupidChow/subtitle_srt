Luckily, it wasn't for long.

It's nothing serious.

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,480
This often happens
in your medical school.

21
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,320
It's best to have
a full body checkup tomorrow.

22
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,120
Thank you, doctor.

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Look at you, you're an adult.

24
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,200
How did you get yourself locked
in a cold storage?

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,840
Did you know how dangerous it was?

26
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,760
Someone pushed me in.

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,800
Wait, if something had happened,

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,040
that's murder.

29
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,080
The person who pushed me
clearly wants to kill me.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Something is wrong.

If it wasn't for President Lu,

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,080
your life would have been in real danger.

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,640
Did you already forget about it?

34
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,920
I'll repeat it for you.

35
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,480
He used force

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,320
to smash the lock
on the electricity meter box.

37
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,880
Then he pulled the door open
and strode in.

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,160
My God, I didn't know

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,800
he would have such a soft side to him.

40
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,680
Did Zhang Ping give you instructions?

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Looks like she's dead.

42
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
Did you think Zhang Ping
would have your back?

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,000
He made you do the dirty work

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,320
so he can stay out of it.

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,760
I advise you to tell everything

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,040
to the police.

47
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,800
You called the police?

48
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,040
As long as you tell them
you got instructions from Zhang Ping,

49
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,280
we can consider not suing.

Hello, Lu Xun. Where are you?

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,040
Why haven't you been answering my calls?

53
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,320
We're about to begin.

54
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,360
What?

55
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,160
Okay, I got it.

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,120
Why did he leave? Director?

57
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Why did he leave?

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,680
Everyone, stay calm. Stay calm.

59
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,160
I need to go talk
to the production team.

60
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,280
I'm going now.

61
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
What did the doctor say?

62
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,080
It's nothing serious.

63
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,320
I'm glad you came.

64
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,560
How did you know
I was inside the cold storage?

65
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
I...

66
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,240
What happened?

67
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,720
It's nothing. I accidentally got cut.

68
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,040
It's fine.

69
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,160
It looks like a cut from a knife.

70
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,640
It's so deep
and you're saying it's fine?

71
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,760
Sit down.

72
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,920
Don't you know that injuries like these
get easily infected

73
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,040
if not treated in time?

74
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Your skin might even partially necrose.

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,280
I was in a hurry.

76
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,880
Are you still angry?

77
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Of course I am...

78
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
Are you saying

79
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,360
you were in a hurry to find me

80
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,680
to the point of neglecting your injury?

81
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,640
Point is, it doesn't hurt.

82
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,920

I don't know.

113

125
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,360
Just 10 minutes.

126
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,920
President Lu, why is your hand injured?

127
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,400
This is private.

128
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,680
Why are you two late for almost an hour?

129
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,040
I wasn't feeling well.

130
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,480
So I was late.

131
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,600
Netizens are asking if this engagement

132
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,280
is just an act.

133
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,200
What do you think of this, President Lu?

134
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,320

you don't have a reason to stop me.

139
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,480
I didn't commit any crimes.

140
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,000
Your accomplice has been arrested.

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,680
So you have to stay put

142
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,120
until the police arrives.

143
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,200

that it was me.

144
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,200
But

145
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,520
I can stay put.

146
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,000
I haven't watched
the best show yet, after all.

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,200
What do you mean?

148
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,960
This engagement isn't an act.

149
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,080

150
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,160
President Lu, may I ask

151
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,320
why were you at Liu Yan's room?

152
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,800
We had something private to talk about.

153
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,720
Liu Yan and Lin Wan don't get along.

154
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
What is this something private
between you and Liu Yan?

155
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,560
No comment.

156
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,600
Isn't Liu Yan staying at this hotel?

157
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,280
We can ask her and make this clear.

158
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,080
My dating show...

159
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,160
This is it.

160
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,120
Miss Liu?

161
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,620
(I thought I escaped from you.)

162
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Snap this.

163
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,120
Miss Liu Yan? Miss Liu Yan?

164
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,920
Miss Liu Yan.

165
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Heard that? The show has begun.

166
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,080
This is terrible! Liu Yan...

167
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,680
Liu Yan is dead.

168
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,160
She is dead?

169
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
Liu Yan is dead.

170
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,000
How did she die?

171
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,280
It might be suicide.

172
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,080
How is that possible?

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,400
Lu Xun, I've called the police.

174
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,440
Let's leave first.

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,920
You were the last person to see Liu Yan.

176
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,560
What did you say to her in the room?

177
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,080
Why did she commit suicide?

178
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,920
Do you know what the words

179
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
on her laptop means?

180
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,120
I am deeply sorry

181
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,560
for Miss Liu Yan's death.

182
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,120
SW will cooperate
in dealing with the aftermath.

183
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,640
As for the others, I have no comment.

184
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,760
(Why? Why?)

185
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,720
(Why did you come back again now)

186
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,360
(after raping me six years ago?)

187
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,680
(Why can't I escape from you?)

188
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,400
Lu Xun.

189
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,560
Six years ago.

190
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,640
What does that mean?

191
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,280
President Lu, do you have anything
to say about Liu Yan's death?

192
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,000
President Lu.

193
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,040
Please answer, President Lu.

194
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,320
Someone has leaked online

195
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,960
that Liu Yan studied locally
at No. 47 High School.

196
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,000
She was once suspected of
being raped in high school.

197
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,600
Were you that rapist, President Lu?

198
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,160
It was her.

199
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,540
Liu Yan is dead.
Do you have anything to say, President Lu?

200
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,800
Why did you suddenly
leave Jiangbei back then?

201
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,000
Is it related to Liu Yan?

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,120
You couldn't have run away
to the US, could you?

203
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,880
Everything points to President Lu now.

204
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,960
President Lu, please answer publicly.

205
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,840
Were you the one
who harassed Liu Yan back then?

206
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,920
President Lu, answer us.

207
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,280
Answer us.

208
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
No! It wasn't!

209
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,200
It wasn't him.

210
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,760
Lu Xun wasn't even there.

211
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,920
Liar, you weren't even here
during high school.

212
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,160
You're only saying that to help
lift the suspicion off Lu Xun.

213
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,640
I was right there.

214
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,120
I'm not Lin Wan,

215
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,360
I'm Lin Chen.
