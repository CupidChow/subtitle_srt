(Minato Coin Laundry)

2
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:07,975
(Closed due to personal circumstances)

3
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:12,346
Shin.

4
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:14,853
Let's go back to being friends.

5
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:16,049
But...

6
00:00:16,238 --> 00:00:16,917
I...

7
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:19,079
Come to the coin laundry again.

8
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,055
I'm always there.

9
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:25,125
Aren't you always here?

10
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:41,842
Shin.

11
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:44,044
What's wrong?

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,480
You weren't at the coin laundry.

13
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,248
So, I...

14
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,917
feel a bit bothered.

15
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:52,673
Sorry.

16
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,252
It seems I have caught a cold.

17
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,126
But it's nothing.

18
00:01:01,077 --> 00:01:02,042
Really?

19
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:03,564
Are you really okay?

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,165
I'm alright.

21
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:06,533
See you later.

22
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:10,904
Hot...

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,240
How is this okay?

24
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:15,542
Be quiet.

25
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:18,011
It's not a big deal or anything.

26
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:19,079
Alright,

27
00:01:19,092 --> 00:01:20,614
go back already.

28
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:23,951
What is it?

29
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,052
We're friends.

30
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,286
Please let me in.

31
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:27,487
It's okay, right?

32
00:01:27,526 --> 00:01:29,122
Since we're friends.

33
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:32,225
I got it.

34
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:34,595
I got it.

35
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:34,988
"Minato Shouji Coin Laundry2"
(Episode 12)

36
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,567
Delicious.

37
00:02:48,756 --> 00:02:49,469
Shin,

38
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:51,071
thanks for the food.

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,212
Are you fine being alone?

40
00:03:00,636 --> 00:03:01,274
Huh?

41
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:02,883
Did you take medicine yet?

42
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:04,418
Yeah.

43
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,053
I did this morning.

44
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:08,212
Thanks to you,

45
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:09,658
I can eat something again.

46
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:10,857
See?

47
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,793
This is nothing.

48
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:14,895
Thanks.

49
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,575
Then...

50
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:30,210
I'll take my leave.

51
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:50,997
Shin.

52
00:03:59,894 --> 00:04:00,741
Minato-san.

53
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:09,082
I'll return this.

54
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:14,790
(Shin)

55
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:35,203
(Shin)

56
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:41,548
Why?

57
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:45,579
Huh?

58
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:50,657
Why?

59
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:58,799
You said that

60
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:01,467
you would love me all your life.

61
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:07,073
Even though you loved me so much.

62
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,143
But why

63
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,435
did you forget?

64
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:23,623
Dammit.

65
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,927
What am I doing?

66
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:29,830
I'm sorry, Shin.

67
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:31,431
The key,

68
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:32,933
thanks.

69
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,035
You can return now.

70
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:37,237
Am I the only one in the wrong?

71
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:41,775
You...

72
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,307
You abandoned me

73
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:46,199
who couldn't remember anything!

74
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:49,749
What's with being friends?

75
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:52,652
When I can't recall anything,

76
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,921
and I feel cautious,

77
00:05:56,518 --> 00:05:57,324
but even so,

78
00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:59,211
you keep trying to get closer

79
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:00,657
even though I am clueless.

80
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,130
But in the end, you...

81
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:07,142
the me who can't remember

82
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,758
has no value, right?

83
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,195
That's not it.

84
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,238
I know.

85
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,208
The current me won't do, right?

86
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:19,813
I also want to be able to remember.

87
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:23,550
But...

88
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,972
Even if I look at the photos,

89
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:30,223
or going to places with memories,

90
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,493
I still can't recall anything.

91
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,064
But still,

92
00:06:40,114 --> 00:06:43,624
you're always on my mind constantly.

93
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:50,210
Actually, I didn't want to return it.

94
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:52,979
For me,

95
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:57,613
it's the only thing that connects us.

96
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,124
You

97
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,626
just forget about the past me

98
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:08,762
completely, that would be better.

99
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:11,464
No.

100
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,638
Forgetting my memories with you,

101
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:21,875
I can't do it.

102
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,910
Then what should I do?

103
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,815
Say something!

104
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,084
Minato-san!

105
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:10,590
When hydrogen peroxide decomposes,

106
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:12,892
it releases oxygen gas,

107
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:14,527
resulting in the formation of bubbles.

108
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,649
Catalase is

109
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:18,398
an enzyme that, when exposed to heat...

110
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,337
Forgetting my memories with you,

111
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,841
I can't do it.

112
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,917
(I'm sorry about earlier)

113
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,126
(If you don't mind,

114
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,038
I fried some aji fish for you)

115
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:24,089
(Love makes you blind)

116
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:04,852
(Love makes you blind)

117
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:27,654
Dear

118
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:29,622
Katsuki Shintaro,

119
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:32,121
I think you probably know

120
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:33,761
that this letter was written

121
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:35,402
for me to complain about you.

122
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,497
Read until the end.

123
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:38,965
Huh?

124
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:42,035
You have always been stubborn.

125
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:44,470
You have never respected elders at all.

126
00:11:45,152 --> 00:11:46,472
You talk a lot.

127
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:48,608
Besides that...

128
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:51,511
you like using cocky vocabulary,

129
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,013
like "always"or "certain".

130
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:55,521
Seriously,

131
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,684
please do something about that.

132
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,552
It really is just complaint.

133
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:01,254
Alright.

134
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:02,788
You

135
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,834
have always like

136
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,530
saying nonsensical things,

137
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:08,027
like "tell me what you like about me".

138
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:10,964
Causing trouble for Minato-san again.

139
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:13,132
Oh well,

140
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:15,401
since it's your birthday,

141
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:16,869
I'll answer you

142
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,958
about the things I like about you

143
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:20,094
as you wish.

144
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,342
Firstly, your appearance.

145
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:24,577
Appearance?

146
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,013
Just kidding.

147
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:28,848
And also...

148
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:31,484
Straightforwardness,

149
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:33,253
upright,

150
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,588
strong mind,

151
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,191
compassion,

152
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,128
honest about what you like.

153
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:45,031
During my difficult times,

154
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,567
you have always been by my side.

155
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:50,003
Living together,

156
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:51,838
I can be myself.

157
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:54,474
Your cuteness when you smile.

158
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:57,610
You think I'm finished?

159
00:12:57,979 --> 00:12:58,845
Idiot,

160
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:00,480
there are other things, too.

161
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,483
You care about your family.

162
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:05,385
You're good at cooking.

163
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:07,553
Your arrogance.

164
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:10,356
Your relaxed face when sleeping.

165
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,448
Your relaxed face after

166
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:14,153
waking up in the morning.

167
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,296
Your serious look when studying.

168
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:17,997
Furthermore,

169
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,668
the fact that you don't give up,

170
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:23,269
and repeatedly tell me that you love me.

171
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,653
And that...

172
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:27,573
you keep liking me that it's annoying.

173
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:30,076
I'm sorry

174
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,378
for not telling you that time.

175
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,348
The things I like about you

176
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,684
are countless.

177
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:42,422
In the past,

178
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:44,446
I've always been living

179
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:46,392
while thinking that

180
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,375
"forever" or "certain"

181
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,196
did not exist.

182
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:52,165
But now,

183
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:54,860
I'm starting to think that

184
00:13:54,885 --> 00:13:55,843
if I stay with Shin,

185
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,118
then they're possible.

186
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,305
Hey, Shin,

187
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,974
as long as you don't mind,

188
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:04,944
can you please stay together forever?

189
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:08,147
Please

190
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,283
give me a good answer.

191
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:12,518
This year's birthday,

192
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,354
congratulations.

193
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,123
From Minato-san

194
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:19,058
who is older than you.

195
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:20,827
Minato-san!

196
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:23,563
Minato-san!

197
00:14:50,115 --> 00:14:50,957
Shin!

198
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:58,030
Minato-san!

199
00:14:58,032 --> 00:14:58,731
Shin.

200
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:01,801
I...

201
00:15:02,258 --> 00:15:03,652
I have something to tell Minato-san.

202
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:04,504
Wait.

203
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:07,940
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,276
But please let me say it first.

205
00:15:16,154 --> 00:15:16,916
Shin.

206
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,352
I'm sorry!

207
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,490
For earlier,

208
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:26,325
when I told you to be friends.

209
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:30,029
Please forget about it!

210
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:31,030
Huh?

211
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:35,701
Shin.

212
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:39,172
Please...

213
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:42,275
continue dating me!

214
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,949
It's fine if you can't recall.

215
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:51,984
Just forget about that.

216
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:53,920
Because those things,

217
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,489
I can remember it clearly.

218
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:03,129
I...

219
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:06,632
From now on...

220
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:08,801
I still want to make...

221
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:12,772
new memories together with you.

222
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:16,542
Oh, here.

223
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:18,845
Couple mugs,

224
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:20,947
I bought everything.

225
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:28,541
Until you accept,

226
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:30,289
even if it's 10 years,

227
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,525
or 20 years, I'll wait.

228
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,428
No.

229
00:16:37,004 --> 00:16:38,839
Not 10 or 20 years.

230
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,368
Huh?

231
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:44,637
I...

232
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,107
Including Minato-san

233
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,645
or the crows on the coin laundry roof,

234
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:56,949
and this sea.

235
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,721
I love everything.

236
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:05,892
This thing...

237
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,094
do you remember what it's called?

238
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,766
Could it be that...

239
00:17:15,964 --> 00:17:17,370
I can remember everything.

240
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,807
The time I've spent with Minato-san,

241
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,244
every little thing.

242
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:46,625
The fact that I forgot you,

243
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:50,369
I'm an idiot.

244
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,777
I'm sorry for making you cry.

245
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:03,849
For that,

246
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:06,218
from now on,

247
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,421
I'll make you even more happy.

248
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:13,292
What you said,

249
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:16,295
just remember it well, Shin.

250
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,330
Yes.

251
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,133
I'll never forget again

252
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,869
until I die.

253
00:18:24,996 --> 00:18:25,750
No.

254
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:29,442
Even if I die, I won't forget it.

255
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,382
This is why

256
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,649
I said that you're too serious.

257
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:46,258
Shin.

258
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:49,295
To celebrate the return of your memories

259
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:51,030
let's go into the sea.

260
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:52,865
It's fine.

261
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:54,600
I'm already an adult.

262
00:18:56,388 --> 00:18:57,356
You're right.

263
00:18:59,037 --> 00:18:59,672
But...

264
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,909
Minato-san would never say that!

265
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:06,212
Wait, Minato-san!

266
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:18,180
This is payback for that

267
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:19,805
swimming pool incident, idiot!

268
00:19:58,226 --> 00:19:59,999
Shin! Shin-chan, wait!

269
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:02,435
Let’s rest first.

270
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,703
Be quiet, Minato-san.

271
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:06,338
I'll listen to your complaint later.

272
00:20:08,536 --> 00:20:09,742
Hey...

273
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:14,246
Hey, Shin.

274
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:16,048
The mobile notification.

275
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,783
Just forget about it.

276
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,286
Please think about what happened.

277
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:06,999
Hey, Shin...

278
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:08,167
Dammit.

279
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:11,613
Shin, are you still unable to remember?

280
00:21:11,908 --> 00:21:13,439
How's it going with Akira-san?

281
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:15,908
I'll tell him that I'm with Minato-san.

282
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:22,982
What did you type?

283
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,455
Installing information right now.

284
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,205
Good morning, Shin.

285
00:21:47,061 --> 00:21:49,508
Good morning, Minato-san.

286
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,143
It's too embarrassing! It's impossible!

287
00:21:55,143 --> 00:21:56,515
Hey, don't run away.

288
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,809
You're just too handsome.

289
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:00,619
Huh? Say that again.

290
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:05,224
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

291
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:07,626
Shin.

292
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:09,228
Cheers.

293
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:12,031
Cheers.

294
00:22:13,806 --> 00:22:15,367
The bowl looks really good.

295
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:16,836
Right?

296
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:18,920
It matches, too.

297
00:22:30,873 --> 00:22:31,717
Alright.

298
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,018
Let's go.

299
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:34,019
Yes.

300
00:22:40,287 --> 00:22:41,847
(Minato Coin Laundry)

301
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:42,561
See you later.

302
00:22:43,376 --> 00:22:44,363
I'm off.

303
00:22:44,872 --> 00:22:45,531
Yeah.

304
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:46,765
Take care.

305
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,236
Oh, right.

306
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,771
Minato-san,

307
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,506
do you like me?

308
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:01,013
I love you,

309
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:01,914
Shin.

310
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:03,716
Huh?

311
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,652
Did you think I would say that, idiot?

312
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:19,465
What you forgot.

313
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,806
(Minato Coin Laundry)

314
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,105
Alright.

315
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:27,806
Go already.

316
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:29,341
Minato Coin Laundry

317
00:23:29,424 --> 00:23:31,176
that is beloved by everyone,

318
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:34,947
we'll always be in your care.
