(Bean sprout)

00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:42,543
Minato-san, good morning.

3
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,520
That startled me.

4
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,589
Minato-san, good morning.

5
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,948
Hey, you're too close in the morning!

6
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:01,595
It's your fault, Minato-san,

7
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:03,297
Because you didn't notice me.

8
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:04,865
Can't you see?

9
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:07,134
I'm in the middle of cleaning.

10
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:10,037
You woke up quite early,

11
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,705
it's already six o'clock.

12
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:15,609
It naturally happens

13
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:17,911
when you reach your 30s,

14
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:20,703
I couldn't sleep a wink

15
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:22,248
due to nervousness.

16
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,651
I can't tell Shin.

17
00:01:27,697 --> 00:01:28,589
Shin.

18
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:30,290
I'm hungry.

19
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:31,837
It's your responsibility

20
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:33,119
to make breakfast,

21
00:01:33,158 --> 00:01:35,362
Yes. I'll make it right away.

22
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:42,669
Our living together like this,

23
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:44,237
or rather...

24
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:46,444
our cohabitation has started.

"Minato's Laundromat2"
(Episode 3)

26
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,601
Speaking of shopping,

27
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:02,898
I already took care of it.

28
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:04,766
I bought fresh ingredients

29
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,153
and the daily necessities.

30
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:15,562
Hey.

31
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:17,064
Shin.

32
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,467
You have bedhead,

33
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,364
you're really cute.

34
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:25,005
I'll take a picture later.

35
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:28,875
You in your pajamas

36
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,218
is too cute, it's irritating.

37
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:34,981
Shin.

38
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,784
The voice in your heart has spilled out.

39
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,252
Ah...

40
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:40,520
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:44,568
You really are a disappointing

42
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:45,624
handsome guy.

(Sakuma Shop)

44
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,298
Shu-kun!

45
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,800
Asuka, what is it?

46
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:56,259
The results of the practice exam

47
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:57,471
is out.

48
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:02,709
I did my best, though.

49
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:03,942
I got a B grade.

50
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:05,679
It has to be an A grade.

51
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,447
A promise is a promise.

52
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:09,692
If I can go on a date with you,

53
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,836
I'll do better.

54
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,192
You should work harder

55
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:14,380
if you want to go on a date.

56
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,090
- But...
- Asuka.

57
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,763
Just being by my side is enough.

58
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,431
You said that, didn't you?

59
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:27,000
I like Shu-kun.

60
00:04:27,164 --> 00:04:28,068
So please...

61
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:29,770
let me be by your side.

62
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:32,439
That was...

63
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:35,275
I might have said that...

64
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:36,243
Anyway...

65
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,979
For now, focus on studying.

66
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:41,281
We'll think about the date later.

67
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:48,688
What?!

68
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:50,257
We're in a relationship!

69
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,292
(Annual summer festival)

70
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:13,580
What is it?

71
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:15,966
Did you come to talk

72
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:17,591
about Shu-san again?

73
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,352
Yeah.

74
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:21,615
But I still haven't figured out how

75
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,779
to organize my thoughts or what to say.

76
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:26,059
Huh?

77
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:31,865
Shin, too.

78
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,433
You seem troubled,

79
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,779
did something happen with Akira-san?

80
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:40,207
I...

81
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,410
I'm living with Minato-san now.

82
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:45,145
Really...

83
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,814
Living together?!

84
00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:49,396
Sometimes, I wonder

85
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:50,654
if it's all just a dream.

86
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,053
When I wake up, Minato-san is there.

87
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,661
When I come home, Minato-san is there.

88
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,677
The time we spend together

89
00:05:57,702 --> 00:05:58,822
has increased.

90
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:00,227
Oh, I see...

91
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:02,796
But...

92
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:05,498
I want to get closer,

93
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,582
I want to know more about him.

94
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,272
I want him to look at me more.

95
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,175
I want him tell me that he loves me.

96
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,723
I want him to kiss me every morning.

97
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,046
I want us to share the bedroom too.

98
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:23,683
I'm not being selfish, right?

99
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:25,418
It's clearly selfish, isn't it?

100
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,922
Shin, you're being needy to Akira-san!

101
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,591
Living together is more than enough.

102
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,168
I'm jealous, you know?

103
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,763
You make all the first-loves look bad!

104
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:41,368
I shouldn't have told Hanabusa.

105
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,117
I still snapped at him,

106
00:06:58,864 --> 00:07:01,421
even though I understood him perfectly.

107
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:07,093
Oh!

108
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:08,628
Asuka?

109
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,964
Oh, Mizuki-chan.

110
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:12,165
What are you up to?

111
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:15,001
Well, I'm a student at this school.

112
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,903
Oh, I see...

113
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,204
It's been a while.

114
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,473
Why are you here?

115
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:22,108
Well...

116
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:24,179
a little bit of this and that.

117
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,616
Hey.

118
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,885
Do you want to talk for a bit?

119
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,753
Well...

120
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,422
Sure.

121
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:52,327
The spare key that you wanted so much

122
00:07:52,352 --> 00:07:54,312
that you wrote it on a wishing paper!

123
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,444
Shin, you're being needy to Akira-san!

124
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,047
Maybe...

125
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:09,990
I'm home.

126
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,495
Welcome back, Shin.

127
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:17,197
Just in time for dinner.

128
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,002
Thank you for the meal.

129
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:22,769
Huh?

130
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:25,105
Minato-san in an apron.

131
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:31,244
Go wash your hands and rinse your mouth.

132
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:32,612
Yes.

133
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:36,583
Hey, Shin.

134
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,387
Do you have work next Saturday?

135
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:42,455
No. I'm free.

136
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:44,257
Is that so?

137
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:47,194
There's a festival in

138
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:48,335
the shopping district,

139
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:50,702
so why don't we go together?

140
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:51,998
Huh?

141
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:53,199
Ah...

142
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:54,299
It's okay if you don't want to.

143
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:55,702
There's no way I wouldn't want to.

144
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:57,203
I absolutely want to go!

145
00:08:58,923 --> 00:08:59,939
I see.

146
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:02,142
So, next Saturday,

147
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:03,375
make yourself available.

148
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,177
Yes.

149
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:07,013
A festival...

150
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:08,548
that means...

151
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:09,617
I'll get to see.

152
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,760
Minato-san in a yukata.

153
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,036
I don't have a yukata.

154
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,119
Let's go buy one.

155
00:09:13,174 --> 00:09:13,863
Huh?

156
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,355
Let's go buy one tomorrow.

157
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:17,057
I don't want to.

158
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:18,625
It's fine, isn't it?

159
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:19,828
I've received my paycheck.

160
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:20,859
I'll buy it for you.

161
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:22,696
Don't waste money, idiot!

162
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:25,054
- I can buy my own yukata...
- I'm glad,

163
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:26,399
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

164
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:30,170
I never said anything about buying one.

165
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,814
Too flashy.

166
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,881
Which one?

167
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:44,117
This one, then...

168
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:02,368
Hey.

169
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:04,804
Which one should I get?

170
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:08,975
Minato-san,

171
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:13,179
they're all cute.

172
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,784
I'll never be able to decide then.

173
00:10:18,605 --> 00:10:19,452
Sheesh.

174
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:32,667
Sorry to keep you waiting.

175
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,040
You look amazing.

176
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:43,610
It really suits you.

177
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,412
It's only natural,

178
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,450
someone made me try on multiple options.

179
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:53,753
Let's go, Minato-san.

180
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:54,854
Yeah.

181
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:58,158
Actually, Shin...

182
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,360
the yukata suits you too well...

183
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:02,621
It's so annoying!

184
00:11:07,228 --> 00:11:08,301
Minato-san,

185
00:11:08,387 --> 00:11:09,813
Don't get lost staring at me,

186
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:11,118
let's go quickly.

187
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:13,606
I'm not staring!

188
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:15,721
I'm not staring at you at all!

189
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:17,438
Hit the nail on the head, huh?

190
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:20,146
Okay, I'll leave you behind, Shin-chan.

191
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:22,515
Please wait for me, Minato-san.

192
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,587
Wow, how lively.

193
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:28,388
Yes.

194
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,424
Anything you want to eat?

195
00:11:31,978 --> 00:11:34,060
This kind brother shall treat you.

196
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,895
Thank you so much.

197
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:38,198
- Let's go.
- Yes.

198
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:40,810
Smile.

199
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:41,834
Huh?

200
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,872
Cheese.

201
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:48,441
Shin!

202
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:52,056
Adorable.

203
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:53,646
Huh?

204
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:56,307
The cutest in the world.

205
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,518
- Amazing.
- Yes.

206
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,890
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

207
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:05,291
Umm!

208
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:06,426
Tasty.

209
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,027
Do you want some?

210
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:09,028
No.

211
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:10,029
Why?

212
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:26,151
You got it wrong here.

213
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:28,915
We did it before, use this formula.

214
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,756
Asuka, are you listening?

215
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:42,128
What is it?

216
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:44,063
You can see it, can't you?

217
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:45,865
I'm holding your hand.

218
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:49,183
Why?

219
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,300
Because

220
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:52,905
I like you, Shu-kun.

221
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,041
Thank you.

222
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:56,876
Okay, next question.

223
00:12:57,165 --> 00:12:58,507
Use the previous formula

224
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:00,311
on this question.

225
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,348
Wait. That's it?

226
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,219
We're in a relationship,

227
00:13:06,344 --> 00:13:08,554
you can hold my hand back.

228
00:13:10,652 --> 00:13:11,457
Why?

229
00:13:12,177 --> 00:13:13,259
Why?

230
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,330
Because that's how one expresses love.

231
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:24,039
Got it.

232
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,532
Why are you doing that, Asuka?

233
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,501
It's because of you, Shu-kun!

234
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,103
I understand now.

235
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:58,905
For you,

236
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:00,157
when I'm by your side,

237
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:02,087
it's probably hard for
you to focus on studying.

238
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,876
Huh?

239
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,011
I thought it was strange,

240
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:06,846
I've been teaching you so much,

241
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:08,407
but your grades haven't been

242
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:09,552
improving much.

243
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,986
When I'm by your side,

244
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:14,186
all you think about is me

245
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:16,089
instead of concentrating on studying.

246
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,079
Wait!

247
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:19,359
It's okay, Asuka.

248
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,895
If you get A, then we can go on a date.

249
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:25,465
Try studying on your own for a while.

250
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:34,006
Why does it end up like this...

251
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,439
Since you're here for the festival,

252
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:35,975
buy it!

253
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,009
Thank you.

254
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,184
350 yen.

255
00:14:38,396 --> 00:14:39,412
Yes.

256
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:44,083
This one looks delicious.

257
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:48,521
How nice...

258
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:56,462
Minato-san.

259
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:58,831
Yeah?

260
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:01,419
(Watermelon smoothie)

261
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:02,656
- Hello.
- Hello.

262
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:04,170
Two watermelon smoothies, please.

263
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,271
- Yes.
- Thank you.

264
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:07,106
(Watermelon smoothie)

265
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,249
Isn't this year's watermelon smoothie

266
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,850
sweeter than last year's?

267
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,619
Is that so?

268
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:20,953
Mine isn't.

269
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,223
Maybe only yours is sweet?

270
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,459
How could it be?

271
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:28,428
Please let me have a taste.

272
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:34,066
Is it sweet?

273
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:36,569
It is sweet.

274
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,210
I'm glad we could

275
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,062
have watermelon smoothies

276
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:47,414
together again this year.

277
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:50,165
Last year, I thought

278
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:51,820
we might not be able

279
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:53,525
to drink them together.

280
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:57,968
When it's summer,

281
00:15:57,993 --> 00:15:59,673
I feel like drinking it.

282
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,427
Really?

283
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,030
Let's drink together again.

284
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:05,498
Next year too.

285
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:10,336
I can't be in a relationship with you.

286
00:16:14,477 --> 00:16:15,341
But...

287
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,844
It's because of those moments,

288
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,380
so I'm very happy now.

289
00:16:23,477 --> 00:16:24,383
Yeah.

290
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:26,819
That's right.

291
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:31,609
But watermelon smoothies

292
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:33,314
became traumatic for me.

293
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,661
Yes. I'm sorry.

294
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:38,498
I hope you'll treat me to it

295
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:39,365
next year too.

296
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:40,733
Got it.

297
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,301
I got it!

298
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:04,290
Alright.

299
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,892
It's time to go home.

300
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:06,893
Yes.

301
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:09,944
Shall we have a BBQ

302
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,272
in the backyard for dinner?

303
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,298
That sounds great.

304
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,234
The sea!

305
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:22,441
Come on.

306
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:24,168
Let's hurry up and do some shopping.

307
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:30,816
Alright.

308
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:32,488
First, let's get some meat.

309
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,393
Minato-san,

310
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:42,228
what was that earlier?

311
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:44,001
Huh?

312
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:45,530
If it was embarrassing for you,

313
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:46,675
I'll accept it.

314
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,601
But in your case,

315
00:17:48,922 --> 00:17:51,037
that wasn't the only reason, right?

316
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,540
Do you still feel guilty

317
00:17:54,564 --> 00:17:56,776
about being in a relationship with me?

318
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,512
No, it's not like I just...

319
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,951
I'm already a university student,

320
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,019
even the law allows it.

321
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:11,457
But you still...

322
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:15,394
need acknowledgment
from whom or what?

323
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,965
You

324
00:18:19,424 --> 00:18:21,807
don't understand my feelings at all.

325
00:18:25,118 --> 00:18:26,939
Do you really love me?

326
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:29,675
I chose to be with you...

327
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:31,911
Isn't that enough to understand?

328
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,824
Stop making a fuss.

329
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:35,521
Let's do the shopping already.

330
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,361
Hey, Shin.

331
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:49,883
It's grilled perfectly.

332
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:54,800
Come on. Eat.

333
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,276
Ahhh...

334
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:09,849
How is it?

335
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,720
It's delicious.

336
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:16,022
Right?

337
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:17,423
I'm glad.

338
00:19:24,823 --> 00:19:26,632
What is it?

339
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:28,701
Why are you sighing like that?

340
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,838
Sometimes...

341
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,474
My feelings...

342
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,811
for you sometimes become overwhelming,

343
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,615
I can't help but wonder if being

344
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,660
in a relationship with you

345
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,045
is only a dream.

346
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,154
What are you talking about?

347
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:53,866
It's not a dream, right?

348
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:56,123
Hey.

349
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:02,001
Why are you pinching my cheek?

350
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:15,915
I acted a bit awkward earlier,

351
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:17,516
I'm sorry.

352
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:19,221
Huh?

353
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:23,022
You let go of your hand,

354
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,657
you were conscious of others watching.

355
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:26,862
Even though I want to

356
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:28,567
touch you all the time.

357
00:20:29,137 --> 00:20:30,711
That was not always the case for you.

358
00:20:31,643 --> 00:20:33,479
It depends on the time and situation.

359
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:36,838
Sometimes.

360
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:41,950
I can't understand
Minato-san's thoughts...

361
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,013
Because we're different

362
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,750
so the attraction is stronger.

363
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,690
I have my own thoughts,

364
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:01,260
and you have your own.

365
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:04,997
That's why...

366
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,000
I love Minato-san.

367
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,707
Shin...

368
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,212
You're different from me,

369
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:22,848
so...

370
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,752
we can at least share a bedroom.

371
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:27,820
Yeah.

372
00:21:28,476 --> 00:21:29,555
Alright then.

373
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:34,326
As if that is okay!

374
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,235
No sharing a bedroom!

375
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:39,833
Seriously,

376
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:41,546
I can never let my guard down

377
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:42,571
around you.

378
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,070
If you keep saying that.

379
00:21:45,481 --> 00:21:47,139
I won't grill meat for you.

380
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,308
Minato-san.

381
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:50,910
Please grill the meat for me.

382
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:52,678
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:54,814
Sure.

384
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,848
It's good that you're being honest.

385
00:21:57,703 --> 00:21:58,584
Alright.

386
00:21:59,982 --> 00:22:02,236
Hey, they're all burned!

387
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,322
Ah, I'm sorry!

388
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,623
Go grab a plate.

389
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,766
- I'm off.
- Yeah.

390
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:14,834
Have a safe trip.

391
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:21,440
Minato-san, I forgot something.

392
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,802
Just like newlyweds!

393
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,115
We're not newlyweds!

394
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,139
Hurry up and leave!

395
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,259
I'm leaving.

396
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:51,837
You okay? Anxious?

397
00:22:51,861 --> 00:22:52,838
I'm anxious.

398
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:54,862
It's fine. Don't worry.

399
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:05,417
It's okay.

400
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:10,522
What is it?

401
00:23:13,797 --> 00:23:14,793
We are

402
00:23:14,864 --> 00:23:16,295
dating now.

403
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,397
Really?

404
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:19,678
- Right?
- Yes.

405
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:29,475
Minato Shouji Coin Laundry.

406
00:23:29,607 --> 00:23:30,978
A summer storm is approaching.

407
00:23:31,003 --> 00:23:32,017
Please be cautious.

408
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,251
Please take care of us next week.

409
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:46,719
(Next episode)
Are you aware

410
00:24:46,743 --> 00:24:48,858
of how much I like you, Minato-san?

411
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:49,883
(The increased feeling)
I never thought

412
00:24:49,883 --> 00:24:51,924
I'd have this kind of feeling.

413
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:53,189
(The distant feeling)
Minato-san,

414
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:54,218
why did you come to the

415
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:55,060
university as it suits you?

416
00:24:55,084 --> 00:24:56,462
What is it, Shin?

417
00:24:56,486 --> 00:24:57,997
Acting as if he dislikes me.

418
00:24:58,021 --> 00:24:58,863
Let's go.

419
00:24:58,887 --> 00:24:59,798
Who?
