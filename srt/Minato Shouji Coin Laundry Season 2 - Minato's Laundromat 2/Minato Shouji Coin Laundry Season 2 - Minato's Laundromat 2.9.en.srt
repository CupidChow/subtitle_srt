1
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:09,042
Shin,

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,398
is there anything you

3
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:13,103
want for your birthday?

4
00:00:13,754 --> 00:00:15,015
Well...

5
00:00:16,304 --> 00:00:19,319
If you buy it, it can be anything.

6
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:21,755
Rinse your mouth.

7
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:23,257
Yes.

8
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:29,228
(The cohabitation is until the renovation is complete)

9
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,078
If I can spend my life

10
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:40,836
like this with Minato-san,

11
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:43,544
I don't need any presents.

12
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:48,949
You can't do that.

13
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:51,184
There must be something.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,287
Like...

15
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:56,423
a robot vacuum cleaner

16
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,658
or a massage chair.

17
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:59,575
Those are things you want, right?

18
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,363
Then, what do you want?

19
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:05,365
Nothing.

20
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:06,433
Nothing comes to mind.

21
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:08,135
Except for Minato-san.

22
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:10,103
Listen...

23
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,405
I truly don't mind anything.

24
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:14,757
I'll cherish anything you give me.

25
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,377
I should be going soon.

26
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:21,582
I'm off.

27
00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:23,183
Yeah.

28
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:26,386
Take care.

"Minato Shouji Coin Laundry2"
(Episode 9)

30
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:37,260
(Hanabusa Asuka personal study report)

31
00:02:38,063 --> 00:02:40,527
Please, please, please, please, please!

32
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,415
Everyone,

33
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,066
you've really worked hard up

34
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:05,091
until today!

35
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,785
I know you might be nervous

36
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,043
for tomorrow's match,

37
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:09,809
but give it your all and

38
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:10,959
enjoy it to the fullest!

39
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,125
- Yes!
- Yes!

40
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,261
Coach.

41
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,564
Here.

42
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:19,533
For you!

43
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,300
Huh?

44
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,762
(To Coach Minato, thank you very much)

45
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:26,039
On three!

46
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:28,275
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you very much!

47
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,311
What's with you all...?

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,046
You're being overly dramatic.

49
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:35,949
Don't be shy.

50
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:39,286
No, I'm not!

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,788
Be quiet, you lot!

52
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:43,957
Let's do our best tomorrow, coach!

53
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:44,997
Let's do our best.

54
00:03:44,997 --> 00:03:46,426
- Please cheer for us.
- Go for it.

55
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:50,964
Sakuma-sensei,

56
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:52,932
thanks for your hard work.

57
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:56,303
Akira-kun, thank you for another year!

58
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,137
No,

59
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,138
thank you, too.

60
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,141
This...

61
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:03,150
Thank you so much.

62
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:05,376
You wrote one for me too, right?

63
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:07,380
Of course.

64
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:09,116
Thanks to you,

65
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:11,108
it truly became a fruitful summer

66
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,573
for the students.

67
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,583
I was thinking of

68
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,335
asking you to join us next year

69
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
if possible.

70
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:20,527
Of course.

71
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:23,697
Thank you.

72
00:04:25,888 --> 00:04:27,667
The time spent with you

73
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:30,160
and every second with the students,

74
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:33,347
every moment is precious and invaluable.

75
00:04:34,388 --> 00:04:35,753
If you let your guard down,

76
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:37,497
you might start thinking that the

77
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:39,716
current environment will last forever.

78
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:41,377
But that's not the case.

79
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,453
I got a little sentimental there.

80
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,322
Expressing feelings in words like this,

81
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:54,814
it's really something special.

82
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,558
Akira-kun...?

83
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:04,037
Oh, no.

84
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:05,372
It's nothing!

85
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,145
Shu-kun.

86
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:14,414
Asuka,

87
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:16,716
what's up?

88
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:22,155
Ta-da!

89
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:23,456
Look, look,

90
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:24,591
it's an 'A' grade!

91
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:27,661
Asuka,

92
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:29,675
well done.

93
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:31,031
Right?

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,192
Even when you weren't looking,

95
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:35,052
I was working hard the whole time.

96
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,576
Good job, Asuka.

97
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:49,716
Hey,

98
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:51,518
do you remember?

99
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:53,891
If I got an 'A' grade...

100
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:54,788
Date.

101
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:55,956
Huh?

102
00:05:58,504 --> 00:05:59,559
Where should we go?

103
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:13,773
Minato-san.

104
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,468
Shin!

105
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,648
Minato-san, what are you doing?

106
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,849
Ah, well, um...

107
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,851
Oh, this!

108
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:28,388
Well, you know, it's quite challenging.

109
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,031
By the way, why did you

110
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:33,211
come back so early?

111
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:34,726
Weren't you supposed to

112
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:36,194
visit your house for renovations?

113
00:06:36,218 --> 00:06:37,197
I did go.

114
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:38,565
But today is

115
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,836
your last day as the

116
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:41,242
swimming club's coach,

117
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:43,235
so I cooked a lot and

118
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:44,671
wanted to treat you.

119
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:49,349
Shin.

120
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:03,490
I'm working!

121
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:05,492
Working?

122
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:08,169
Looks like you're just doing

123
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:09,865
a crossword puzzle to me.

124
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,849
Having this kind of knowledge is

125
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:13,279
necessary for smooth communication

126
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:14,495
with customers!

127
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:16,836
It's a respectable job!

128
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:19,839
Is that a kid's excuse? Seriously...

129
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,910
Minato-san,

130
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:25,645
there's a blank space here.

131
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,181
Ah, I don't know this one.

132
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:30,647
It's an 8-letter word

133
00:07:30,671 --> 00:07:31,795
that starts with 'a.'

134
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,256
A four-character idiom

135
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:34,631
about excessive love

136
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,556
and blind devotion.

137
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:38,803
When you love someone so much

138
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:40,186
that even the crow on their roof

139
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,311
becomes endearing.

140
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,396
Let me have it, Minato-san.

141
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:57,252
(Love makes you...)

142
00:07:57,252 --> 00:07:59,959
Love...

143
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:01,214
Yes.

144
00:08:01,636 --> 00:08:02,782
When written in kanji.

145
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:10,358
(Love makes you blind)

146
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,998
Correct!

147
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:20,066
Impressive, Shin!

148
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,002
I...

149
00:08:22,497 --> 00:08:24,871
find all the crows perched at

150
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,406
this laundromat adorable.

151
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:30,043
There aren't any crows perched here.

152
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:33,058
Of course,

153
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:35,573
you're the most adorable to me.

154
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,821
Fine! Alright, I got it!

155
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,889
Let's go home!

156
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:44,824
Come on,

157
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,209
today you're the one cooking dinner!

158
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:49,929
My love is blind.

159
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:56,636
Shut up, Shin!

160
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:58,705
I'm leaving now!

161
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:01,007
Wait up, Minato-san.

162
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:04,885
Shu-kun,

163
00:09:05,114 --> 00:09:05,812
ready?

164
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:07,881
Say cheese!

165
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:10,292
I still have so many places to

166
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,050
show you today, Shu-kun.

167
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:13,720
Look, isn't that it?

168
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:15,440
The roof with tiles that you mentioned,

169
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:16,815
attached to the chimney!

170
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,347
Seeing it with your own eyes

171
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:19,667
important after all.

172
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:20,994
Asuka,

173
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,629
let's take a photo.

174
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:25,146
Sure thing.

175
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:26,533
Can you do it, Shu-kun?

176
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,235
Shu-kun, too close!

177
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:29,800
Say cheese!

178
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:32,972
This is the Ellisman Residence.

179
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:34,599
The architect behind this is

180
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:35,667
Antonin Raymond,

181
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:36,893
often called the father

182
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:38,598
of modern architecture.

183
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:41,461
It's really beautiful.

184
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:43,856
Would you like me

185
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:45,193
to take a photo for you?

186
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:46,820
Oh, yes, please!

187
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:48,481
Say cheese!

188
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:51,591
That's nice,

189
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:53,026
you two look so in love!

190
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,928
Asuka.

191
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:56,796
Here.

192
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:58,098
Thank you.

193
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:01,379
It's nostalgic to stroll

194
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:03,051
and eat like this.

195
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:04,304
Yeah.

196
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,113
It's like when we used to

197
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,676
travel together, Asuka.

198
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:13,913
Thank you for today.

199
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:17,225
I had a really great time on

200
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:19,069
this date with you, Shu-kun.

201
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:20,186
Seriously!

202
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:30,430
Likewise.

203
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,598
Huh?

204
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:34,719
Traveling to various places

205
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:35,767
with you, Asuka,

206
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:37,070
was enjoyable.

207
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,073
Thank you.

208
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:42,809
Shu-kun...

209
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,291
What are you looking at?

210
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,783
Could it be... are you embarrassed?

211
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,399
I'm not embarrassed.

212
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:54,854
Oh, sorry, sorry.

213
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,657
By the way,

214
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,993
how about another date sometime?

215
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,698
A date plan to make Shu-kun happy,

216
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:07,901
I'll come up with something perfect.

217
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:09,435
Yeah.

218
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:12,605
Sure.

219
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,275
Alright!

220
00:11:15,443 --> 00:11:17,143
It's a promise, Shu-kun.

221
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:18,751
You absolutely won't forget, right?

222
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:20,079
I got it.

223
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:23,116
Well,

224
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:25,118
if your grades drop,

225
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:26,553
the date is off.

226
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:28,588
No way. We're going on that date!

227
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:29,822
Well then, I'm off.

228
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,324
Sure. Take care.

229
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,097
Now then...

230
00:11:42,831 --> 00:11:44,391
...and X will be greater than

231
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,297
one and a half plus three.

232
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,075
Find the common elements...

233
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:51,580
Hello.

234
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,412
Hello.

235
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,090
Good work, Shin.

236
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,025
I've got a little something to do today.

237
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:08,061
I'll be home late,

238
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:09,929
go ahead and have dinner on your own.

239
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:18,638
You're home.

240
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:28,414
Huh?

241
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:30,896
(Shin, happy birthday)

242
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:31,784
Shin,

243
00:12:32,147 --> 00:12:34,147
happy birthday!

244
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:36,389
Minato-san!

245
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,658
Surprise comeback!

246
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:40,772
I lied about coming home late.

247
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:41,728
Really...

248
00:12:45,707 --> 00:12:47,000
Thank you.

249
00:12:47,255 --> 00:12:49,035
Did you prepare all this?

250
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:50,670
Yep.

251
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,237
(Happy birthday, Shin)

252
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,559
Happy birthday!

253
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,706
Thank you.

254
00:12:58,124 --> 00:12:58,945
Come on,

255
00:12:59,094 --> 00:12:59,879
dig in!

256
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:02,475
Wow!

257
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:03,249
Mmm!

258
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:04,384
Delicious!

259
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:06,819
Mmm!

260
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:25,147
(Shin, happy birthday)

261
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,500
Here.

262
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,141
Open wide!

263
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:34,879
I'm so happy to be celebrated

264
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:35,948
by you like this.

265
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:38,584
So,

266
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:40,528
there's still this.

267
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:43,423
Huh?

268
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:45,458
Thank you.

269
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:49,696
A bracelet?

270
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:56,469
Ah!

271
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,666
(Minato Akira & Katsuki Shintaro)

272
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,341
Ta-da!

273
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:04,043
Matching...

274
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:05,910
Remember when

275
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:07,513
we were at the hot springs,

276
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,148
you mentioned wanting matching items?

277
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:10,816
I've always wanted

278
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:11,834
this kind of thing.

279
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:13,019
If we're matching,

280
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:14,551
it's better to have something

281
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:15,730
we can keep wearing.

282
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:20,093
Let me see.

283
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:32,271
It fits perfectly.

284
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:33,699
Of course.

285
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,774
I've grabbed your wrist many times,

286
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,828
evading your attacks.

287
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:42,181
I've got it down perfectly.

288
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,051
All that persistent attacking paid off.

289
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:46,419
Why are you so smug?

290
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,554
Well, anyway...

291
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:51,202
Make sure you wear it all the time,

292
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:52,726
Shintaro-kun.

293
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:54,327
Okay.

294
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:09,342
What are you doing...

295
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:14,680
hurry...

296
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,151
Hold me tight.

297
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,249
I can't do it!

298
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:51,645
It's impossible!

299
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:53,820
Hey, don't run away.

300
00:15:54,142 --> 00:15:56,456
You've looked at me like this,

301
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,070
I won't let go until we meet

302
00:15:58,095 --> 00:15:59,775
each other's eyes again.

303
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,695
If you were to say

304
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:04,660
you like me or love me, which is it?

305
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:07,900
You...

306
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,001
Can't say?

307
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:11,604
We're not at work anymore,

308
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:13,239
it's just the two of us,

309
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:15,341
and it's my birthday too.

310
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:19,345
That is...

311
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,281
L

312
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:24,884
OV

313
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:27,186
E

314
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,722
- Okay?
- Hm?

315
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:31,357
One more time, please?

316
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,659
I said I...

317
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,795
LO

318
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:41,234
VE

319
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:42,101
Huh?

320
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:46,172
You're doing this on purpose, you idiot!

321
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,774
Wait, Minato-san!

322
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:53,881
I said I love you, didn't I?

323
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:56,415
And it's

324
00:16:56,524 --> 00:16:58,351
not like it's easy on my side either!

325
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:00,152
Since we became a couple...

326
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:02,522
day by day,

327
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,190
it's getting worse...

328
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,562
I can't even look you

329
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:07,796
in the eyes properly,

330
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,396
and even now...

331
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,167
it's so intense that I can't breathe...

332
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,271
So intense that you can't breathe?

333
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,380
I almost...

334
00:17:28,518 --> 00:17:29,849
cannot breathe...

335
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:34,053
that's how much

336
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,188
I love you.

337
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:46,899
Minato-san,

338
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,636
every time you looked away from me,

339
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,422
you were thinking that

340
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,530
you liked me, right?

341
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,142
Yeah, that's right!

342
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:58,344
Even though

343
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:00,546
I'm older, I still felt pathetic!

344
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,433
I never even managed

345
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:05,718
to give you the letter...

346
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:06,485
Huh?

347
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:11,357
But still!

348
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:13,759
Even so...

349
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,229
I do

350
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:20,166
like you a lot.

351
00:18:25,513 --> 00:18:27,139
When you say things like that...

352
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:31,210
it's hard for me too, you know.

353
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,380
I don't want to be away

354
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:37,552
from you, Minato-san.

355
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,387
I want to be together more...

356
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:41,554
I want to say

357
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,198
'good morning' first thing

358
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,107
when we wake up.

359
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,525
I want to say

360
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:48,425
'welcome back' first thing

361
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,490
when you come home.

362
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:52,965
Shin.

363
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:58,671
Minato-san, please.

364
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:01,407
I'm greedy,

365
00:19:03,134 --> 00:19:05,077
so I want one more present.

366
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:09,415
From now on,

367
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,419
could you continue living with me?

368
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,893
Sure.

369
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:23,929
That's right, isn't it?

370
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:25,564
It's impossible, right...

371
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:27,667
Huh?

372
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,870
Actually, I...

373
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,773
was thinking of saying the same thing.

374
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:42,682
What's with that?

375
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,717
Can't you say something?

376
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:46,719
I...

377
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:48,954
in this world right now...

378
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,523
no,

379
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:52,397
in the entire universe,

380
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:54,194
I've become the happiest living being.

381
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,768
You really are as overly dramatic

382
00:19:58,804 --> 00:19:59,804
as ever.

383
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:01,000
Idiot.

384
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:30,863
I won't

385
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,432
forget today's events, Minato-san.

386
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:35,735
Yeah, yeah,

387
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:37,737
I get it.

388
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,554
I'm going to bed first!

389

Thank goodness...

Are you okay?

Does it hurt anywhere?

I'm sorry.

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,295
I do.

428
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,496
I like him a lot.
