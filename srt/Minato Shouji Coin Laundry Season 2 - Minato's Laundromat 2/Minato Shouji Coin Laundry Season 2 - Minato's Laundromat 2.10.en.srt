00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:02,496
Excuse me,

3
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:05,332
who are you?

4
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,042
Huh?

5
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,604
Wait, Shin. What are you saying?

6
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:12,039
Shin!

7
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:13,807
They say you fell down the stairs.

8
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:14,641
Yeah,

9
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:16,546
but it's not that serious.

10
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,178
Shintaro, are you okay?

11
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:19,012
Yes.

12
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:23,216
Hey, Shin,

13
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:28,000
do you really not remember Minato-san?

14
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,593
Um...

15
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:37,236
Have we met somewhere before?

16
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:53,246
Um,

17
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,116
it seems that hitting your head

18
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:59,386
can cause you to lose specific memories.

19
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:02,322
They want to monitor him for a while.

20
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:05,128
Why did Shin forget only

21
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:06,433
about Akira-san?

22
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:10,597
I really don't get it...

23
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,735
Hey, Akira-san,

24
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,594
what if you kiss him? Will that help?

25
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,372
Calm down, Asuka.

26
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:22,843
Everyone,

27
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:27,781
about Shin and me...

28
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,717
Please keep it a secret from him.

29
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:32,649
Huh?

30
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:35,355
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,157
Think about it from Shin's perspective.

32
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:39,675
If he's told that he has a lover

33
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,964
he doesn't remember,

34
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:42,629
it will only confuse him more, right?

35
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,904
Until Shin's memory returns!

36
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,977
If someone asks about me...

37
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:57,377
say I'm the friendly owner of

38
00:02:57,651 --> 00:02:59,246
a nearby laundromat.

39
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:04,779
And I was like a really kind

40
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:06,710
older brother figure.

41
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:12,125
Minato-san...

42
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,262
No, no,

43
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:17,030
don't make those faces!

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,398
Anyway,

45
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,186
the most important thing is

46
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:21,405
that Shin is safe, right?

47
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:53,429
(Shin, happy birthday)

48
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,079
This is Shin's belonging.

49
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,181
What should we do with it?

50
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:11,418
I'll take care of it.

51
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:14,387
If his memory returns,

52
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:17,023
I'll give it back to him.

53
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,147
Alright!

54
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,086
Hey, Shin.

55
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:47,354
Good morning.

56
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:51,691
How are you feeling?

57
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,660
I'm fine.

58
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:55,996
That's good.

59
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,072
Oh, right! I brought this for you.

60
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,942
The latest issue of weekly comic,

61
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:10,487
I thought you might get bored

62
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:11,380
during your stay,

63
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:12,995
so read this and cheer up.

64
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:15,048
Thank you.

65
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:22,455
Oh,

66
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,990
and your change of clothes!

67
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:26,159
I brought three days' worth for now.

68
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,272
If your hospital stay gets extended,

69
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:29,568
I'll bring more.

70
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:34,668
Well then,

71
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:36,303
I'll go.

72
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:39,372
Um...

73
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:44,885
We...

74
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,448
lived together, right?

75
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:58,237
We lived together, but it was

76
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:02,729
just roommates.

77
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:04,030
Roommates?

78
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:05,465
Yeah!

79
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,901
Your family was renovating your house,

80
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:10,337
so I let you use one of my empty rooms.

81
00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:12,405
It was only during the renovation...

82
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,311
Oh, that's why...

83
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,902
Your house is done with

84
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,050
the renovation now,

85
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,552
so, you can go back home

86
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:27,320
after you're discharged.

87
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,344
I understand.

88
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,191
Alright...

89
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:34,327
Listen to the doctor

90
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:35,929
and be a good boy!

91
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:47,073
Hey, Shin.

92
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:48,308
This is

93
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:52,078
the pillow you used.

94
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:53,546
Hey, Shin.

95
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:55,715
I know you don't like sweets,

96
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,985
so I got some rice crackers for today.

97
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:00,720
Hey, Shin.

98
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,722
It's pretty hot today too.

99
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,058
Make sure to wipe off that sweat.

100
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:06,426
Look,

101
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,229
aren't these towels cute?

102
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:10,964
Yes.

(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

104
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,049
Hello?

105
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:30,717
Minato-san,

106
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,119
Shin is going to be discharged tomorrow.

107
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,122
I see.

108
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,625
That's good.

109
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:41,261
Minato-san,

110
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:43,496
are you okay?

111
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:44,597
Huh?

112
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:46,232
Oh,

113
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:48,201
I'm fine.

114
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,805
There's nothing

115
00:07:52,109 --> 00:07:54,174
I can do about it, you know...

116
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,044
When Shin's memory returns,

117
00:07:58,302 --> 00:07:59,746
I'll go pick him up right away.

118
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,282
So, Sakurako-chan,

119
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:04,084
please take care of Shin

120
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:05,952
until then.

121
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:07,887
I understand.

122
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:37,097
(The cohabitation is until

123
00:08:37,122 --> 00:08:38,606
the renovation is complete)

00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:05,745
Good morning.

126
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,313
Yeah.

127

Hey!

128
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,251
What are you doing?

129
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,420
You have a nice smile.

130
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:27,046
Shin,

131
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:28,974
Minato-san sent some stuff for you.

132
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:30,599
It's in your room.

133
00:09:30,794 --> 00:09:32,338
I see. Thank you.

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,504
- One watermelon shake, please.
- Certainly.

137
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:38,438
I'm glad.

Oh! Akira-kun, hello.

140
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:47,380
Um,

141
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:49,420
is this a good time?

142
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,351
Yes, of course.

143
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,457
Uh, actually,

144
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:59,408
make that two watermelon shakes, please.

(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

146
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,310
Shintaro-kun,

147
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:18,741
you still haven't regained

148
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:19,886
your memories?

149
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:21,663
Yeah...

150
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:25,051
Akira-kun,

151
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:27,520
are you okay?

152
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,122
Yes,

153
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,890
I'm perfectly.

154
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,735
Fine...

155
00:11:43,218 --> 00:11:44,270
Not fine,

156
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,841
to be honest.

157
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,513
I realize now just how significant

158
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,716
his presence was in my life.

159
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,224
I think that for Shintaro-kun,

160
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:08,127
your presence was the most significant.

161
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,298
Maybe.

162
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:15,240
It's just that

163
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,637
I'm the only one who forgot him.

164
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:25,311
Memories of someone important

165
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,839
should be stored safely

166
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,544
in a precious drawer.

167
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,619
Right now, it's just that

168
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:35,521
the drawer seems to be locked.

169
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:42,595
Akira-kun,

170
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:45,148
please keep holding on to hope.

171
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:47,200
I believe your feelings

172
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,969
will reach Shintaro-kun.

173
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:07,754
Sakuma-sensei!

174
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:12,058
Oh, Shintaro-kun. Hello.

175
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:12,992
Hello.

176
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:15,662
Sensei,

177
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:19,283
what's your relationship

178
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:20,588
with Minato-san?

179
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:21,934
Huh?

180
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:22,735
Well,

181
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,672
you were talking so friendly earlier.

182
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:28,637
I was just wondering

183
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,710
what you think of Minato-san.

184
00:13:34,443 --> 00:13:35,615
I've been

185
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,650
asked that question before.

186
00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:38,484
Oh?

187
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,172
Akira-kun is a remarkable student,

188
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,006
you know.

189
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,356
He was, he is,

190
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:44,791
and he always will be.

191
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:51,464
Why did I

192
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,233
ask this question before?

193
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:56,257
Umm...

194
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:57,770
I don't know.

195
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:01,841
But

196
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:04,610
the Shintaro-kun I know

197
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:07,780
has always talked about Akira-kun.

198
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,083
Sometimes with excitement,

199
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:13,419
and sometimes with a grumpy face.

200
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,834
(To Minato-san, )

201
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:52,058
To Minato-san,

202
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:53,575
thank you for taking care of me

203
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:54,690
during my hospitalization.

204
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:55,964
As a token of my gratitude,

205
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,818
I baked cookies.

206
00:14:56,842 --> 00:14:58,403
Please enjoy them.

207
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,120
They're sweet.

208
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:36,602
Shintaro,

209
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,620
are you okay?

210
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:39,040
Are you pushing yourself too hard?

211
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:40,662
I'm fine. Really.

212
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,941
Okay,

213
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:43,596
but it hasn't been long since

214
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,924
you were discharged.

215
00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:46,245
Don't overexert yourself.

216
00:15:46,691 --> 00:15:47,513
Yes.

217
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,054
By the way,

218
00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:58,090
do you know why I

219
00:15:58,216 --> 00:15:59,699
started working part-time?

220
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:00,960
Huh?

221
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:02,428
I

222
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:05,031
remember that I started working in May,

223
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:07,567
but I can't recall why I decided

224
00:16:07,793 --> 00:16:09,368
to take on a part-time job.

225
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,605
Well...

226
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:14,373
Do you know something?

227
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:19,545
I don't know.

228
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,569
That's a suspicious look on your face.

229
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:22,915
Tell me!

230
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,391
Hey, Shu-san, wait!

231
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:35,561
Shu-san, wait up!

232
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:36,896
Hey, Shin!

233
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:39,099
Asuka, what's going on?

234
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:41,133
Shu-kun, thanks for your hard work.

235
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,170
I came today to talk to Shin.

236
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,471
Me?

237
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,439
Yeah.

238
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:48,341
I heard from Sakurako-chan.

239
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,009
Why

240
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:52,111
did you go back to your parents' house?

241
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:53,312
Huh?

242
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,781
Why did you leave Akira-san's place?

243
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,049
Well,

244
00:16:57,729 --> 00:16:59,775
my parents' house finished renovations,

245
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:00,286
so I...

246
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,420
That's not it!

247
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:03,623
- You and Akira-san...
- Asuka.

248
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:05,091
Shu-kun.

249
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:07,493
But...

250
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,529
Let's go.

251
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,298
Wait, Shu-kun.

252
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:17,803
Wait a minute!

253
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,272
We shouldn't be the ones to say it.

254
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:20,306
But...

255
00:17:20,478 --> 00:17:22,478
It's Akira-kun's decision.

256
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:27,480
Shu-kun,

257
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:30,049
what if, let's say,

258
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:31,754
I forgot about you...

259
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,288
What would you do?

260
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:46,866
Oh! Fried horse mackerel tonight?

261
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,925
Want to taste some, Sakurako?

262
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:49,835
Yeah.

263
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:54,307
Here you go!

264
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:56,709
How is it?

265
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:57,710
Delicious.

266
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,211
I'm glad you like it.

267
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,232
Hey, why don't you take some

268
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:04,472
to Minato-san?

269
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:06,018
Why?

270
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,791
Well, I just thought I'd suggest it...

271
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:13,125
Okay.

272
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:24,971
Asuka-san,

273
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:27,607
I've had enough...

274
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:48,728
Akira-san!

275
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,729
Minato-san!

276
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:51,564
What are you doing here at this hour?

277
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:58,371
It's about time you told Shin the truth!

278
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:00,206
Minato-san! Please!

279
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,005
Shin doesn't dislike you anymore,

280
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,732
he's not the same Shin anymore!

281
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,184
Hey, Akira-san!

282
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,191
Don't run away!

283
00:19:19,832 --> 00:19:21,193
I'm not running away!

284
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,865
I'm just worried about Shin!

285
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,768
! I don't want to hurt him

286
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:31,003
or make him suffer...

287
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:34,940
Besides, you know,

288
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:36,842
he just got out of the hospital.

289
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,446
A college student

290
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:43,282
dating a guy in his thirties,

291
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:45,918
he'd be shocked, right?

292
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,988
I mean, it's not something

293
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:51,624
he'd expect.

294
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,831
So you keep making excuses,

295
00:19:59,112 --> 00:20:00,366
isn't it just because you

296
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,155
don't want to get hurt yourself?

297
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,373
If you love him, just say you love him!

298
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:10,576
Is Akira-san's feeling that fragile?

299
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:13,646
Minato-san,

300
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,182
do you

301
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:17,917
not like Shin?

302
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:28,368
I do like him.

303
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:33,365
I love him!

304
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,502
I can't do without him!

305
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:39,972
I really...

306
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:44,343
I want him to remember!

307
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,613
I want him to

308
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:52,818
say 'I like you, Minato-san!'

309
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:55,721
and smile like before!

310
00:20:58,947 --> 00:21:00,025
Akira-san...

311
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:01,427
Minato-san...

312
00:21:06,988 --> 00:21:08,501
I messed up...

313
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,338
I said things in the heat of the moment.

314
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,341
Asuka, Sakurako,

315
00:21:15,513 --> 00:21:16,675
forget about it.

316
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,479
It's not the time to be saying that!

317
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:22,581
Enough already!

318
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,949
Oh, I know.

319
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:25,851
We're going on a date together!

320
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,222
Date?

321
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:36,160
(Amusement Park)

322
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,866
Today, let's make Shin remember,

323
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:42,134
Akira-san.

324
00:21:43,225 --> 00:21:44,103
Yeah.

325
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,721
I'm absolutely going to make him

326
00:21:46,746 --> 00:21:47,746
remember me!

327
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:50,543
Sakurako!

328
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:53,078
Minato-san,

329
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,648
this is my boyfriend, Tachibana Kenta.

330
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,017
I'm Kenta Tachibana! Nice to meet you!

331
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,452
You're really energetic!

332
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:02,354
Well then, nice to meet you,

333
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:03,722
I'm Minato Akira.

334
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:04,924
Let's get along.

335
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:08,661
Shu-kun.

336
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,344
Now that we're all here...

337
00:22:26,948 --> 00:22:28,502
Oh, Tachibana-kun,

338
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,677
I'd like to see the souvenirs first!

339
00:22:30,702 --> 00:22:31,821
Huh, but...

340
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,180
Oh, Shu-kun,

341
00:22:33,205 --> 00:22:34,800
do you want to go to that tower?

342
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:38,057
So, let's meet here at four PM.

343
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,258
Disperse!

344
00:22:39,865 --> 00:22:40,826
- What?
- Huh?

345
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,850
Impress Shin and make sure

346
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,555
he remembers, Akira-san!

347
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,401
Let's go, Shu-kun.

348
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,206
Wait a minute.

349
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:58,944
They

350
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,081
said they'll take care of everything,

351
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:03,700
but aren't they just trying

352
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,247
to go on a date themselves?

353
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,020
Minato-san.

354
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:14,660
Minato-san...

355
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:16,485
What should we do now?

356
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:19,732
Oh.

357
00:23:19,935 --> 00:23:21,233
Right...

358
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:23,695
Umm...

359
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,739
Minato Shouji Coin Laundry.

360
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:29,409
In this season when sweat won't stop,

361
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:31,434
even in front of the person you like

362
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:34,213
We'll be in your care next week as well.

363
00:24:45,002 --> 00:24:45,581
(Next episode)

364
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:46,798
(Two couples full of feelings)
I have to go on a date Shin

365
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:48,675
(Two couples full of feelings)
and remind him of our relationship.

366
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:50,456
I like your face when you smile.

367
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:53,325
I don't want Asuka to forget about me.

368
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,467
(The closer distance between them)
Please remember

369
00:24:54,714 --> 00:24:56,664
everything that happened with you.

370
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:58,055
Our relationship,

371
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,798
just how deep is it?
