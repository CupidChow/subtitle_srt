1
00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:01,602
Minato-san,

2
00:00:01,804 --> 00:00:03,370
please live with me.

3
00:00:05,594 --> 00:00:07,015
Please let me live in your room

4
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:08,232
starting today.

5
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:10,967
Huh?

6
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:13,547
What does this mean?

7
00:00:13,795 --> 00:00:14,994
What was that about having

8
00:00:15,018 --> 00:00:16,486
no place to go back to?

9
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:19,119
While my house is being renovated,

10
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:21,622
my family will temporarily move.

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,401
We're moving to a new apartment

12
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:24,634
but it's cramped.

13
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,399
We don't even have our own rooms,

14
00:00:26,424 --> 00:00:28,262
and we're a big family, so...

15
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:30,797
So that's how it is.

16
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,101
No!

17
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:36,637
Why would you choose to live with me?

18
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,667
Even if you're okay, but your family...

19
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,475
All of them approved.

20
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:42,876
Huh?

21
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:43,977
Here.

22
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:45,612
A letter from my mother.

23
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:58,918
(Dear Minato Akira)

24
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:01,828
I've told her about you

25
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:03,864
since the first day we dated.

26
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:05,065
I've also mentioned

27
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:06,854
that you saved me when I was drowning,

28
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:08,245
back when I was young.

29
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:10,635
The renovation will be

30
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:12,248
completed by this summer.

31
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,473
I beg you.

32
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,809
Please keep me by your side.

33
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:19,844
"Minato's Laundromat2"

34
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,584
(Minato)

35
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:32,024
Excuse me.

36
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:33,787
Wait!

37
00:02:42,014 --> 00:02:43,163
You'll stay here.

38
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:44,731
The next room?

39
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,768
Why can't I stay in the same room as you?

40
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,635
No!

41
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:51,004
Even if you got permission,

42
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:52,264
we've only been dating

43
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:53,729
for a short while.

44
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:55,375
Living together

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,044
is 10 years too early!

46
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:58,826
We've had mutual feelings

47
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:00,013
for over 10 years.

48
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:01,383
Go to bed quickly.

49
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:02,616
You have to get up early.

50
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,784
Goodnight.

51
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,121
Today's breakfast can

52
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:27,457
be Japanese food, right?

53
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:29,251
Shin,

54
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:30,877
you see,

55
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,647
why would you bother...

56
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,671
It's fine.

57
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:37,484
Whether it's for one person or two,

58
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,219
it's all the same.

59
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,858
Bon appetit.

60
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,567
How is it?

61
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,670
It's delicious.

62
00:03:57,724 --> 00:03:58,872
I'm glad.

63
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:13,253
Idiot!

64
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:15,355
Focus on your own meal!

65
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:18,367
It's because you keep looking away.

66
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:22,963
Bon appetit.

67
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,123
Well then, I'm off.

68
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,705
Yeah.

69
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:34,040
Oh, and Minato-san,

70
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,075
Can I...

71
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:36,510
What?

72
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:37,511
The spare key.

73
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:40,243
Don't just casually

74
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,481
mention it like that.

75
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:42,634
If I have a spare key,

76
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,597
I can prepare breakfast for you,

77
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:46,820
you can sleep in a little longer.

78
00:04:47,124 --> 00:04:48,488
Oh, I see...

79
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:51,758
Wait a minute! No!

80
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:52,993
Listen up!

81
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,842
They said three years for

82
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:55,942
peaches and chestnuts,

83
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:57,144
eight years for spare keys.

84
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:58,178
It's not something

85
00:04:58,203 --> 00:04:59,883
I can easily give you.

86
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,403
Well, it's not like that.

87
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,821
Go on, hurry!

88
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,056
Alright.

89
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:13,747
This is not good,

90
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,283
this is completely Shin's pace...

91
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,554
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

92
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,630
How is it?

93
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:32,933
It's delicious.

94
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,801
Don't make me say it so many times.

95
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:39,339
Do you intend to

96
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,508
have a meal together everyday?

97
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,413
I'm not done!

98
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:47,848
The spare key, please.

99
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,283
No.

100
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:01,394
Please open the door, Minato-san.

101
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,944
If I sleep alone, I'll have bad dreams.

102
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:05,565
Are you a child?

103
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,934
Go back and sleep alone!

104
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:10,003
Then the spare key, please.

105
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:11,996
No way!

106
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,779
This is terrible.

107
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,281
If it's like this

108
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:22,585
it's meaningless to be

109
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:24,129
in separate rooms.

110
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:28,003
Minato-san,

111
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,590
lately, you haven't been looking at me.

112
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:33,500
That's not true at all.

113
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:36,930
Is there something you're hiding?

114
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:39,332
I'm not hiding anything!

115
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:41,134
Oh, really?

116
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:44,571
There's no way I could say it...

117
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:47,507
I'm off.

118
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,443
I love Shin too much

119
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,678
to look into his eyes.

120
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:55,949
There's no way

121
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:58,251
I could say something like that!

122
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:03,957
Ugh!

123
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:08,962
Draw three connected points.

124
00:07:09,164 --> 00:07:10,864
Four is less than or equal to A,

125
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,732
so the result is less than 13.

126
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,088
Well, that's all for today.

127
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:17,270
Thank you, everyone.

128
00:07:17,547 --> 00:07:19,205
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

129
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:23,276
Yeah.

130
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,613
How's your mock exam preparations?

131
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,184
Do what you need to first,

132
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:32,950
that should benefit you more

133
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:34,575
than speaking to me.

134
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:36,852
I'm cheering for you.

135
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,392
Yeah.

136
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,696
I'll hang up then...

137
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:51,571
Are you already used to the job?

138
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:52,981
Yes.

139
00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:58,077
You're in a relationship

140
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,782
with Hanabusa, right?

141
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:01,881
Yeah,

142
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:03,616
something like that.

143
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:06,052
Something like that?

144
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:08,555
We stay in touch as often as possible.

145
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:10,940
When we have free time,

146
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:12,667
we usually spend time together.

147
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,129
A relationship is like that, isn't it?

148
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:18,631
I think

149
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:20,867
it varies for each person.

150
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:23,636
You're right.

151
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,357
Minato-san.

152
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:45,925
Welcome back, Shin.

153
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:47,394
What are you doing?

154
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:49,162
It's almost Tanabata.

155
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,229
This year, I thought everyone

156
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:52,971
could write their wishes.

157
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:54,868
Do you want to write?

158
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:55,702
Yes.

159
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,323
Here you go.

160
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:00,432
Thank you.

161
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,786
Here you go.

162
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,667
Let me see.

163
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:18,804
(Wishing that Minato-san will
say he loves me - Katsuki Shintaro)

164
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:22,054
(Wishing that Minato-san will
give me the key - Katsuki Shintaro)

165
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:25,151
Like hell I'm going

166
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,840
to display this outside!

167
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,068
Give it here!

168
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:29,135
Why?

169
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,281
There's no reason.

170
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:31,873
It's fine. Just hang it.

171
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:34,040
You two are so annoyingly lovey-dovey!

172
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:35,775
Hanabusa is here?

173
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,111
I've been studying inside all this time.

174
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,714
He says he can't concentrate at home.

175
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,185
Want to write too?

176
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:46,219
Huh?

177
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:50,223
Tanabata is coming up soon.

178
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:59,065
(Hope I can achieve an A grade in the
upcoming mock exam - Hanabusa Asuka)

179
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,300
Wow, Asuka.

180
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,069
That's a good specific wish.

181
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,737
Well, you know...

182
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:07,245
Hey, Shu-kun.

183
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,110
Huh?

184
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,977
Let's go on a date next time.

185
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,247
Sure.

186
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:16,049
Huh?

187
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,917
Seriously?!

188
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:19,319
In exchange for

189
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:21,821
the result of the next mock exam.

190
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:23,323
You must achieve an A grade.

191
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:28,194
The truth is it's a secret.

192
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:29,462
Huh?

193
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:30,930
Did you say something?

194
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:33,466
Let me hang it first.

195
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,522
Good night.

196
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:42,609
Good night.

197
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:51,173
Shin.

198
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,254
I don't need breakfast tomorrow.

199
00:10:54,582 --> 00:10:55,698
Go ahead and eat alone.

200
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,655
Why?

201
00:10:58,165 --> 00:10:59,225
Could it be...

202
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:01,042
you've grown to dislike my cooking?

203
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,762
Idiot, that's not it.

204
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,964
I have to wake up early and

205
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:06,824
attend the neighborhood meeting.

206
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:08,434
I see.

207
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:09,869
What a relief.

208
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:13,439
As a substitute,

209
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:16,943
tomorrow's dinner,

210
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,930
I'll take care of the preparations.

211
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:21,014
- Huh?
- I mean...

212
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:23,183
You've been the one to cook every time.

213
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:25,018
Once in a while, let me do it.

214
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:27,312
You said you liked them, right?

215
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:28,354
Hamburgers.

216
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:32,158
Minato-san...

217
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,527
Look forward to it when you return.

218
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:37,462
Good night.

219
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,300
Good night, Minato-san.

220
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:00,771
(Wishing that Minato-san will
say he loves me - Katsuki Shintaro)

221
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:01,307
Shin...

222
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:03,016
(Wishing that Minato-san will
give me the key - Katsuki Shintaro)

223
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:20,340
Thanks for your hard work.

224
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,841
Thanks for your hard work.

225
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,467
I thought that I would fall.

226
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:48,901
How heavy.

227
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:51,037
- Would you like my help?
- It's fine.

228
00:12:52,582 --> 00:12:53,399
Are you okay?

229
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:54,774
- Oh.
- I'll help.

230
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,242
- Really?
- I'll leave it to you.

231
00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:58,266
- Thank you.
- Yes.

232
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:10,223
Alright, this should be good.

233
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:17,864
Shin, welcome back.

234
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:21,060
Akira.

235
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:22,635
Akira-chan.

236
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:24,470
Grandpa!

237
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:25,638
Grandma!

238
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:28,274
Shintaro-kun is such a good child!

239
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,144
What's going on?

240
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:34,574
Geez.

241
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:36,713
It was really helpful, thank you!

242
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:39,221
We received a box full of vegetables.

243
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:41,421
I was wondering what to do with them.

244
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,722
- Right?
- Yes!

245
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:44,857
I was so happy when Shintaro-kun

246
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:45,899
offered to help!

247
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:47,229
I was surprised

248
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:48,991
when I heard that Shintaro-kun

249
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:50,687
is your close friend.

250
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:54,834
Is that so?

251
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:56,882
I'm glad I got to meet

252
00:13:56,913 --> 00:13:58,647
Minato-san's grandparents.

253
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,203
Akira-chan,

254
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:02,569
you're lucky to meet

255
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:04,327
such a wonderful person.

256
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,455
Yeah.

257
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,214
By the way today,

258
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,851
I have something to discuss with you.

259
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:11,780
Discuss?

260
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,653
Actually...

261
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:15,030
It's about the demolition

262
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,811
of this apartment.

263
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,925
Demolition?

264
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:21,661
Yes, this place has become quite old.

265
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,663
We've decided to rebuild

266
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:25,960
with a new building.

267
00:14:26,462 --> 00:14:27,667
Don't worry.

268
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:28,936
We've already prepared

269
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:30,828
a place for you, Akira-chan.

270
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:33,439
As for Shintaro-kun's place,

271
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:35,588
if you are fine with it,

272
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:37,357
why don't the both of
you live there together?

273
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:38,311
Understood!

274
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:39,740
Huh?

275
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,548
I'm glad!

276
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,100
It's a spacious house,

277
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:45,551
so feel free to use it.

278
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:47,379
Hold on a moment...

279
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:49,655
By the way, Akira,

280
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,231
when did you become good at cooking?

281
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,761
It's really delicious, yes?

282
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:56,971
- It's really delicious!
- It's really delicious!

283
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:58,598
Grandpa, wait...

284
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,674
Minato-san.

285
00:15:09,495 --> 00:15:10,698
Am I really allowed

286
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:12,979
to live here too?

287
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,681
It can't be helped.

288
00:15:16,056 --> 00:15:17,249
They say the apartment

289
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:18,671
is going to be demolished.

290
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:22,681
But it's only for this summer.

291
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:26,125
Yes. Thank you so much.

292
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:31,931
Here.

293
00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:46,045
Is this the place?

294
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:47,547
Yeah.

295
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:50,249
Grandpa and Grandma lived here before.

296
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,919
It's such a lovely house.

297
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,456
It's perfect for our life cohabitating.

298
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,125
It's room-sharing!

299
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,660
You're just a lodger!

300
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:02,128
It's not cohabitation!

301
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,964
It's the same, isn't it?

302
00:16:11,152 --> 00:16:12,421
Excuse me.

303
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,513
This is Shin's room.

304
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:22,215
Thank you very much.

305
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:49,942
Is this Minato-san's room?

306
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:51,344
Yeah.

307
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:17,737
Shin,

308
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:21,040
since we're staying together,

309
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:23,587
I have something to tell you.

310
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:27,970
Yes.

311
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:32,518
Sit there and listen carefully.

312
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:33,619
Yes.

313
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:37,089
Firstly,

314
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:39,358
I have allowed you,

315
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:41,327
Katsuki Shintaro, to live here.

316
00:17:41,592 --> 00:17:43,729
Yes, thank you.

317
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:44,931
With the condition...

318
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:47,166
(The cohabitation is until
the renovation is complete)

319
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,234
that it ends

320
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,803
when your house renovation is finished.

321
00:17:50,896 --> 00:17:52,605
Yes, understood.

322
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:53,318
(The cohabitation is until
the renovation is complete)

323
00:17:53,343 --> 00:17:54,373
And also...

324
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,097
I also want to establish

325
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:57,839
some rules for our life together.

326
00:17:58,964 --> 00:18:00,112
Rule one.

327
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,591
(House chores will be divided)

328
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,783
House chores will be divided.

329
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:06,018
Yes. House chores will be divided.

330
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:06,852
(House chores will be divided)

331
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:07,820
Rule two.

332
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:10,523
(Notify in case of being late)

333
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,224
Notify in case of being late.

334
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:13,159
Yes.

335
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:14,927
Notify in case of being late.

336
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:15,559
(Notify in case of being late)

337
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:16,495
Rule three.

338
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:20,538
(Separate bedrooms)

339
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:21,867
Separate bedrooms.

340
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:23,502
Huh?

341
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:24,370
That's it.

342
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:25,801
The three rules...

343
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:26,659
I object!

344
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:28,574
I'm not a kid anymore!

345
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:30,676
I also object!

346
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:33,112
You're not even 18 and acting like this!

347
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,435
Are we going back to that again?

348
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:36,716
Anyway,

349
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,951
absolutely separate bedrooms!

350
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:40,386
That's final.

351
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,254
Alright.

352
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:43,397
Organize the belongings.

353
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:44,624
Let's clean the house.

354
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:50,529
Shin,

355
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:52,661
there's a reward, you know.

356
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:55,501
A reward?

357
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:57,770
Yes.

358
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:20,960
What's this?

359
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,335
- Shin.
- Yes?

360
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,364
What are you doing?

361
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:31,804
Why are you escaping?

362
00:19:32,177 --> 00:19:33,323
Don't look this way.

363
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:34,674
It's fine.

364
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:36,809
One, two.

365
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:39,712
Carry it properly!

366
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:40,923
I am carrying it properly.

367
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:42,737
Place it down.

368
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:43,683
It's heavy!

369
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,180
Don't come this way!

370
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,386
Shin, don't run away.

371
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,366
- Huh?
- Ahh!

372
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,425
It's dangerous!

373
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:09,222
Cold!

374
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:10,560
(The cohabitation is until the renovation
is complete) (House chores will be divided)

375
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,038
(Notify in case of being
late) (Separate bedroom)

376
00:20:12,062 --> 00:20:14,094
Family...

377
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:15,481
Hey, Asuka.

378
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:17,917
The mock exam results

379
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:19,231
are here.

380
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:20,286
Yeah.

381
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:40,072
The garden looks much better now.

382
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:41,907
Yes.

383
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:48,514
Minato-san,

384
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:51,517
you've been bitten by mosquitoes here.

385
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:53,252
You're right.

386
00:20:53,984 --> 00:20:55,352
I thought it was itchy...

387
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,625
It's annoying that they suck your blood.

388
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,453
You're jealous of mosquitoes?

389
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:05,397
Yes.

390
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:08,167
I'm the only one allowed to touch you.

391
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,437
How stubborn.

392
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,785
Why don't you look at me?

393
00:22:03,297 --> 00:22:05,524
I haven't received my reward yet.

394
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:10,729
Idiot.

395
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:16,975
The spare key that you wanted so much

396
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,061
that you wrote it on a wishing paper!

397
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:22,741
If you don't want it, I'll keep it.

398
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:24,343
I want it!

399
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,685
Don't lose it.

400
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:43,562
What's wrong?

401
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,459
I...

402
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,999
am so happy.

403
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:50,326
So I'm looking for words

404
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,031
to convey this feeling.

405
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:57,309
It can't be helped.

406
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,650
Alright.

407
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:08,287
I'm so sweaty.

408
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:09,722
Shin.

409
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,313
Go take a bath.

410
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,660
Are you seducing me?

411
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,497
No!

412
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,190
Geez!

413
00:23:20,438 --> 00:23:21,667
This summer

414
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,382
seems much more hotter.

415
00:23:23,406 --> 00:23:24,911
- You'll be bitten by a mosquito.
- Quiet you.

416
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,605
Minato Shouji Coin Laundry.

417
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:28,857
Please take care of us next week too.

418
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:30,009
Please go inside.

419
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:31,543
Why?

420
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:33,846
I will use the key

421
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:35,265
and say "I'm back"

422
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:46,468
(Next Episode)
There's a festival in the market area.

423
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:47,434
(summer festival date in Yukata!)
Want to go together?

424
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,504
They're all cute.

425
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:49,888
(Different love styles)
We are dating.

426
00:24:49,912 --> 00:24:51,724
You didn't need to pull back.

427
00:24:51,748 --> 00:24:52,540
Why?

428
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:55,828
You don't understand my feelings.

429
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,867
We are dating.

430
00:24:57,867 --> 00:24:59,498
Do you actually like me?
