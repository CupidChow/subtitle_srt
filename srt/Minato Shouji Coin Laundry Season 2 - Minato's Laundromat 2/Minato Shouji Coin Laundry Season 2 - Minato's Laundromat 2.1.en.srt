Good morning, Akira-chan.

Good morning.

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,201
It's so hot today.

8
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:35,629

It's loved by the locals here.

Good morning.

- Yes, of course.

13
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,985
I've started working at my

At first, I was an

00:00:51,237 --> 00:00:52,813
inexperienced caretaker,

Good morning.

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,307
Good morning.

23
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:14,808
Do you like me?

24
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,144
What kind of question is that

25
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,211
early in the morning?

26
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:19,813
It's fine, isn't it?

27
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,691
Do you like me?

28
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:33,271
Never mind. Isn't
university more important?

29

Today, you have classes starting from...

30
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,433
What... all of a sudden!

31
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:41,902
See you later.

32
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,107
Take care, okay?

33
00:01:47,326 --> 00:01:49,776
I've been dating Shin for three months.

35
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:53,803

by an 18 year old guy.

37
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,486
Hurry up and go!

38

How about a saba fish?

43
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:17,698
It's delicious!

I'm studying!

Who is it this time?

60
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:20,375
Just say

Translucent Catfish.

00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,297
the catfish family.

68
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:46,486
Notice the whiskers?

69
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,917
They are native to Indonesia.

70
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:50,857
When they are unwell, they turn white.

71
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:55,262
Asuka, you really know a lot about fish.

72
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,063
Not at all.

73
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,948

know more than me.

75
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,736
Yeah, but...

76
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:06,473
I used to want to learn more too...

77
00:05:07,427 --> 00:05:08,708
Why not go to a university?

78
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:10,709
Huh?

79
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:13,078
You can study, even about fish.

80
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:16,449
But it's too late now...

81
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,421
There's no such thing as
it being too late to learn.

82
00:05:24,252 --> 00:05:25,926
You can do it.

83
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:28,295

Quit bothering me.

166
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,217
You won't understand unless I say it?

167
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:12,528
I won't understand unless

168
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,662
you say it out loud.

169
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:15,973
We've been together for three months,

170
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,458
but you've said you like me only twice.

171
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:20,226
Only once on line.

can I ask your body?

00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:31,004
Huh?

been a good boy for

00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:10,597
and the kitchen is flooded.

188
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:11,578
Got it.

189
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:13,146
I'll hurry back home.

190
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:17,350
Whoa, Shin.

191
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:18,384
That's great.

192
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,087

00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,989
just five more seconds.

194
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:41,808
Lately,

195
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:44,052
I'm unable to properly look

196
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,357
at Shin's face.

197
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:52,018
I've been feeling nervous

198
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:53,750
ever since I started dating him.

199
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:55,755
Ah...

200
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,591
I've become too wary.

201
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:02,896
Get yourself together,

202
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:04,531
Minato Akira.

203
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:13,640
"Like"...

204
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:16,843
It's not that easy to say,

205
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,379
Idiot.

206
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:31,291
No, it's wrong.

207
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:32,474
This is

208
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:34,794
the correct way to approach it.

209
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:43,648
I like you, Shun-kun.

210
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:48,808
Asuka.

211
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:52,845
Focus.

212
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:57,483
Hey. We're dating, right?

213
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,718
Yeah.

214
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:00,420
We decided to be that way.

215
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:02,827
It's not about making decisions

216
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:04,000
or anything like that.

217
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:07,360
It's more about emotions, you know?

218
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:11,064
I...

219
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,566
When I'm with you, Asuka,

220
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:15,635
I find it interesting.

221
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,877
Shun-kun really is Shun-kun.

222
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:30,116
Let's move on

223
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:32,318
to the next problem already.

224
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,967
Seems like this year is going to be hot.

225
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,822
I'm sorry, Minato-san.

226
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:12,558
Something came up, I can't come today.

227
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,379
I can't come.

228
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:22,285
I have something to take care of.

229
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,167
Akira-san.

230
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:30,777
- Oh, Asuka.
- Here you go.

231
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:32,578
Grandma wanted me to give this to you.

232
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:33,646
Scallops!

233
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,415
Thank you!

234
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:38,284
It's the season for scallops, huh?

235
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:40,386
Hey, isn't it unbelievable?

236
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,210
What?

237
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:43,003
Since I've been dating Shun-kun,

238
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:44,708
we've never once held hands.

239
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,383
Well, that's because he's Shun-kun.

240
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:50,370
I mean, come on,

241
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:51,933
I also want to be lovey-dovey

242
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:53,433
like your couple, Akira.

243
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,601
We're not exactly being affectionate.

244
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:57,441
Have you guys done it yet?

245
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:02,741
What are you talking about?

246
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:05,011
Still not there, huh?

247
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:11,150
Oh, by the way...

248
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,554
Shin seems busy lately.

249
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,356
Do you know something about it?

250
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,557
Huh? Shin?

251
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,728
Oh...

252
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:23,996
What?

253
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,264
You know something?

254
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:26,999
No.

255
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,482
Enough. I'm heading back.

256
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:30,770
I have to study anyway. Bye.

257
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:31,604
Huh?

258
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:33,306
Hey!

259
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:53,659
(They look delicious, right?)
They look delicious, right?

260
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:54,971
This year, as well,

261
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:56,464
it's first-come-first-served.

262
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:02,489
Shintaro.

263
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,770
It's about time.

264
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:04,871
Yes.

265
00:15:13,418 --> 00:15:15,072
(I'm sorry, Minato-san)
I'm sorry, Minato-san.

266
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:17,417
I'm busy this week and next week too.

267
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:19,556
What's with being busy?

268
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:23,523
(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)
Shin

269
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,558
doesn't bother to come see me.

270
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,980
Didn't he say he wanted to be with me

271
00:15:28,005 --> 00:15:29,176
as long as possible?

272
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:30,716
Is he angry because I refused

273
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:31,982
to let him stay over?

274
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,372
What?

275
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:35,201
Don't be so childish.

276
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,303
Geez,

277
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:39,205
it's so vague.

278
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:44,977
Minato-san.

279
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,680
It's been a while.

280
00:15:50,902 --> 00:15:52,385
About three weeks.

281
00:15:53,475 --> 00:15:55,354
Can I borrow the nearby garage?

282
00:15:55,714 --> 00:15:56,456
Huh?

283
00:15:56,518 --> 00:15:57,623
I need a place to study.

284
00:15:59,263 --> 00:15:59,966
Oh.

285
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:01,127
I want to focus,

286
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:02,728
please don't come over.

287
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:07,900
What's with him?

288
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:10,369
It's been so long since we last met!

289
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,492
Who's the real kid here?

290
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,594
It seems like it's me.

291
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:35,695
Shin!

292
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,001
When you're asleep,

293
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,333
you're so cute.

294
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,038
Stop bothering me!

295
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,474
Are you done studying or what?

296
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,780
What's with you?

297
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:55,815
Just come.

298
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,764
Close your eyes.

299
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,666
Huh?

300
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,275
Watch your head.

301
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,076
Please stay still.

302
00:17:25,717 --> 00:17:26,600
Huh?

303
00:17:29,768 --> 00:17:31,050
One, two...

304
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:36,355
Happy birthday!

305
00:17:37,193 --> 00:17:37,990
Huh?

306
00:17:38,843 --> 00:17:39,825
Minato-san,

307
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:42,495
Happy 29th birthday.

308
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,263
Oh.

309
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,766
I forgot about it.

310
00:17:50,782 --> 00:17:52,766
Wait, you guys haven't been studying?

311
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,606
Yes.

312
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:55,492
Hanabusa and Sakurako

313
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,069
helped prepare too.

314
00:17:57,093 --> 00:17:58,211
You didn't have to go

315
00:17:58,236 --> 00:17:59,916
through all this trouble.

316
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,514
I wanted to surprise you.

317
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:09,789
Happy birthday.

318
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,358
Oh!

319
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:14,260
It's a nice broom!

320
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,629
Thanks, Shin.

321
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,668
There's one more thing.

322
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:25,605
Huh?

323
00:18:32,202 --> 00:18:33,888
Wait... this is...

324
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,014
It's a watch,

325
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,450
since you wanted it.

326
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:40,419
But... I mean, it's really nice.

327
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:42,572
This must have been quite expensive!

328
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,155
Are you okay with spending money like that?

329
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,527
Actually, I started working part-time.

330
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:51,297
A part-time job?

331
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:52,331
Yes.

332
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,506
I'm teaching at the same cram school

333
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:55,571
as Shun-san.

334
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,490
So, I couldn't really find

335
00:18:58,515 --> 00:18:59,955
time to visit you.

336
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:00,973
But...

337
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:02,561
But I wanted to give you

338
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:04,053
the watch as a present.

339
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:07,880
Shin...

340
00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:12,703
But...

341
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:15,021
you should have told me.

342
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:16,822
It wouldn't have been a surprise

343
00:19:16,877 --> 00:19:18,524
if I had told you.

344
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:21,232
Here,

345
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:22,772
I'll put the watch on for you.

346
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,449
I wanted to celebrate

347
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,901
every birthday with you,

348
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:31,804
starting from the day you were born.

349
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:32,738
Idiot.

350
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:34,730
Just celebrating from now on

351
00:19:34,746 --> 00:19:36,070
is more than enough.

352
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:36,942
Then...

353
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,911
From now on,

354
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,080
let me celebrate with you.

355
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,617
It's not too tight, right?

356
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,551
Yeah.

357
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:49,719
It's just right.

358
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:52,825
Thank you so much, Shin.

359
00:19:57,611 --> 00:20:01,367
That's great, they look so happy.

360
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:05,838
Hanabusa, that's for Minato-san!

361
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,048
It's no big deal,

362
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:08,685
he doesn't like sweets anyway.

363
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,868
That's why I chose a cake

364
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:10,937
that's not too sweet!

365
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,665
You didn't even light the candles.

366
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:13,897
We haven't taken a photo.

367
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:15,965
It's fine, I helped out too!

368
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,283
Hey, hey,

369
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:19,361
you two, don't fight.

370
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:21,018
You two were affectionate

371
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:21,987
in front of me.

372
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:23,856
I'll eat another one.

373
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,191
- Hey, don't!
- Wait!

374
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,959
- It's fine!
- Let's light the candles.

375
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:29,495
- Wait, stop!
- Cut it out!

376
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:32,932
One, two...

377
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:37,903
Happy birthday.

378
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,171
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

379
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,439
Get closer, you two.

380
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,041
(Happy birthday)
Closer.

381
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:44,089
I'll take it now.

382
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:46,278
Alright, smile.

383
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:48,547
It's delicious.

384
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:49,682
That's great.

385
00:20:52,662 --> 00:20:53,652
Minato-san,

386
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:55,921
I have a boyfriend now.

387
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:57,323
Really?

388
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:58,657
Congratulations!

389
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,295
Wow! He looks cool.

390
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,257
A classmate?

391
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:05,865
Yes. We're in the same class.

392
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,334
Really? Great, a classmate.

393
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,609
See you later, Akira-san.

394
00:21:16,757 --> 00:21:17,576
Yeah.

395
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,011
Thank you.

396
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:21,647
Thank you, Sakurako-chan.

397
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,537
Yes, see you later, Shin.

398
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:24,350
Yeah.

399
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:28,096
See you later?

400
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:32,258
Shin.

401
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:34,627
I'll take care of the cleanup later,

402
00:21:34,814 --> 00:21:35,928
you can return now.

403
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,872
What?

404
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:52,111
Sorry.

405
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,539
Sakuma-sensei, what's the matter?

406
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,359
Oh.

407
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,190
It's been a while, Akira-kun.

408
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,319
You see...

409
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,987
I was wondering if

410
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:04,109
you could be the swimming team's coach

411
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,733
for this summer too.

412
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,860
Of course, I'll do it.

413
00:22:14,228 --> 00:22:15,234
Akira-kun?

414
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:17,536
What's wrong, Akira-kun?

415
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:23,741
You little brat!

416
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:25,444
Oh...

417
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:26,812
I'll do it.

418
00:22:27,077 --> 00:22:29,188
I'll get back to you later!

419
00:22:32,295 --> 00:22:33,492
What's wrong?

420
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:37,189
I was on a call, you know!

421
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:39,377
Of course, I know, it was intentional.

422
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,392
I suppose.

423
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,061
About us dating,

424
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:44,864
when will you tell Sakuma sensei?

425
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,179
Like I would say that! Idiot!

426
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,770
What's with that face?

427
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:54,139
Where are you going?

428
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,186
I...

429
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:09,355
I have nowhere to go tonight.

430
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:10,736
Huh?

431
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,125
Minato-san,

432
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,527
Can we live together?

433
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,169
Please let me live in your room

434
00:23:19,194 --> 00:23:20,309
starting today.

435
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:25,938
Huh?

436
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:27,937
Minato Shouji Coin Laundry

437
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,975
is now closed today...

438
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:32,044
That's not right!

439
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:34,613
Minato Shouji Coin Laundry.

440
00:24:45,015 --> 00:24:45,451
(Next episode)

441
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:46,352
(Living together has begun!)
Today's breakfast is

442
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:47,419
Japanese, please.

443
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:48,069
How is it?

444
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,297
Minato-san, please open.

445
00:24:49,297 --> 00:24:51,869
This is bad. It's going in Shin's favor!

446
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:53,335
(The distance between the two isn't less)
Do what you must do first,

447
00:24:53,335 --> 00:24:54,574
that should benefit you more.

448
00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:55,906
It's decided that the build

449
00:24:55,922 --> 00:24:57,320
will be demolished.

450
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,047
Want to live there, just you two?

451
00:24:59,047 --> 00:24:59,798
Huh?
