1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,966
Alright.

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,370
It should be enough.

3
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,072
I'll head back then.

4
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:07,808
Shin...

5
00:00:07,832 --> 00:00:08,775
Shintaro!

6
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:10,893
Hey.

7
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:11,945
- How are you? It's been a while.
- Yes.

8
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,361
- It's been a while.
- It's been a while.

9
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:14,314
Is everything okay?

10
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:15,115
Yes.

11
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:17,551
Huh?

12
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:24,358
Who's that?

13
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:26,093
Of course.

14
00:00:26,117 --> 00:00:27,261
And what are you doing?

15
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,795
Recently...

16
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:33,767
Shin.

17
00:00:34,884 --> 00:00:37,104
Aren't you smiling so brightly?

18
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:47,180
No way.

19
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:49,041
I'm still worried.

20
00:00:49,393 --> 00:00:55,952
(Keyaki University)

21
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:00,093
A university student?

22
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,263
But he looks a lot older.

23
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:05,666
What kind of relationship is it exactly?

24
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:12,706
Why am I here peeking again?

25
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:15,909
He's looking this way too!

26
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:16,877
No.

27
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:18,612
More than this and it'll be bad.

28
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:22,149
Alright.

29
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,885
I'll pretend I didn't see.

30
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:26,987
I didn't see a thing.

31
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:28,722
I didn't see at all.

32
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:30,179
I didn't...

33
00:01:30,203 --> 00:01:31,124
Excuse me.

34
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:34,054
Do you have business

35
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,304
with the university?

36
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:38,131
I didn't see a thing.

37
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:39,166
What?

38
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,268
Oh, I mean...

39
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:42,803
Excuse me.

40
00:01:42,827 --> 00:01:44,338
Do you have a student card

41
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:45,447
or entry permit?

42
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:47,874
No.

43
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:49,476
I'm not a suspicious person.

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,911
Yes, you are.

45
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,080
Minato-san.

46
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:56,350
What are you doing?

47
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,372
I told you not to come,

48
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:58,404
it's dangerous.

49
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:00,320
Oh, nothing. It's...

50
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:01,555
What's wrong, Shintaro?

51
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:03,290
Shintaro?

52
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,525
It's nothing, Dr. Kirihara.

53
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,829
Dr. Kirihara...

54
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:10,923
Huh?

55
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,699
A doctor?

56
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,961
"Minato's Laundromat2"

57
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:15,209
Let me introduce you,

58
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:16,698
he works at our university's

59
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:18,222
affiliated hospital,

60
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,000
this is Dr. Kirihara Satoshi.

61
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:20,993
Hello.

62
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:22,636
Kirihara, an orthopedic surgeon.

63
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:24,805
Umm...

64
00:03:24,836 --> 00:03:26,580
I think I told you before that

65
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:29,810
there was a doctor who took care of me

66
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,179
back in middle school...

67
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:35,182
Back in middle school

68
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:36,945
when I injured my back

69
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,650
and had to quit swimming.

70
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:40,520
Back then,

71
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:42,516
the doctor was very empathetic

72
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,727
and listened to me.

73
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:47,294
Oh! Back then!

74
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,665
Then he's your benefactor?

75
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,367
Calling me a benefactor is a bit much.

76
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:56,378
You talked about me in such a way.

77
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,072
I'm honored to meet you.

78
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:00,619
I feel the same way.

79
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:01,869
Thank you very much.

80
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:05,795
Dr. Kirihara is from abroad, you know.

81
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:06,847
Ah!

82
00:04:07,198 --> 00:04:08,448
From abroad!

83
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:13,120
Why have you come to this university?

84
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:14,244
Oh, about that...

85
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:17,157
He gives lectures here occasionally.

86
00:04:17,305 --> 00:04:18,765
Today, he'll oversee the practical

87
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,145
training of the senior students.

88
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:22,243
Yes, and on my way here,

89
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,165
I ran into Shintaro.

90
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:25,432
Oh.

91
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:26,933
I see.

92
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,500
By the way, Minato-san,

93
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,133
why are you at the university?

94
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,340
Huh?

95
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:36,843
I can't tell them

96
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,912
that I've been following them

97
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:40,195
because I was worried.

98
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:41,548
No way I can say that!

99
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,982
I just happened to be around here to

100
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:47,983
buy some things for the club activities.

101
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:51,658
So I figured why not pay you a visit?

102
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,154
So you wanted to see me so much

103
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,319
that you can't help it,

104
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
Minato-san?

105
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,499
Yeah, that's it.

106
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:03,703
You two seem to get along very well.

107
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:04,571
Huh?

108
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,446
Oh, not at all, the thing is...

109
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,308
Yes.

110
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:10,332
Minato is my boyfriend.

111
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,380
Hey!

112
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:15,255
Why are you suddenly saying that...

113
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:18,265
Oh, I see. Is that so!

114
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,853
You two make a good couple.

115
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:21,321
Thank you,

116
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:23,056
I think so too.

117
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,567
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

118
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:43,476
You.

119
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:46,370
Seriously, next time please don't

120
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:48,362
say that we're lovers, alright?

121
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:51,698
Again with that ridiculous

122
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:52,906
guilty feeling?

123
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:54,921
It's nothing like that.

124
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,172
I'm concerned about how people

125
00:05:57,204 --> 00:05:58,751
at the university might perceive us.

126
00:05:58,776 --> 00:05:59,930
And many other reasons.

127
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:01,297
You being unable to tell

128
00:06:01,322 --> 00:06:02,759
Sakuma-sensei about us

129
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,098
is also part of many other reasons, too?

130
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:06,378
Huh?

131
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:08,869
Still hung up on that, huh?

132
00:06:08,893 --> 00:06:11,371
I don't care what people think about me.

133
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:12,689
For me, you are a lover

134
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:13,822
that I am proud of.

135
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:15,495
If I wasn't scared that you'll be stolen,

136
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,541
I wanted to introduce you

137
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:17,477
to the whole campus,

138
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,555
the shopping district, no,

139
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,593
even all of humanity.

140
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:20,712
Stop it.

141
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:21,882
Why?

142
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:23,721
The old men in the shopping district

143
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:25,786
probably know me since I was born!

144
00:06:25,816 --> 00:06:27,361
I can't just suddenly tell them

145
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,408
I have a boyfriend!

146
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,625
It's too embarrassing!

147
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,361
Growing pains are rough, huh.

148
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:36,696
Shut up, brat!

149
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:53,780
But still,

150
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:56,483
Dr. Kirihara is amazing!

151
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:57,984
Huh?

152
00:06:58,008 --> 00:06:59,552
He's refreshing, handsome,

153
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,988
bright, kind, and friendly.

154
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:04,090
He seems warm and reliable.

155
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,460
He's truly like a reliable adult.

156
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:08,962
Seriously,

157
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,712
I'm really glad I met

158
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:12,337
such a good doctor.

159
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,546
That's why I didn't

160
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:16,718
want you to meet him.

161
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,415
Huh?

162
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:20,537
A kind and gentle adult man

163
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:22,242
with and open-hearted

164
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,640
seems to be the type that

165
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:25,093
someone around here likes.

166
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:28,262
It's not like I meant it in that way!

167
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:29,683
Then someone like me?

168
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:32,185
Shin-chan.

169
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:34,186
Minato-san's so complicated that

170
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,708
there are no words to describe it.

171
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:37,624
Want to hear something more complicated?

172
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,592
Tell me ten things you like about me.

173
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:41,227
If you really like me, you can say it.

174
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:44,831
You're such a pain.

175
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,156
And can you say it?

176
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,168
I can.

177
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:50,143
Cute smiling face, cute crying face,

178
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,052
sexy voice,

179
00:07:51,077 --> 00:07:52,460
beautiful eyes, very caring,

180
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:53,435
many vulnerabilities,

181
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,466
but well protected.

182
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:55,468
Hospitable,

183
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:56,757
constantly changing attitudes,

184
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,078
willing to help with no hesitation.

185
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,669
You like to do things by yourself.

186
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:01,351
Sorry, I was a little too focused,

187
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:02,507
so I said 11 things.

188
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:04,818
Hey!

189
00:08:04,954 --> 00:08:07,354
Yes, it's Minato-san's turn.

190
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:11,327
It's Minato-san's turn.

191
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:13,126
Oh.

192
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,861
Well...

193
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:18,178
Handsome.

194
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,599
And...

195
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:20,734
Handsome.

196
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:22,288
Because of handsomeness.

197
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:24,137
And...

198
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,161
Handsome.

199
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:27,974
That's just all about looks.

200
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:29,642
It can't be helped.

201
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,683
Putting me on the spot like this.

202
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,846
I got it.

203
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:34,366
Regardless, Minato-san,

204
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:36,449
don't come to the university again.

205
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,654
Eh?

206
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:39,953
No, don't wander around on your own.

207
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,132
Don't talk privately

208
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:42,163
with the club members.

209
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:43,567
Whenever I'm not around,

210
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:46,359
never leave the laundry area.

211
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,894
Huh?

212
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,097
Wait a minute!

213
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,767
Do you think I would easily

214
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,152
fall for anyone?

215
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:57,637
About that...

216
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:00,507
It's not like that...

217
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:02,709
But...

218
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,147
There's a thing with Sakuma-sensei.

219
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,221
I see.

220
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,224
I understand perfectly.

221
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:24,464
That you don't trust me one bit.

222
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,566
It's not like that!

223
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:28,068
Thanks for the meal.

224
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:54,260
Shu-kun.

225
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:56,863
Asuka.

226
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:58,852
Sorry for coming suddenly.

227
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,567
I really needed to talk to you.

228
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:02,569
Can we talk now?

229
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:03,403
No.

230
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:04,604
Huh?

231
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:07,780
But well, just a little...

232
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:08,675
Now,

233
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:10,043
I can't take my hands away.

234
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,212
Ouch!

235
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:13,686
Are you okay, Shu-kun?

236
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,781
I'm okay.

237
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:27,427
Let me do it for you.

238
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:34,300
Let go.

239
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,338
I'm sorry.

240
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:46,813
Hey, Shu-kun.

241
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:51,125
Lately, you never answer my calls.

242
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:55,688
Do you dislike talking to me so much?

243
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:58,625
No. It's not that I dislike it.

244
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,661
Really?

245
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:10,359
But really,

246
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:12,148
something seems off since earlier.

247
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:15,942
Maybe you have a fever or something.

248
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:30,423
It's because of you.

249
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:31,758
Huh?

250
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,827
It's because of Asuka.

251
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:39,632
When you're here,

252
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:41,601
I can't concentrate.

253
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:52,245
I see.

254
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,647
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,784
But I...

256
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:09,762
I understand.

257
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,238
But, Shu-kun...

258
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,643
can we still chat on LINE?

259
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,618
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:33,286
I guess I'm being persistent.

261
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,823
I'm off.

262
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:03,716
Shu-kun is an idiot.

263
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:23,069
Minato-san, earlier I...

264
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:25,738
What are you doing?

265
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:28,370
This should do it.

266
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:30,943
Listen, Shin,

267
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,477
don't come in here.

268
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:35,909
Huh?

269
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,550
What is this?

270
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:41,554
From here to there, that's your space.

271
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:44,824
From here to there, that's my space.

272
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,688
What about the toilet then?

273
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:48,828
And the bath tub?

274
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:50,487
If you don't pass my space

275
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,175
then you can't get water.

276
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:53,966
Quiet, you!

277
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,742
Just forget those minor details.

278
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:56,831
An elementary student

279
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:58,090
who is entering adulthood.

280
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,038
Huh?

281
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,308
Then you must be a little kid!

282
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:06,012
Fine, do whatever you want.

283
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,121
Hmph!

284
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,818
That Shin.

285
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,253
How dare he talk back

286
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,223
when he's just a newborn baby.

287
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:21,561
He doesn't trust me at all?

288
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,064
Argh!

289
00:14:25,705 --> 00:14:28,167
I swear, it's not my fault!

290
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:36,008
What are you doing?

291
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,150
Sleeping like this after taking a bath.

292
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:40,546
I can't help it, okay?

293
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:43,082
The water temperature was too hot.

294
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,219
Hey!

295
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,054
Don't cross the line!

296
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,576
Are you trying to blame me

297
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:52,779
for boiling the water?

298
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:56,629
No.

299
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:58,832
An adult at this age

300
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,318
just taking care of your self,

301
00:15:00,343 --> 00:15:01,709
please do it properly.

302
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:05,938
I get it.

303
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:07,160
Just shut it.

304
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:13,045
What's his problem? That Shin...

305
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:27,527
Minato-san.

306
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:31,557
Bon appetit.

307
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:40,633
- You see...
- It's...

308
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:44,570
What?

309
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:46,706
Minato-san, as well,

310
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,007
what is it?

311
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,177
- Nothing. And you?
- Nothing. And you?

312
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:56,282
That is...

313
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:58,342
Well...

314
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,121
About yesterday...

315
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,697
The fan.

316
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,133
You left it on.

317
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,537
I'll be more careful from now on.

318
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,972
What were you going to say just now?

319
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:21,207
Nothing.

320
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:24,544
I have work today, so I'll be back late.

321
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:27,980
I'm off.

322
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:47,033
The lowest value is minus three.

323
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:50,336
Practice doing today's part well.

324
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,805
That's all for today's class. Good job.

325
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,607
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

326
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:04,143
(Minato-san, yesterday)
(I'm coming home)

327
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,922
Shintaro.

328
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:21,233
What happened?

329
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:27,440
Shu-san.

330
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:40,786
What do you think?

331
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,521
Huh?

332
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,857
Aren't you a medical student?

333
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:46,455
I thought you might be able to

334
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:48,167
figure out what's wrong.

335
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:49,829
What are you saying?

336
00:18:51,516 --> 00:18:52,665
Lately,

337
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:54,585
sometimes, I feel this

338
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,290
tightness in my chest.

339
00:18:57,147 --> 00:18:58,004
Huh?

340
00:18:58,343 --> 00:19:00,206
You don't know the cause of the pain?

341
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:02,074
Not really.

342
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:07,446
When I think about Asuka...

343
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:09,582
my heart aches every time.

344
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:15,154
I don't know how to deal with it.

345
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:16,689
Here.

346
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,624
It's strange, right?

347
00:19:19,176 --> 00:19:20,059
No.

348
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:22,094
Rather, for me...

349
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,829
when I'm with Minato-san,

350
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:25,266
there was never a time

351
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,836
where my heart doesn't ache.

352
00:19:27,344 --> 00:19:28,200
Huh?

353
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:30,503
Whether I'm with him or not,

354
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,605
sometimes there's pain,

355
00:19:33,332 --> 00:19:34,674
sometimes there's love,

356
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,877
sometimes there's anger.

357
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:41,747
I don't like it as well.

358
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,017
But regardless,

359
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,387
I love him.

360
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,059
Love...

361
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,797
I like you,

362
00:19:58,492 --> 00:19:59,632
Shu-kun.

363
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,474
But...

364
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,377
It's not always like that like you.

365
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:12,945
I think

366
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:15,314
each person's feelings are different.

367
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,884
My feelings for Minato-san

368
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,386
are only mine.

369
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:22,988
That applies to you as well.

370
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,025
Then he must also...

371
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,412
Surely, Hanabusa...

372
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,896
must have feelings for you

373
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,766
that are unique to him.

374
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:12,698
(I'm coming home)

375
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:13,839
(Shin)

376
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:14,908
Shin.

377
00:21:15,587 --> 00:21:16,742
Sorry about yesterday.

378
00:21:18,703 --> 00:21:20,184
I lashed out at you.

379
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,722
(Shin. Sorry about yesterday.

380
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,427
I lashed out at you)

381
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,301
This kind of thing,

382
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:38,464
it's better to talk face to face.

383
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:43,803
Alright.

384
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:13,599
Alright.

385
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,512
When I get back, I'll make the

386
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:17,512
hamburgers Shin said were delicious.

387
00:22:17,763 --> 00:22:18,971
I'll apologize properly.

388
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:20,639
I'll do my best.

389
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,809
Thank you so much.

390
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,013
Sorry for calling you out so suddenly.

391
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,082
I needed to consult with someone,

392
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,617
there's only you, Dr. Kirihara.

393
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:38,023
Don't worry about it.

394
00:22:38,093 --> 00:22:39,583
I'll always be there to support you

395
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,733
if you need it.

396
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:43,020
No matter when, I'll be on your side.

397
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:44,997
Cheer up.

398
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,120
Something like this happened before too.

399
00:22:57,145 --> 00:22:58,744
You're right.

400
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:00,312
Let's go.

401
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:14,326
Why didn't he tell me anything...?

402
00:23:20,152 --> 00:23:24,031
(For making hamburger)

403
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:27,308
Minato Shouji Coin Laundry

404
00:23:27,962 --> 00:23:30,122
is closed for today.

405
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,091
We'll be in your care next week.

406
00:24:45,449 --> 00:24:47,031
(Next episode)
Where did you go, Minato-san?

407
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:49,119
(Feeling distant)
You can tell me everything, you know?

408
00:24:49,143 --> 00:24:50,715
(Feeling kept hidden)
You can tell Dr. Kirihara everything,

409
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,907
but not me.

410
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:53,343
If this goes on,

411
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:55,627
Shu-kun's feeling will drift away.

412
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,020
I have something to talk about.

413
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,665
Sorry for coming to see you.
