1
00:00:09,612 --> 00:00:12,141
(Minato-san, you haven't come back yet?)
Minato-san, you haven't come back yet?

2
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:14,248
(Where are you?)
Where are you?

3
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:17,384
(Is something the matter?)
Is something the matter?

4
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,321
I can only discuss these things

5
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:24,925
with Dr. Kirihara.

6
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,131
What kind of expression

7
00:00:32,154 --> 00:00:34,234
should I have when I meet Shin?

8
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,396
Minato-san, where did you go?

9
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:03,964
You didn't even reply to my messages.

10
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,133
You came back later than usual,

11
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:06,203
I'm worried...

12
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:09,536
The club activity ran a bit long.

13
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,262
What's wrong?

14
00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:14,306
You look a bit off.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,645
If something happened, please tell me.

16
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:21,882
Even though...

17
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:24,072
Yes?

18
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,521
Even though you never tell me anything.

19
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:28,822
Huh?

20
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:30,991
You can tell Dr. Kirihara,

21
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:33,060
But you never tell me anything.

22
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:34,328
Wait a minute,

23
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:36,797
why is Dr. Kirihara involved in this?

24
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:38,298
It's nothing.

25
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:40,867
Wait, Minato-san.

26
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,270
Stop! This is my space!

27
00:01:44,714 --> 00:01:46,239
From this point, this is my area.

28
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:47,908
You're still on about this?

29
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:50,344
Be quiet.

30
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:53,230
Minato-san.

31
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:55,315
Don't tell me you...

32
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,784
are jealous of Dr. Kirihara?

33
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:00,770
I'm not jealous.

34
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,422
And I know that you deeply

35
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:04,632
respect Dr. Kirihara.

36
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:08,432
I just...

37
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:10,797
Just...

38
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,072
Wait a moment.

39
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:20,974
We haven't finished talking.

40
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:23,076
No.

41
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:24,177
But...

42
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:29,049
Asuka!

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,651
You...

44
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,605
Please, do something for me,

45
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:34,726
Akira-san!

46
00:02:34,726 --> 00:02:35,822
What are you up to?

47
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,457
No, I can't take it anymore.

48
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:39,133
Stay away from Minato-san.

49
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,228
Asuka, calm down first.

50
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:42,362
Calm down, alright?

51
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:44,131
What's happening?

52
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:46,800
I...

53
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,604
might have gotten dumped by Shu-kun...

54
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:51,605
Huh?

55
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,574
Regardless...

56
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,294
I'm going to stay here tonight!

57
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,049
Wait. Hey!

58
00:03:59,754 --> 00:04:01,936
"Minato's Landromat2"
(Episode 6)

59
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,510
At this rate,

60
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,816
Shu-kun's feelings will

61
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:06,512
gradually drift away.

62
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,585
I really don't know what to do...

63
00:04:12,955 --> 00:04:13,987
I see...

64
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,490
It must be tough.

65
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,425
But...

66
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:20,160
we're talking about Shu-kun,

67
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:23,043
It's impressive enough that he's

68
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:24,738
considering being with someone.

69
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:27,030
You don't have to worry that much.

70
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,202
I think for Shu-kun,

71
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:31,371
you must be special to him.

72
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:33,940
At first, I thought the same way, too.

73
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,073
But...

74
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,444
Recently,

75
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:39,079
I don't really know why,

76
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:41,204
but he's been avoiding me all the time.

77
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:43,150
Messages and calls too?

78
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,051
He ignores everything.

79
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:49,122
What should I do?

80
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:51,499
Help me, please!

81
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,226
Hanabusa!

82
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:55,529
Don't get too close to Minato-san, okay?

83
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,295
Also, why do you have

84
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,000
to stay at our house?

85
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:00,133
It's not a big deal.

86
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:02,206
If I'm alone,

87
00:05:02,604 --> 00:05:04,371
I'll worry so much that I can't sleep.

88
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:05,906
Besides,

89
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:07,467
I thought that if I stay here,

90
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:08,974
Shin can help me study too.

91
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:10,443
Huh? I won't help.

92
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:11,778
Why?

93
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,313
Stingy!

94
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,842
I was having an important

95
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:16,506
conversation with Minato-san.

96
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,085
Besides, when Shu-san talks about you...

97
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,388
When I think about Asuka,

98
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:23,482
my heart aches.

99
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:27,527
What?

100
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:29,963
Nothing.

101
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:32,087
Well, it's not like staying here

102
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,208
will solve anything.

103
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,740
Go talk properly again.

104
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:37,275
It's still impossible like this.

105
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:38,004
But...

106
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,306
Be quiet!

107
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:43,010
Someone living so happily like you

108
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:45,037
would never understand me.

109
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:48,454
Besides, you're unrelated.

110
00:05:48,454 --> 00:05:50,650
This is Akira-san's house, isn't it?

111
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:52,485
You're just staying at his place.

112
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:54,688
Huh? At least,

113
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:57,130
from here onwards it's my territory.

114
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,825
Right, Minato-san?

115
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,560
Huh?

116
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:01,970
What's with you?

117
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:04,665
I've been wondering since earlier...

118
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,167
What's with this tape? It's so sticky.

119
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,468
Calm down.

120
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:10,897
It's just one day, right, Shin?

121
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,406
Asuka is feeling down like this.

122
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:15,775
Fine.

123
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:17,978
If Minato-san says this...

124
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:20,511
Alright, Asuka.

125
00:06:20,644 --> 00:06:21,748
You can stay here tonight.

126
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,984
Thank you, Akira-san.

127
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,695
Then tonight,

128
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,729
I'll sleep in Minato-san's room.

129
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:28,916
Stop spouting nonsense!

130
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:30,257
I'll never allow it.

131
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:31,719
Even I have never been

132
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:33,148
allowed to sleep together.

133
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:34,656
Eh?

134
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:35,929
Seriously?

135
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:41,034
Just kidding!

136
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:43,775
Shin-chan, you're too desperate.

137
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,763
Hey, there are good jokes and bad jokes.

138
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:48,909
Hey, enough already.

139
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:57,384
I can't do it.

140
00:06:57,408 --> 00:06:59,119
I don't understand.

141
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,957
Ah, sorry,

142
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:06,395
Did I wake you up?

143
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:07,460
No.

144
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,396
I just came to get a drink.

145
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,429
You've been studying all this time?

146
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:14,108
Well,

147
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:17,470
this is all I can do for now.

148
00:07:19,383 --> 00:07:20,417
Besides,

149
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,609
I promised Shu-kun

150
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,477
that I would do my best.

151
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:33,086
You got that wrong.

152
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,788
- Eh?
- Let me borrow it.

153
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:39,326
This.

154
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:42,862
You solve it using this formula.

155
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,465
Wow.

156
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:47,267
You're amazing.

157
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:48,669
Are there any parts

158
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:49,869
you don't understand?

159
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,806
Shin...

160
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:55,075
- You...
- Just so you know,

161
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,376
I don't care if you're bad at studying,

162
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:59,012
I won't go easy on you.

163
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,381
Yeah.

164
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,983
Let's do it.

165
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:07,020
What's next?

166
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:11,624
Take the results obtained from B...

167
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,705
You guys seem to get along well

168
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,730
after all.

169
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,721
Where are we going, Minato-san?

170
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,561
Let's grab some food.

171
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:45,294
Seems like both of you

172
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:46,983
were studying late last night.

173
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,462
Today, I'll treat you both.

174
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,464
- Really?
- Yes.

175
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,899
Yay!

176
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,836
Bon appétit!

177
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:02,942
You guys are so young.

178
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,978
- Thanks for the meal.
- Thank you.

179
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,546
- Thanks for the meal.
- Thank you.

180
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:08,848
It was delicious!

181
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:10,550
Thanks, Akira-san!

182
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:12,003
Thanks for the meal.

183
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:14,154
You're welcome, here.

184
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:16,523
What's that?

185
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:18,616
Raffle tickets for the shopping street,

186
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,026
If I recall correctly,

187
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:22,073
I think the first prize this year is...

188
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:26,917
(First prize hot spring trip)

189
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:30,537
Excuse me.

190
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,243
(Keyaki commercial area, try your luck)
Welcome.

191
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:32,739
(Keyaki commercial area, try your luck)
One try, welcome.

192
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,276
A hot spring trip...

193
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:38,209
with Minato-san...

194
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,949
Too bad! Consolation prize.

195
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:44,784
- Here's a pocket tissue.
- Welcome.

196
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:49,222
Too bad! Consolation prize.

197
00:09:49,246 --> 00:09:51,021
It's just my luck, huh...

198
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:52,158
Minato-san.

199
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,427
Do your best.

200
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:03,169
Congratulations! It's a jackpot!

201
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,771
Congratulations!

202
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,111
A trip with Minato-san,

203
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:13,196
a hot spring trip...

204
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,328
Even just winning something

205
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:16,438
is lucky, right?

206
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,419
And

207
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:20,587
what's next?

208
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:21,788
Huh?

209
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:24,053
Well...

210
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:25,725
Since it's come to this.

211
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:32,457
Asuka, go and spin around.

212
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,667
One, two...

213
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,470
So fast! Three, four...

214
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:38,799
Oh no!

215
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,039
- No!
- Idiot.

216
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:40,907
Where is it?

217
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,176
- It's screwed.
- I'll hit it now!

218
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,244
Oh dear...

219
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,045
Alright. One.

220
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,413
Shin-chan, come!

221
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:49,415
Don't help him. Stop!

222
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:51,280
Can't be helped.

223
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,318
It’s hard.

224
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:54,196
Don't underestimate people in their 30s.

225
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,623
Okay, let's go!

226
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:58,758
It's dangerous!

227
00:10:58,782 --> 00:10:59,659
Good.

228
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:01,027
Go straight in front.

229
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:02,495
- Alright.
- Yes.

230
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:04,931
Ahh!

231
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,471
Wow!

232
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:08,801
You did it!

233
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:10,855
Great job!

234
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,123
I got it!

235
00:11:12,147 --> 00:11:12,961
Amazing!

236
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:14,307
Looks delicious!

237
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,642
Amazing.

238
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:24,717
I...

239
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:27,183
had better go home.

240
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:29,856
Are you okay now?

241
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:31,291
Yeah.

242
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:34,060
I'm bored of being the third wheel.

243
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,129
So, you're aware?

244
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:42,168
Thank you both so much,

245
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,004
thanks to you, I feel much better now.

246
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:51,150
I'll try studying on my own.

247
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:53,646
I see.

248
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,165
If there's anything,

249
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,602
you can always talk to us.

250
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,186
Thank you.

251
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,521
See ya.

252
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:02,922
- Take care.
- Yeah.

253
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,664
You see...

254
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,568
I will...

255
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,503
go clean up the shop then return.

256
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:20,043
Do you need my help?

257
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:21,140
It's fine.

258
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:22,822
You haven't slept enough,

259
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:24,410
you mus be tired.

260
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:28,881
I got it.

261
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,350
Then...

262
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:31,784
see you later.

263
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:15,728
You see...

264
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,536
(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

265
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:27,340
Please.

266
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:28,675
Thank you.

267
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:30,815
I'm sorry

268
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:33,276
for visiting so suddenly.

269
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:34,747
It's fine.

270
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,150
Did something happen?

271
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:38,751
Actually, yesterday.

272
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:40,437
Shintaro called and said that

273
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:42,395
he had something to discuss.

274
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,258
And she said

275
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,027
he had a fight with Minato-san

276
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:49,529
and he was very sad.

277
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,332
It's my fault,

278
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:55,735
It's because

279
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:58,538
I like Minato-san too much.

280
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:01,808
And I've become

281
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,910
a burden for him.

282
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,816
Just to be by Minato-san's side,

283
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:12,018
I know how happy it is,

284
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:14,887
and I should understand that.

285
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:19,746
But that's why it's scary.

286
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:21,361
Scary, huh?

287
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,198
What if one day,

288
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:29,202
Minato-san might

289
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:35,341
suddenly disappear from my side?

290
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,813
Shintaro,

291
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:44,650
you're solid,

292
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:46,893
really.

293
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:51,655
Seriously.

294
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:56,796
You always speak so clearly.

295
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:57,964
I'm sorry,

296
00:14:58,589 --> 00:14:59,499
but...

297
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:01,434
That's one of

298
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:03,269
your good qualities.

299
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,329
You're solid, earnest, straightforward.

300
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:10,143
Hates losing.

301
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:13,780
He's a man with a strong core.

302
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:16,582
That's because...

303
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,494
he's been thinking about you

304
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,589
for 10 years,

305
00:15:19,658 --> 00:15:20,791
even though he didn't

306
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,181
even know your name.

307
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:25,383
Shintaro

308
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:27,533
started swimming again because

309
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:29,049
he wanted to meet you again.

310
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,764
So, at that time...

311
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,372
When he couldn't continue swimming

312
00:15:35,397 --> 00:15:36,841
due to a waist problem...

313
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,240
All he could think about was you.

314
00:15:45,072 --> 00:15:46,112
No.

315
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,481
That's impossible.

316
00:15:50,497 --> 00:15:51,584
Shintaro...

317
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:53,853
Swimming...

318
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,372
It's the only thing that connects

319
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:57,536
with that person.

320
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,425
I won't give up.

321
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,893
I can't do that.

322
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,396
There's no need to give up.

323
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,498
Just...

324
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:07,533
change the approach.

325
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,469
Change the approach?

326
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,805
After swimming...

327
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,141
What do you want to be?

328
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:19,078
Certainly,

329
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:21,681
you might not be able to do it

330
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:24,817
the way you wanted through swimming.

331
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:27,208
But this

332
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:29,255
is a new beginning.

333
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,861
Even if you lose swimming,

334
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:39,131
you can still go anywhere you want.

335
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,835
Doctor...

336
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,478
You see, destiny is

337
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,514
a mysterious thing.

338
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:56,616
You'll meet

339
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:59,819
that person you cherish

340
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,555
one day.

341
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,193
It's going to be alright,

342
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:12,231
you can do it.

343
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:25,645
So, that's what happened.

344
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,581
He's truly an amazing guy.

345
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,044
After that, he decided to

346
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,340
become a doctor.

347
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:34,487
On top of that,

348
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:36,878
he gets to love you too.

349
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,861
Minato-san.

350
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:47,466
From now on,

351
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,603
please take care of Shintaro.

352
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,262
I'm back.

353
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:18,864
Welcome back.

354
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,401
You see...

355
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:24,774
I...

356
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:26,072
I'm sorry about the other day.

357
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:27,440
Huh?

358
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,710
I lost my temper.

359
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,713
Sorry for acting so childish.

360
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,202
I'm really sorry.

361
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:37,216
No.

362
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,851
Minato-san, you're not wrong.

363
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,553
It's because of me...

364
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:42,989
I talked about Sakuma-sensei

365
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,335
and doubted you.

366
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,362
I'm really sorry.

367
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,265
It's alright,

368
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:55,211
don't think too much about it.

369
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,807
To be honest...

370
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,677
actually,

371
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:07,680
I was jealous of Dr. Kirihara.

372
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:09,515
Huh?

373
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,286
There are things about with me,

374
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,244
but you can discuss
everything with Dr. Kirihara.

375
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:20,126
About that...

376
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:21,727
I heard about

377
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:23,829
what happened in middle school.

378
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,233
He

379
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:29,045
stayed by your side

380
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,750
when you were in pain

381
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:32,338
and suffering.

382
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:35,574
He was the one who pulled you through.

383
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,947
Yet, I...

384
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:46,452
It's pathetic, right?

385
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,421
You're not pathetic at all.

386
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,426
The pathetic one

387
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,794
is me.

388
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,799
I went to consult Dr. Kirihara...

389
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,684
one of the reasons is

390
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:03,833
because I trust him.

391
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,440
But really it's not just that.

392
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,413
I don't want...

393
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:17,683
to show you my uncool side.

394
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,256
Why?

395
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:28,278
Sometimes,

396
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:29,829
I wanted to

397
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:32,298
be relied upon

398
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,402
as an adult.

399
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,110
Minato-san.

400
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:46,679
I...

401
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:49,048
I'm glad.

402
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,612
Even though I can't swim anymore,

403
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,308
I didn't give up on you.

404
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,592
I've said it before...

405
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:03,763
It's because I like you too much.

406
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,232
Sometimes,

407
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,033
no.

408
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,035
I

409
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:12,677
always cause you trouble.

410
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:16,474
That's why I...

411
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,011
try harder

412
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,848
to become an adult quickly.

413
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:26,485
What are you saying?

414
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:30,556
It's okay.

415
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:33,964
I don't hate it, you know.

416
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:36,428
Getting angry or upset with you.

417
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:42,234
Take your time becoming an adult.

418
00:21:43,057 --> 00:21:44,036
Shin-chan.

419
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,383
It's frustrating to be treated

420
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:49,680
like a child like this.

421
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:52,836
But somewhere inside,

422
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,094
I'm secretly delighted.

423
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:55,848
It's a bit complicated in my heart.

424
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,951
Idiot.

425
00:22:01,206 --> 00:22:02,655
You really are an idiot.

426
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,890
Have you finally agreed to look at me?

427
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,295
Minato-san.

428
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,466
Let's take a bath together...

429
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,069
Who would?

430
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,137
Didn't you already bathe?

431
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,807
I'm already sweating.

432
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:57,033
Huh?

433
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,944
Then go alone.

434
00:22:58,968 --> 00:23:01,614
It's fine. Just take it off, Minato-san.

435
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:03,382
Hey, stop!

436
00:23:03,406 --> 00:23:04,385
Then I'll strip.

437
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:06,640
Wait, you'll catch a cold.

438
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:07,653
Hurry up and take it off.

439
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,421
What?

440
00:23:09,445 --> 00:23:10,623
- Hurry up and take it off.
- No way!

441
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:17,329
Let's take a bath together tomorrow.

442
00:23:17,353 --> 00:23:19,273
- No way.
- The day after tomorrow?

443
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,900
From washing to drying,

444
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,153
or any problems,

445
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:24,503
please visit Minato Shouji Coin Laundry.

446
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,205
Even important memories,

447
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:28,407
we will handle them gently.

448
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,845
We'll be in your care next week as well.

449
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,151
(Living together until

450
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,784
the renovation is completed)

451
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:45,517
(Next episode)

452
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,310
I'll record everything about Minato-san.

453
00:24:48,334 --> 00:24:50,456
(Trembling love...)
Let's talk directly and see.

454
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,790
There's something I want to talk about.

455
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:52,858
Asuka...

456
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:54,693
(One step towards decision-making)
Us dating,

457
00:24:54,717 --> 00:24:56,070
there's no need to force it.

458
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:57,830
Professor Sakuma.

459
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:59,358
I have something I want
to talk about with you.
