00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:07,281
we'll be closed for two days.)

5
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:11,879
Alright.

6
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:13,347
Oh?

7
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:14,669
What's wrong?

8
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:16,089
The seat belt...

9
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:18,819
Which one, let me help.

10
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:24,191
Tonight, let's sleep in the same room.

11
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:28,341
What are you saying, seriously!

12
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:34,539
It's not like we mind you

13
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:36,244
being all lovey-dovey,

14
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:38,188
but please, while you're driving,

15
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:40,017
don't start doing weird stuff, okay?

16
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:41,441
Huh?

17
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:43,225
What are you talking...

18
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:44,711
Anyway,

19
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:45,712
let's go!

20
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:47,579
Departure, we're off!

21
00:00:47,604 --> 00:00:48,582
A hot spring trip...

22
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:49,151
Yes.

23

One-night, two-day trip.

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,818

27
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:04,458
It's a nice room with a spacious

28
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:05,830
and pleasant atmosphere.

29
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,528
Yeah.

30
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:10,697
Here...

31
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,599
with Shin...

32
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,635
just the two of us.

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,604
No, no,

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,640
what am I even thinking?

35
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:21,541
Minato-san,

36
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,010
please prepare your underwear.

37
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:24,745
What?

38
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:26,913
I meant, for going to the hot springs.

39
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:28,248
Hot springs...

40
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,818
No, no way,

41
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,720
I'm not going yet.

42
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,955
Is that so?

43
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:37,024
How about taking a walk outside then?

44
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:39,126
There seems to be a nearby tourist spot.

45
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:41,061
Oh! Yeah,

46
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:42,262
that sounds good!

47
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:44,197
Let's do that!

48
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,400
I'm looking forward to it!

49
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:48,949
When we come back,

50
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:50,738
let's go to the hot springs together.

51
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:56,677
Wow...

52
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,749
Let's go somewhere to play for now...

53
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:02,549
No, you can't.

54
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:03,550
Huh?

55
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:04,851
Why?

56
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:07,120
We aren't here to play.

57
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:11,391
But, you know, since we're here...

58
00:03:12,294 --> 00:03:14,039
I came here for study,

59
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:15,703
I told you that.

60
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,368
No, I mean,

61
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:19,041
I'll definitely study properly!

62
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,903
I'll study, you know...

63
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:22,603
(English)

64
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,403
Alright,

65
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:24,771
let's get started.

66
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,907
Seriously...?

67
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,312
Look, look at this!

68
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,246
Wow.

69
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,938
It's amazing, right?

70
00:03:35,305 --> 00:03:36,757
Minato-san, let's take a picture.

71
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:38,151
Yeah.

72
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:41,021
Say cheese!

73
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,125
Wow...

74
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,160
This feels really nice.

75
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:52,165
Hey, what are you taking pictures of?

76
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,345
Isn't it fine?

77
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:54,568
Come on, go to sleep.

78
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,437
Hey, knock it off, stop swaying.

79
00:03:57,826 --> 00:04:00,240
Minato-san, are you feeling refreshed?

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,041
Yeah.

81
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:02,473
Thanks to you, Shin.

82
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:03,777
I appreciate it.

83
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:05,879
I'm glad...

84
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:07,458
I hope from now on,

85
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:09,801
we can go to various places together.

86
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:10,584
Yeah.

87
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:12,412
This place looks interesting.

88
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:13,386
Yes.

89
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,456
Hey,

90
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:18,505
isn't this cute?

91
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:19,893
Yeah.

92
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,197
Do you want it?

93
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:26,299
Yeah, well.

94
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:29,035
I've always admired things like this...

95
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:30,478
But...

96
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:32,644
I'll be leaving that house soon.

97
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:34,965
If we were to have matching ones,

98
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,298
it'd be better to have something

99
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:37,595
we can keep for a long time.

100
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:49,556
Umm... Minato-san.

101
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:50,857
Hm?

102
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:53,219
Do...

103
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:56,196
I really have to leave?

104
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,800
Sure,

105
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:01,568
originally it was

106
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,301
until the house renovation was done...

107
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:06,085
that was the promise,

108
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:08,775
but... still,

109
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,378
I still want to

110
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,332
live together with you, Minato-san,

111
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,387
in that house.

112
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,120
Don't you

113
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,756
feel the same way, Minato-san?

114
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:38,905
Hey, Shu-kun.

115
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:41,775
How about taking a break soon?

116
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:45,371
Alright, let's take a 10-minute break.

117
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:46,213
Yeah.

118
00:05:46,296 --> 00:05:47,714
I'll go get some drinks.

119
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,252
Not that kind of break.

120
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:55,789
Come on,

121
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:57,040
since we've come all the way

122
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,361
to the hot springs.

123
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,828
Asuka.

124
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:03,763
Do you want to take a bath?

125
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:05,098
Yeah.

126
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:06,533
Hmm...

127
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:08,802
Well,

128
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:10,804
go ahead.

129
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:12,205
No,

130
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:14,641
that's not what I meant!

131
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,491
Let's take a bath together!

132
00:06:16,518 --> 00:06:17,544
Together!

133
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,051
But I usually take baths

134
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:20,436
before sleeping.

135
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:26,820
Fine,

136
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,558
I'll wait until tonight.

137
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,260
Why?

138
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,412
I thought you wanted to take a bath?

139
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:36,263
Well,

140
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:38,665
it's pointless to bathe alone!

141
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,136
Why?

142
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:50,777
Ah...

143
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,380
it feels so good...

144
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:01,421
Is it okay if I

145
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:03,356
move a little closer?

146
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,329
Yeah.

147
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:25,912
About what we talked about earlier...

148
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:32,886
Not about the rules we set

149
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:35,922
or the promises...

150
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,092
Nothing to do with them.

151
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,029
It's just that

152
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,900
I wanted to know how you feel.

153
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:02,939
Minato-san...

154
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:06,853
In the future,

155
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:09,322
do you want to be with me?

156
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:29,075
I'll go out first.

157
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:31,069
Don't get overheated.

158
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:40,854
Wow.

159
00:08:47,122 --> 00:08:48,528
Shu-kun, this is delicious!

160
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,330
Ahh...

161
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:52,565
I can feed myself.

162
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:54,801
It's okay, just open up.

163
00:08:55,463 --> 00:08:56,302
Here,

164
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,204
ahh...

165
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:02,142
Is it tasty?

166
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,043
Yeah.

167
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:10,095
Speaking of which,

168
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:11,184
how was the hot spring?

169
00:09:11,853 --> 00:09:13,553
We haven't gone in yet.

170
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,088
Huh...?

171
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:16,589
Oh.

172
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:19,659
It feels nice, right?

173
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:27,534
What's with this tension...

174
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:31,237
Hey,

175
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:33,339
did you and Akira-san have a fight?

176
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,741
No.

177
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:36,142
It's none of your business.

178
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,143
Huh?

179
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,745
It is my business.

180
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:41,648
This is a trip for both me and Shu-kun,

181
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,017
so don't make the atmosphere unpleasant.

182
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:48,415
Oh, right!

183
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:49,856
Let's take a photo together.

184
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:51,135
- Please?
- Yeah.

185
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:51,935
For memories.

186
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,760
Phone...

187
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:56,663
Huh?

188
00:09:58,076 --> 00:09:58,705
Oh?

189
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:02,168
I might have left my phone in the room.

190
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:06,239
Anyway, you two better make up quickly!

191
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,649
What was that...

192
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:18,788
my feelings...

193
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:21,121
I don't even...

194
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:23,823
understand my own feelings.

195
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,096
Here's our recommended bai-sen.

196
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,164
Would you like some?

197
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:32,565
Oh,

198
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:34,134
umm...

199
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:35,902
We'll take two, please.

200
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:38,872
Minato-san, please drink some water.

201
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,307
I don't need water.

202
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:45,378
Ah, it's Asuka!

203
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:47,321
You've come at a good time!

204
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,134
- What?
- Sit down!

205
00:10:49,134 --> 00:10:50,650
Akira-san? What happened?

206
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,125
He might have had too much to drink.

207
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:53,351
His energy has been a bit strange...

208
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,248
Shu-san also seems lost in thought.

209
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:59,584
- Come on, I'll give you a kiss.
- No. Stop! Don't come near me!

210
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,797
Minato-san, what are you doing?

211
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:03,563
Eww, you smell of alcohol!

212
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,682
Seriously, don't come near me!

213
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,368
Asuka, you dummy!

214
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,117
There was a time when I

215
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:12,555
even changed your diapers!

216
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,502
You even let him do that?

217
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,943
Both of you are causing trouble!

218
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:18,511
Anyway,

219
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:20,246
we're going to take a bath.

220
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,415
You two figure things out on your own!

221
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:23,950
Let's go, Shu-kun!

222
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,819
Shu-kun!

223
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:28,955
Here.

224
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,895
Why did you drink so much?

225
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:37,897
You're so drunk...

226
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,733
No, I'm not.

227
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,171
He's exceeded the limit of cuteness...

228
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:47,674
but...

229
00:11:48,303 --> 00:11:49,872
Minato-san, with you like this,

230
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:50,888
I'm worried.

231
00:11:51,857 --> 00:11:52,545
Huh?

232
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:55,114
From now on, when you're alone,

233
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:56,340
please absolutely avoid

234
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,598
drinking sake.

235
00:11:57,892 --> 00:11:59,786
Don't eat instant food for meals.

236
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:01,187
Make sure to eat vegetables,

237
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:02,360
and don't let your stomach

238
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:03,532
get cold before sleeping.

239
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,465
And also...

240
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:07,393
Isn't that...

241
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,597
like something a mother would say?

242
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,834
Minato-san.

243
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:16,536
Are you truly okay with

244
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,204
me leaving the house?

245
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:34,921
Well...

246
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:38,524
I...

247
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,328
If you...

248
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,134
If you weren't...

249
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:50,436
I'd be lonely.

250
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:58,278
I...

251
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:03,816
if I could... always...

252
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,156
If that's the case,

253
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,403
how about we live together like this?

254
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,129
From your point of view,

255
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:18,212
I'm younger,

256
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,725
and there might still be parts of me

257
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:21,936
that you can't rely on.

258
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:23,550
However,

259
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:26,039
even if I have to stake everything,

260
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:27,240
I'll cherish you.

261
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,608
Oh.

262
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,048
Sorry... I'll pull back.

263
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,458
Don't...

264
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,279
Ah... It's impossible!

265
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:08,757
Even though I went through

266
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,249
all the trouble to get drunk...

267
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:13,186
What are you talking about?

268
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:15,355
It's your fault...

269
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,257
you're such a show off,

270
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:19,926
greedy,

271
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,096
always thinking only about me.

272
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:30,136
I thought...

273
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:33,239
that I didn't want to be in love anymore.

274
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,676
But...

275
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,204
when you

276
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,614
came into my life...

277
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,621
The idea of living together forever...

278
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,061
I still have a long way to go...

279
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,398
Even now,

280
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,147
being looked at with

281
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:02,506
your straightforward eyes...

282
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,372
Just bring together,

283
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:09,116
My feelings are growing stronger

284
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,181
and stronger.

285
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:15,915
I don't know what to do.

286
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,587
Minato-san...

287
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:30,129
By the way,

288
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:34,066
you've

289
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:37,929
always been calling me 'Minato-san'...

290
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:47,213
aren't you going to call me 'Akira'?

291
00:16:07,894 --> 00:16:08,935
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:12,171
I...

293
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:18,511
Idiot.

294
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:23,249
Hurry...

295
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:28,387
Hurry up and...

296
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,323
hug me...

297
00:17:32,797 --> 00:17:33,786
Minato-san?

298
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:38,024
Hey, Minato!

299
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:40,893
Wake up, Minato!

300
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:51,570
Ugh... Seriously, Minato Akira.

301
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:30,476
Shu-kun, you finally woke up.

302
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,512
Have some water.

303
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:36,616
Ah.

304
00:18:36,888 --> 00:18:37,717
The hot spring.

305
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,853
It's already past the time for bathing.

306
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:43,022
Sorry.

307
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:46,592
Oh, right!

308
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:52,164
Ta-da!

309
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:53,866
Isn't it amazing?

310
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:55,949
Yeah,

311
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:57,103
impressive.

312
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:58,137
You worked hard.

313
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,147
I'm being praised.

314
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:03,576
Well then, as a reward,

315
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:06,479
can I sleep with you tonight?

316
00:19:06,868 --> 00:19:07,613
Sure.

317
00:19:07,954 --> 00:19:09,081
Right...

318
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:10,966
Huh?

319
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:11,984
Really?

320
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:13,953
Yeah.

321
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:15,454
Sure.

322
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:39,145
Ah.

323
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:41,013
Wait.

324
00:19:41,156 --> 00:19:42,181
Before that...

325
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:53,993
What's this...?

326
00:19:54,249 --> 00:19:55,027
It

327
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:56,796
reminded me of you, so I got it.

328
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:07,106
You're giving this to me?

329
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,444
Why all of a sudden?

330
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,179
It's just...

331
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,449
I wanted to give something to you.

332
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,335
- Did you not like it?
- No!

333
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:25,191
I'm really happy!

334
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:27,093
Thank you, Shu-kun!

335
00:20:27,656 --> 00:20:28,561
I'm glad...

336
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:31,630
So,

337
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:33,265
should we sleep together then?

338
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,107
Actually, never mind.

339
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:45,945
Oh yeah,

340
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,547
let's talk, Shu-kun.

341
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:49,982
Talk?

342
00:20:50,255 --> 00:20:51,009
Yeah,

343
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:52,513
about the architecture

344
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:54,458
you want to see again,

345
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:57,490
and the countries you want to visit...

346
00:20:58,403 --> 00:20:59,738
those kinds of things.

347
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:05,131
Is that enough for you, Asuka?

348
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:07,079
Yes.

349
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,103
For now, this is more than enough.

350
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:42,368
(Minato - Kazuki)

351
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:57,049
Is Shin tired too?

352
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:58,884
Not really.

353
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,241
Aren't you the one

354
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:01,556
who's tired, Minato-san?

355
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,620
I can give you a massage.

356
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,689
It's okay, it's okay.

357
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,757
Today, as a special treat,

358
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,109
I'll give you a massage.

359
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,005
You see...

360
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,309
Sorry

361
00:22:24,445 --> 00:22:26,412
about last night, I caused you trouble.

362
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:29,882
Minato-san,

363
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:31,567
do you remember what

364
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:32,958
you said to me last night?

365
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,055
I don't remember.

366
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:37,857
Minato-san,

367
00:22:37,926 --> 00:22:39,280
you said if I were to disappear,

368
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:40,449
you would feel lonely.

369
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:42,194
You wanted to be called 'Akira, '

370
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:43,341
And that you love me,

371
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:44,419
you want me to stay by

372
00:22:44,451 --> 00:22:45,435
your side forever.

373
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,241
I didn't go that far!

374
00:22:47,294 --> 00:22:48,410
I just asked if you

375
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,579
wouldn't call me by my name!

376
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:51,370
So you do remember, after all.

377
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,076
There's still time.

378
00:22:57,572 --> 00:22:59,912
If you just say 'don't go, '

379
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,780
I'll stay in this house forever.

380
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:04,657
I won't say it.

381
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:06,852
And if you say 'hug me tight right now, '

382
00:23:06,877 --> 00:23:08,167
I'd hug you as many times as you want...

383
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:09,622
I won't say it!

384
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:12,057
You're stubborn.

385
00:23:20,223 --> 00:23:21,491
Oww!

386
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:22,301
That hurts!

387
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,384
Stubborn stains that won't come off

388
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:25,515
might just wash away at

389
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:26,789
the Minato Trading Laundromat.

390
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:28,463
Rinse off the past

391
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,043
and take a step forward.

392
00:23:31,636 --> 00:23:33,746
We'll be in your care next week as well.

393
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,481
Do your best tomorrow, Shin.

394
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,953
(Next episode)
Want anything for your birthday?

395
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:48,970
I don't expect anything

396
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,217
besides Minato-san.

397
00:24:50,217 --> 00:24:51,090
If say...

398
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,117
(Shin's birthday)
like or love me...

399
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:54,093
(their feelings)
I love you

400
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,762
(finally tied together)
so much that I can't breathe.

401
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,565
Minato-san, what should I do? Shin is...
