(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

2
00:00:01,473 --> 00:00:03,209
I inherited Minato Coin Laundry

3
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:04,734
from my grandfather,

4
00:00:04,841 --> 00:00:06,206
- Thank you very much.
- During the summer break,

5
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:08,865
we have received a lot of patronage.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,445
Minato-san, good work.

7
00:00:16,438 --> 00:00:18,285
Please enjoy this as a reward.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,989
Oh, thanks. You're thoughtful.

9
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:23,123
Well,

10
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:25,726
is the one I bought, though, right?

11
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:27,661
You noticed well, Minato-san.

12
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:29,396
Seriously, Shin...

13
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:31,898
Just because it's summer break doesn't

14
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:34,000
mean you have to stay here all the time.

15
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:37,484
I should go to the swimming club soon.

16
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:39,273
Are you leaving already?

17
00:00:42,602 --> 00:00:43,944
What's with that look?

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,244
I want to spend more time together.

19
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:47,180
I want to kiss you.

20
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:48,878
If things go well, I want to push...

21
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:50,117
You're so noisy!

22
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:51,485
But...

23
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:53,287
there are only three weeks left.

24
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,078
(The cohabitation is until

25
00:00:54,094 --> 00:00:54,859
the renovation is complete)

26
00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:57,691
Well,

27
00:00:58,122 --> 00:00:59,357
yeah.

28
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:00,827
Minato-san,

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,363
even now, can't we extend it?

30
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:04,571
I want to be together a little longer...

31
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:05,591
Nope.

32
00:01:06,193 --> 00:01:07,367
Why not?

33
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:09,509
Are you really, really sure?

34
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,735
Even if you make a cute face,

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,841
it can't be done.

36
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:15,909
Why?

37
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:17,206
Wasn't that the promise

38
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:18,464
from the beginning?

39
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:22,115
I won't change the conditions suddenly.

40
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:25,218
Well then, I'm off.

41
00:01:27,346 --> 00:01:28,889
Minato-san's stingy.

(Minato's Laundromat2)
(Episode 7)

43
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:31,918
I'm home!

44
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:35,522
Welcome back, Minato-san.

45
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:37,791
What the heck, all of a sudden!

46
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:39,426
I bought it with part-time job earnings.

47
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:40,742
I thought I'd record

48
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,550
your appearance thoroughly.

49
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,998
Whoa... what's this,

50
00:02:45,177 --> 00:02:46,133
delete it!

51
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:47,758
Can't do. It's too cute to delete,

52
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:49,095
so it's saved forever.

53
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:50,437
Huh?

54
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:52,906
Yeah.

55
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,441
Even an angry Minato-san is cute.

56
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:55,876
You, seriously!

57
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,928
Let me borrow it! I'll take one of you!

58
00:02:57,952 --> 00:02:59,946
No thanks, I don't need pictures of me.

59
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,049
Huh? That's unfair, just you!

60
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,018
- Sorry for making you wait.
- Ah, here you are.

61
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:06,386
Thank you very much.

62
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:08,221
Well then, cheers.

63
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,222
Cheers.

64
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:19,733
You're still not drinking alcohol, Shu?

65
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,302
Drinking makes me sleepy.

66
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,573
Do you perhaps prefer a different place?

67
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:27,641
It's fine.

68
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,885
I like cats.

69
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,639

(Prosperity)

71
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,680
Oh.

72
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:35,182
That's good.

73
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,751
So, how was your day today?

74
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,370
There's something

75
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:42,784
I want to ask Takayuki

76
00:03:43,413 --> 00:03:44,624
about Asuka.

77
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:46,393
Asuka-kun?

78
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,861
Umm...

79
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,263
Where should I begin?

80
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,234
Momotaro.

81
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,204
Momotaro?

82
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:58,739
Asuka said

83
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:00,058
it's fine to be a cat,

84
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,609
or a dog, a monkey or a pheasant.

85
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,312
So Momotaro,

86
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,247
is a cat?

87
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:08,115
But, as long as

88
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:10,984
they're by his side, it's fine.

89
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:12,786
So, I

90
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:15,222
thought that would be fine for me too.

91
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:18,558
But,

92
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:23,396
for some reason,

93
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,466
it's getting more and more painful...

94
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,836
Just being by his side

95
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:31,538
is difficult.

96
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,612
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:40,380
I still can't explain it well.

98
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:45,713
Here's your pickled vegetables. Enjoy.

99
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,020
Thank you very much.

100
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,726
Oh, that's right.

101
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:54,226
Speaking of Momotaro...

102
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,563
It's okay, no need to talk about it now.

103
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,597
No,

104
00:04:57,894 --> 00:04:59,366
for a long time,

105
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,390
you two have been like Momotaro.

106
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,036
Huh?

107
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:04,404
See...

108
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,685
Back when I was still

109
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,436
helping out at Sakuma,

110
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:09,169
Asuka-kun used to

111
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:11,255
follow behind Shu a lot.

112
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:14,281
His presence was so adorable.

113
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:16,550
Was it?

114
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,218
Huh?

115
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:19,686
Don't you remember?

116
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,561
When Asuka-kun was little,

117
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,386
he had a strong curiosity.

118
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:25,358
He often got scolded by his dad

119
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:27,627
and would come to the shop crying.

120
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:30,430
One day,

121
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:32,399
you gave him candy...

122
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:35,268
Here you go.

123
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:40,975
(Sakuma Shop)

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,036
From that day on,

125
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,377
he became really attached to you.

126
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:46,112
You were together every day...

127
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,181
It truly felt like

128
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:50,717
Momotaro and his companions.

129
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,086
That was...

130
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:55,889
I just didn't know what to do.

131
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:58,058
Even so,

132
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,160
it must have meant

133
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:02,184
a lot to Asuka-kun...

134
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,564
And you,

135
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,666
wanting him to smile like that.

136
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:09,228
You probably still keep one of those

137
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:10,603
in your pocket, don't you?

138
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:14,808
This...

139
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:17,310
It's just a habit...

140
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,729
Shu, you really love Asuka-kun,

141
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:24,745
don't you?

142
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:41,680
What's wrong suddenly?

143
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:06,026
There's something I want to talk about.

144
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:10,096
Asuka...

145
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:11,932
Actually, I...

146
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:18,338
I saw it.

147
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,741
Asuka was with a girl at the cafe.

148
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:24,626
Huh?

149
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:28,214
We're dating now,

150
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,150
right?

151
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:33,019
At that time,

152
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,449
you said you were going

153
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:35,933
to start dating her, right?

154
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,025
Is that true?

155
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,864
Huh... Shu-kun, you saw?

156
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,153
Since then,

157
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:50,470
I couldn't help but worry about you...

158
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:52,382
I couldn't focus on my

159
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:54,094
architectural studies.

160
00:07:58,356 --> 00:07:59,312
If possible,

161
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:02,048
I want you to explain it properly.

162
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:06,319
No, wait a second.

163
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,823
Could it be...

164
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,794
were you jealous?

165
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,465
Huh?

166
00:08:18,558 --> 00:08:19,632
Because maybe,

167
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,368
aside from architecture,

168
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,722
you were thinking about me all the time?

169
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:24,637
Wait!

170
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,172
Don't change the subject!

171
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:27,430
Sorry!

172
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:30,076
But it's not like that!

173
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:31,991
A friend asked me to

174
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:33,873
pretend to be her boyfriend!

175
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:38,218
Huh... just that?

176
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:40,355
Isn't it obvious?

177
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,056
The only one I like is

178
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,091
you, Shu-kun.

179
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,635
Do you believe me?

180
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,241
I believe you,

181
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,843
but it's just... kind of strange.

182
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,349
Just now...

183
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,787
I felt a bit happy.

184
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:19,059
Shu-kun...

185
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,897
Shu-kun!

186
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:24,597
Hey.

187
00:09:25,156 --> 00:09:27,699
Hey, Asuka, stop it, it tickles.

188
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:31,071
No! Because I'm happy!

189
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,423
Huh?

190
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,292
Good morning.

191
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:53,793
Ah...

192
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,096
Good morning.

193
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:01,267
- Hey!
- Alright.

194
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,735
What do you mean, 'alright'?

195
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,874
Hey!

196
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,110
What are you doing?

197
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:13,379
Hey, ignoring me? Don't ignore me!

198
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:17,280
Hey,

199
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:18,952
you should help too.

200
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:20,520
And stop taking pictures!

201
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:21,705
Nice expression.

202
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:29,764
Why are you taking so many

203
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,084
random pictures?

204
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:33,084
For me, every moment with

205
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:34,514
you is special, Minato-san.

206
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:36,967
Sure, sure.

207
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,975
- What's this?
- Oh,

208
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:43,500
that's the cup you drank water

209
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:44,719
from this morning.

210
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,900
You're taking it too far!

211
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,890
I wish I took a snap

212
00:10:49,907 --> 00:10:50,920
when you choked just now.

213
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:51,851
Can you do it again?

214
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:52,952
Are you serious?

215
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:53,909
By the way,

216
00:10:54,064 --> 00:10:55,594
why don't you take pictures

217
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:56,836
of something else?

218
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:58,591
Like when we go out somewhere.

219
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:01,628
Then take me with you, Minato-san.

220
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:02,432
Huh,

221
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:04,230
well, fine...

222
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:06,366
Is there anywhere you want to go?

223
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:08,768
I...

224
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,703
want to go to a hot spring.

225
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:12,005
A hot spring?

226
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,339
Yes.

227
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:14,741
Is it not okay?

228
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:17,177
A hot spring with Shin...

229
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,448
Just the two of us...

230
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,809
No, it's still a no!

231
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:51,644
Definitely a no!

232
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:53,119
Why?

233
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,747
We're living together,

234
00:11:54,771 --> 00:11:56,849
you're embarrassed about a hot spring?

235
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,969
Could it be that you have

236
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,019
some strange imagination?

237
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:02,689
I don't, and I definitely don't!

238
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,090
Anyway,

239
00:12:04,286 --> 00:12:05,892
if it's a no, it's a no!

240
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,730
Oh, it's already this late.

241
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:11,898
I need to go soon.

242
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,066
Running away again?

243
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,000
Shut up!

244
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:15,602
You should be studying at home!

245
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:18,671
Thanks for the meal!

246
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:22,942
Hey, Shin-chan.

247
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:24,611
What's with the shopping bags?

248
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:25,784
Yeah.

249
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:27,887
Hey, wait up!

250
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:29,048
What?

251
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,486
Do you have anything you want to ask me?

252
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:36,198
Like, what happened between

253
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,090
you and Shu-kun after that?

254
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:39,592
Something like that.

255
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:41,237
From the looks of it,

256
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,604
it seem to be going well.

257
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,431
Come on, show a bit more interest.

258
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,102
Well, I guess it's true.

259
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:52,698
We've finally taken a step forward.

260
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:54,774
At this rate,

261
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:57,977
we might even surpass you and Akira-san.

262
00:12:58,665 --> 00:12:59,879
- Huh?
- Oh.

263
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:02,081
Just kidding.

264
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:04,083
Why are you so moody?

265
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:07,654
Oh, right.

266
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:11,291
Even though you're living together,

267
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,661
you still have

268
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,563
separate bedrooms.

269
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:19,672
You're talking as if

270
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:20,995
you're making any progress.

271
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:21,868
Huh?

272
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,925
Oh? I've traveled with Shu-kun,

273
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,950
you know,

274
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:26,901
and I've seen his incredibly

275
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:28,605
adorable sleeping face!

276
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,097
The one with the cutest

277
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:31,344
sleeping face is Minato-san!

278
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:34,747
- Shu-kun!
- Minato-san!

279
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,993
Anyway, more importantly...

280
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:40,186
What now?

281
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:41,387
I actually

282
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,490
came up with a pretty good idea.

283
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,192
Huh?

284
00:13:47,356 --> 00:13:49,228
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

285
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:50,697
Don't fool around.

286
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,698
Yes.

287
00:13:57,054 --> 00:13:58,805
(Minato-san, I'm sorry)
Minato-san, I'm sorry.

288
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:00,340
About tonight's dinner,

289
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:02,369
is it okay if I eat out and come back?

290
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,513
(Sure, that's fine)
Sure, that's fine.

291
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:14,921
Yeah,

292
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:16,889
just finished.

293
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,526
Asuka,

294
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:22,528
make sure you study well too.

295
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:30,370
Oh…

296
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:31,571
Thank you for your hard work.

297
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:32,772
Thank you for your hard work.

298
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,175
So, you're able to talk to Hanabusa now?

299
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,312
It's still a bit…

300
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:42,215
It's hard to make eye contact, but...

301
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:46,185
But...

302
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:48,388
I feel like I understand a little now.

303
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,857
What Asuka

304
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,693
had been trying to tell me

305
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,387
all this time.

306
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,798
So from now on,

307
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:02,201
I want to return those feelings too.

308
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:07,640
I'm not sure if I can return

309
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:09,499
the same amount of feelings

310
00:15:09,515 --> 00:15:10,944
that Asuka gives me, but...

311
00:15:14,384 --> 00:15:16,416
Even if it's not the same amount,

312
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:19,024
just being able to be together

313
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,080
is happiness,

314
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:21,854
I believe.

315
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,657
Of course,

316
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:26,959
I might want more,

317
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,807
or seeking something beyond

318
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,256
what we have now.

319
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,267
But still,

320
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:37,076
including the times

321
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,513
when we struggle like this,

322
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:42,080
I think it's happiness.

323
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:50,082
Is that so?

324
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:52,708
Yes.

325
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:54,587
Something like that.

326
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:15,970
Minato-san, I'll be eating out again

327
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:17,363
today and coming back late.

328
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:19,319
Sorry for the late notice.

329
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,847
Again?

330
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,021
Something's weird…

331
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:30,890
that guy Shin.

332
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,006
He wanted to be together

333
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:35,209
so much until recently.

334
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:37,597
What's been going on lately?

335
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:47,840
It's quiet

336
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:50,076
when you're alone.

337
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:10,630
Sleeping, huh?

338
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,668
Geez, can't be helped, I guess.

339
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,035
Minato-san…

340
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:01,213
Hey, Shin!

341
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,461
Good morning.

342
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:49,795
Good morning.

343
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,197
The bento is ready,

344
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:52,632
just wait a moment.

345
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:54,467
Sure, thanks.

346
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:57,203
Sorry.

347
00:18:57,773 --> 00:18:59,138
Don't worry about it.

348
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:00,873
Getting 300 kisses from you

349
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,006
is more than enough.

350
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,100
Are you so greedy or something?

351
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:08,314
Here you go.

352
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:10,316
Well, then, do your best today too.

353
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:22,828
Uh, hey...

354
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:24,196
Shin.

355
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:26,866
One more lap!

356
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,067
Do your best!

357
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:33,072
Last lap!

358
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:34,477
Thanks for your hard work.

359
00:19:34,502 --> 00:19:35,408
How is it?

360
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:37,008
Use your shoulders more.

361
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:38,097
Not just the arms,

362
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:39,142
but the entire shoulder.

363
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:40,012
Make them broader.

364
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:41,097
Utilize the strength

365
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:42,280
from your shoulders.

366
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:43,416
Thanks for your hard work.

367
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,284
Thanks for your hard work.

368
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:48,988
Shintaro-kun,

369
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,890
thank you very much for today.

370
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:53,325
Your help was greatly appreciated.

371
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:54,226
Not at all.

372
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:01,734
Um…

373
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:03,690
Sakuma-sensei…

374
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,779
I need to talk to you about something.

375
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:07,940
Yes,

376
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:09,275
what is it?

377
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:13,144
Well…

378
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:16,082
Actually…

379
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,218
Shin and I are…

380
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,261
Da...

381
00:20:28,588 --> 00:20:29,562
Da...

382
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:30,663
Da...

383
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:31,997
Ah.

384
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:33,466
Both enjoy fishing!

385
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,569
- No.That's not it…
- Oh, I'm sorry.

386
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:38,596
Da...

387
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:40,172
Da?

388
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:41,073
Da...

389
00:20:41,097 --> 00:20:42,641
The grateful crane?

390
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:45,044
- No.
- No? Not that…

391
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:46,946
Your nails grow too fast?

392
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:47,969
- Better take it off.
- That's not it.

393
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:48,848
- No...
- It's not like that.

394
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,784
The lotus root inside the chicken balls.

395
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:53,586
You see...

396
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,288
Actually...

397
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:00,549
Shin and I are…

398
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,599
dating!

399
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,775
Oh!

400
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:18,110
I see.

401
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,980
That's great!

402
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:24,283
You two make a wonderful couple!

403
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:28,087
Minato-san.

404
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:30,210
Akira-kun, Shintaro-kun,

405
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:31,675
congratulations.

406
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:34,593
I'll be cheering for both of you always.

407
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:39,086
Thank you very much.

408
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:07,359
Thank you for today.

409
00:22:08,438 --> 00:22:09,995
I was really happy.

410
00:22:11,232 --> 00:22:12,419
It's not like I said it

411
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:13,903
just because you said it.

412
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:15,467
I said it because I wanted to,

413
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:17,069
on my own accord!

414
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:19,839
Right.

415
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,441
I also have something to report.

416
00:22:22,816 --> 00:22:23,642
Huh?

417
00:22:24,597 --> 00:22:25,511
'First Prize Hot Springs Trip (for 4).'
Here you go.

418
00:22:26,766 --> 00:22:27,479
Huh?

419
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,081
This is...

420
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:30,082
Actually,

421
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:32,585
I really wanted this travel voucher...

422
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,453
With Hanabusa's help,

423
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:36,455
I've been eating out every day,

424
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,923
collecting raffle tickets.

425
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:41,268
That's why you've been

426
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:42,527
eating out so much.

427
00:22:42,552 --> 00:22:43,362
Yes...

428
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,602
And finally, I won!

429
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:50,569
'First Prize Hot Springs Trip (for 4).'

430
00:22:50,873 --> 00:22:52,945
Let's go together, Minato-san.

431
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,640
Huh?

432
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,912
We have tickets for four people,

433
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:57,743
so let's invite Hanabusa and Shu...

434
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,378
That's okay, right?

435
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,152
Fine, I guess…

436
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:08,704
Alright.

437
00:23:08,728 --> 00:23:09,688
Really?

438
00:23:10,392 --> 00:23:11,890
Yeah. Let's go.

439
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:13,959
Yes!

440
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:21,769
But, it's with everyone! All of us!

441
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:22,867
I know that!

442
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,069
Summer memories are

443
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:25,971
made at Minato Coin Laundry.

444
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,949
Entrust us with your peaceful and

445
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:29,628
warm everyday moments.

446
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:31,710
(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)
Leave it to us.

447
00:23:32,335 --> 00:23:34,680
We'll be in your care next week.

448
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:45,436
(Next episode)

449
00:24:45,436 --> 00:24:47,152
(Hot spring in the middle of summer!)
Hot spring with Shin,

450
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:48,483
will it be okay?

451
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:50,689
We didn't come here to play.

452
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:51,915
Seriously?

453
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,926
Do you really have to go?

454
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:56,095
(The overflowing direction of feelings)
Tonight we sleep in the same room.

455
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:57,863
If you disappear...

456
00:24:57,957 --> 00:24:59,264
I'll be lonely.
