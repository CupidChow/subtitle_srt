was established 31 years ago.

4
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:07,273
This year, the season has come

5
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,385
to meet Minato Akira once again.

6
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:11,518
Minato-san.

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,146
Oh, Shin.

8
00:00:13,436 --> 00:00:15,516
The swim team practice is today, right?

9
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:16,799
Here, I made a bento,

10
00:00:16,824 --> 00:00:18,605
so please eat it if you like.

11
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:19,720
A bento box?

12
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:21,655
You made that for me?

13
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:24,605
Make sure to drink plenty of fluids

14
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,310
to avoid heat fatigue,

15
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:28,222
I packed candies for replenishing salt,

16
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:29,563
spare towels,

17
00:00:29,587 --> 00:00:31,089
a change of clothes made of

18
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:32,402
breathable material.

19
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:34,816
Did you apply sunscreen, yet?

20
00:00:34,824 --> 00:00:35,602
I can help.

21
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:36,904
I'll be fine,

22
00:00:36,928 --> 00:00:38,340
you worry too much.

23
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:39,640
Thanks, Shin.

24
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,175
I'm off then.

25
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:43,877
Take care.

(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

27
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,825
Geez,

28
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,648
you're so overprotective.

29
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:07,134
Alright, it's the final lap. Go for it!

30
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:09,503
Don't relax until it's over.

31
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,471
Good. Keep it up!

32
00:01:12,217 --> 00:01:14,708
Go for it! Do you best!

33
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:15,776
Excellent!

35
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:31,778
You really look like a coach now.

36
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:32,859
No.

37
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:35,295
I'm still not that great.

38
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:37,112
I'm grateful that you agreed

39
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:39,218
to be the coach again this year.

40
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:40,432
Let's do our best together

41
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:41,950
until the competition.

42
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:43,385
I'm also happy to be a part

43
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:44,831
of the swim team again.

44
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:46,126
I'll be in your care.

45
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:47,140
Likewise.

46
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,515
Wow!

47
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,828
Such a cute bento box!

48
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,654
This LOVE is well done.

49
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,325
It means I LOVE rice, you see.

50
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:07,227
Oh.

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,129
I see.

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,199
Why is it not okay?

53
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:13,600
Why?

54
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,525
It's embarrassing.

55
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:19,272
I'm just an ordinary 30-something.

56
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:21,021
You're not an ordinary 30-something.

57
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:22,456
You're a cute 30-something.

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,933
What's embarrassing about an adult

59
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,355
enjoying a cute bento box?

60
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:29,616
You're still as unyielding as ever.

61
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,518
You should just say

62
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:32,987
that this is the bento box

63
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:35,034
that my beloved Shin made.

64
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:39,092
Like I can say something like that!

65
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:43,027
I got it.

66
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,683
I'll stop from making cute bento

67
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:45,948
starting from tomorrow.

68
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:48,168
But in return...

69
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:49,903
Please repay me for the bento box.

70
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:51,471
Repay with what?

71
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,540
Tell me you like me.

72
00:02:54,126 --> 00:02:55,242
Huh?

73
00:02:55,304 --> 00:02:57,110
Isn't it okay to do that occasionally?

74
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,346
Look at me properly

75
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:01,481
and say "I like you, Shin."

76
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:09,156
Stop saying stupid things like that!

77
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,160
Thank you for the food.

78
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,002
Then give me a hug.

79
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:25,560
What? Why all of a sudden...

80
00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:28,075
Even though I like you so much,

81
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,943
No matter what words I use,

82
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:32,036
it feels insufficient.

83
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,315
Do you know

84
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:38,485
how much I like you?

85
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:44,157
I do.

86
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:47,494
It's a lie.

87
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:50,397
You don't.

88
00:03:51,092 --> 00:03:52,099
Hey!

89
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:06,213
It's not enough just to hug.

90
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:13,186
I need to be closer.

91
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:22,996
Wait, it's a call, Shin!

92
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:27,367
It's from Sakurako!

93
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,769
Answer it quickly!

94
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:31,905
What happened, Sakurako?

95
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,008
Are you crying?

96
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:37,544
That sounds serious!

97
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:39,312
You should go quickly!

98
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,015
I'll come over right now.

99
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:43,784
See you soon.

100
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:48,054
Then...

101
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,489
I'm off.

102
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:02,369
My heart can't handle this.

103
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,925
"Minato's Laundromat 2."

104
00:06:06,135 --> 00:06:07,067
Good morning.

105
00:06:07,364 --> 00:06:08,368
Good morning.

106
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,330
I woke up late,

107
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:10,676
I couldn't make the bento today.

108
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:12,412
It's fine. Don't worry.

109
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:14,975
More importantly, is Sakurako okay?

110
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,692
She had a fight with her boyfriend.

111
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:18,158
She vented her frustrations at me

112
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:19,623
non-stop until around 4 am.

113
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,252
She felt better after venting.

114
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:22,315
I see.

115
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,121
Then I'm off.

116
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:25,552
Don't forget the towel and bottle.

117
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:27,120
I know that.

118
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:28,722
I'm not a kid.

119
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:40,700
That guy...

120
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:44,070
He forgot something instead.

121
00:06:57,445 --> 00:06:59,452
Can't we really study together?

122
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:04,291
We decided

123
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:05,926
to start dating.

124
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:08,828
What

125
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,931
was that?

126
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:17,103
Shu-kun, I like you.

127
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:27,413
(Can't we really study together?)

128
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:30,083
(Shu-kun, I like you.)
Why won't you reply to me?

129
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,022
Asuka.

130
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:36,289
- Oh.
- Are you alone?

131
00:07:36,313 --> 00:07:37,057
Yeah.

132
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:39,242
Sorry for asking you something weird

133
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:40,387
the other day.

134
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:42,128
Pretend lover?

135
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:43,150
Yeah.

136
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,899
My senior at work is being persistent.

137
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:47,968
I'm in trouble...

138
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,337
Please?

139
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:52,439
Can you help me?

140
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,075
Don't worry too much.

141
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:57,235
What happens after that?

142
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:58,998
Are you being harassed or anything?

143
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,582
No, thanks to you, I'm really relieved.

144
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:03,650
Thanks.

145
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:06,953
Hey,

146
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,022
How about going out for a meal?

147
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:11,166
I'll treat you as a thank you.

148
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:13,727
Ah,

149
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,629
Sorry, I'll pass.

150
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:18,765
I have some studying to do.

151
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,368
I see.

152
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:23,269
I'm off.

153
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:25,238
- Do your best then.
- Yes. Thank you.

154
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,040
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

155
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:37,384
Asuka's little liar.

156
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:38,952
Huh?

157
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:40,920
Why?

158
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:45,108
(Keyaki University)

159
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:46,997
Even though I'm here to

160
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:48,694
bring Shin his phone,

161
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,363
could it be that...

162
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,799
am I lost?

163
00:09:04,954 --> 00:09:07,113
I can't find him at all.

164
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:10,016
Should I ambush him at the cafeteria?

165
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:12,018
Kazuki-kun!

166
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:17,429
We're going to karaoke. Wanna join?

167
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:19,292
Why are am I hiding?

168
00:09:19,694 --> 00:09:21,261
I still have classes.

169
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:23,963
We can go some other time.

170
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:26,299
Then let's exchange contact information.

171
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:29,035
I left my phone behind today, sorry.

172
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,504
Oh, I see...

173
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,273
I'll invite you again next time.

174
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:36,176
Shin...

175
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,812
Can't you be a bit more friendly?

176
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,800
Minato-san.

177
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:52,307
What are you doing?

178
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:53,791
Huh?

179
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:56,162
Oh, your phone...

180
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,797
Come over here for a moment.

181
00:09:58,623 --> 00:09:59,666
What's going on?

182
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,135
Just hide, please.

183
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:04,008
That was close.

184
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:06,072
What's going on?

185
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:07,140
Seriously, Minato-san,

186
00:10:07,164 --> 00:10:08,975
why did you come here on your own?

187
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:10,577
Why?

188
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:13,876
I just wanted to return your phone.

189
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:14,781
Here.

190
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,316
Thank you.

191
00:10:16,652 --> 00:10:17,617
But for me,

192
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,686
a day without a phone is fine.

193
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,155
From now on, no need to delivery it.

194
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,189
Why?

195
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,092
Are you angry?

196
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:27,695
It's not that I'm angry,

197
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:29,992
Sorry, class is about to begin.

198
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:31,041
I must hurry.

199
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,258
Just don't come to

200
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:33,954
the university anymore.

201
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:36,117
If someone here approaches you,

202
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:37,342
just ignore it.

203
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,805
Hey!

204
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,475
Huh?

205
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:47,580
What's wrong with Shin?

206
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:50,316
I went to deliver it, and yet...

207
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:52,652
He didn't have to hate it like that.

208
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:54,954
Good morning!

209
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:55,955
Good morning!

210
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,249
Coach is wearing another

211
00:10:57,274 --> 00:10:58,311
weird T-shirt today.

212
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:00,187
Today, "Takoyaki" is printed on it.

213
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,027
Huh?

214
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,393
Could it be...

215
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:11,938
because of me?

216
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,909
(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

217
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:24,517
Seriously! Ugh!

218
00:11:24,603 --> 00:11:26,553
(Shu-kun)
Why won't he pick up?

219
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:29,756
Asuka.

220
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:31,424
You're here?

221
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:32,892
Yeah.

222
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:36,896
Perfect timing!

223
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,672
There's something I want to ask!

224
00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:40,266
Huh?

225
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,734
From your perspective...

226
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:43,636
I mean...

227
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:45,638
How do you see me?

228
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:48,541
Huh?

229
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:51,177
Someone older like me

230
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:52,345
is no good?

231
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,515
Huh?

232
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,484
Like, the pattern on my T-shirt.

233
00:11:58,508 --> 00:11:59,786
The length of my hair.

234
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,623
I've been eating delicious food lately,

235
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,024
Am I fat?

236
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:06,359
What do you think?

237
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,696
It doesn't matter how you are.

238
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:11,305
Besides, I don't have time

239
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:12,849
for this right now.

240
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,489
Don't say cold things like that.

241
00:12:15,498 --> 00:12:18,004
You can consult with me sometimes.

242
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:19,639
So that's it?

243
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,708
You guys of your age are...

244
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:24,444
embarrassed to be with someone like me?

245
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:26,521
Yes!

246
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,714
I suppose.

247
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:29,482
Probably embarrassing.

248
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,255
I see...

249
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,325
I guess that's how it is.

250
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,104
Huh?

251
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:48,701
Wait a minute, Akira-san!

252
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,370
Let's go.

253
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,397
Let's go.

254
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,006
My boyfriend cheated on me again.

255
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,840
Huh?

256
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:55,408
How cruel.

257
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:57,510
He's seeing someone else?

258
00:12:57,534 --> 00:12:59,534
Yes. Unbelievable, right?

259
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,190
He even said he liked me so much.

260
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,117
It's the worst!

261
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,755
Yes, unbelievable!

262
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,791
Because I like Shu-kun.

263
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:17,130
We decided to start dating.

264
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:20,466
I like you,

265
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,701
(I like you, Shu-kun.)
Shu-kun.

266
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:41,676
(Asuka)

267
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,314
Are you not going to answer?

268
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:47,760
I don't feel like talking right now.

269
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:48,961
No, rather,

270
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:51,264
I don't know what to say.

271
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:53,066
Huh?

272
00:13:57,526 --> 00:13:59,379
(Asuka)

273
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:05,645
"There is no new creation in the world."

274
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:06,546
"There is only"

275
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,348
"discovering what already exists."

276
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,282
Shu-san.

277
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,818
That's a quote by Antoni Gaudí.

278
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:12,685
He believed that

279
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,073
all structures in art should

280
00:14:14,098 --> 00:14:15,778
be learned from nature,

281
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:17,488
and beautiful forms

282
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:18,624
are naturally created.

283
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:19,858
He thought the answers

284
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:21,928
were all within nature.

285
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:25,522
I didn't expect to discover

286
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:27,280
these emotions in myself.

287
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:28,501
Like...

288
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,103
Like this...

289
00:14:31,952 --> 00:14:33,005
What do you mean?

290
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:34,607
Something like this...

291
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,179
I don't know it myself.

292
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:49,756
Sagrada Família.

293
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:51,724
That is...

294
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:53,842
A place...

295
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:55,094
Shu-kun.

296
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:57,558
It is a place where his

297
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,583
structural ideas are embodied.

298
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:01,834
Huh?

299
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:03,035
What does this mean?

300
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:05,605
He doesn't even answer my calls!

301
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:09,142
Why is he so cheerful?

302
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,517
What's this...?

303
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,453
Shu-kun is an idiot.

304
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:27,717
(Men's fashion, August issue)

305
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:31,431
I see.

306
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,467
So, this is what's trendy now.

307
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:39,172
So troubling.

308
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:43,276
Oww, that hurt.

309
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,377
I'm back...

310
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:51,384
Welcome home.

311
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:53,910
What were you up to?

312
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,654
Huh?

313
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,056
Your breathing is heavy.

314
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,626
I was just cleaning up a bit

315
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,561
you know?

316
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:03,596
But the place is messy.

317
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,265
That's not it.

318
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,935
Anyway, the bath is ready.

319
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,403
Quickly go and take it.

320
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:22,782
Minato-san, breakfast is ready.

321
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:24,750
Yeah.

322
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:26,986
It's different from usual...

323
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:29,989
Different?

324
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,675
You always look cute no matter

325
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:32,826
what hairstyle you have.

326
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,194
No. It's not like that...

327
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:36,629
What do you mean?

328
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,898
It's nothing, just forget it.

329
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,377
Sorry.

330
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:52,845
I'll be a bit late.

331
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:54,647
Please have dinner first.

332
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:02,368
Hanabusa.

333
00:17:05,422 --> 00:17:06,325
Hey.

334
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,660
Why are you ignoring me?

335
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:09,314
Don't touch me, don't look at me,

336
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,396
don't breathe.

337
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,163
Huh?

338
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:13,332
Wait a minute.

339
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:15,601
What?

340
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:16,903
Nothing.

341
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,371
Since yesterday,

342
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,773
there's something off with Minato-san.

343
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,837
Do you know anything about it?

344
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:25,678
I don't know.

345
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,492
Wait a minute, Shin.

346
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:43,229
In order for Shin to not be embarrassed,

347
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,370
at least I should dress up nicely.

348
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:02,715
Ugh, it's no good.

349
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:04,530
I can't figure out

350
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:05,866
what's the right choice.

351
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:14,393
So tiring.

352
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:20,199
(Minato Shouji Coin Laundry)

353
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,259
Welcome back, Minato-san.

354
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,897
Shin.

355
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,387
I already heard from Hanabusa

356
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:31,677
that you are worried

357
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:33,075
that I told you not to come

358
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,411
to the university.

359
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,583
That Asuka...

360
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:38,851
Is it true?

361
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:41,988
Yes.

362
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,490
You see...

363
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:47,660
I'm sorry, Shin.

364
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,763
I...

365
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:54,333
didn't understand your feelings at all.

366
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,104
And I made you feel embarrassed.

367
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,708
You really don't understand at all.

368
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:08,347
I'm sorry.

369
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:09,548
That's not it.

370
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:12,518
About feeling embarrassed ny you,

371
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:14,520
do you really think so?

372
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:16,789
Huh?

373
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:18,424
Well...

374
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:20,326
You forbade me...

375
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:21,794
From coming to university.

376
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:22,728
I mean it.

377
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:23,828
But that's because.

378
00:19:23,853 --> 00:19:25,564
Minato-san is too cute.

379
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:26,999
Huh?

380
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:28,949
Both your appearance

381
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,302
and personality,

382
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:32,138
everything about you is cute.

383
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,473
It's too dangerous for the average person,

384
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,176
I've been trained so it's okay.

385
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,342
If the cute Minato-san

386
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:39,516
goes to university,

387
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,586
who knows what will happen?

388
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:43,006
Maybe a younger guy like me will

389
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:44,355
fall in love at first sight

390
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,606
and come to the laundromat to bother you.

391
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,225
Huh?

392
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:51,090
Do not "huh?" please. Seriously.

393
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:53,893
You really don't know about yourself.

394
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:56,629
Wait a minute.

395
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:58,189
I don't even understand

396
00:19:58,206 --> 00:19:59,557
half of what you said.

397
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,934
Basically...

398
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,236
I don't want it to be seen

399
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,538
or taken away,

400
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:07,807
my precious treasure.

401
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:10,783
Treasure? Who are you talking about?

402
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:11,742
Minato-san.

403
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:18,517
I give up.

404
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:22,888
You're such a hopeless fool.

405
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,659
What's so funny?

406
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,943
I was serious.

407
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:28,961
I know, I know.

408
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,796
I got it.

409
00:20:31,405 --> 00:20:33,432
Thanks for worrying about me.

410
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:35,201
Shin-chan!

411
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,010
I got really worried.

412
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,614
Sorry for making you misunderstand.

413
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:50,382
But...

414
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:52,251
I'm glad, though.

415
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:53,185
Huh?

416
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:54,487
Because Minato-san

417
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,790
tried to dress up for my sake.

418
00:21:01,284 --> 00:21:02,495
The hairstyles.

419
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,196
And the clothes.

420
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,934
Thinking that you did all this for me...

421
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:19,612
It's way too cute.

422
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:26,252
Are you insane?

423
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:28,788
You're such a hopeless fool.

424
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:31,624
No matter how you dress,

425
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:33,292
my feelings won't change.

426
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,027
So...

427
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:36,395
in front of me.

428
00:21:36,535 --> 00:21:38,164
Please be yourself,

429
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:39,503
Minato-san.

430
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:46,438
Enough!

431
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,606
Come on!

432
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:49,341
Let's head back now.

433
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:51,309
Let's go.

434
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:53,212
Minato-san, let me enter too.

435
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:55,381
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

436
00:21:55,405 --> 00:21:56,354
I forgot to look at

437
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,183
the weather forecast.

438
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:58,184
Seriously...

439
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,218
Let me carry it.

440
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:00,553
Thank you.

441
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:02,021
You'll get wet.

442
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:04,623
I'm doing it.

443
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,206
I feel more at ease in this one

444
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:18,231
after all.

445
00:22:28,261 --> 00:22:30,783
Minato-san, I'll head out first.

446
00:22:31,072 --> 00:22:32,628
I made this bento for you.

447
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:34,333
Please take it with you.

448
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:43,521
Oh, that was close.

449
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:53,906
Four sports drinks.

450
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,374
Two cold brew coffee.

451
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,657
Four towels.

452
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:00,610
Good weather today.

453
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,781
Minato Shouji Coin Laundry,

454
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:05,050
happily operating today as well,

455
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:06,819
Alright.

456
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,487
It should be enough.

457
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:10,222
I'll head back then.

458
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,057
Shintaro!

459
00:23:15,236 --> 00:23:15,928
Hey.

460
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,596
- How are you? It's been a while.
- Yes.

461
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,420
It's been a while.

462
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,402
Is everything okay?

463
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:20,204
Yes.

464
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:22,534
Huh?

465
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,203
It's just...

466
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:26,014
Be careful of sudden

467
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,131
rain in the evening.

468
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:29,475
Who's that?

469
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,344
We'll be in your care next week as well.

470
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,418
(Next episode)
What is it, Shintaro?

471
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:47,809
Shintaro?

472
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,722
(Cause of heartache)
When I think of Asuka,

473
00:24:49,844 --> 00:24:51,326
my heart aches.

474
00:24:51,326 --> 00:24:52,483
Minato-san...

475
00:24:52,483 --> 00:24:54,442
There wasn't a time without any pain.

476
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:55,773
Someone that I can consult...

477
00:24:55,773 --> 00:24:57,094
is only Kirihara-sensei.

478
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:59,231
No matter what, teacher is by your side.
