1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:01,735
Minato-san,

2
00:00:01,871 --> 00:00:03,504
what should we do?

3
00:00:05,268 --> 00:00:06,006
Oh,

4
00:00:06,362 --> 00:00:07,587
you're right.

5
00:00:08,628 --> 00:00:09,576
Umm...

6
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,846
This is not the time to be nervous.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,982
I must date Shin

8
00:00:15,378 --> 00:00:17,378
and remind him about us.

9
00:00:20,983 --> 00:00:22,055
Alright.

10
00:00:22,878 --> 00:00:25,926
Today, we'll do whatever you like.

11
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:28,328
It's fine.

12
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:30,197
Let's do whatever you like.

13
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,308
That won't do.

14
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:33,367
Why?

15
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:35,202
Why?

16
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:36,837
Come on,

17
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:38,405
tell me where you want to go.

18
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,208
Then...

19
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:44,311
A haunted house.

20
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:45,812
Huh?

21
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,115
Huh?

22
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:50,911
"Minat's Laundromat2"
(Episode 11)

23
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:56,149
Please drink this.

24
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:01,254
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:03,724
Minato-san,

26
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,759
you're scared of ghosts?

27
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:07,461
What are you saying?

28
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,364
There's no way I'm scared.

29
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,099
This is nothing.

30
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:13,367
Absolutely nothing.

31
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:15,202
It's nothing...

32
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,571
That doesn't seem to be the case.

33
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,142
Right.

34
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:25,935
I instantly regret entering

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,660
even for three seconds.

36
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,084
Are you really an adult?

37
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,167
Quiet you.

38
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:43,497
Let's have a lot of fun today.

39
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,132
Yeah?

40
00:02:46,826 --> 00:02:47,535
Yes.

41
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:51,471
(Ring toss corner)

42
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:56,510
Shin.

43
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:57,724
You toss it.

44
00:02:58,493 --> 00:02:59,146
Yes.

45
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:03,049
(Ring toss corner)

46
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:05,719
Congratulations, this is the prize.

47
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,154
Thank you.

48
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,023
That was awesome, Shin!

49
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:12,893
Minato-san is just terrible.

50
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,263
Don't say that I'm terrible.

51
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,032
Let's go.

52
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:20,366
Yes.

53
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,969
I'll give this to you.

54
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:25,739
It looks like Minato-san.

55
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:27,641
Is that alright?

56
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:30,577
What do you mean by that?

57
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:33,180
I mean exactly what I said.

58
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,174
The way the eat bamboo?

59
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:40,834
No.

60
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:42,522
Cute like a panda...

61
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:44,324
Huh?

62
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:46,827
Ah.

63
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:47,994
Nothing.

64
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,110
Shin, you...

65
00:03:51,577 --> 00:03:52,699
Did you remember something?

66
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,804
Not at all.

67
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,107
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:03,910
No need to apologize.

69
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:05,479
Come on, let's go!

70
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:06,646
Yes.

71
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:14,254
How is it?

72
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,355
Umm...

73
00:04:15,697 --> 00:04:16,916
Doesn't look good.

74
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:18,725
Really?

75
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,287
But...

76
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:22,928
Regardless, Shin will eventually

77
00:04:22,953 --> 00:04:24,633
remember Minato-san.

78
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:27,067
That's why, Tachibana-kun,

79
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:28,468
let's have fun on a date.

80
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:29,736
Since we're already here.

81
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:33,059
You're not pushing yourself?

82
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:35,108
No, I'm not.

83
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:37,077
Well, Sakurako,

84
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:39,513
you left your bag here.

85
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:40,814
Ah...

86
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:42,249
Sorry.

87
00:04:42,684 --> 00:04:44,451
Let's do what you want.

88
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:45,852
Because today I...

89
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:48,321
will carry your bag for you.

90
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:49,890
Tachibana-kun.

91
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:51,358
Oh!

92
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:52,726
Just don't forget me

93
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:55,028
along with the bag.

94
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:57,397
I won't forget.

95
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:01,301
Seriously?

96
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:02,536
Oww!

97
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:04,137
I'm pushing!

98
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,640
That's enough!

99
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:07,841
You lose!

100
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:10,310
Shin.

101
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:11,812
Come and try it.

102
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,017
You win!

103
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:18,885
Wow!

104
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,020
All done.

105
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,021
Let's go.

106
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,256
Stand on the spot and pose.

107
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:25,353
(Look at the camera)

108
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:27,867
Let's get closer.

109
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:29,396
Make a cute pose.

110
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,498
Why aren't you smiling?

111
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,334
How can I smile when it's not fun?

112
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,034
Whoa.

113
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:36,363
I won't forgive you. Smile!

114
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:37,737
Minato-san!

115
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,006
Oh!

116
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:41,641
It looks good!

117
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,074
Here, look.

118
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,878
What a big smile, Shin.

119
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,441
It's actually you

120
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:48,333
who made me smile like that.

121
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,084
Come on, it's fine.

122
00:05:52,322 --> 00:05:54,321
I like your face when you smile.

123
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:56,456
Huh?

124
00:05:58,793 --> 00:05:59,492
Oh.

125
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,546
Shin!

126
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:03,196
Are you thirsty?

127
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:05,279
I'll go buy drinks for you.

128
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:06,299
Just wait.

129
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:25,886
Akira-san.

130
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,120
How's it going?

131
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:29,990
Asuka...

132
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:33,393
I don't think I can handle it.

133
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:36,596
Try a little more.

134
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:40,834
Be persistent like Shin.

135
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:44,437
No,

136
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,306
that guy is too amazing.

137
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:49,676
No matter how I try to flee or hide,

138
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:51,645
he never cared.

139
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,713
It's true.

140
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:55,472
There are people

141
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:56,878
who like strange things.

142
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,168
Hey, you little...!

143
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:03,924
Hey, I'm very troubled now.

144
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:11,698
S-shin...

145
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:17,270
Hey, Shin.

146
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:18,805
You...

147
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,975
Isn't it better to not be too close?

148
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,312
It's hot too.

149
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:27,672
Huh?

150
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:30,150
Next, I...

151
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:32,211
want to ride on the Ferris wheel.

152
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:34,487
Oh.

153
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,722
Sure.

154
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,333
Do your best,

155
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:47,567
Akira-san.

156
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,010
Asuka.

157
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:52,305
Here.

158
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:53,840
Thank you, Shu-kun.

159
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:57,243
How are those two?

160
00:07:57,663 --> 00:07:58,645
Well...

161
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,980
They still need more time.

162
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:02,204
I thought he would remember

163
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,360
if they went on a date.

164
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,521
Hey, Asuka.

165
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:10,790
About that matter earlier.

166
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:12,525
Yeah?

167
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:15,420
You asked me what would happen if

168
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:16,821
one day I forget about you?

169
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:17,998
What if, let's say,

170
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:19,702
I forgot about you...

171
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:21,334
What would you do?

172
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:23,036
Oh.

173
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:23,903
Well...

174
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,941
Since then, I've been thinking about it.

175
00:08:28,683 --> 00:08:29,542
And...

176
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:32,245
Finally, I have an answer.

177
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:35,448
I don't want...

178
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,618
Asuka to forget about me.

179
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,421
I'll never accept it.

180
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:45,058
To be honest,

181
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,387
The feelings of liking

182
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:47,525
or being in a relationship,

183
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:48,856
I don't really understand

184
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,400
anything intangible.

185
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:52,441
Even right now,

186
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,001
I still don't know for sure.

187
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:00,740
I...

188
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,511
see that Asuka

189
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:06,546
is someone very important.

190
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:11,651
That means...

191
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:15,255
Thank you for staying by my side.

192
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,065
You know, Shu-kun.

193
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,767
You see...

194
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,670
So, Shu-kun...

195
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:32,472
your feelings for me...

196
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,076
I like you.

197
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:41,107
Therefore...

198
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:44,651
From now on, let's stay together.

199
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:49,756
Shu-kun...

200
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:57,397
Wait, Asuka. That hurt, please let go.

201
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,431
No way.

202
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:00,900
I'll never let go.

203
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,028
Hey,

204
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:17,350
Shu-kun.

205
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:22,822
Please kiss me.

206
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:27,760
Just kidding.

207
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:46,045
You see...

208
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:48,248
You and Hanabusa,

209
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,549
what kind of relationship

210
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:50,934
do you two have?

211
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,287
Why do you two seem so close?

212
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:55,989
Well,

213
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,671
I've been taking care of Asuka

214
00:10:57,695 --> 00:10:58,882
since he was young.

215
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:00,260
Oh.

216
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:02,695
Then...

217
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:05,498
What about Sakuma-sensei?

218
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,546
Huh?

219
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:10,703
I happened to witness

220
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:12,739
at the sea,

221
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:16,442
when you were talking to Sakuma-sensei.

222
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,379
You two...

223
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:21,080
seem very close.

224
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:23,516
So...

225
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:26,519
I feel...

226
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,127
I don't know.

227
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,697
I don't get it myself.

228
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:39,832
But...

229
00:11:41,163 --> 00:11:42,235
When I see Minato-san

230
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:45,205
with Sakuma-sensei,

231
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,774
or Hanabusa,

232
00:11:49,297 --> 00:11:50,243
I...

233
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,215
feel frustrated.

234
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:57,650
Besides, today...

235
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:00,680
no matter what,

236
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:02,633
I can't take my eyes away from you.

237
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:06,526
I'm sorry

238
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:08,362
for saying strange things.

239
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,196
Please forget it.

240
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,501
How could I forget?

241
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:20,976
No.

242
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:25,245
The one who forgot is you, Shin.

243
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,414
I...

244
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:37,423
You and I...

245
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:39,899
are dating.

246
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:41,961
Huh?

247
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:44,597
Hey, Shin.

248
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:45,932
Can you not remember?

249
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,468
We're dating,

250
00:12:49,405 --> 00:12:50,803
we're living together!

251
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:53,906
We're living together?

252
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:54,674
Yes.

253
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:56,342
I lied about sharing the room.

254
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:58,344
We're lovers

255
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,979
living together,

256
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:01,014
and...

257
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:04,917
we're extremely lovey-dovey too!

258
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:07,487
Extremely lovey-dovey?

259
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,454
Yes.

260
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:09,722
So...

261
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,191
Shin.

262
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,393
I beg you,

263
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:16,129
can you please remember?

264
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,301
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:22,802
I...

266
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:24,337
can't recall anything...

267
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:33,646
But I want to remember

268
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,717
everything

269
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:39,118
about you.

270
00:14:02,064 --> 00:14:03,392
Sakurako-chan, I'm sorry!

271
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:04,532
We'll be leaving first!

272
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:06,546
Minato-san...

273
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:08,448
Asuka!

274
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:09,916
Sorry! See you later!

275
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,718
Akira-san!

276
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,008
(Amusement park)

277
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,599
(Minato Coin Laundry)

278
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:18,852
Hey, Shin!

279
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:21,219
Sit over here.

280
00:14:21,514 --> 00:14:22,195
Yes.

281
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,768
Alright.

282
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,103
Yes.

283
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,488
What's this?

284
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:50,923
How would I know?

285
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,425
You like doing it.

286
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,561
Oh, no. It's the opposite.

287
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:56,938
I'll sit there

288
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,831
and you do what I just did.

289
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:00,066
Yes.

290
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,404
Over here?

291
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,171
Yes.

292
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,173
Ah, more to the left.

293
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,511
I'll coming.

294
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:13,112
Alright.

295
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,017
This is my first time doing

296
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,262
anything like this.

297
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:42,775
No way, you always do this.

298
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,811
With a serious expression too.

299
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:46,145
The you back then.

300
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:47,814
You're lying.

301
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:49,115
It's so strange.

302
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,249
Exactly.

303
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,418
You really are indeed weird.

304
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:55,388
But...

305
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,424
Isn't it too embarrassing?

306
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,525
Like this.

307
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:02,662
Minato-san.

308
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:04,564
Cute.

309
00:16:08,782 --> 00:16:09,569
Shin.

310
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,370
Did you remember anything?

311
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:13,072
No, but...

312
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:14,974
I was absent-minded.

313
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:18,644
Good.

314
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:20,913
Shin,

315
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,281
let's go.

316
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,885
The croquette that I like.

317
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:28,354
I also ate it with you last year.

318
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,189
Is that so?

319
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,027
(Watermelon slushy)

320
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:37,630
It's sweet, but I like it.

321
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,633
Watermelon slushy

322
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,036
has both sweet and bitter memories.

323
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,484
A photo when we went to the festival.

324
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:48,374
I see.

325
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:49,475
Look.

326
00:16:51,838 --> 00:16:53,012
Was it fun?

327
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,214
Yes, of course.

328
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:05,591
I now understand that we're lovers.

329
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:07,793
But our relationship,

330
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:09,629
what stage of relationship are we in?

331
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,444
Huh?

332
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,566
I mean,

333
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:15,234
if we were lovers,

334
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:16,560
I wonder what stage

335
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,724
of relationship are we in?

336
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:23,376
Nothing.

337
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:25,044
We've never done anything.

338
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:26,412
Really?

339
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:28,481
Even though we're always lovey-dovey?

340
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:31,784
More importantly,

341
00:17:32,273 --> 00:17:32,985
here,

342
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,788
last summer,

343
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:38,057
I came here with you.

344
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,461
At the time, you were so talkative,

345
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:45,464
and caused us to fall into the pool.

346
00:17:46,102 --> 00:17:47,033
Talkative?

347
00:17:47,502 --> 00:17:48,234
Yes.

348
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:50,903
About past stuff,

349
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:53,039
I used to like Sakuma-sensei.

350
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,599
Sakuma-sensei?

351
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,411
That Sakuma-sensei?

352
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:00,746
Well...

353
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,183
Let's not talk about it.

354
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:07,486
We always fight because of this.

355
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,089
It's embarrassing.

356
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:11,691
Enough.

357
00:18:42,002 --> 00:18:42,888
Shin...

358
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,127
Hey!

359
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,967
What are you doing, idiot?

360
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,370
Because I couldn't recall

361
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,330
so I thought I could

362
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:01,288
if I recreate what happened.

363
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:02,842
Huh?

364
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:13,753
Hey, Shin.

365
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,523
Slowly walk here.

366
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:25,131
Like this?

367
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:30,936
And...

368
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:32,538
After this?

369
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:36,976
Here,

370
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,325
you acted like you were

371
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,239
going to kiss me.

372
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:47,319
Idiot!

373
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,922
Why, were you going to do it?

374
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:51,857
Isn't it fine?

375
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,406
I want to remember.

376
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,575
It's impossible.

377
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:45,077
Why?

378
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,647
We can't do it.

379
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:53,352
Your feelings aren't the same as mine.

380
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,122
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:57,602 --> 00:20:58,457
It's fine,

382
00:20:58,606 --> 00:21:00,526
you don't have to apologize.

383
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,330
Shin.

384
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:07,666
You see...

385
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:11,704
Want to dry your clothes at my place?

386
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,709
Thank you.

387
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:19,145
But...

388
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:21,586
It's alright.

389
00:21:26,781 --> 00:21:27,720
I see.

390
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:33,392
Akira-san!

391
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:43,028
Huh?

392
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,238
Akira-san.

393
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,109
The thought of us dating,

394
00:21:50,873 --> 00:21:51,877
we should...

395
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,951
call each other by our names.

396
00:22:03,336 --> 00:22:05,391
Shin wouldn't call me that.

397
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,900
That's enough, Shin.

398
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:19,591
But...

399
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:20,806
It's alright.

400
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:23,209
Don't force yourself.

401
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,298
We

402
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:49,969
should go back to being friends.

403
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:54,131
Huh?

404
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:57,276
Until your memories return,

405
00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,578
I think it's better this way.

406
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:03,716
But I...

407
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:05,885
Come to the coin laundry again.

408
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:09,655
I'm always there.

409
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,658
I'm off.

410
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:15,895
Take care.

411
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:46,642
(Next episode)
I'll return this to you.

412
00:24:46,722 --> 00:24:47,619
(The conflicting feelings of the two)
You told me that

413
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,588
(Their answers are...)
you'll love me for your whole life,

414
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,562
so why did you forget about me?

415
00:24:51,562 --> 00:24:52,858
The me who cannot remember

416
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,202
(The destination of their love)
is essentially worthless, right?

417
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,113
(The destination of their love)
Then what should I do?

418
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,732
To Kazuki Shintaro.
