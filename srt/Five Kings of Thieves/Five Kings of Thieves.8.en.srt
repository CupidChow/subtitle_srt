00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,000
But the wind blows everywhere.

190
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,910
What riddle is this?

191
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,230
The wind blows around constantly.

192
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,150
Xun is the earth agent

193
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,180
in the southeast.

194
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,080
The tree craves calm
but the wind will not abate.

195
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,350
Oh, I see.

196
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,710
We've summoned you here

197
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,550
to formally tell you

198
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,590
where Qingyun Inn is.

199
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,350
Xiaoxie and I

200
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,520
have figured it out.

201
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,960
From now on, you don't need

202
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,230
to stalk us like that.

203
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,320
Since there's no restraint

204
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,760
for the sequence or number,

205
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,370
my best buddy Huo Xiaoxie

206
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,520
will give this chance

207
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,110
to all of you present.

208
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,440
Let's try not to lose
even a single participant

209
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,470
for the first task, shall we?

210
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,170
- Nice!
- Nice!

211
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,710
It's right there, I think.

212
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:14,960
Are you sure?

213
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,870
They're following us, after all.

214
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,170
Are we coming to the wrong place?

215
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,760
Why do I feel not right?

216
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,440
We can't be wrong.

217
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,840
My master didn't teach me too much

218
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,880
but the Five Elements
and the Eight Diagrams.

219
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,960
Why do I think we're going off the grid?

220
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,550
Let's check over there.

221
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,960
Why do I feel something wrong?

222
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,440
Let's go check over there.

223
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,520
If it's wrong, we can leave.

224
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:46,790
Go!

225
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,470
It doesn't look like an inn.

226
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,000
Am I really wrong?

227
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,080
Man, can we believe you or not?

228
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,150
It's the right place, I think.

229
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,840
Did you get us here

230
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,440
for something else?

231
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,290
Watch out!

232
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,470
This isn't a test.

233
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,380
We'll have to fight, anyway!

234
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,000
Bring it on!

235
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,540
We're ambushed!

236
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,710
You... You sold us out.

237
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,400
Huo Xiaoxie!

238
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,030
Oh, no.

239
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,190
Huo Xiaoxie!

240
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,230
Calm down!

241
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,540
Go!

242
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,080
Don't go after them.

243
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,280
How dare you collude
with them and betray us!

244
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,430
Get your hand off him!

245
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,800
You volunteered to come.

246
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,920
It's me who told you about this place.

247
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,070
Come at me!

248
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:04,680
Nonsense!

249
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,470
You must have colluded.

250
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,940
You want to kick us out!

251
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,760
He's so mean!

252
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,770
You're a backstabber!

253
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,060
Say no more. Beat him.

254
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,160
Wait, man.

255
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,280
Listen.

256
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,830
Huo Xiaoxie is my old friend.

257
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,400
I'm sure he wouldn't
do anything like this.

258
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,590
Zedao,

259
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,680
it's my fault.

260
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,430
Because of me, they were ambushed.

261
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,830
Kill me.

262
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,680
Buddy!

263
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,560
Trust me.

264
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,350
You two saved us.

265
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,040
We'll let him go, for your fake.

266
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,680
May I have your names?

267
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,760
I'm Zheng Zedao.

268
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,920
I'm Ruoyun.

269
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,110
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

270
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,280
You're welcome.

271
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,560
We're fellows

272
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,800
and I should help.

273
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,760
You must have been stunned.

274
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,230
I'm Lin Wan from the Wood family.

275
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,920
I just found out

276
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,560
someone moved the marks.

277
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,430
Now, many people want
to take down the five element families.

278
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,280
Sorry to get you involved.

279
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,920
Don't say that, Miss Lin.

280
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,400
The enemies of the five element families

281
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,760
are our enemies, too.

282
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,350
Right.

283
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,760
We will decently bury

284
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,520
your dead friends.

285
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,430
All because of this guy!

286
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,660
Without you,

287
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,070
our friends wouldn't have died!

288
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,020
- That's right.
- It's your fault.

289
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,840
- It's his fault.
- It's your fault.

290
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,310
You...

291
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,950
Come on, Xiaoxie.

292
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,640
It's totally my fault.

293
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,110
I bragged it to them,

294
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,950
so they followed us.

295
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,310
If you feel bad,

296
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,470
I'll go negotiate with them.

297
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,000
It's not your fault.

298
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,190
It's me who made a mistake.

299
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:27,630
[Noble Virtues]

300
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,310
Master!

301
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,110
Master, bad news.

302
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,560
Miss passed out.

303
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,190
Yao'er's disease is more serious.

304
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,110
We'll follow the Wood-spirit Bird.

305
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,190
You'll have to take charge
of the Three Firegate Tasks.

306
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,890
Take care, my old friends.

307
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,640
- Take care.
- Take care.

308
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:41,970
Let's go.

309
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,140
Master, hurry!

310
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,070
Why is Yao'er so badly sick?

311
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,800
Oh.

312
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,400
Tonight,

313
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,520
she took the tonic from Miss Lin.

314
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,920
Miss Lin knows about Yao'er's condition.

315
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,160
There won't be a problem with her tonic.

316
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,350
She must be exhausted these days.

317
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,800
Well,

318
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,350
she's always weak.

319
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,560
Look,

320
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,800
she loves to be cool, too.

321
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,610
Enough.

322
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,400
Out you go.

323
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,970
All right.

324
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,590
Mr. Three Snakes.

325
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,280
There you go.

326
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,350
Mr. Shui,

327
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,590
how's Yao'er?

328
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,520
In the past few years,

329
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,430
she has fallen sick a few times.

330
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,350
But it was never so serious before.

331
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,110
I'm really worried about her.

332
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,760
Mr. Shui,

333
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,520
I solemnly request

334
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,410
you marry Yao'er to me.

335
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,430
What do you mean?

336
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
You said, I have
the water and fire bloodline

337
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,680
that can restrain
the Cold Poison in Yao'er's body.

338
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,000
She and I are engaged

339
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,640
just to save her life, right?

340
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,400
All right.

341
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,040
Zedao,

342
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,110
you're so loyal and righteous.

343
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,710
I really appreciate it.

344
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,040
But

345
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,160
if you get married hastily,

346
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,310
you can only have a simple wedding

347
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,660
and you have no time
to invite your parents

348
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,490
to this wedding.

349
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,430
I'm sorry for that.

350
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:32,950
Mr. Shui,

351
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,610
it's about Yao'er's life.

352
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,860
It's just my duty to do this.

353
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,760
All right, then.

354
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,040
I think tomorrow is the best day.

355
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,350
You'll have the wedding tomorrow.

356
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,230
All right.

357
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,400
I object.

358
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,710
Keep your eye on Yao'er.

359
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,680
Don't let anything happen to her.

360
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,430
Rest assured.

361
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,590
Father...

362
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,950
Father, don't leave.

363
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,470
Unfreeze me.

364
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,230
Get some sleep, Yao'er.

365
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,710
By this time tomorrow,
we'll have been married.

366
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,640
You're having a death wish.

367
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,520
You hate me?

368
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,310
Yao'er,

369
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,920
I'm doing all this for your own good.

370
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,160
Rest for recuperation.

371
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,800
The four of you, go clean the yard.

372
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

373
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,330
The six of you,
put up the lanterns and decorations.

374
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,110
- Yes.
- Yes.

375
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,830
The four of you, make sure

376
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,930
you clean the sitting room perfectly.

377
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

378
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,430
The rest of you,
go hand out the invitations.

379
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,040
What if there aren't enough invitations?

380
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,000
Keep everything simple!

381
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,360
Off you go. Hurry.

382
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

383
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,760
The Holy Cauldron of Five Elements.

384
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:34,640
Come in.

385
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,520
Miss, it's from the Water family.

386
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,340
[Happy Wedding]

387
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,900
[The wedding of Shui Yao'er
and Zheng Zedao]

388
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,560
Are you here for Yao'er?

389
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,880
Zedao,

390
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,830
congratulations.

391
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:29,800
Congratulations?

392
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,070
Mr. Shui is eager to save Yao'er

393
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,830
and I'm just doing my duty.

394
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,070
Yeah.

395
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,110
Something

396
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,710
is what we're destined to do.

397
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,800
They look gorgeous.

398
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,430
I'll go check on Yao'er.

399
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,400
Mr. Three Snakes.

400
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,950
Miss Lin,

401
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:22,920
I know

402
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,230
you're close to our Miss.

403
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,230
But this time,

404
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,400
you mustn't help her.

405
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,470
Every human is sensible.

406
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,090
Miss Lin, if Water King
had a better plan,

407
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,920
he wouldn't be doing this.

408
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,560
Hope you can understand.

409
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,190
Wan,

410
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,830
I can't marry Zheng Zedao.

411
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,950
Please help me.

412
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,830
For your health,

413
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,760
your father tried really a lot.

414
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,640
Don't break his heart again.

415
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,520
Then you go tell Huo Xiaoxie.

416
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,280
Tell him

417
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,190
I will not fail him.

418
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,560
Don't do anything silly.

419
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,710
Huo Xiaoxie.

420
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,710
Huo Xiaoxie.

421
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:50,920
Where's he?

422
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,000
He's been like this these days?

423
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,590
Huo Xiaoxie, wake up.

424
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm here to tell you

425
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,880
Shui Yao'er and Zheng Zedao
are getting married.

426
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,400
When?

427
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,310
Today.

428
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,680
Really?

429
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,400
You don't need to tell me.

430
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,830
There's no cure
for Shui Yao'er's disease.

431
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,280
Only the water
and fire bloodline can help.

432
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,400
Today, I finally found
a similar citta-dharma.

433
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,230
It's hidden in the Holy Cauldron.

434
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,350
When you manage to learn that,

435
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,830
you'll also be able to save Shui Yao'er.

436
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,040
But I got so many people killed.

437
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,400
What right have I to take part
in the Three Firegate Tasks?

438
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,950
I can't get the Holy Cauldron.

439
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,470
There's one more thing.

440
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,830
Shui Yao'er asked me to tell you

441
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,800
that she will never fail you.

442
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,190
First for equal marriage.

443
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,800
Second for mutual progress.

444
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,400
Third for permanent relationship.

445
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,920
Fourth for perfect life.

446
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,190
Fifth for great children.

447
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,190
Sixth for wonderful wealth.

448
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,110
Seventh for good luck.

449
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,590
Eighth for healthy parents.

450
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,760
Yao'er,

451
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,810
you're wearing the wedding dress

452
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,940
that your mother wore

453
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,800
when she married me.

454
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,500
You've grown up.

455
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,350
And you look exactly like your mother

456
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,760
when she was young.

457
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,210
Don't blame me.

458
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,570
I'm just an ordinary father.

459
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,610
I can't just watch my daughter

460
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,740
lose her life.

461
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,530
One day,

462
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,530
you'll be a mother

463
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,100
and then you'll understand

464
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,020
what I'm saying.

465
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,510
You're still young

466
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,490
and you've got a long way to go.

467
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,840
I don't ask you to understand me now.

468
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,800
But one day,

469
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,980
you will understand.

470
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,260
It's the wedding time.

471
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,560
Yao'er,

472
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,750
what are you doing?

473
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,530
Father, thank you for bringing me up.

474
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,140
I'm so naughty

475
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,010
that I always annoy you.

476
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,810
I can't live with you anymore.

477
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,290
Please take good care of yourself.

478
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,740
Yao'er,

479
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,140
you're getting married today.

480
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,820
But you won't stop seeing me.

481
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,500
Why are you doing this?

482
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,970
Get her up.

483
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,290
Yeah, Yao'er.

484
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,380
After we're back home,

485
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,940
I'll still take you here to your father.

486
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,010
First bow to heaven and earth.

487
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:46,900
Wait!

488
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,860
What's up?

489
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,570
Who's he?

490
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:55,800
Why is he disturbing the wedding?

491
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,560
Is he here to sabotage it?

492
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,620
Huo Xiaoxie!

493
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,010
Stop them!

494
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,530
Stop!

495
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,460
Today is Yao'er's wedding.

496
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,220
We have important guests here.

497
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,480
If you dare to make trouble...

498
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,420
Let her go!

499
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,980
Zedao,

500
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,300
I'm taking her away now.

501
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,290
What exactly do you want?

502
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,060
Shui Yao'er,

503
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,400
will you go with me?

504
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,700
Yes.

505
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,490
You're going to ruin me?

506
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,620
Zedao,

507
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,810
I'm sorry.

508
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,380
Hope you can grant our wish.

509
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,100
Grant your wish?

510
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,050
Then who can grant mine?

511
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,660
Three Snakes,

512
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,250
take him down!

513
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,940
If anyone comes over,

514
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,660
I'll kill myself.

515
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,730
Yao'er!

516
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,120
Don't be absurd!

517
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,050
I swear I will!

518
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,100
Shui Yao'er...

519
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:27,970
You two,

520
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,010
what are you doing actually?

521
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,660
I said I wouldn't marry you.

522
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,700
I hate decent families like you

523
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,810
who have strict rules for marriage.

524
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,770
Water King,

525
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,050
I love Shui Yao'er truly.

526
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,490
I'll do my best
to get the Holy Cauldron.

527
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,220
I will save her.

528
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,380
I won't bet my daughter's life.

529
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,380
I swear.

530
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,730
With what?

531
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,620
My life.

532
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,730
If I'm so incompetent

533
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,490
that Shui Yao'er
doesn't survive the poisoning,

534
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,570
I will die with her.

535
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,460
By then, you can kill me yourself.

536
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,460
In my eyes, your life

537
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,290
is worthless.

538
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:21,730
Father,

539
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,010
I've made up my mind.

540
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,860
Today, if I can't marry the man I want,

541
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,620
I'll kill myself here.

542
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,420
And if you kill Huo Xiaoxie,

543
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,810
I'll die with him, too.

544
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,700
Yao'er!

545
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,420
How could you force me like this?

546
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:40,020
Father, I know you care about me.

547
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,420
You want me

548
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,940
to get married, have children,

549
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,900
and live a happy life
like everybody else.

550
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,970
But to me,

551
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,380
failing to marry the man I want

552
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,420
will kill me more.

553
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,530
I'm sorry, Father.

554
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,180
Please grant my wish.

555
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,250
Let's go.

556
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,250
Get out of the way.

557
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:22,620
Did you

558
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,490
just let them go?

559
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Or do you want her

560
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,570
to really kill herself?
