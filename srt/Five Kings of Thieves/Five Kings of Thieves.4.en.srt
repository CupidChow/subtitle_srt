00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,020
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,870
Master!

4
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,420
Ask around, young man.

5
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,920
- In Fengtian, I used to have
- Master!

6
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,060
about a hundred apprentices.

7
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,020
They always honored me
with a lot of money.

8
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,460
Hang in there.

9
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,460
Tonight, I'm going with you.

10
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:01,980
Master!

11
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,380
- I'm a loser.
- Hold on!

12
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,460
And I'm so incompetent.

13
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,660
I can't protect my apprentices.

14
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,060
Master.

15
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,370
Master.

16
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:24,980
Master.

17
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,650
Wake up.

18
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,500
Master.

19
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,090
Huo Xiaoxie.

20
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:29,730
Master.

21
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,170
Master.

22
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,980
Feed your master this.

23
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,170
Master, open your mouth.

24
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,220
Master, are you feeling any better?

25
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,420
So cold.

26
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,730
You're all right, Master.

27
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,780
It's me, Xiaoxie.

28
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,500
Xiaoxie.

29
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,780
I'm afraid

30
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,530
I'm really dying.

31
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,730
Master,

32
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,700
that's impossible.

33
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,170
You're going to be all right.

34
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,580
I'll have the best physician cure you.

35
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,810
You hear that?

36
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,650
You brought me up,

37
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,780
but I failed to provide you
with a peaceful life.

38
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,370
Lang Deben and I had a deal.

39
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,010
We'll buy you a large house.

40
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,980
All right?

41
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,420
Good...

42
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,610
Go get me some water.

43
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:43,980
All right.

44
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,780
I'll go get some water.

45
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,300
Master.

46
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,980
You just fed me a Water Elixir, right?

47
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:04,980
Yes.

48
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,220
You're from the Water family?

49
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,300
It's really my lucky day.

50
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,730
Don't be sad.

51
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,230
It's not a shame

52
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,490
when a hooligan like me dies.

53
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,180
Master, don't say that.

54
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,300
But that's a real shame
for my apprentice.

55
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,300
Xiaoxie was born gifted.

56
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,980
He's smart

57
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,140
and he's a quick learner.

58
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,090
Too bad...

59
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,700
Too bad he has a useless master like me.

60
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,250
He has an eerie flame.

61
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,580
Eerie flame?

62
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,860
He's the eerie flame bloodline?

63
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,620
Yes.

64
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,140
The Five Elements Rally
is held every twenty years.

65
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,210
You know that, huh?

66
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,580
Could you...

67
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,770
Could you take Xiaoxie there?

68
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,300
Umm...

69
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,810
Guys like us

70
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,820
can't even approach

71
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,700
the five element families.

72
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,650
Master, say no more.

73
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,580
I'll do my best to help him.

74
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,420
I'm dying, you know.

75
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,740
Don't fool me.

76
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,650
Master, rest assured.

77
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,140
You have my word.

78
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,810
All right.

79
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,090
Master, here's the water.

80
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,980
Master, have some water.

81
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:03,650
All right.

82
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,090
Be careful.

83
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,370
Do you want more?

84
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,420
Come on, Xiaoxie.

85
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,140
I'm here, Master.

86
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,490
Let me tell you.

87
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,370
Miss Water promised me.

88
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,980
She'll take you
to the five element families.

89
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:22,860
All right.

90
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,020
Master, stop talking.

91
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,250
Xiaoxie, when I was young,

92
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,930
I wished to join
the five element families.

93
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,460
But there wasn't such a great chance.

94
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,460
Master.

95
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,180
Don't worry. I give you my word.

96
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,530
Oh, good. Good...

97
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:50,930
Master.

98
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:53,700
Master.

99
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,900
Go. Let's go get a physician.

100
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,810
Master.

101
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,700
Huo Xiaoxie, what are you doing?

102
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,650
Let's go see a physician.

103
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,980
- Huo Xiaoxie, calm down.
- Master.

104
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,860
Go. Let's go see a physician.

105
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,090
Master.

106
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,300
- Huo Xiaoxie, calm down.
- Go.

107
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,090
- Your master is dead!
- I would not let you die.

108
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,330
My master isn't dead.

109
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,650
He's dead.

110
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,980
He isn't!

111
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,490
Take my dog

112
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,180
and let's go out.

113
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,650
This time, we must
eliminate the five element families

114
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,460
and get back the Holy Cauldron.

115
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,650
- Yes!
- Yes!

116
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,210
Huo Xiaoxie.

117
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,300
I'm sorry for your loss.

118
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,260
I got a tip

119
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,210
that Mr. Zhang Si and his men
had set off from Fengtian.

120
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,260
You'd better leave now.

121
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,860
Then Zedao,

122
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,450
please take care of my buddies.

123
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,330
Count on me.

124
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,130
You're Zheng Zedao?

125
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,770
And you are?

126
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,060
Shui Yao'er.

127
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,620
I didn't expect to see you here, Miss.

128
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,940
I was about to visit your family

129
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,090
in a couple of days.

130
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,690
No need. My father
has no time to see you.

131
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,180
I can't disobey my parents.

132
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,860
The Water King helped our family a lot.

133
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,900
My father insisted
that I should visit him.

134
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,740
I'll see you in Wangjiapu.

135
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,300
Wangjiapu?

136
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,690
This year's Five Elements Rally
will be held there.

137
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,570
Your father gave me
a Black Stone Fire Token.

138
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,260
Let's say no more.

139
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,450
Mr. Zhang Si's men are catching up.

140
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,500
You should leave.

141
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,180
Not until I bury my master.

142
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,650
Farewell, Miss Water.

143
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,570
About the Five Elements Rally...

144
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,010
Why do I think your master set a trap

145
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,860
and made me fall for it?

146
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,890
It doesn't matter.

147
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,180
Girls always go back on their word.

148
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,380
Who told you that?

149
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,210
We'll go!

150
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,010
I think we can exchange the Jade Pearl

151
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,740
for a Black Stone Fire Token.

152
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,890
Where's my Linglong Mirror?

153
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,690
Did you leave it in Fengtian?

154
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,380
Pretending to be sick, huh?

155
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,500
Why are you so cold?

156
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,420
Go away!

157
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,820
Who's there?

158
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,380
Show yourself.

159
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,500
Oh, Shui Yao'er.

160
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,740
What are you doing here?

161
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,770
No wonder it smells so good.

162
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,500
Greetings, gentlemen.

163
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,330
Be seated, please.

164
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,650
The dishes are getting cold.

165
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,740
We've heard
the Water King's daughter cooks perfectly.

166
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,690
Today, we can also enjoy her food.

167
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,090
Jingtian,

168
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,740
I have some good news for you.

169
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,210
I found the Jade Pearl.

170
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,420
Delicious food and the Jade Pearl...

171
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,060
Miss Water, what exactly do you want?

172
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,330
I'll take a man

173
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,090
back to Wangjiapu with us

174
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,530
for this year's Five Elements Rally.

175
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,500
Who is this man?

176
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,420
Don't ask.

177
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,650
If you want the pearl,

178
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:00,980
protect him.

179
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:02,860
Go.

180
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,380
Stop pretending.

181
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,260
Somebody's there.

182
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:09,740
Hurry.

183
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,620
Jingtian.

184
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,650
Jingtian.

185
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,570
Yao'er, what took you so long?

186
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,010
We've been waiting.

187
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:20,820
That's him.

188
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,860
It's you who bullied Yao'er, huh?

189
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,330
How daring! Beat him!

190
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,560
- Go.
- Hey, don't.

191
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,010
- Go.
- Don't.

192
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,890
We have to cool her down,

193
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,010
otherwise she won't let you go.

194
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,420
Play along and yell.

195
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,500
Yao'er, is it enough?

196
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,210
No. Continue.

197
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,940
I'm getting screwed. Stop it.

198
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,650
It's just a mirror, isn't it?

199
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,420
And in it,

200
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,420
I saw a woman who had your face!

201
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,090
Why do you need to beat me?

202
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,530
How about I buy you many more mirrors?

203
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,650
What did you say?

204
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,010
Bring him to me.

205
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,980
All right. Go!

206
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:57,890
Go!

207
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,260
Say it again.

208
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,380
I said,

209
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,690
in the mirror, I saw a woman

210
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,180
who had your face.

211
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,180
And how about I buy you
many more mirrors?

212
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,450
One can only see in the Linglong Mirror

213
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,860
Mr. or Mrs. Right.

214
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,380
Can Huo Xiaoxie be

215
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,980
the hero I heard about
from the fortune-teller?

216
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,500
You saw that?

217
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,530
I did.

218
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,010
What's so strange?

219
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,130
Not enough. We'll beat him more.

220
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,500
I'll buy you twenty mirrors.

221
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,010
Wait.

222
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:34,820
From this day on,

223
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,450
no one can beat him.

224
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,650
I'll go cook for you.

225
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,860
Really?

226
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,060
Here's some fish.

227
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,820
How's it? Is it tasty?

228
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,090
Yes.

229
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,090
Show me your hand.

230
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,530
The other one.

231
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,770
What did you eat
and get such strong cold energy?

232
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,010
And you look all right.

233
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,260
The Jade Pearl.

234
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,300
You swallowed the Jade Pearl?

235
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,210
And you're still alive?

236
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,060
Oh, I see.

237
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,060
The rope.

238
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,860
Shui Yao'er has tied knots

239
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,620
to restrain your meridians

240
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,380
in case the cold energy proliferates

241
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,180
and the toxin acts up too quickly.

242
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,420
Is that so?

243
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,380
Or what?

244
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,570
Then can you take it out of me?

245
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,620
You have to do it yourself.

246
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,010
Are you done?

247
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,620
How's it? Is it out?

248
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,500
No.

249
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,540
You stink.

250
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,320
I...

251
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,980
Stay away.

252
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,170
Why do you think I stink?

253
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:32,860
You really stink.

254
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,460
That's not possible.

255
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,610
I don't stink.

256
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
Wh-what?

257
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,980
Brothers, come and help.

258
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,660
Again?

259
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,570
Be right there.

260
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,300
Hey, man...

261
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,730
Shui... Shui Yao'er!

262
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,860
Behave yourself.

263
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,020
Jingtian.

264
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,490
You see, he can't get the pearl out.

265
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,020
How about this?

266
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,300
I heard your martial arts
could control the cold toxin.

267
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,250
How about you teach him some?

268
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,130
Yao'er, you know.

269
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,900
The five element families never teach
an outsider their martial arts.

270
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,170
Fine.

271
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,020
Then cut him open like this.

272
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,340
Kill him and get the pearl out.

273
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,780
You're leaving me to die, huh?

274
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,450
After that, you'll cut me for the pearl.

275
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,370
I despise you.

276
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,650
You turn out to be so evil!

277
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,250
All right. Stop it!

278
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,060
Let's hurry on.

279
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,780
I'll teach you
after we reach somewhere safer.

280
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,820
And your comprehension
decides how much you can learn.

281
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:35,940
Go.

282
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,850
After them!

283
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,970
Sorry for the mirror thing.

284
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,020
But I'm keeping it somewhere safe.

285
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,370
It won't be lost. Don't worry.

286
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,250
What exactly can that mirror do?

287
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,700
It can show you your Mrs. Right.

288
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,490
Mrs. right?

289
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,780
It's a mirror of love and marriage.

290
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,180
One can see Mr. or Mrs. Right in it.

291
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,330
It was in that mirror that my father

292
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,180
saw my mother.

293
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,370
Isn't this a story to fool kids?

294
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,420
How could you even believe it?

295
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,330
What?

296
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,330
You don't want me?

297
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,730
What's wrong, Huo Xiaoxie?

298
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,330
Jingtian!

299
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,970
Jingtian, what do we do?

300
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,250
The Jade Pearl's toxin, I guess.

301
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,020
I didn't expect them
to catch up so quickly.

302
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,490
And they're coming all together.

303
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,290
I'll take him away.
You guys lure away Mr. Zhang Si.

304
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,420
Where are you going?

305
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,660
I can find someone to cure him.

306
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,180
The Wood family?

307
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:41,970
Yes.

308
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:42,970
No way.

309
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,850
The Jade Pearl can't fall
into the hands of the Wood family.

310
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,610
I don't care.

311
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,700
I can't let him die here.

312
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,130
I promised his master to protect him.

313
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:55,780
Fine.

314
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,300
A post house is 30 li away from here.

315
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,300
We'll meet you there.

316
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,090
All right.

317
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,660
There are two ways to the entrance.

318
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,300
Banghai Path and Gubei Path.

319
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Now, we'll lure Mr. Zhang Si

320
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,210
to Banghai Path.

321
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,180
You two share a horse.

322
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,420
Ride in turns, one in the front
and the other in the back.

323
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,580
In this way,

324
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,370
the hoof prints will look different

325
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,900
as if a man and a woman were riding.

326
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,420
All right.

327
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,610
Mr. Zhang.

328
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,660
Judging from the hoof prints,

329
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,420
we can catch up within half an hour.

330
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,580
Release all the pigeons.

331
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,370
Use all the informers
we've had all these years.

332
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:18,330
Yes.

333
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:21,580
Go.

334
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,180
Giddyap!

335
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,060
Pretty...

336
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
You get the wrong guy.

337
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,450
What?

338
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,850
What is that?

339
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,300
Give the pearl back to me.

340
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,420
It's mine now.

341
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,900
For medical bills.

342
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:42,820
No way.

343
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,370
What's the difference
between giving it to me

344
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,580
and giving it to the Fire family?

345
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,180
I just can't.

346
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,970
You stink.

347
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,180
Go take a bath.

348
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:54,940
You...

349
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,850
You did it on purpose, huh?

350
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,210
They must be right ahead.

351
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,850
Mr. Zhang, look.

352
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,610
Turn back.

353
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:35,610
Why?

354
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,610
We fell into their trap.

355
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,020
Let's also turn back.

356
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,580
- All right.
- Yes.

357
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,370
Come and have dinner.

358
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,490
Don't worry.

359
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,330
I wouldn't dare to poison Miss Water.

360
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,020
Or your father would kill me.

361
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,180
If you don't give the pearl back to me,

362
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,540
my father will kill you, too.

363
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,970
I got the pearl out of his body.

364
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,580
But it's hard
to detoxify the extreme cold toxin.

365
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,060
The man or the pearl, make your choice.

366
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,580
I...

367
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,580
Forget it.

368
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,130
I'll pick him.

369
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,820
You can't be into him, are you?

370
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,700
And you're giving up
such a precious pearl?

371
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,660
How could I ever be into him?

372
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,300
Fine.

373
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:13,940
Just tell me,

374
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,370
how can he be cured?

375
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,940
The Jade Pearl is the gloomiest thing.

376
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,210
Only the strongest can kill its toxin.

377
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,660
The sun is the world's strongest thing.

378
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,780
Purely strong.

379
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,300
Are you saying

380
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,130
he can't recover

381
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,540
unless I bathe him in the sun every day?

382
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,490
Smart girl.

383
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,250
Lin Wan, you must be kidding.

384
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,180
Wan, don't you want to know

385
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,490
how we got the Jade Pearl?

386
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,490
Tell me about it.

387
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,130
We grabbed it from Zhang Si.

388
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,370
You know what? Zhang Si is fierce.

389
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,020
He used to be the Yufeng Detective.

390
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,900
For this, he sent a lot of men after us

391
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,090
for quite a few days.

392
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,130
Shui Yao'er!

393
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,580
You're a jinx every time I meet you!

394
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,900
Wan, don't be angry.

395
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,970
Look. You have great medical skills.

396
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:10,970
Even if Mr. Zhang Si catches up,

397
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,490
acupuncture him to erase his memory

398
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,780
and then he can't do anything.

399
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,090
You...

400
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,450
Shui Yao'er, hurry up.

401
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,090
Coming, Wan.

402
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,700
How could you be so clumsy?

403
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,330
These are too heavy.

404
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,580
How about we dump them?

405
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,130
I need that one. And that one.

406
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,780
Dump all that in the basket.

407
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:32,850
Come on.

408
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,610
Hurry. Get in for more stuff.

409
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,370
All right.

410
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,020
Enough. Leave the rest there.

411
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,730
Wan.

412
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,540
Yao'er,

413
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,610
I can tell that you like him.

414
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:57,420
I...

415
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,090
Listen.

416
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,330
I found an eerie flame inside his body.

417
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,780
Without it, he would have been dead.

418
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:04,940
However...

419
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,820
Any problem?

420
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,780
If I'm right,

421
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,580
that is a dark flame.

422
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,090
Since ancient times,

423
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,780
anyone with a dark flame bloodline

424
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,540
has always had a rough destiny.

425
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,940
Either remarkable

426
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:19,900
or...

427
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,780
Anyway, your fate of love

428
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,180
doesn't look right.

429
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,300
I don't...

430
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,370
I don't want...

431
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,300
I don't want to yield to fate.

432
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,620
You've never been very obedient.

433
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,420
But anyway,

434
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,970
are you ready for this?

435
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,360
Your father won't just approve.

436
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,060
Good luck, then.

437
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,060
Giddyap!

438
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,090
Master... Don't leave.

439
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:15,940
Master.

440
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,490
Don't leave me.

441
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,270
Don't leave me.

442
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,450
Master.

443
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,850
Master.

How do you feel? Any better?

461
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:49,900
Yes.

462
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,250
I had a dream just now.

463
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,610
In it, a pretty girl saved me.

464
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,900
A pretty girl?

465
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,180
Get up.

466
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,660
Shameless.

467
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,820
How do you feel? Any better?

468
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,210
I'm asking you. Any better?

469
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,330
You bad girl, I'm going to kill you!

470
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,900
Don't be so ungrateful.

471
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,180
Do you know how hard I worked

472
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,780
to collect so many mirrors?

473
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,540
Only in this way

474
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,130
can your cold toxin be controlled.

475
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,020
Nonsense!

476
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,330
Stay here and enjoy the sunlight.

477
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,650
Why are you so tanned?

478
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,650
Because of what you did!

479
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,850
Are you angry now?

480
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,800
Yes, quite angry!

481
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,320
Pound it.

482
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,130
Why?

483
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,850
Silly. Make the chicken flabby.

484
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,010
You'll know when you eat it.

485
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,490
What a girl!

486
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,650
Enough.

487
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,080
It's done.

488
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,250
Where did you learn this?

489
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,080
From my master.

490
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,530
Looks like the Fire Slash
of the Fire family.

491
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:51,610
It does?

492
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,160
Their Fire Slash is totally different

493
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,130
from their previous tough martial arts.

494
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,010
You just pounded too hard.

495
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,490
Be gentle and try again.

496
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,130
Oh, where's the Jade Pearl?

497
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,650
Are you keeping it?

498
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,400
It's gone.

499
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,730
A great physician saved you
and she took it.

500
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,010
What if Jingtian asks about it?

501
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,250
How can we explain that?

502
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,440
Well, I know what to do.

503
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,400
Listen.

504
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,320
Don't ever tell them

505
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,530
that the pearl is gone.

506
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,130
Or you and I would be doomed.

507
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:31,970
Got it.

508
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:34,920
Let's do this.

509
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,040
Catch.

510
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,930
Follow me.

511
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,490
This is a therapeutic exercise.

512
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,540
It smooths your meridians
and nurses your body.

513
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,420
Butt down.

514
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,330
Leg. Out a little bit.

515
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,370
Arm up.

516
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,370
Eyes... Stare.

517
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,580
Stare.

518
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,580
Follow me.

519
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,180
You reversed. Turn around.

520
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,460
Brothers, come in, please.

521
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,740
Again, we can enjoy the food you make.

522
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:28,660
Come on.

523
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,900
I took you as an elder brother.

524
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,700
Who exactly

525
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,940
stopped me from seeing a physician?

526
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,050
The Jade Pearl is precious.

527
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,050
We can't give it to the physician.

528
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,290
So, my life is worthless, huh?

529
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,050
You guys claim to be decent.

530
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,050
You won't rob me of the pearl, huh?

531
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,740
Young man,

532
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,900
we won't rob you, of course.

533
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,570
My family is always honest.

534
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:53,660
Tell us.

535
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,570
Do you want anything in return?

536
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,260
Yes.

537
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,610
I hear I can exchange the pearl

538
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,180
for a Black Stone Fire Token
of the Five Elements Rally.

539
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,940
Yes. You can get
the Black Stone Fire Token.

540
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,050
But we don't have one now.

541
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,020
You don't?

542
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,770
Don't be kidding, man.

543
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,810
Then don't waste my time.

544
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,220
I'll take my leave.

545
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,220
Enjoy your food.

546
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:29,700
Wait.

547
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,980
The pearl...

548
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,660
You're both my friends.

549
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,530
Then I'll keep this pearl for now.

550
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,900
You don't have a problem, huh?

551
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:48,770
Jingtian,

552
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,700
Huo Xiaoxie

553
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,700
risked his life for this pearl.

554
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,050
Since you don't have
a Black Stone Fire Token,

555
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,810
how about you give him something else?

556
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,660
What is it?

557
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,460
The Fire Slash.

558
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,940
Thank you for your hard work, Jingtian.

559
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,900
Yao'er,

560
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,290
I taught him the best I could do.

561
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,660
Give me the pearl.

562
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,530
No way.

563
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:19,700
You can't give him it.

564
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,130
Hey, young man.

565
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,330
What do you mean by that?

566
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,810
What do I mean?

567
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,700
Something's wrong with this martial art.

568
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:28,460
It's fake.

569
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:30,900
It's not powerful at all, is it?

570
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,980
I taught you everything I could.

571
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,460
You just failed to learn.

572
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,770
It's because you...

573
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,770
- I...
- What's my problem?

574
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,090
I'm clumsy?

575
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,130
I don't read a lot.

576
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,260
But I know one saying.

577
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,810
What's it again?

578
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,090
A teacher...

579
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,740
A teacher propagates the doctrine,
imparts knowledge, and resolves doubts.

580
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,330
Yeah. That's it.

581
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,850
Anyway,

582
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,940
I failed to learn what you taught me.

583
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:54,770
It means you taught poorly.

584
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:55,980
You should give the money back.

585
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,370
Did I even charge any money?

586
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,500
You're a decent man. Don't fight me.

587
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,610
Jingtian, to be fair,

588
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,260
he... he's clumsy indeed.

589
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,460
And this martial art isn't that simple.

590
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,130
He can't master it in a short time.

591
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,500
Besides,

592
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,980
this is the Jade Pearl.

593
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,370
Maybe your family can follow it

594
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,460
to find the Holy Cauldron.

595
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,460
Come on, Yao'er.

596
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,700
It's not that I don't want to teach him.

597
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,570
Look how clumsy he is.

598
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,660
When he can't master this,

599
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,420
he won't be able to try anything else.

600
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,130
How about

601
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,530
you show me a few more?

602
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,610
I'll certainly learn something.

603
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:30,980
What are you talking about?

604
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,050
Our martial arts aren't cabbages!

605
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,180
Jingtian, calm down.

606
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,570
How about you do this?

607
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,090
Teach him something simple.

608
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,500
He really can't master this one.

609
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,090
Fine.

610
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,740
But this is the last time.

611
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,530
However much he can master,

612
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,290
I will take back the pearl.

613
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,500
No problem. Teach him a legwork, then.

614
00:37:59,090 --> 00:37:59,770
Come on, man.

615
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:00,460
There you go.

616
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,020
Watch carefully.

617
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,570
Start.

618
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:11,850
They're coming.

619
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,260
Mr. Zhang Si and his men.

620
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,020
Where are they now?

621
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:15,660
At the foot of the mountain.

622
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,330
We took a long detour.

623
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,530
How could they still catch up?

624
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,180
With the help of their dog.

625
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:22,770
Well,

626
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,640
lure them up here tomorrow morning

627
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:25,860
and take care of them.

628
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,320
Let's get rid of them!

629
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,370
Outflank them.

630
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,380
Here it is, I guess.

631
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,330
Put up Seven-net Arhat Formation.

632
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,740
Let nobody get out!

633
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,290
Yes!

634
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,090
Charge!

635
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,180
Good dog, go!

636
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,050
Bomb!

637
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,050
Looks like the trick
of the Water family.

638
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,530
