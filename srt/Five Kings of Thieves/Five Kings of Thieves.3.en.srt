[Five Kings of Thieves]

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,020
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,220
Come on, let's get out of this street

4
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,260
to our turf.

5
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,140
And we'll be safe.

6
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,750
You hurt the Japanese
and ruined my future.

7
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,180
Run!

8
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,390
Guan!

9
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,260
Catch them!

10
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,180
Get up.

11
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:05,950
Let's go.

12
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,390
Xiaoxie, leave.

13
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,900
- Sir.
- Sir.

14
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,430
Piss off.

15
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,310
Don't let them get away! Piss off.

16
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,670
Piss off.

17
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,580
Get out of the way.

18
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,910
Piss off! Don't let them go!

19
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,750
Get out of the way.

20
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,780
Let's go.

21
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,750
Xiaoxie, I can't make it anymore.

22
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,500
Get Monkey and Lang Deben out.

23
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,580
With the Pearl, they will be fine.

24
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,420
Stop talking. You won't die.

25
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,750
I'll take you to eat delicious food.

26
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,340
Roast duck.

27
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,910
Mutton soup.

28
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,620
Remember?

29
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,310
You won't die.

30
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,190
Xiaoxie, forget it.

31
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,980
Stop talking.

32
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,830
Get the two of them out.

33
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,780
Take them away.

34
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,620
Back to our hometown in Shandong.

35
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,340
- Okay.
- Xiaoxie.

36
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,580
I will.

37
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,580
Don't worry. I will.

38
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,420
You jerk. Stop running.

39
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,060
Don't you just want the pearl?

40
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,420
Come get it.

41
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,270
I'm going to blow it up to pieces.

42
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,060
Let's see how you can get it.

43
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,500
Stop.

44
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,060
Lay down arms!

45
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,860
Lay down arms!

46
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,950
Listen.

47
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,950
We can talk.

48
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,910
Let go of my brothers.

49
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,110
Now!

50
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,550
Okay, all of you can be set free.

51
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,270
Just leave the pearl

52
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,580
in your hand to me.

53
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,860
I wasn't born yesterday.

54
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,030
Save it.

55
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,500
Let my brothers go now.

56
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,420
Or I will blow the pearl
and myself to pieces.

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:41,980
Understand?

58
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,620
Don't!

59
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,030
Your brother...

60
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,220
He's seriously injured.

61
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,270
I'm afraid he won't be able to
hold on for a while.

62
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,910
I can take him to see

63
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,500
the best Japanese doctor in Fengtian.

64
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,620
The best!

65
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,700
Maybe he can survive.

66
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,270
Hero.

67
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,620
You seem to be righteous.

68
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,420
Make a choice.

69
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,340
Your brother's life or the pearl.

70
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,270
Xiaoxie...

71
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,830
Stop talking.

72
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,980
- I'm afraid I can survive...
- Stop it.

73
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,500
Don't believe them, Xiaoxie.

74
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,270
Take brothers home.

75
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,430
What are you doing?

76
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,430
What are you doing?

77
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,020
No, Guan!

78
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,670
Take brothers home!

79
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,990
Guan!

80
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,020
Guan!

81
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,390
Huo Xiaoxie!

82
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,020
Guan!

83
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,870
Go, Huo Xiaoxie!

84
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,150
Guan!

85
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,710
Go, Huo Xiaoxie!

86
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,500
Guan! Guan!

87
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,430
Huo Xiaoxie!

88
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,710
Let me go!

89
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,390
Huo Xiaoxie!

90
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,390
I'm going to save him!

91
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,220
Calm down. He's dead.

92
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,300
No.

93
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,710
Come on.

94
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,460
Where are they? Search for them!

95
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,220
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

96
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,430
Hurry up.

97
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,500
Keep an eye on the gate.

98
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,180
Yes, sir.

99
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,830
Your brother,

100
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,220
is a hero.

101
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,270
If I were him,

102
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I would also like you to survive.

103
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,110
We're in troubled times.

104
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,740
People die every day.

105
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,950
Pain and self-blame are useless.

106
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,670
We can only protect
those we want to protect

107
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,620
by making ourselves stronger.

108
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,060
Is the Jade Pearl with you?

109
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,950
I can't give it to you.

110
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,430
They got two of my brothers.

111
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,740
It's a life-and-death matter.
I understand.

112
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
I will help you.

113
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,740
Could you tell me

114
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,950
what the Jade Pearl is?

115
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,300
I don't want my brother to die in vain.

116
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,180
The Jade Pearl carries clues to
the Holy Cauldron of Five Elements.

117
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,670
The Holy Cauldron of Five Elements?

118
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,620
The Holy Cauldron has been handed down
since Qin Shi Huang's days.

119
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,420
It is the supreme secret
of the royal families

120
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,950
and is guarded
by the five element families.

121
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,300
Ever since the Eight-Nation Alliance
entered the capital,

122
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,780
Yufeng Detectives seized on the chaos
and colluded with foreign countries

123
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,500
to encircle and suppress
the five element families,

124
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,150
and the Holy Cauldron's whereabouts
have been a mystery.

125
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,780
And the Jade Pearl is the only clue

126
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,180
to finding the Holy Cauldron.

127
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,340
What a jerk!

128
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,180
Just for this?

129
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,900
It's complicated

130
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,500
and I can't make it clear
in a few words.

131
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,220
In short, all forces

132
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,020
are eyeing this pearl.

133
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,710
It is dangerous for you to have it now.

134
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,710
This is my place.

135
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,180
Staying here. You can calm down.

136
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,110
Mr. Zhang.

137
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,340
How is it?

138
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,830
The man is called Huo Xiaoxie.

139
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,500
He is Liu Sanzhi's apprentice.

140
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,180
Somehow he got involved

141
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,300
with Black Whipper.

142
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,830
The girl's identity remains unknown.

143
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,540
She pretended to be a servant
in the Residence for more than a month

144
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,350
without getting noticed.

145
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,590
She must be a martial master.

146
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,710
We got two of Huo Xiaoxie's brothers

147
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,830
and are interrogating them.

148
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,270
It's my negligence.

149
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,540
I thought they were here
for the Jade Pearl.

150
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,100
But why did they

151
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,180
take my Linglong Mirror?

152
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,860
That's the only thing Jiao left me.

153
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,300
Who's that female thief?

154
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,540
It must

155
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,980
have something to do
with the Water family.

156
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,710
After all these years,

157
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,150
there is finally a clue.

158
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,660
The Jade Pearl is what matters.

159
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,180
No.

160
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,150
Now that everything
happened at the same time,

161
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,420
let's get them all done.

162
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,420
This time I have to find

163
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,540
the Holy Cauldron.

164
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,350
Yes, sir.

165
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,950
Piss off.

166
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,830
Where is Huo Xiaoxie?

167
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,770
You are so funny.

168
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,620
I'd like to know
where your private money is.

169
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,500
Would you tell me?

170
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,500
Where is Huo Xiaoxie?

171
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,820
No idea.

172
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,620
All I know is that

173
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,210
you are a jerk offspring

174
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,260
because of your wicked ancestors.

175
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,530
Stop.

176
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,450
I know where he is.

177
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,570
Lang Deben, what are you doing?

178
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,010
Say it.

179
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,330
Come over.

180
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,010
I will tell you.

181
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,690
Tell me.

182
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,180
Beat them hard.

183
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,740
Keep an eye on Huo Xiaoxie.

184
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,770
Don't let him get away.

185
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,330
Yes, sir.

186
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,530
Is the Jade Pearl with you?

187
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,180
You again.

188
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,180
Do you know you are in danger now?

189
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,820
Now the whole city

190
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,060
is looking for you.

191
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,300
If you keep the pearl

192
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,620
with you,

193
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,060
you will definitely be caught.

194
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,980
You also

195
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,770
want the pearl, right?

196
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:29,890
Am I right?

197
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,740
No one can take the pearl from me.

198
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,570
I'll trade it for the lives
of two of my brothers.

199
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,690
Are you crazy?

200
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,740
Yes.

201
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,380
Now do it my way.

202
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,650
You will get yourself killed.

203
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,260
You will end up in tragedy.

204
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,940
Yes, I know.

205
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,650
But don't let me die.

206
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,860
Or you will never
find that mirror again.

207
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,980
Are you threatening me?

208
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,940
Help me save my brothers,

209
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,690
and I will return your mirror.

210
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,450
You!

211
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,380
If you kill me,

212
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,860
you can never find that mirror anymore.

213
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,060
That's to say,

214
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,210
Huo Xiaoxie is just a thief.

215
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,450
How could he steal the Jade Pearl?

216
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,210
He must be with Black Whipper.

217
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,300
Black Whipper is such a troublemaker.

218
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:27,940
Right.

219
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,650
That's the love debt

220
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,570
of the Lord.

221
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,530
Never gossip about the Lord.

222
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,530
Continue to inquire about the news
after the meal.

223
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,060
We have to find Huo Xiaoxie

224
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,380
and get the Jade Pearl back.

225
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,010
- Country.
- Country.

226
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,260
- Home.
- Home.

227
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,860
- Country.
- Country.

228
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,210
- Home.
- Home.

229
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:49,820
Liu.

230
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,010
- Country.
- Country.

231
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,690
- Home.
- Home.

232
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,210
Xiaoxie, you are fine.

233
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,530
Great!

234
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,450
I thought you were caught
by the adjutant.

235
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,010
Do you have any news about
the Monkey and Lang Deben?

236
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,740
I've sent my people to look for them.

237
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,570
They'll let me know if there's any news.

238
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,260
Huo Xiaoxie.

239
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,530
You are...

240
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,860
We are enlightening people's wisdom,

241
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,570
trying to do something meaningful.

242
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,690
These kids say

243
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,260
you've been taking care of them
for years.

244
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,180
We should learn from you.

245
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,330
Don't say that.

246
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,530
They are left to you from now on.

247
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:25,570
Of course.

248
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,820
Children are the future,

249
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,860
the hope,

250
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,210
and our responsibility.

251
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,090
Something's up!

252
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,650
Something's up!

253
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,530
Xiaolang and the others

254
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,500
are tied up at the gate of
Mr. Zhang Si's mansion for public display.

255
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,090
They are dying.

256
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,330
The old guy

257
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,090
does have some tricks.

258
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,330
Mr. Zhou.

259
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,060
I'm sure
Huo Xiaoxie will definitely come.

260
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,450
Remember.

261
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,770
Keep an eye on them.

262
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:12,690
Got it.

263
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,010
All of you, come over.

264
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,450
Huo Xiaoxie may appear at any time.

265
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,210
Be sharp.

266
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,200
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

267
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,530
Let's go.

268
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,300
All of you,

269
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,650
watch carefully.

270
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,620
Anyone who dares to steal things

271
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,260
from the Zhang Residence
will end up like them.

272
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,860
They did commit theft.

273
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,940
I don't think they can make it.

274
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,020
Indeed.

275
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,060
They are still so young.

276
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,620
They are so badly wounded.

277
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,330
Poor guys.

278
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,380
This is what happens to thieves.

279
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,130
Why did they commit theft?

280
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,070
Yeah.

281
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,420
Master.

282
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,770
Move.

283
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,620
Come in.

284
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,530
You are such a fool.

285
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,890
Can't you see that it's a trap for you?

286
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,500
I know. I just came for scouting.

287
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,460
Leave, I will save them.

288
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,740
Master.

289
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,980
Guan is dead.

290
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,090
I can't put you at risk.

291
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,420
My bad.

292
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,180
I failed to

293
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,940
protect you.

294
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,330
We have to save them.

295
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,020
But it shouldn't be you doing it.

296
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,620
You are my most valued apprentice.

297
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:19,930
Usually

298
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,290
I don't care about what you do.

299
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,410
But today

300
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,380
I have to revenge myself.

301
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,900
Master, calm down.

302
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,290
Anyway, the Jade Pearl is with me.

303
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,570
The legendary Jade Pearl.

304
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,410
Black Whipper,

305
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,570
Zheng Zedao

306
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,740
and Mr. Zhang Si all want it.

307
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,090
Where is the pearl?

308
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,620
Where is it?

309
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,380
I swallowed it.

310
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,570
You swallowed it?

311
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,330
I will figure out a way to take it out.
Don't rush to revenge.

312
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:55,980
Hold on.

313
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,450
Hold on.

314
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:58,740
No worries.

315
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,170
Let's think about it.

316
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,690
Come on.

317
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,500
Well, find a place to hide.

318
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,500
If they can't find you,

319
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,050
they will come to me.

320
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,290
I will talk to them.

321
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,690
No way.

322
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,380
This will put you in danger.

323
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,860
Silly kid.

324
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,210
As long as you're safe,

325
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,740
I'll be fine.

326
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,860
Listen to me, go.

327
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,290
But...

328
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,140
Go.

329
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:26,810
Come on.

330
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,020
Not bad.

331
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,540
Look at them.

332
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,210
Yes, they are covered in blood.

333
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,340
I feel sorry for them.

334
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,570
Piss off.

335
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:42,860
Piss off.

336
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:43,930
Piss off.

337
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:45,900
Back.

338
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,450
- Traitor!
- Lackey!

339
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,020
- Traitor!
- Traitor!

340
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,540
Mr. Oda, this way, please.

341
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,500
Traitor!

342
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,610
Lackey!

343
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,330
Please.

344
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:01,810
Traitor!

345
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,690
Traitor!

346
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,930
- Traitor!
- Traitor!

347
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,500
Lackey! So shameless!

348
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,780
Mr. Zhang Si.

349
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,140
You seem to have little interest

350
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,090
in Mr. Puyi's ascension to the throne.

351
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,740
Mr. Oda, how come?

352
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,210
I have always been loyal

353
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,330
to the emperor.

354
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,380
Goddess Jade...

355
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,050
No,

356
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,740
I would say the Jade Pearl.

357
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,860
It is essential for finding
the Holy Cauldron of Five Elements.

358
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,780
Why did Mr. Zhang Si

359
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,140
spread the news in advance?

360
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,170
I can't reveal
the secret of the Jade Pearl.

361
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,330
So I need helpers.

362
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,330
Did you let them steal it on purpose?

363
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,140
Mr. Oda, sorry for scaring you.

364
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,290
It seems that

365
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,050
Mr. Zhang Si is quite confident.

366
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,980
Only the five element families

367
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,620
can unlock the secret of the Jade Pearl.

368
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,500
If they can't,

369
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,290
the Five Element Holy Cauldron
will never be found again.

370
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,210
We have reached an agreement
with Mr. Puyi

371
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,660
to help him establish a new Manchukuo
as soon as possible.

372
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,930
It is rumored in China that

373
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,260
the one who gets the cauldron
wins the country.

374
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,410
The Holy Cauldron was originally a gift
from our Imperial Majesty

375
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,810
to Emperor Xuantong.

376
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,450
So

377
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,140
as long as you can help us
find the treasure,

378
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,210
we will recommend you as

379
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,140
the head of the Guards Department

380
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,210
after the new Manchukuo is established
in the future.

381
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,210
We need the help
of the Dark Dragon Gang.

382
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,860
No problem.
We are always at your service.

383
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,090
Can Zhang Si really be of use to me?

384
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,500
Of course he has his own plan.

385
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,260
But

386
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,050
Yufeng Detective's minions
are all over China.

387
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,260
Those survivors of the bygone ages
of the Qing Dynasty.

388
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,780
You can't just ignore them.

389
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,450
I would be glad to see him

390
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,660
and the five element families
fight with each other.

391
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,660
Fight China with China.

392
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,540
Yes.

393
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,570
Traitor!

394
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,050
Piss off!

395
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,980
Do you have a conscience?

396
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,180
Get out of the way!

397
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,740
Traitor! Lackey!

398
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,380
Traitor!

399
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,140
You traitor, why did you
bully the Chinese?

400
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,840
Why?

401
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,900
How could you use lynching?

402
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,330
Lackey!

403
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,260
Traitor!

404
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,170
All of you.

405
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,140
Put them down.

406
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,780
Hurry up.

407
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,940
Stop shouting.

408
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,810
Bring them in.

409
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,290
Traitor!

410
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:08,690
Mr. Zhou.

411
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:09,810
Let's go.

412
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,020
- Lackey!
- Traitor!

413
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,020
When?

414
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,900
Okay, I see.

415
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,380
There are troublemakers
outside Mr. Zhang Si's mansion.

416
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,660
Go take a look.

417
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,540
Director.

418
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,050
Do you still want to protect Zhang Si?

419
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,290
What do you mean?

420
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,260
To help the Japanese,

421
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,980
Zhang Si used lynching to
torture two Chinese teenagers,

422
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,620
which aroused the anger
of the people in Fengtian.

423
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,690
But...

424
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,020
I see.

425
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,540
You are worried about how to
explain to the Commander in chief.

426
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,330
On the day of the auction,

427
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,860
adjutant Shao, who was with
Commander in chief, was killed.

428
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,410
He's the fair-haired boy
of the Commander in chief.

429
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,330
But Commander in chief didn't
take this matter as something important.

430
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,330
You know that

431
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,170
among the subordinates
of the Commander in chief,

432
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,690
adjutant Shao was the closest
with the Japanese.

433
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,290
You mean

434
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,700
Commander in chief isn't that loyal

435
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,380
to the Japanese?

436
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,660
I don't dare to speculate on
the Commander in chief's mind.

437
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,540
But Zhang Si

438
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,900
is like an untimely bomb.

439
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,090
No one knows if he will explode

440
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,100
and when.

441
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,090
The position of mayor is vacant.

442
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,690
You are now the top competitor.

443
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,500
It's better to save trouble.

444
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,860
In your opinion,

445
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,690
how should I handle this matter?

446
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,140
Ask Zhang Si to return the two teenagers

447
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,620
and win the hearts of
the people of Fengtian.

448
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,500
I have to ask the leader

449
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,090
for instructions on this matter.

450
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,380
Yes, sir.

451
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,620
Master Liu, you are finally back.

452
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,170
Sir, what are you...?

453
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,020
Mr. Zhang Si asked me
to bring you a present.

454
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,780
I sent your apprentice back to you.

455
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:20,450
Take it.

456
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,810
What?

457
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,090
You changed your mind?

458
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,780
Come on.

459
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,660
Did you poison me?

460
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,170
Huo Xiaoxie.

461
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,860
Admit it or not, you're a jerk.

462
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,810
Too sweet.

463
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,660
Huo Xiaoxie, listen.

464
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,020
I hate it most when people say
I'm a bad cook.

465
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,740
If you praise me,

466
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,170
maybe I'll help you.

467
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,540
Miss Water.

468
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,780
You are so nice,

469
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,860
cute,

470
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,050
and kind.

471
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,540
I'm begging you.

472
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,050
As long as you can save my brothers,

473
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,780
I'm willing to do anything for you.

474
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,290
Enough.

475
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,810
Sit down and eat.

476
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,210
Only when you've eaten well
can you have the strength to take revenge.

477
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,050
Listen.

478
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,860
I'm not doing this to help you

479
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,170
but to get my mirror back.

480
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,050
I know.

481
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,140
By then, if there is a real danger,

482
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,620
just be my assistant.

483
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,780
Assistant.

484
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,330
Distract them.

485
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,330
So I can meet my master.

486
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:58,620
Distract?

487
00:26:59,210 --> 00:26:59,930
How?

488
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,690
You are a girl.

489
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,170
Do I need to teach you this?

490
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,140
Excuse me...

491
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,140
Take this!

492
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,090
Guan.

493
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,090
Sorry for

494
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,620
this life.

495
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,050
Let's be brothers again
in the next life.

496
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,170
Master.

497
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,660
They sent someone
and delivered the message.

498
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,500
11 p.m.

499
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,740
At the mass grave.

500
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,570
Thank you, Master.

501
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,410
Who is this girl?

502
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:24,860
She...

503
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,810
She is my friend.

504
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,700
She helped me a lot.

505
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,290
I'm going with you tonight.

506
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,290
Master, but your condition...

507
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,740
Listen to me.

508
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,860
I can't just stand there watching.

509
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,050
Okay.

510
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,410
Wine.

511
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,170
Master.

512
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,410
Kid, rest in peace.

513
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,660
Guan, Master and I
will take your revenge.

514
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,740
We will rescue all our brothers

515
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,210
and return to our hometown
in Shandong together.

516
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,050
Don't worry.

517
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,690
Why am I a little dizzy?

518
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:33,860
Master.

519
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,570
Would you like to go to bed?

520
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,620
Okay.

521
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,170
Slow done.

522
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,450
Tonight...

523
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,450
Master, forgive me.

524
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,450
I will repay you in the next life.

525
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,090
Huo Xiaoxie, what did you do
to your master?

526
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:06,980
He's fine.

527
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,740
I drugged his wine.

528
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,050
I know my master well.

529
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:12,980
I can't put him at risk.

530
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,330
I will save them alone.

531
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,090
You are quite filial.

532
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,570
But you are simply courting death.

533
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,050
They won't let you go easily.

534
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,020
It's okay. I have my way.

535
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,620
Let's go.

536
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,260
Young hero.

537
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,020
Interesting.

538
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,090
Where is the pearl?

539
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,500
I hid it in a safe place.

540
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,170
Let them go.

541
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,540
I'll take you there.

542
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,050
You came alone?

543
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,930
I will accept the consequences
of my own doing.

544
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,450
To deal with you,

545
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,780
me alone, is enough.

546
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,410
Catch him.

547
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:36,980
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,140
Don't get close.

549
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,050
Home-made grenade.

550
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,090
Piss off.

551
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,050
Do you want to die?

552
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,570
I know you are unreliable.

553
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,570
Let them go. I will go with you.

554
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,860
Xiaoxie, leave us alone.

555
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,210
Right, Xiaoxie.

556
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,050
Go.

557
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,540
Listen to me.

558
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,260
Come over.

559
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,570
Look at them.

560
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,290
I'm afraid it's impossible for them
to go by themselves.

561
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:14,980
Well.

562
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,020
How about I ask someone

563
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,620
to send them both over there?

564
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:20,980
Okay.

565
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,260
- Xiaoxie.
- Xiaoxie.

566
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,570
Sorry.

567
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,860
Don't get close.

568
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:51,980
Brat.

569
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,260
You are so cruel.

570
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,690
Don't get close.

571
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:32,930
Huo Xiaoxie! I was wrong to trust you!

572
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,020
Then why are you still here?

573
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,290
Who are you?

574
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,290
What does it have to do with you?

575
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,020
Let her go, or I will ruin the pearl.

576
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,410
Old man, leave them alone.

577
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,140
Play with me.

578
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,260
Master!

579
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,860
Stop.

580
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,980
None of you can leave today.

581
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,100
Shui Yao'er.

582
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,500
Run!

583
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:58,820
Go.

584
00:34:59,260 --> 00:34:59,690
Come on.

585
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,650
Good for you.

586
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,130
Shut up.

587
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,450
It seems that

588
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,820
you really want to offend Mr. Zhang Si.

589
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,450
Anyone who dares to hurt my apprentice

590
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,780
is hurting my son.

591
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,610
Xiaoxie, are you okay?

592
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,580
I'm fine.

593
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,450
Step aside!

594
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,450
Old man!

595
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,610
Master!

596
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,450
Master!

597
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,340
Master!

598
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,210
Master!

599
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,740
Zhou!

600
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,610
You have been reported
for lynching abuse.

601
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,580
Come with me.

602
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,690
How dare you?

603
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,340
This is the official document
signed by the Director himself.

604
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,930
Catch me if you dare.

605
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,740
- Come on.
- Come on.

606
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:36,580
Let's go.

607
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:42,580
Huo Xiaoxie.

608
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,690
Take care of my brothers.

609
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,210
I will get my master out of here.

610
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,650
You, take them to the hospital.

611
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,300
