00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,060
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,520
Mr. Zhang, how are your wounds?

4
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,890
Didn't expect this Huo Xiaoxie

5
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,250
to be so good.

6
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,610
When driven by the dark flame,
the Fire family's techniques

7
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,520
are truly powerful.

8
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,420
I underestimated him.

9
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,370
Mr. Zheng,

10
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,780
you've caused me trouble time and again.

11
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,860
Do you also

12
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,090
work for the five element families?

13
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,450
Who I am doesn't matter.

14
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,730
But you are clearly a traitor
who conspires with the Japanese

15
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,240
and traffics in national treasures.

16
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,060
Captain Zheng,

17
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,170
I feel sorry for you.

18
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,300
At your age,

19
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,610
are you really content
with being a mere captain

20
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,060
in Fengtian?

21
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,170
What should I do then?

22
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,780
Be a traitor

23
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,780
like you?

24
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,700
During the Boxer Rebellion,

25
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,140
the five element families
disobeyed the imperial decree

26
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,860
and fled with the Holy Cauldron\
in chaos.

27
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,500
I, Yufeng Detective,
was ordered to capture these traitors.

28
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,580
The decisive battle
happened at Shanhaiguan,

29
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,420
where we were outnumbered by them.

30
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,700
Despite fighting fiercely

31
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,370
and killing more than
half of the traitors,

32
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,890
the Holy Cauldron
still ended up in their hands.

33
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,500
Since then, I've never slackened
in my efforts

34
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,730
to investigate,

35
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,010
so that I can recover the Holy Cauldron

36
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,940
to uphold my honor
as Yufeng Detective,

37
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,500
and kill the traitors

38
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,010
from the five element families

39
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,800
for revenge.

40
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,740
I am just serving my own master.

41
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,340
How could I be a traitor?

42
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,890
I know

43
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,380
you want to go
to the Five Elements Rally.

44
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,220
Help me find the Holy Cauldron,

45
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,340
and I'll help you become
the successor of the Fire family.

46
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,220
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

47
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,220
Come on then.

48
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,940
Kill me now.

49
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,780
I will fulfill your wish then.

50
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,050
I don't want to kill someone useless.

51
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,780
To succeed,

52
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,420
one must follow their own path.

53
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,930
I can't just die like this.

54
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,020
If Zhang Si agrees to help me,

55
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,250
it could be an opportunity.

56
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,740
Wan, how is he?

57
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,330
Don't worry.

58
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,300
It's nothing serious.

59
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,490
He used the power

60
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,930
of the dark flame within him.

61
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,740
He got so worn out that he passed out.

62
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,740
Shui Yao'er,

63
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,460
where is Jingtian?

64
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,420
He's with Black Whipper.

65
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,420
I think they escaped, too.

66
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,180
What about Zedao?

67
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,490
Did he escape?

68
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:42,980
This won't do.

69
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,020
I must go back and find him.

70
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,970
Don't move.

71
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,250
If it weren't for Wan,

72
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,880
you probably wouldn't be alive now.

73
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,460
But...

74
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,410
No buts.

75
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,810
Given the current situation,

76
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,420
even if the three of us
went there together,

77
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,700
we would get killed for nothing.

78
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,810
- Huo Xiaoxie.
- Huo Xiaoxie.

79
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,900
Help him sit up.

80
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:05,980
Cross his legs.

81
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,490
Do as I say.

82
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,050
From the dantian,
the five-element energy originates.

83
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,050
From the dantian,
the five-element energy originates.

84
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,620
The circulation of qi and blood
is what it regulates.

85
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,620
Ms. Whipper, are you alright?

86
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,140
Not dying yet.

87
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,330
Why?

88
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,620
Do you want to help me apply medicine?

89
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,050
I wouldn't dare
to offend you, Ms. Whipper.

90
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,460
So you'll leave me to die?

91
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,490
Ms. Whipper, you jest.

92
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,740
I'm done. You can turn around.

93
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,740
Back when we were in the secret chamber,

94
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,740
would you really have cut off
your own foot to save me?

95
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:23,900
Of course.

96
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,300
Do you have feelings for me?

97
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,700
I wouldn't dare.

98
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,860
You are devoted to the Fire King.

99
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,620
As a disciple of the Fire family,

100
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,810
it is my duty to keep you safe.

101
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,700
If you were the Fire King,

102
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,250
would you have abandoned me
to advance your martial arts skills?

103
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
I am not the Fire King.

104
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,020
It's a hypothesis.

105
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,250
The Fire King

106
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,930
bears the honor
of the entire Fire family.

107
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,460
Such a responsibility

108
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,580
is too significant
for frivolous speculation.

109
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,180
I hope you can forgive him.

110
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,770
What's more,

111
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,620
I hope the Fire King

112
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,930
can understand your good intentions,

113
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,460
and marry you soon.

114
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,580
Do you really think so?

115
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,300
I mean every word I said.

116
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,210
Thank you.

117
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,530
I'll go look around.

118
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,650
You should have a rest.

119
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,940
I think I've recovered.

120
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,210
I feel totally fine now.

121
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,890
Already?

122
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,940
The dark flame

123
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,300
may have been toning his body,

124
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,260
so his healing ability

125
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,130
is stronger than average.

126
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,500
That means you're tough and strong,

127
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,300
and you heal faster than others.

128
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,890
Got it?

129
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,860
By the way, Wan,

130
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,420
what was the technique
you taught him yesterday?

131
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,130
The Wood Element Technique.

132
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,690
What?

133
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,370
You actually taught him

134
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,160
the Wood King's technique?

135
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,330
Only the first level.

136
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,450
Wood nourishes fire, so the technique
can warm and heal his body.

137
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,530
The Wood family
won't ask anything of him.

138
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,860
A skill learned
is a skill gained, isn't it?

139
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,010
What's with the anger?

140
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,210
I'm hungry.

141
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,300
Go find something to eat.

142
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,120
You guys

143
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,180
aren't going to fight, right?

144
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,270
I'll fight you!

145
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:48,920
Just go!

146
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,570
Are you really mad?

147
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,650
Wan, you really went all out.

148
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,970
You even taught him
your family's secret technique.

149
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,690
You're trying to steal him from me.

150
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,620
Although the five element families
seem united,

151
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,620
they've kept
their own techniques secret for years

152
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,500
and refused to share them.

153
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,500
This made them vulnerable as a whole

154
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,770
when faced with strong enemies.

155
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,330
Master once said to me

156
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,020
that to revitalize
the five element families,

157
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,740
the Five Elements Rally alone
won't be enough.

158
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,420
We must also
drop the gatekeeper mindset.

159
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,610
This technique from the Wood family

160
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,530
can help regulate the dark flame
in Huo Xiaoxie's body

161
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,180
and improve his martial arts skills.

162
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,570
Really?

163
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,010
Of course.

164
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,080
Wan, I owe you one.

165
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,170
I'll repay you someday.

166
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,030
But,

167
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,770
can you not compete with me for him?

168
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,090
I can give you anything you want,

169
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,300
except him.

170
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,770
Who's competing with you for him?

171
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,980
You are the only one
who thinks he's precious.

172
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,770
You are so beautiful and kind, Wan.

173
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,690
You're the best.

174
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,920
Don't try to butter me up.

175
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,120
But what are you going to do
about your condition?

176
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,600
My father has been helping me
keep it under control.

177
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,490
Whatever.

178
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,800
As long as I can be with the one I like,

179
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,840
even...

180
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,610
even if it's just for a day,
it's worth a lifetime.

181
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,570
What about you and that Zheng Zedao?

182
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,720
Why are you bringing him up
all of a sudden?

183
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,570
What's wrong with him?

184
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,690
He's proficient in martial arts.

185
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,740
He saved us.

186
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,340
And he seems like a nice guy.

187
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,180
Don't you have
the slightest interest in him?

188
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,740
Whoever likes him can have him.

189
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,860
I am not interested.

190
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,900
I see.

191
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,810
If you like him,

192
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,050
you can have him.

193
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,080
Don't be silly!

194
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,900
Where is Wangjiapu?

195
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,450
Right behind that mountain ahead.

196
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,240
We have to go over a mountain?

197
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,860
I twisted my ankle.

198
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,540
What's wrong?

199
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,800
Are you alright?

200
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,820
I just got injured somehow.

201
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,610
Let me see.

202
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,490
Is it serious?

203
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,370
It's fine.

204
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,540
Just let him carry me.

205
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,490
Okay.

206
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,340
Be careful.

207
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,420
You'd better let Wan take a look.

208
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,810
What if you've hurt your tendon or bone?

209
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,420
No, I just want you to carry me.

210
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,350
Come on.

211
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,570
Are you okay?

212
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,660
Listen.

213
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,370
My foot's not really injured.

214
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,300
I just want to ask you
to steal back the Jade Pearl.

215
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,380
What did you say?

216
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,370
Keep your voice down.
Don't let her hear you.

217
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,690
Just tell me whether you'll do it.

218
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,930
Of course not.

219
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,000
The Jade Pearl is supposed to pay

220
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,130
for Wan for treating me.

221
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,860
If I stole it back,

222
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,980
wouldn't that make me a villain?

223
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,810
How dare you imply that I am a villain!

224
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,490
Do you think I want that pearl

225
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,450
for myself?

226
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,690
It's to help you get back
the Black Stone Fire Token.

227
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,860
But I...

228
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,810
Then let me tell you.

229
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,100
I don't care if I have the Jade Pearl.

230
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,900
But without the Black Stone Fire Token,
I might not be able to save you.

231
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,860
Don't blame me then.

232
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,930
I won't blame you.

233
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,420
I know you want
to use it to save my life.

234
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,420
There's more.

235
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,810
I actually

236
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,250
sneaked out this time.

237
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,370
When I go back,
Father will definitely punish me severely.

238
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,370
If I only get a beating or a scolding,
I'll consider it lenient.

239
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,600
More likely, he'll lock me up
for three to five years.

240
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,280
If so, who knows how long it will be

241
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,460
before we can see each other again?

242
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,570
Then why are you being so reckless?

243
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,540
Actually, the five element families
are one family.

244
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,340
Whether the Jade Pearl
is in the hands of the Wood King

245
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,360
or my father,

246
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,340
it's all the same.

247
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,450
But if I go back empty-handed,

248
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,340
Father definitely won't let me
get away with it.

249
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,810
You wouldn't want me to suffer, right?

250
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,540
I'm too delicate for that.

251
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,180
I'd be toast.

252
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,780
Huo Xiaoxie!

253
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,570
What happened?

254
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,730
Wan.

255
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,690
I am hurt.
The injury is getting worse now.

256
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,180
Let me see.

257
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,530
How could you be so careless?

258
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,660
Ouch.

259
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,660
Does this hurt?

260
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,740
Yes.

261
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,400
What about here?

262
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,290
It hurts too.

263
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,690
And here?

264
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:09,930
It hurts even more.

265
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,820
I don't think it's a bone injury.

266
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,340
Wan,

267
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,910
I didn't break my leg, did I?

268
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,690
I'll apply some medicine for you.

269
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,050
It's healed.

270
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,660
Already?

271
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,540
Wan, you are amazing!

272
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,180
Look. I can even jump!

273
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,780
Good.

274
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,900
Wangjiapu is just ahead.

275
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,870
I'll leave you two alone.

276
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,500
Aren't you going home yet?

277
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,250
I need to show Huo Xiaoxie around,
right?

278
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,770
Then make sure to go home early,

279
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,530
or you'll upset the Water King again.

280
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,260
Goodbye, Wan.

281
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:12,810
Did you get it?

282
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,610
I hope you're not playing me,

283
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,980
or I've really disappointed Wan.

284
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,780
You'll either disappoint her

285
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,300
or disappoint me.

286
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,780
Pick your poison.

287
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,740
Of course, I choose to disappoint you.

288
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,740
How dare you!

289
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,100
If you dare to disappoint me,

290
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,490
I'll kill you.

291
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,860
Here. Take the pearl.

292
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,860
That's more like it.

293
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,490
Your act was quite convincing.

294
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,420
I think so too.

298

Master.

299
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,660
Wan, you are back.

300
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,300
Master, how have you been lately?

301
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,980
Same as always.

302
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,420
What brings you back?

303
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,610
It's all because of the trouble
Shui Yao'er caused.

304
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,270
That traitor, Mr. Zhang Si from Fengtian,
was hunting us down

305
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,900
and almost got us killed.

306
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,180
Thankfully, Mr. Yan from the Fire family
and his men helped us.

307
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,700
But two of his men died.

308
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,010
Why was he after you?

309
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,510
Because Shui Yao'er took his treasure.

310
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,530
What treasure?

311
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,840
The Jade Pearl.

312
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,610
The Jade Pearl?

313
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,550
I twisted my ankle.

314
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,020
Let me see.

315
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,940
How could you be so careless?

316
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:51,970
Oh, no.

317
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,050
What's wrong?

318
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,050
I got played by Shui Yao'er again.

319
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,820
This won't do.
I must go get the Jade Pearl back.

320
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,980
Let it be.

321
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,940
Let them have it.

322
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,580
But I...

323
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:12,580
By the way,

324
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:13,980
Master,

325
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,460
I met someone else on the way.

326
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,980
Shui Yao'er said she planned to take him
to the Five Elements Rally.

327
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,410
He carries the dark flame bloodline.

328
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,940
The dark flame bloodline?

329
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:24,890
Are you sure?

330
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,620
Yes.

331
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,700
What's his character like?

332
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,170
He got injured trying to save us.

333
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,500
To keep him alive,

334
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,580
I taught him the first level

335
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,620
of the Wood Element Technique.

336
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,050
Master,

337
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,100
you won't blame me for this, right?

338
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,370
Everything follows a natural order.

339
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,220
The universe holds
a destiny in store for everyone.

The emergence of the Jade Pearl
alongside a dark flame descendant

341

foretells a Five Elements Rally
rife with unforeseen twists.

342
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,700
Those endowed with the dark flame
have never been ordinary.

343
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,130
With careful guidance,
this very descendant

344
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,400
may well hold the key to revitalizing

345
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,680
the five element families.

346
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,690
You must pay close attention to him.

347
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,500
Go.

348
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,370

I'm bringing you here
to expand your horizons.

372
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:37,650
Let's go.

373
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,350
Zedao,

374
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,120
our Zheng family from northern Jiangsu
has been experiencing a downturn

375
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,170
with waning fortunes.

376
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,380
Fortunately, you still have

377
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,130
a marriage arrangement
with the Water family.

378
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,650
Marrying Shui Yao'er will gain you

379
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,740
the support of the five element families

380
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,290
and thus the Holy Cauldron
of Five Elements.

381
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,890
Then, the revitalization of our family
will only be a matter of time.

382
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,370
Father, rest assured.

383
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,530
I will secure the Holy Cauldron.

384
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,370
Zedao.

385
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,860
Zedao, wake up.

386
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:25,860
Anyone here?

387
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,250
Help!

388
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,530
Open the door!

389
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,130
Miss and Mister, what would you like?

390
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,520
One of your best rooms,
and something delicious.

391
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,340
Right away.

392
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:35,660
What do you think?

393
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,650
Isn't Wangjiapu great?

394
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,980
[Wine]

395
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,170
What do you think?

396
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,650
Can you take them?

397
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,370
Right now,

398
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,860
probably not.

399
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,650
What about these two?

400
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,100
- Tea's coming!
- I don't fight women.

401
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,920
Enjoy your tea.

402
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,530
Thanks.

403
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,060
Can you handle these two?

404
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,340
Then you have no chance of winning.

405
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,460
What are we going to do?

406
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,050
Are the Three Firegate Tasks
only about fighting?

407
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,170
What else can they be about?

408
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,170
Who has a thicker skin?

409
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,160
Help!

410
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,460
Someone's dead!

411
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,860
- Help!
- Waiter!

412
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,290
Boss.

413
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:46,990
What's going on?

414
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,220
- I'll go check.
- No idea.

415
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,130
Even when napping,

416
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,370
I am alert to my surroundings.

417
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,580
During my nap,

418
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,730
I suddenly sensed a shadow

419
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,220
coming at me.

420
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,130
I got up with a kip-up,

421
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,860
ready to end him with one punch.

422
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,530
But then it hit me.

423
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,290
I couldn't kill him.

424
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,650
I had to keep him alive

425
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,100
to figure out who he was

426
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,290
and why he dared to attack
a participant in the Five Elements Rally.

427
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,460
But the guy was a wild one.

428
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,860
He took poison and killed himself.

429
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,170
Stop bragging.

430
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,740
Who would steal from you?

431
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,410
You don't believe me, huh?

432
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,650
Let me tell you.

433
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,820
I've also traveled extensively

434
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,460
and made a name for myself out there.

435
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,620
Mister, don't tamper with the scene,

436
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,530
or I won't be able to prove
I was attacked.

437
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,410
Is there a dyehouse nearby?

438
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,860
Yes, there's one to the east.

439
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,710
I recognize this man.

440
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,470
He worked for Mr. Zhang Si.

441
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,440
Mr. Zhang Si?

442
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,760
Doesn't he live in Fengtian?

443
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,710
What's he doing here?

444
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,440
What's going on?

445
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,230
Huo Xiaoxie?

446
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,040
Jingtian.

447
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,110
Did Shui Yao'er bring you here?

448
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,710
Yes.

449
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,860
That's one of Mr. Zhang Si's men.

450
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,480
Everyone out.

451
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,710
Let's cooperate, everyone. Let's go.

452
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,500
Don't leave. I'm not done talking.

453
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,770
Thank you, Mr. Shui, for saving my life.

454
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,880
No need to thank me.

455
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,290
It was this lady

456
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,770
from the Wood family who saved you.

457
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,210
Thank you, Miss Lin.

458
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,840
Follow this prescription
to prepare the herbs.

459
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,260
Simmer gently, until the liquid reduces
from three bowls to one.

460
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,950
Yes.

461
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,570
Though you are young,

462
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,160
you managed to escape
from the hands of Zhang Si.

463
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,280
Very impressive.

464
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,350
You flatter me, Mr. Shui.

465
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,400
I am no match for Zhang Si.

466
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,280
I was just lucky.

467
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,710
I slipped away
when the Hook Troop was resting.

468
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,950
The Three Firegate Tasks are coming up.

469
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,800
Stay here while you recover.

470
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,160
Thank you, Mr. Shui.

471
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,440
Take the young master to his room
so he can rest.

472
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,190
Yes.

473
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,090
This way, please.

474
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,640
Mr. Shui, where is Yao'er?

475
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,350
Why isn't she here?

476
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,470
What?

477
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,490
Has Yao'er returned?

478
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,160
He worked for Mr. Zhang Si.

479
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
But I don't know why he came here.

480
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,430
Right.

481
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,590
And I suspect

482
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,990
that the guy who died yesterday

483
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,280
was killed by him, too.

484
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,920
I am busy
with the Three Firegate Tasks now.

485
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,310
I don't have time for this.

486
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,470
Huo Xiaoxie,

487
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,440
here's a chance for you to shine.

488
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,040
You want to join
the five element families, right?

489
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,310
Find out what happened here for me.

490
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,280
What's in it

491
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,400
for me?

492
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,590
Are you still asking me for benefits?

493
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,310
Haven't I given you enough already?

494
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,230
One can never have too many benefits.

495
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,300
But...

496
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,190
But I will do my best.

497
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,590
Cut the chatter.

498
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,760
Everyone's watching.

499
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:09,990
Don't bungle the job.

500
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,640
Do it with the same craftiness
you used on me.

501
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,520
No problem.

502
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,560
What are you two talking about?

503
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,950
I am still here.

504
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,280
I am the one who caught him.

505
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,010
You are taking my credit!

506
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:26,950
Jingtian,

507
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,950
this guy

508
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,470
managed to handle
a Hook Troop member on his own.

509
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,520
He can probably be useful.

510
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,040
I can use some help anyway.

511
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,940
We'll count you in then.

512
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,640
Jingtian, one more thing.

513
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,640
Could you seal this place off
for a few hours?

514
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,350
No.

515
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:43,570
Will do!

516
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,260
Listen up, everyone.

517
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,180
Jingtian just said

518
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,320
that the Grand Way Inn
would be sealed off for four hours.

519
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,360
No way! On what grounds?

520
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,100
- No way!
- Why's that?

521
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,030
That little brat!

522
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,760
No way!

523
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:54,800
You little brat.

524
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,870
In Wangjiapu,
what the Fire family says goes.

525
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,740
Everyone, just go.

526
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,160
Come on. Go back to your rooms.

527
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,470
Let's go.

528
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,220
Come on.

529
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,560
Manager,
are any strangers around just now?

530
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,350
No.

531
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,880
Everyone staying here came
for the Three Firegate Tasks.

532
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,640
We keep track of them all.

533
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,110
Let's go.

534
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,600
Yes.

535
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,190
Get ready for trouble.

536
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,190
Make sure you do what you promised me.

537
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,760
Yes.

538
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,640
Did our Miss return with you?

539
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,190
Sir, you are...?

540
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,050
Do you know who our Miss is?

541
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,090
Who is your Miss?

542
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,500
She is the daughter of the Water King.

543
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,810
And who are you?

544
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:56,930
Where is Shui Yao'er?

545
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,780
One must know their place.

546
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,260
If you don't,

547
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,170
let me make it clear.

548
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,660
Our Miss is not someone you can covet.

549
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:10,930
From now on,

550
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,860
if you dare

551
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,260
to show your face around her again,

552
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,570
don't blame me for being rude.

553
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,930
Who is this guy,
acting all high and mighty?

554
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,090
It's none of your business.

555
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,060
[Grand Way Inn]

556
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,660
Wait for me!

557
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,330
My name is Jin Pan.

558
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,330
I am Huo Xiaoxie from Fengtian.

559
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,620
"Huo" as in a scorching fire,

560
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,780
and "Xie" as in "evil".

561
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,290
Xiaoxie,

562
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,540
should we eat something first?

563
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,410
I am hungry.

564
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,500
Are you coming or not?

565
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,380
Sirs, enjoy your tea.

566
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,930
Where are we going now?

567
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,570
The dyehouse.

568
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,780
Huo Xiaoxie.

569
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,090
Bro.

570
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,330
Huo Xiaoxie!

571
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,410
Where is he?

572
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,020
Xiaoxie, you scared me.

573
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,870
Bro, there's no one here.

574
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,860
Do you think someone tipped them off?

575
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,140
Come on.

576
00:28:59,220 --> 00:28:59,810
Let's go back to the inn.

577
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,930
[Fragrant Orchids in Hidden Valley]
That's how it went down.

578
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,380
I couldn't bring back

579
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,050
Shouzhen and Shouyi.

580
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,740
It's all my fault.

581
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,620
I am useless.

582
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,170
Please punish me.

583
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,480
Enough. Stand up.

584
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,690
The Water King sent word

585
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,500
that he had the Jade Pearl

586
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,890
and that he wanted me
to go and discuss matters with him.

587
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,380
Right now, your top priority should be

588
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,050
the Five Elements Rally.

589
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:36,810
Yes.

590
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:38,930
There's one more thing.

591
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,140
Ms. Black Whipper
has been looking for you.

592
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,050
I know she is.

593
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,690
Back then,

594
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,860
I made a mistake in my training

595
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,140
and almost died.

596
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,020
She saved my life.

597
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,020
We spent a lot of time together.
We got close.

598
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,260
And I did something I shouldn't have.

599
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,090
Then why didn't you marry her?

600
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,020
When I succeeded Master as the Fire King,
I promised him

601
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,740
I would dedicate myself to the cause,

602
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,900
and I would not marry or have children.

603
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,290
I explained to her,

604
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,660
but she could never accept it.

605
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,410
I admit

606
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,690
that this is my fault.

607
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:23,690
But whatever happens,

608
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,380
I can't meet her.

609
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,450
I'm afraid...

610
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,050
I'm afraid it's too late.

611
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,890
Yan Lie, come out!

612
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,330
You can't go in!

613
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:38,930
Move!

614
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,680
- Sir, you can't hide forever.
- You can't go in!

615
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,980
- Then I'll stop being nice!
- Sooner or later...

616
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,020
- You can't go in!
- you have to face it.

617
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,280
How did she find this place?

618
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,300
Get out of the way.

619
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,740
- Get lost!
- I'll deal with you later.

620
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,210
Come out!

621
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,380
Where is he?

622
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,740
Where is Yan Lie?

623
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,290
He's gone.

624
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,740
Yan Lie, come out!

625
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,260
If you don't, I'll kill him!

626
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,570
Everyone says you're a hero.

627
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,290
But to me,

628
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,900
you're just a heartless coward.

629
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,050
You promised to marry me

630
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,450
and take care of me for life.

631
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,410
Why do you keep avoiding me?

632
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,540
You've become the Fire King,

633
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,380
and I've become a joke.

634
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,260
This is not my fate.

635
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,780
I don't accept it!

636
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,860
Today, I just have one question for you.

637
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,690
Have you ever loved me?

638
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:17,620
Yan Lie.

639
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,660
Yan Lie.

640
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,050
Come out!

641
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,660
Come out!

642
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,570
You can all leave now.

643
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:29,660
Go!

644
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,260
There are things

645
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,090
that are meant to be let go.

646
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:45,930
Let go?

647
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,660
And let all these years be for nothing?

648
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,090
Getting over the Fire King

649
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,130
is also a way of freeing yourself.

650
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,580
Mr. Three Snakes, let me out!

651
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,660
Whoever lets me out today

652
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,410
will be handsomely rewarded!

653
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,580
Wan, why are you here?

654
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,060
I'm relieved to see
you've returned safely.

655
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,700
Where's the Jade Pearl?

656
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,780
Did you snitch to my father?

657
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,660
What a low blow!

658
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,540
Look who's talking!

659
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,390
What are you arguing about?

660
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,720
Father.

661
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,210
Mr. Shui,

662
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,450
I asked Yao'er
to bring the Jade Pearl back to you.

663
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,540
Now that I see she's returned safely,
I have nothing to worry about.

664
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,730
I will take my leave.

665
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,580
Thank the Wood King for me
when you get home.

666
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,300
Father...

667
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,730
What were you trying to do?

668
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:16,730
Running off without a word,

669
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,780
were you trying
to give me a heart attack?

670
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,140
Father,

671
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,250
I am back now, aren't I?

672
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,450
Don't be angry.

673
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,890
Come on. Take a seat.

674
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,870
Don't be upset.

675
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,730
If Three Snakes hadn't brought you back,

676
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,980
would you have come back?

677
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,380
I...

678
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,380
Father,

679
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,140
I didn't run away from home.

680
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,860
I went to find the Linglong Mirror.

681
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,370
It belonged to Mother,

682
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,780
so I wanted to find it
and give it back to you.

683
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,770
Where's the mirror then?

684
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,620
I've hidden it

685
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,490
somewhere incredibly secret,

686
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,820
where not even immortals could find it.

687
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,280
But I promise to bring it back
after the contest

688
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,410
of the Three Firegate Tasks

689
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,060
is over.

690
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,810
Three Snakes.

691
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,140
Amazing, Father.

692
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,620
You're even better than the immortals.

693
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:31,930
You're becoming

694
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,490
increasingly unruly
as you grow up.

695
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,060
I've really spoiled you.

696
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,140
Hand over the Jade Pearl.

697
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,410
Let me exchange it for something else.

698
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,700
The Black Stone Fire Token, right?

699
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,100
Why do you know everything?

700
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,670
I also know you've been hanging around

701
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,690
with someone named Huo Xiaoxie
these days.

702
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,690
Yao'er,

703
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,580
you're a grown woman now,

704
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,860
and you're betrothed.

705
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,450
How are you going to get married

706
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,100
if you keep messing around outside?

707
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,810
I didn't want to get married
in the first place,

708
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,690
especially not to that Zheng Zedao!

709
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,210
This

710
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,440
is not up to you.

711
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,000
Your mother arranged

712
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,170
this match for you

713
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,580
to save your life.

714
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,060
Mother died when I was little.

715
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,170
If she knew I didn't like him,

716
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,650
she definitely
wouldn't make me marry him.

717
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,490
Besides, Father,

718
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,060
Huo Xiaoxie saw me

719
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,930
in that mirror,

720
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,510
just like you saw Mother

721
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,930
in it back then.

722
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,280
Not only do you look like your mother,

723
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,820
but you also have the same character

724
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,120
as her.

725
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,060
Back then,

726
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,540
when she was poisoned severely,

727
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,070
only Zhang Si

728
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,300
could save her.

729
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:12,690
However,

730
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,490
she refused to seek his help.

731
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,250
By the time I found out,

732
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,040
it was already too late.

733
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,490
Mother was wise.

734
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,820
She didn't want to be apart from you.

735
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,580
You understand your mother's intentions,

736
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,580
but

737
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,930
do you know how I feel?

738
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,020
It's been 16 years

739
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,520
since she passed away.

740
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,020
For all these years,

741
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,450
I've always wondered

742
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,140
if it was me

743
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,420
who caused her death.

744
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,580
Of course not.

745
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:02,890
You've stayed single

746
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,250
for Mother's sake.

747
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,890
You've truly honored her love for you.

748
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,490
After your mother passed away,

749
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,730
I wanted to follow her, too.

750
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,120
But you were too young,

751
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,380
and

752
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,100
you were very frail.

753
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,140
If I had left you behind,

754
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,840
your mother
would never have forgiven me.

755
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,730
Over the years,
I have watched you grow up

756
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,450
to look more and more like your mother.

757
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,820
Sometimes, I even mistakenly thought

758
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,390
that she had come back.

759
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,010
I often wonder

760
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,600
what your mother would look like

761
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,710
if she were still alive.

762
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,370
What would she look like

763
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,560
with white hair?

764
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,380
Would she still be beautiful

765
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,690
with wrinkles all over her face?

766
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,140
But I know

767
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,730
I'll never see her again

768
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,540
in this life.

769
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,540
Yao'er,

770
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,170
for the sake of your mother

771
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,730
and me,

772
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,210
you must live a good and healthy life.

773
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,060
Moreover,

774
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,060
I can't bear

775
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,540
another blow like that in this life.

776
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,490
Therefore,

777
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,890
you must marry

778
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,210
Zheng Zedao.

779
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,300
Three Snakes,

780
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,690
keep a close watch on my daughter.

781
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,730
Don't let her step out of the residence.

782
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:00,780
Yes, Master.

783
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:09,960
Manager,

784
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,210
when did the person who just died
check in?

785
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,450
Recently, everyone who's checked in

786
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,970
is here for the Five Elements Rally.

787
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,340
That person wasn't staying at our inn.

788
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,450
It seems Mr. Zhang Si's men

789
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,730
have already infiltrated Wangjiapu.

790
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,980
What should we do then?

791
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,020
Starting today,

792
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,970
I'll let the disciples
of the Fire family

793
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,980
strictly screen everyone

794
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,060
entering and leaving Wangjiapu,
especially those participating

795
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:29,970
in the Five Elements Rally.

796
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:30,970
You can leave now.

797
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

798
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,690
So, you're saying

799
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,020
that Zhang Si is after us

800
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,860
because he wants the Jade Pearl back?

801
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,620
But Wangjiapu is our turf.

802
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,640
A direct confrontation
would be suicidal for him.

803
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,300
Is he trying to create chaos
so he can steal the pearl?

804
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,850
I think there's more to it.

805
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:51,820
I have a feeling

806
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,780
that Zhang Si has other motives.

807
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,990
What do you make of the situation?

808
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,520
Right now, he's outnumbered,

809
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,280
so he definitely won't
confront us head-on.

810
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,440
The guy he sent
would rather poison himself to death

811
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,960
than be captured alive.

812
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,390
He clearly did so
to avoid leaking Zhang Si's plans.

813
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,960
The Five Elements Rally
takes place once every 20 years.

814
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,150
It is a major event.
We cannot afford any mistakes.

815
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,720
Yufeng Detective is known
for being cunning.

816
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,270
There must be more of his people
in the city.

817
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,150
Huo Xiaoxie,

818
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,070
I'll let you handle this.

819
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,100
No problem.

820
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:34,440
What's the matter?

821
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,680
Still worried about Yao'er?

822
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,260
I'm fine.

823
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,830
I can tell that Yao'er truly likes you,

824
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,950
but you can't go find her now.

825
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,700
More haste, less speed.

826
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,870
Focus on the task at hand first,

827
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,730
and you will thus be known
to the Water King.

828
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,070
Jingtian,

829
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:02,690
you are right.

830
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,680
I must join the five element families.

831
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:06,920
Kiddo,

832
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,720
I knew I was right about you.

833
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,730
Only after you make it through
the Three Firegate Tasks

834
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,120
will you be able to truly secure a place
in the five element families.

835
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,030
Only then will you be worthy of Yao'er.

836
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,080
I understand.
