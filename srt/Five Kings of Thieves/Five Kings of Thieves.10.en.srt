[Five Kings of Thieves]

2
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,060
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,330
Stay here

4
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,880
for the next few days.

5
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,880
Don't go out.

6
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,690
I'll bring you food.

7
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,730
Except when you come,

8
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,240
I'll pretend I'm not here.

9
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,160
Or my father will take me back again.

10
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,010
Sorry for the trouble.

11
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,560
There is no trouble

12
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,440
when I'm with you.

13
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,760
Promise me to take care of myself.

14
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,930
I'll wait for you to come back.

15
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:18,840
Close your eyes.

16
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,400
Close your eyes.

17
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,250
Then,

18
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,390
Shui Yao'er bailed on the wedding.
She escaped with Huo Xiaoxie.

19
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,510
Zheng Zedao...

20
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,800
You've made a big joke out of this.

21
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,250
Mr. Zhang.

22
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,840
Why don't we take advantage
of the situation?

23
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,360
Zheng Zedao will be reckless

24
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,960
after being so humiliated.

25
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,440
So we...

26
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:18,930
What do you think?

27
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,530
It's time for me to settle my score

28
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,810
with Water King.

29
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,920
Father-in-law.

30
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,840
Let's get Yao'er back now.

31
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,450
It's useless.

32
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,890
Marriage is a matter for the parents.

33
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,980
God can prove

34
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,840
that Yao'er is now my wife.

35
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,310
My nephew.

36
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,760
Let's call it quits.

37
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,200
I'll write to your father

38
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,560
about it.

39
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,680
This time, the Water family

40
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,760
is sorry for the Zheng family.

41
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,010
What about Yao'er?

42
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,450
You don't care about her life?

43
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,830
Of course, I want her to live.

44
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,490
But she

45
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,120
has made her choice.

46
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,920
As her father,

47
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,610
I can only wish her well.

48
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,370
Prepare for the Three Firegate Tasks.

49
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:27,940
[Wine]

50
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,830
What are you doing here?

51
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,520
Zedao.

52
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,870
Stop drinking.

53
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,110
It's bad for your health.

54
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,360
Today, I've become a joke
to the whole world.

55
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,590
You're the only one
who still cares about my health.

56
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,200
I know it's hard on you

57
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,520
but no matter what,

58
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,590
it's only temporary.

59
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,040
Who told you it's temporary?

60
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,680
I can't get through this.

61
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,960
I just know it.

62
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,050
Although you come from a famous family,

63
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,410
you are not like those other playboys

64
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
who are only debauched every day.

65
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,390
You care about the world

66
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,270
and are always striving for your ideals

67
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,150
and ambitions.

68
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,910
You're not a self-destructive person.

69
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,870
Who told you that?

70
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,950
I...

71
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,650
I...

72
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,360
I didn't expect

73
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,080
there could be someone

74
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,240
who understands me so well.

75
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,780
[Wine]

76
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,990
Jiao.

77
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,150
I don't know

78
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,640
if I'm doing the right thing.

79
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,080
If you were alive,

80
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,390
would you approve of our daughter

81
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,110
making the same choice you did?

82
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,990
Zedao.

83
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:33,870
Mr. Shui.

84
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,080
I'm going to Three Firegate Tasks.

85
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,690
Okay.

86
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,750
Hasn't Yao'er come back yet?

87
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,270
No.

88
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:42,880
Master.

89
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,390
Master, a letter for you.

90
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,800
Zhang Si, you're killing yourself.

91
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,680
Sirs, here's your food.

92
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,710
You.

93
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,360
Come...

94
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,800
Where's Huo Xiaoxie?

95
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,880
He went out early.

96
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,800
Have you seen Shui Yao'er?

97
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,000
No.

98
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,590
Boss, Ms. Lin. Something happened.

99
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,710
Shui Yao'er has been captured
by Mr. Zhang Si.

100
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,950
Water King and Zheng Zedao
have gone out to look for her.

101
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,920
Where's Huo Xiaoxie?

102
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,710
Three Snakes went to Dadao Inn

103
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,190
but couldn't find them.

104
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,000
The Three Firegate Tasks
are about to begin.

105
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,800
What should we do?

106
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,510
I'll go look again.

107
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,510
You guys continue to prepare
for the Three Firegate Tasks.

108
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,240
Go ahead. I'll take care of things here.

109
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,390
Mr. Shui.

110
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,190
Mr. Zhang Si is a trickster.

111
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,710
You're in charge,

112
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,630
so you shouldn't risk your life.

113
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,390
Why don't you go first?

114
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,950
I'll go meet him.

115
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:11,710
It's too late.

116
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,750
You don't know there are treasures

117
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,920
you've never seen before.

118
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,360
Shui Yao'er.

119
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,150
Wan, what are you doing here?

120
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,800
You weren't captured by Mr. Zhang Si.

121
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,630
That's good.

122
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,390
What are you talking about?

123
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh, no.

124
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,560
Mr. Zhang Si must have claimed
he had you

125
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,120
to lure Water King to show up.

126
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,120
Mr. Shui is in danger.

127
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,440
Where's my father?

128
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,270
Come with me.

129
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,880
Zhang Si.

130
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,830
Show yourself.

131
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,800
Water King,
you really love your daughter.

132
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,880
I always thought you'd just

133
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,950
cowardly hide in Wangjiapu
all these years.

134
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,880
Zhang Si.

135
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,480
Hatred does not involve family.

136
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,040
If you're a man,

137
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,000
release my daughter.

138
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,120
Taking my wife is not forgivable.

139
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,150
Today I am going to eliminate
five element families

140
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,830
for the court and take your head

141
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,590
to fulfill the emperor's order.

142
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,830
Your wife?

143
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,630
Shameless!

144
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,510
My master had already betrothed her
to me.

145
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,530
You lured her

146
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,910
into a dishonorable act

147
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,830
and conceived your daughter.

148
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,920
I don't want to talk nonsense.

149
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,510
If you dare,

150
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,360
come and take my life yourself.

151
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,230
You can't run away.

152
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,280
I've come as you promised.

153
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,710
Let my daughter go.

154
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,750
Your daughter?

155
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,190
You're too late.

156
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,440
I've already killed her.

157
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,560
What?

158
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,400
Go!

159
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,920
Be careful!

160
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,950
Go.

161
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Your death by my hand

162
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,240
is my response to Master.

163
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,250
Ridiculous.

164
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,750
If your master knew

165
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,750
that you chose the evil path

166
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,830
and that even his daughter
is going to die at your hands,

167
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,150
he would...

168
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,950
What did you say?

169
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,710
How did Jiao die? Tell me.

170
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,590
At that time,

171
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,800
Jiao was pregnant

172
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,750
when she was hit

173
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,750
by the Cold Poison
you threw in the water.

174
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,800
She knew I had the antidote.

175
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,510
You must have stopped her
from coming to me.

176
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,190
She risked her life with Cold Poison

177
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,920
rather than beg you.

178
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,010
Do you know why?

179
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,320
Because she didn't love you at all.

180
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,190
You want to lie to me

181
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,040
even when you're about to die?

182
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,770
That's ridiculous.

183
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,400
Ask yourself.

184
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,730
Who would love a traitor?

185
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,380
You've done so many evil deeds.

186
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,290
The five element families
will never let you go.

187
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,240
I've been waiting for you
for the past few days.

188
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,240
They forced me.

189
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,750
No one forced you.

190
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,830
You and I are the same.

191
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,040
A general's fame
contains thousands of lives.

192
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,680
Throughout history, great men
wouldn't be obsessed with small things.

193
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,270
I'll make the arrangements.

194
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,830
Wait for me.

195
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,440
Okay.

196
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,800
I have a man at Three Firegate Tasks.

197
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,750
He'll help you.

198
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:18,950
Jiao.

199
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,270
I killed Water King myself.

200
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,800
I avenged your death.

201
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,510
Mr. Zhang Si.

202
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,750
I got a secret from Water King

203
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,320
about Three Firegate Tasks.

204
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,950
It may be related
to the whereabouts of Holy Cauldron.

205
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,390
I'd like to tell you about it.

206
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,000
The secret of the Holy Cauldron is...

207
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,000
Mr. Zhang...

208
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,390
Mr. Zhang.

209
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,920
Die!

210
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,080
You want to kill me?

211
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,450
If you do, none of you will leave.

212
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,930
The five element families

213
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,050
will be here soon.

214
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,470
If you want to live,

215
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,450
get lost!

216
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:19,960
Dad.

217
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,890
- Master.
- Dad.

218
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:22,750
Dad.

219
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:23,680
Master.

220
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,400
Mr. Zhou.

221
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,230
Let's go.

222
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,040
Let's go.

223
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,510
Dad.

224
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,470
Dad.

225
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,040
Dad.

226
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,110
Dad, wake up!

227
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,750
Dad.

228
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,750
Dad.

229
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,470
Zedao, are you okay?

230
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,990
Get up.

231
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,840
Dad, wake up!

232
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,040
Dad.

233
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,220
It's my fault.

234
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,610
I shouldn't have run away.

235
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,560
Dad.

236
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,350
It's my fault, dad.

237
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,680
Dad.

238
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,720
Wake up!

239
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,990
It's my fault.

240
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,740
I'm not good enough

241
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,850
and couldn't save Mr. Shui.

242
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,170
Dad.

243
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,590
Dad, wake up!

244
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,960
Mr. Zhang Si...

245
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,350
I tricked him with the secret
of Holy Cauldron

246
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,920
and killed him.

247
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,230
Dad.

248
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,320
Mr. Zhou and Hook Troop escaped.

249
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,920
Dad, wake up!

250
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,990
Dad.

251
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,750
If it weren't for you,

252
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
the master wouldn't be dead.

253
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,440
Get lost!

254
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,000
Get lost!

255
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,900
Dad.

256
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,150
Dad.

257
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:19,860
[Mourning]

258
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,470
Miss.

259
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,960
Get some rest.

260
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,320
Take care of yourself.

261
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,560
I want to spend more time

262
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,200
with my father.

263
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,230
He can't come back from the dead.

264
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,150
I failed him all these years.

265
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,960
I always made him angry.

266
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,230
Your father

267
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,720
had indeed worked hard for you.

268
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,040
Your mother was poisoned

269
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,270
when she was pregnant with you.

270
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,840
In the end,

271
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,510
they chose to make you be born.

272
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,200
After that, he traveled

273
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,960
all over the world and finally

274
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,870
found someone with both fire and water.

275
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,920
After that,

276
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,470
your father took good care of him,

277
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,470
just for you.

278
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,040
Zheng Zedao

279
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,870
is just a medicine for you.

280
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,800
I've wronged him.

281
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,470
Miss.

282
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,800
Don't be too sad.

283
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,390
We have to look ahead.

284
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,390
The Water family

285
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,870
will depend on you

286
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,510
from now on.

287
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,390
So you have to live.

288
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,840
The Water family must be passed on.

289
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,230
This is a letter from your father.

290
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,350
Yao'er.

291
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,990
Last night, I dreamed
of your mother again.

292
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,870
The last two years she was with me

293
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,870
were the happiest.

294
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,510
I suddenly realized

295
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,350
that I was too selfish.

296
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,080
I couldn't bear to see you die in vain.

297
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,620
I didn't care about your feelings.

298
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,600
You've grown up.

299
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,560
As long as you're happy,

300
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,270
your mother and I
will do anything for you.

301
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:45,580
[Mourning]

302
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,080
Yao'er.

303
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,600
I was just about to say goodbye.

304
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,390
Today is the last day
of the Three Firegate Tasks.

305
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,200
I have to go.

306
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,080
Once Three Firegate Tasks is over,

307
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,270
let's get married.

308
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,040
What?

309
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,320
Are you happy now?

310
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,080
Can I ask you

311
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,150
how I'm worse than Huo Xiaoxie?

312
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,040
I have to live

313
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,240
for the Water family.

314
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,390
Miss Water.

315
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,390
Miss Water.

316
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,630
Huo Xiaoxie is here.

317
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,990
He's coming to pay his respects.

318
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,200
Let him go.

319
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,510
I don't want to see him.

320
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:44,840
Okay.

321
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,040
Wan.

322
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,960
Have Fire King and Wood King

323
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,150
not returned yet?

324
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,630
I want you to do me a favor.

325
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,440
What favor?

326
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
If I can help,

327
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,840
I will.

328
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,270
Let Huo Xiaoxie go.

329
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,630
Why?

330
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,990
I've decided to marry Zheng Zedao.

331
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,440
My father is gone.

332
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,390
I have to live well.

333
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,150
The Water family

334
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,870
can't live without a master.

335
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,470
Miss Water said

336
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,510
she wouldn't see anyone for a few days.

337
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,800
Go home.

338
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,270
Why?

339
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,110
Please let me see her.

340
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,150
If you don't leave now,

341
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,560
I'll kill you.

342
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,200
I must see her

343
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,630
even if I die today.

344
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,630
If I don't do it for the sake of her,

345
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,150
I'll kill you today.

346
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:09,960
We don't have much time left.

347
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,350
The Holy Cauldron is the only chance.

348
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,200
Tell Shui Yao'er.

349
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
I'll get the Holy Cauldron.

350
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,320
Looks like Qingyun Inn isn't here.

351
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,320
There must be something wrong.

352
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,150
The map.

353
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,560
Xiaoxie, you've got the map backward.

354
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,040
Come here.

355
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,680
Can you figure out anything
when you hold it like this?

356
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,040
I can.

357
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,560
Wangjiapu is distributed according
to the Eight Trigrams and Yin Yang.

358
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,630
The houses on the yin and yang sides
correspond to each other.

359
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,870
Look at this well.

360
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,230
There's a spring
at the corresponding location.

361
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,040
If the living door is the Dadao Inn,

362
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,230
could the corresponding dead door

363
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,040
be the ancestral land
of the five element families?

364
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,350
The Qingyun Inn?

365
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:52,680
Let's go!

366
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Look at the hexagram of Kun.

367
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,560
Does it look like the top half
of the character "qing"?

368
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,300
That means I was right.

369
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,680
If the symbols weren't tampered with,

370
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,680
we would have found this place long ago.

371
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,230
What about "Yue" in the lower part?

372
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,470
I think it means night.

373
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,870
It can't be an inn at night.

374
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,340
Qian Kun...

375
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,990
Qian is the sky, and Kun is the earth.

376
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,840
Since it's the ancestral land
of the five element families,

377
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,150
it's probably down here.

378
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,840
Follow me.

379
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,440
What about the "Yun"?

380
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,990
This is too creepy.

381
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,560
Why are you so timid?

382
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,050
Let's go.

383
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,230
No, I...

384
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,320
Get in.

385
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,600
Are we almost there?

386
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,150
I don't know.

387
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,150
It's pretty grand.

388
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,870
Are these old men crazy?

389
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,630
I thought I was in an emperor's tomb.

390
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,990
Wasn't it like this before?

391
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,350
Of course not.

392
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,870
It's just an entrance exam.

393
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,560
This is definitely not normal.

394
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,320
Let's go to the front.

395
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,320
Are the others already here?

396
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,270
I don't know.

397
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,870
After all, we've been delayed
for so long.

398
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,630
Looks like anyone can join us.

399
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,230
Yeah.

400
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,100
This guy has caused a lot of harm

401
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,110
to fellow martial masters.

402
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:47,840
That's right.

403
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,840
Why is he here?

404
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,750
Get him out!

405
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,510
That's right.

406
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,150
You came with us.

407
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,440
You can't blame us
for getting caught in the trap.

408
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:55,800
You...

409
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,560
Okay.

410
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,170
Huo Xiaoxie, come with me.

411
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,350
Hello, we meet again.

412
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,390
If you don't want to die so soon,

413
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,350
get lost.

414
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,150
Dying for love

415
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,390
is also a beautiful thing.

416
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:22,800
Get lost.

417
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,560
What's wrong with girls these days?

418
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,470
Why are they all so aggressive?

419
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,990
I couldn't leave the ancestral land
for a few days.

420
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,750
But I didn't expect such a turn
for the worse in the Water family.

421
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,960
How is Shui Yao'er?

422
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,440
She still won't see me.

423
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,080
Forget it.

424
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,110
Don't blame her.

425
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,720
Now that you're here,

426
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,510
you have to give it your all.

427
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,040
Yes.

428
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,110
Miss Lin said

429
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,040
Sacred King Citta-dharma

430
00:31:59,390 --> 00:31:59,840
could cure Shui Yao'er.

431
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,630
So I must get the Holy Cauldron.

432
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,150
Then you're on your own.

433
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,630
Mr. Zhang Si is dead,

434
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,800
but I'm afraid other threats remain.

435
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,470
The Dark Dragon Gang from Japan
won't rest easy.

436
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,390
What are you going to do?

437
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,750
Don't think too much.

438
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,440
Just deal with Three Firegate Tasks.

439
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,150
I'll take care

440
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,560
of the rest.

441
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,320
The first level

442
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,560
tests your understanding
of the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams.

443
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:38,990
The second level

444
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,990
is about luck.

445
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,600
How can the luck be tested?

446
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,270
I've never heard of such a test.

447
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,600
Don't slack off, everyone.

448
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,320
This is the ancestral land.

449
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,960
It's guarded by the Tomb Beast.

450
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,350
The one who can get the scale shards

451
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,680
on the Tomb Beast within the time limit

452
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,560
can pass the second level.

453
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,870
What?

454
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:01,990
Tomb Beast?

455
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:02,990
That's it.

456
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,230
The Tomb Beast is our blessing.

457
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,870
It has been guarding the ancestral land
for hundreds of years.

458
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,200
To become a disciple
of my five element families,

459
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,680
you must first gain its approval.

460
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,920
Inside this ancestral land,

461
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,110
there will be a total
of four scale shards.

462
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,870
The one who can get the scale shards

463
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,870
on the Tomb Beast within the time limit

464
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,080
can make it to the third level.

465
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,200
What's the test for the third level?

466
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,560
I can't tell you.

467
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,470
Because no one has come out

468
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,200
of here alive for a long time.

469
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,150
No one has come out alive?

470
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,470
What does that mean?

471
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,230
Twenty years ago,

472
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,040
the Qing Dynasty was overthrown.

473
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,270
Seeing the end of the Qing Dynasty,

474
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,230
Empress Dowager Cixi went
against the grain

475
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,270
and ordered the Yufeng Detective
to steal this cauldron

476
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,560
to save the Qing Dynasty.

477
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,270
The five element families resisted
to death.

478
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,600
The elders of the Wood family

479
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,680
used Divine Nirvana Citta-dharma
to seal it in the ancestral land.

480
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,350
The elders of the Wood family
devoted their power

481
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,870
to incarnate as Jade Pearl
and passed it down to the world.

482
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,560
A few days ago,

483
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,200
all of us got the Jade Pearl

484
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,290
and opened the ancestral land

485
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,710
after unremitting efforts.

486
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,160
Moreover,

487
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,640
the two kings have entered the cave,

488
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,360
but they haven't come out yet.

489
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,400
So everyone,

490
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,750
please think twice.

491
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,360
It's not too late

492
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,710
to give up.

493
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,270
Holy Cauldron's been in the dark
for a long time.

494
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,080
It's our duty

495
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,560
to bring it back to the light.

496
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,880
Zheng, you're so righteous.

497
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,800
It's been hard for us to get here,

498
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,990
so there's no reason to give up.

499
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,470
I didn't expect such a good thing

500
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,910
to come our way.

501
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,950
Holy Cauldron chooses its master.

502
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,600
Only the right one can get it.

503
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,460
These are beyond

504
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,230
human control.

505
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,800
Anything else you'd like to ask?

506
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,950
Within the time limit,

507
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,880
this place will be completely closed.

508
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,190
No one can come out

509
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,750
until the time is up.

510
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,230
The blades cannot recognize people.

511
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,400
But

512
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,080
if anyone dares to plot

513
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,950
against a fellow,

514
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,400
the five element families

515
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,080
will surely take them down.

516
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,470
Everyone,

517
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,640
please take care of yourselves.

518
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,480
My name is Pang Haowei.

519
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,840
You can call me Fatty.

520
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,320
I'll take care of your food
for the next few days.

521
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,950
After all, we'll be here for two days.

522
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,470
Eat well, drink well.

523
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,670
Also,

524
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,040
I'll be supervising everyone

525
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,560
to avoid killing at will.

526
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,240
Thank you.

527
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,710
My name is Zheng Zedao.

528
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,640
I hope you'll take care of me
in the next couple of days.

529
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,270
I'd like to propose a toast to you
with a glass of water.

530
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,950
There's only one Holy Cauldron.

531
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,670
How do we split it then?

532
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,040
Stop cottoning up.

533
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,560
Otherwise, we can't bear

534
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,710
to fight you guys.

535
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,040
A few days ago,
Mr. Zheng saved many lives

536
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,880
and eliminated Mr. Zhang Si.

537
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:17,950
Come on.

538
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,670
Let me toast to you.

539
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,120
And,

540
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,510
don't waste the food.

541
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,270
We don't have much this time.

542
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,190
If you need anything,

543
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,600
come see me in the temple.

544
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,190
If you're not good at fighting,

545
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,560
go wait at the door.

546
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,510
I may not be able to stop myself

547
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,710
when the fight starts.

548
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,670
What do you mean?

549
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,750
There are only four scale shards.

550
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,560
We'll have to fight in the end anyway.

551
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,510
Why don't we do it now?

552
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:02,320
Come on.

553
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,800
Idiot.

554
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,080
It's no fun fighting alone.

555
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,560
Does anyone here want
to make an alliance?

556
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,990
We can join forces.

557
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,670
We'll split the tokens we get.

558
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,120
Okay.

559
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,950
I'm in.

560
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,640
Me too.

561
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,080
I don't care about anyone else.

562
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,840
If anyone dares to do anything
against Miss Flower,

563
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,360
my smoking stick

564
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,510
may give you a hard time.
