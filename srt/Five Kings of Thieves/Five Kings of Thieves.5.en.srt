[Five Kings of Thieves]

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,020
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,370
Brat!

4
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,480
You actually had Yufeng Detective
at a disadvantage.

5
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,690
Interesting.

6
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,280
I'm someone big in Fengtian anyway.

7
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,010
Yufeng Detective?

8
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,880
I'll turn him into a Yufeng Rat one day.

9
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,280
It's all thanks
to my family's Qilin Elixir.

10
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,690
Otherwise, your Earth Bomb

11
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,800
will only shatter eardrums.

12
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,600
The Rocky Mound is up ahead.

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,280
Once we're there, we'll be safe.

14
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,770
Jingtian, when will you
teach me martial arts?

15
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,160
Ungrateful and greedy.

16
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,490
Waiter, stable my horse for me.

17
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,080
Alright.

18
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,880
Thank you.

19
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,000
Come. Give it to me.

20
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,850
Let's get back on the road after this.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,930
Bring me a bowl of wontons too.

22
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,080
Alright. Give me a moment.

23
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,050
- Sir!
- What...

24
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,490
What's wrong, Sir?

25
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,130
What's wrong?

26
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,570
Sir!

27
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,440
Sir, wake up!

28
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,330
Let me have a look.

29
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,080
Sir, wake up!

30
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,020
Sir!

31
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Wake up, Sir!

32
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,690
Head deep into the forest

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,410
and wait for my signal.
Then, shoot a few rounds.

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,050
Yes.

35
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,490
Sir...

36
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,490
That's a Wood family skill.

37
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,080
You're from the Wood family?

38
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,720
I... I don't understand what you mean.

39
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,570
Take her.

40
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,080
Mr. Zhang Si,

41
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,130
did you leave Fengtian
with so many men in a hurry

42
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,000
to run away from your crime?

43
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,050
Arrest warrants from the Fengtian Police
are everywhere.

44
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,690
You can't escape.

45
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,330
Captain Zheng,

46
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,970
you conspired to steal from us.

47
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,330
We were looking for you.

48
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,080
Please don't slander me.

49
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,720
You colluded with the Japanese
to sell national treasures

50
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,080
and kill innocent folks.

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,050
Right now,

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,330
I'm arresting all of you.

53
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,410
Just you alone?

54
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,880
What can you do to us?

55
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,210
Are you mad?

56
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,640
When I make an arrest,

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,360
I never go unprepared.

58
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,040
Captain Zheng.

59
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,760
I'm crossing the border

60
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
to take back what is mine.

61
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,920
Are you looking for mutual destruction?

62
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,200
Let's go!

63
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,520
Thank you.

64
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,450
It's nothing.

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,480
Miss, hurry away.

66
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,080
But the medicine in my cart...

67
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,520
There's no time.

68
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,800
They won't be fooled for long.

69
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,360
Leave now.

70
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,200
Okay.

71
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,760
I'll lure them away.

72
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:24,690
Thank you.

73
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,320
Why are you helping me?

74
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,320
I have some history
with the five element families.

75
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,760
Hurry.

76
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,890
May we meet again.

77
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,500
He's over there. After him!

78
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,520
Here! Charge!

79
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,100
Hurry!

80
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,850
This set of legwork drills
is called the 13 Clouds of Fire.

81
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,450
Fire Slash is all about stability

82
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,170
while the 13 Clouds of Fire
is about being nimble.

83
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,480
Those who master it

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,730
can walk through infernos unscathed.

85
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,240
Lower.

86
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,320
Continue!

87
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,480
I've forgotten.

88
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,850
13 Clouds of Fire is too sophisticated.

89
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,800
Is your brain made of wood?

90
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,410
Jingtian, don't be angry.

91
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,890
Be patient
and teach him a few more times.

92
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,570
He'll know it then.

93
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,920
I'll show it to you one last time.

94
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,570
I don't care if you remember it.

95
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,130
I will be taking back the Jade Pearl.

96
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,130
Sure.

97
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,320
What is tested
in the Five Elements Rally?

98
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,290
This time, the hosts
are the Fire and Wood families

99
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,170
The Fire family sets the questions.

100
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,610
That's why we call it
the Three Firegate Tasks.

101
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,610
As for what exactly is tested,

102
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,920
I don't know.

103
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,010
Oh, right.

104
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,080
How is your Fire Slash?

105
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:01,850
Show me.

106
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,410
Let me perform for you.

107
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,920
How did you do it?

108
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,410
With just a bit of practice.

109
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,360
Well?

110
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,410
Dark flame possession really is amazing.

111
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,640
What did you say?

112
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:25,920
Nothing.

113
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,200
Don't let your potential go to waste.

114
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,130
Train hard.

115
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,850
As for the Black Stone Fire Token,

116
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,170
just leave it to me.

117
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,480
Really?

118
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,800
Is it because you think I'm amazing

119
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,760
with a great future before me?

120
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,480
You're vain.

121
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,760
- Jingtian.
- Jingtian.

122
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,480
There's an inn up ahead.

123
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,850
It looks like it's going to rain.

124
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,320
Jingtian, let's take a break.

125
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,730
Alright. We'll stay at the inn.

126
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,410
Jingtian,

127
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,170
will we be past the border
once we cross this stretch?

128
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,450
That's right.

129
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,010
After we get past this mountain,

130
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,320
we'll be past the border.

131
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,480
We'll soon be in the territory
of the five element families.

132
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,080
If Mr. Zhang Si dares to come after us,

133
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,170
we'll make sure
he can't make it out alive.

134
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:12,640
Let's go.

135
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,690
Let's go.

136
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,800
Once we pass the border,
I'll have to go home.

137
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,410
Isn't it nice to be home?

138
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:22,850
Let's go.

139
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,520
How is it nice?

140
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,320
I think you'll find it nice

141
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,130
because I won't have
to watch you train every day.

142
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,040
Also...

143
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,730
Also, what?

144
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,970
Whatever. You won't get it.

145
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,290
Coming.

146
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,560
It'll be done soon.

147
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,080
What wine is it?

148
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,760
- Manager!
- Waiter, do you have any good wine?

149
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,000
Manager...

150
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,850
Why the panic?

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,880
Whatever happens, don't panic.

152
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,610
Manager.

153
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,810
Chefs, is the food ready yet?

154
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,730
- Get it served now.
- Manager.

155
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,760
Manager.

156
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,120
What is it?

157
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,810
Opportunity knocks.

158
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,350
Drink!

159
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,290
Another platter of meat!

160
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,290
- Waiter, where's our wine?
- Hurry!

161
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,080
- Over here.
- Hurry!

162
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,490
Come. Drink!

163
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,170
[Guests at the door]
One platter of meat!

164
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,730
This is good. Have some.

165
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,820
Come. Let's keep drinking.

166
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,090
Mr. Zhang Si.

167
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,640
It's a great opportunity.

168
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,320
Clear the inn!

169
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,120
Clear the inn!

170
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,060
Clean it up.

171
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,850
Huo Xiaoxie.

172
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,570
First, we train.

173
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:57,930
We'll rest after the training.

174
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,280
Jingtian,

175
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,160
it looks like rain soon.

176
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,520
We're all martial artists.

177
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,810
What is a little bit of rain?

178
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:07,770
Let's go.

179
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:11,930
Well,

180
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,250
I think the cold toxin isn't over yet.

181
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,330
I need the bathroom.

182
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,480
This brat.

183
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:18,960
Sir!

184
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,570
What is it?

185
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,130
Where's the bathroom?

186
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,370
It's occupied.

187
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,370
Sir,

188
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,570
here for a meal or to stay?

189
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,770
Manager, five rooms please.

190
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,130
Sir, we only have three rooms.

191
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,370
Why don't you head inside first?

192
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,840
Come.

193
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,840
Have a seat.

194
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,600
It's quite deserted here.

195
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,520
There's no one at all.

196
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,690
Business hasn't been good lately.

197
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,770
Please sit.

198
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,210
For this, I'll...

199
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,480
Manager,

200
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,770
why were you cleaning the floor
in the afternoon?

201
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,250
Well, there aren't any customers.

202
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,810
If we keep it clean,

203
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,160
the customers will be happy, right?

204
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,450
Manager,

205
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,130
who do the horses by the door belong to?

206
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,930
They're ours.

207
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,960
This place is remote.

208
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,520
We can't get stock in without horses.

209
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,690
Why do you need so many?

210
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,930
Isn't one horse each enough?

211
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,960
You just don't get it.

212
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,720
Our inn is famous for game meat.

213
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,130
When hunting, one horse each

214
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,720
isn't enough at all.

215
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,450
Enough.

216
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,570
Stop chattering.

217
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,960
Bring us some of your specialties.

218
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,330
Alright.

219
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,520
Get cooking. I'm talking to you!

220
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,010
Get to it! Hurry!

221
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,600
Okay...

222
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,370
Manager, where is the bathroom?

223
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,330
Through here, Sir.

224
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,570
This way, please.

225
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,210
Manager, is it them?

226
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,250
They look like it.

227
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,930
Go on! Get them tea.

228
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,040
Coming!

229
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,450
Jingtian, is there a problem?

230
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,600
Everyone, be careful.

231
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,010
Food is done.

232
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,010
Come. Serve them.

233
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:29,960
Sorry for the wait.

234
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,370
Here. Check out our delicacies.

235
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,400
Please.

236
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,720
Miss, what's the meaning of this?

237
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,960
We're away from home. Please forgive us.

238
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,720
Our food is definitely clean.

239
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,520
I'll get you another bottle of wine.

240
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,930
There's no problem. Eat up.

241
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,370
Oh, this rain.

242
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,370
Mr. Zhang Si
wouldn't catch up to us now.

243
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,370
It's raining hard.

244
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,840
Eat up and rest well.

245
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,210
That was nice.

246
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,040
We can finally enjoy a feast.

247
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,640
Once you're done, we'll train.

248
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,440
Yes.

249
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,250
Is the border entrance beautiful?

250
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,690
I've never been there before.
Take me there.

251
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,810
The Five Elements Rally
is starting soon.

252
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:28,810
How can you play around?

253
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,370
Brat,

254
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,280
are you trying to run?

255
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,330
No way, Jingtian.

256
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,690
I will master it tonight.

257
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,400
Isn't it nice to go home?

258
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,020
It's nicer to be out here.

259
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,100
I can do what I want.

260
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,710
Being home is a joy.

261
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,220
You have parents to take care of you.

262
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,510
Unlike me.

263
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,190
I've lost my parents
since I was a child.

264
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,870
Every day, I roam the streets
with a gang of boys.

265
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,100
Food is never assured.

266
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,070
Thank goodness I met my master.

267
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:01,950
As for you,

268
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,340
you don't know how lucky you are.

269
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,340
Fine. I won't go back then.

270
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,420
I'll supervise your training every day.

271
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,540
You need a firm hand.

272
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,020
The wine is here.

273
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,070
Come.

274
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,390
Have a taste of my wine.

275
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,020
Sirs,

276
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,510
where do you come from?

277
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,020
Fengtian.

278
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,270
Where are you going then?

279
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,460
What is it?

280
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,580
Do your diners need
to introduce themselves?

281
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,510
From where we came from
to where we're going. You're too much.

282
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,950
Look at me.
My loose tongue has angered you.

283
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,220
Come, Miss. Let me pour you a cup.

284
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:43,950
Here.

285
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,750
Alright.

286
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,830
I'm sorry.

287
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,460
It's fine. I can do it myself.

288
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,980
I'm sorry.

289
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,950
I'll get you more food.

290
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,100
I need two more dishes.

291
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,100
Waiter, wine please.

292
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,340
You're quite eager, little flirt.

293
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,870
You charge at me when you see me.

294
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,980
I'll kill you!

295
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,070
Huo Xiaoxie, stop!

296
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,740
Don't stop me!

297
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,540
Stop!

298
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,630
Stop!

299
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,190
Kill me?

300
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,510
Have you killed before?

301
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,940
You'll pay for my master's death!

302
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,950
Stop it!

303
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,750
Your master is in that kind of business.

304
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,900
I only gave him the chance to get rich.

305
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,750
His death is not on me.

306
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:48,900
Enough!

307
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,750
Our common enemy is near.

308
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,460
Mr. Zhang Si's men
will be here anytime soon.

309
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,070
Anyone who fights will be tied up.

310
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,020
Manager.

311
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,020
Coming.

312
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,750
Give her a room.

313
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,630
Alright.

314
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,460
Oh, I can't. We only have three rooms.

315
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,460
Give her mine.

316
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,630
Alright.

317
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,580
Miss, go right up.

318
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,300
Bring me good wine and good food.

319
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,510
I'll get them ready.

320
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,180
This way, please.

321
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,700
Here. This way.

322
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:22,790
Forget it.

323
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,630
Let's keep eating.

324
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,390
I'm not hungry!

325
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,670
Jingtian,

326
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,700
his Fire Slash seems to be improving.

327
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,510
Has it?

328
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,060
I'm telling you,

329
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,700
your Fire Slash has improved a lot.

330
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:40,790
Has it?

331
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,630
You will get your revenge.

332
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,870
I'll help you.

333
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,060
What is it, Huo Xiaoxie?

334
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,700
Tonight, we can only sleep in one room.

335
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,550
Do you want to die?

336
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,220
Ouch!

337
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,060
Gently!

338
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,390
You want to flirt, right?

339
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,180
That's not it.

340
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,870
Hurry.

341
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,460
Ouch!

342
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,940
Running your mouth off again!

343
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,180
I was wrong!

344
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:09,820
Manager.

345
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,750
I'll straighten you out!

346
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,050
Look at you. Why are you so careless?

347
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,330
Yes.

348
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,630
Take our guests to their rooms.

349
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,130
Okay.

350
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,340
This way, please.

351
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,550
Watch your step.

352
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,550
Come. This way.

353
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,550
We have two rooms here.

354
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,630
Pick whichever you like.

355
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,030
This room is huge.

356
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,980
My bed!

357
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,060
This room is mine.

358
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,670
No way. This is mine for the night.

359
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,390
I'm hungry. Go get me some food.

360
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,630
Hurry up.

361
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,340
Sir,

362
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,060
you're

363
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,340
enjoying the view?

364
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,750
I'll go get you some hot water.

365
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,630
No need.

366
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:46,510
Leave us.

367
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,790
How thoughtless.

368
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:51,910
Come here.

369
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:52,750
What?

370
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,870
I have something serious
to tell you. Hear or not?

371
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,460
Where did the blood come from?

372
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,030
From the staircase.

373
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,460
This place is a trap.

374
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,870
Sir.

375
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,670
Sir.

376
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,510
Sir.

377
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,150
The two in my room are drinking.

378
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,580
They're all in their own rooms.

379
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,790
What do we do now?

380
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,700
Qingzi,

381
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,910
release their horses from the stables.

382
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,390
Okay.

383
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,430
Pour the wine.

384
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,790
Ms. Whipper.

385
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,030
It's getting late.

386
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,700
You should rest soon.

387
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,510
Calling me that is so formal.

388
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,670
Call me Black.

389
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,180
Have you gotten the Jade Pearl?

390
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,390
Not yet.

391
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,340
It's with Shui Yao'er,

392
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,100
but she has promised to give it to us.

393
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,630
I want the Jade Pearl
so I can see the Fire King.

394
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,340
Oh, right. Ms. Whipper,

395
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,870
where do you plan to go next?

396
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,340
The Fire King is hiding from me.

397
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,270
He won't hide from you.

398
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,060
From now on,

399
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,150
I'll be following you.

400
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,100
Ms. Whipper,

401
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,910
the Fire King
has always kept you in his heart.

402
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,670
However, he had no choice
but to leave you

403
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,150
for his training.

404
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,220
You should understand his plight.

405
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,550
Either way, training
is more important than me.

406
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:52,980
Let me ask you.

407
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,750
Am I not pretty?

408
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,790
You are pretty.

409
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,460
If it were you,

410
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,700
would you choose training

411
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,390
or me?

412
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,060
Enough. Stop eating.

413
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,670
Ms. Whipper is already drunk.

414
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,150
Let us go.

415
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,060
Shui Yao'er.

416
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,390
Let's go.

417
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,060
They're chasing off our horses.

418
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,870
Let's check it out.

419
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,700
Let me go!

420
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,980
Be honest.

421
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,150
Who are you?

422
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,300
What are you looking at?
I'm talking to you!

423
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,630
Go summon Jingtian.

424
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:03,550
Okay.

425
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,220
Enough.

426
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,980
Let's go.

427
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,750
Manager.

428
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,030
Manager.

429
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,630
Have you seen the two individuals

430
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,550
we came here with?

431
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,790
I have not.

432
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,300
Chunzi.

433
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,980
Have you seen them?

434
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,180
No.

435
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,790
Why don't you help them search?

436
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,150
Capture them!

437
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,630
Don't move!

438
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,580
What's going on?

439
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,580
This is a misunderstanding, Sirs.

440
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:38,980
Misunderstanding?

441
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,670
What's with the blood then?

442
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,910
We caught some prey yesterday.

443
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,430
The inn is too small,
so we dragged it in to butcher it.

444
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,580
Look at you!
You didn't clean off all the blood.

445
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:52,910
Yes.

446
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,460
You caused a misunderstanding.

447
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,030
You bunch of scoundrels!

448
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,430
Dear guests,

449
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,430
I didn't do anything to you.

450
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,060
We're in the middle of nowhere,

451
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,510
so we wanted to sell some food and wine.

452
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,240
You...

453
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,270
Tie them all up!

454
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:34,820
There's another in the stables.

455
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,030
When we arrived,

456
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,150
they looked quite proper.

457
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,030
I didn't expect them
to be black-hearted.

458
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,090
They're revolting.

459
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,280
I'm telling you,

460
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,150
people like that
should be chopped to pieces.

461
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,460
Alright. Calm down.

462
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,700
We'll bring them
to the authorities tomorrow, okay?

463
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,050
The authorities?

464
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,580
That will be too easy on them.

465
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,430
Don't be angry.

466
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,750
We've checked everything.

467
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,820
The food and drinks are uncontaminated.

468
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,940
There's no one else in the inn.

469
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,220
Alright then.

470
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,940
Tonight, you two will watch over them.

471
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,630
- Yes.
- Yes.

472
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,030
Where's Black Whipper?

473
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,030
She fell asleep after some drinks.

474
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,300
Don't start any trouble.

475
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,940
I'm not feeling good all over.
I'm going to bathe.

476
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,390
Then, I'll sleep.

477
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,510
Black Whipper, you'll pay
for my master's death!

478
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,730
Brat.

479
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,940
I didn't expect Mr. Zhang Si
to be Yufeng Detective,

480
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,150
nor did I expect him to be so bold

481
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,220
as to kill as he pleases.

482
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,630
No matter what,

483
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,390
my master and my martial brothers

484
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,340
were dead because of you!

485
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,140
Okay.

486
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,180
Everyone, move aside.

487
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,580
Let's settle this today.

488
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,550
Okay.

489
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,630
Huo Xiaoxie.

490
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,340
While she was the cause,

491
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,980
it was not her intent.

492
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,790
You and Yao'er are learning from me

493
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,220
to enter the Five Elements Rally.

494
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:48,940
Okay.

495
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
I can go on teaching you.

496
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,180
However, can you listen to me?

497
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,580
Let it go for now.

498
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,150
After all, the one
who killed your master and friends

499
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,980
is Mr. Zhang Si.

500
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:04,940
It's a blood feud.

501
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,870
How can I just let it go?

502
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,180
Yan Jingtian,

503
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,220
move aside.

504
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,430
Ms. Whipper!

505
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,220
Anyone who keeps fighting today

506
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,340
will be at odds with me!

507
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,550
Yao'er, take him away.

508
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,060
Ms. Whipper, you should rest.

509
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,910
No one will disturb you again.

510
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,750
Don't cause trouble
with Huo Xiaoxie again.

511
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:48,630
Forget it.

512
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,510
I did have something to do
with his master's death.

513
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,300
Get some rest.

514
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,670
I'll be leaving.

515
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,430
Don't be upset.

516
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,940
You will have a chance at revenge.

517
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,670
Wan?

518
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,220
Wan, why are you here?

519
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,460
Wan?

520
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,060
Were you the one who saved me?

521
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,510
Why are you here?

522
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,510
You've seen me before?

523
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,820
I have.

524
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,220
I even treated you before.

525
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,700
Why are you in this state?

526
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,510
It's all because of you.

527
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,820
I bumped into your enemy.

528
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,340
What a shame about my cart of medicine.

529
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,550
Did you bump into them?

530
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,100
Didn't you lead them here, right?

531
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,430
How would I know?

532
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Wan, don't be mad.

533
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,430
Come to my room.

534
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,270
I'll get you a change of clothes
and fetch you some fresh water.

535
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,270
Fetching water is hard work.
Leave it to me.

536
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,100
Thank you.

537
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,510
What are you looking at?

538
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,060
Master once said

539
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,390
I should look for women
like her for a wife.

540
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:42,870
Gentle

541
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,060
and beautiful.

542
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,700
What do you want?

543
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,180
Did you misunderstand something?

544
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,220
You're annoying.

545
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,550
By the way, which is your room?

546
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,750
Shui Yao'er.

547
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:19,870
What's going on?

548
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,870
I don't have time
to explain the old feud

549
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,220
between the Fire
and Wood families.

550
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,100
Do you want a fight?

551
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,430
Wan,

552
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,750
I'll walk you to the room.

553
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,030
I'll get the water.

554
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,810
Stop there.

555
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,580
Just how long are you
going to keep hiding?

556
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,430
Jingtian, I'm not hiding.

557
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,390
You've improved so much
in the Fire family skills

558
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,790
in just a few days.

559
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,390
The two of you have worked hard
to cheat me.

560
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,390
We have not.

561
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:55,870
Give me the pearl.

562
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:56,940
It's with Shui Yao'er.

563
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,150
However, they're going
to take a bath and change.

564
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,980
Might not be a good time.

565
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,150
Fine. I'm warning you,

566
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,750
the pearl is no small matter.

567
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,300
It's more important than you think.

568
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,060
You must give it to me tomorrow.

569
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,220
I'll get the water.

570
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,270
I'll get you some food.

571
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,300
Wan has been on the run.

572
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,150
She hasn't eaten the entire day.

573
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,790
Get her some food already.

574
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,630
Wan this and Wan that.

575
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,030
You sound so close to her.

576
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,460
What's her relation to you?

577
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,100
Well, she did save my life.

578
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,030
Why are you so narrow-minded?

579
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,940
Go on. Get her food.

580
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,150
Wan, I'm coming in.

581
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,550
Come in.

582
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,940
I'll put it here.

583
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,300
Actually,

584
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,940
I'm here to thank you for saving me.

585
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,390
I was helping Shui Yao'er,

586
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,550
and

587
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,940
I didn't help you for free.

588
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,550
Get some rest then.

589
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,550
Wait.

590
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,340
Do you know that girl likes you?

591
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,030
What do you think of it?

592
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,510
I have a huge grudge to settle.

593
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,750
I don't even know if I'll live or die.

594
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,060
Moreover,

595
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,870
she is the daughter of the Water King

596
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,550
while I am nobody.

597
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,220
You're not wrong.

598
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,270
You are unworthy of her.

599
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,910
From my point of view,

600
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,220
I naturally want you to stay away.

601
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,100
If you think that as well though,

602
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,340
then you really don't deserve her.

603
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:57,750
Rest up soon.

604
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,340
What do you want?

605
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,340
Move aside.

606
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,750
I'll be sleeping here tonight.

607
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,430
Isn't it better for you two ladies
to sleep together?

608
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,550
Who would want to sleep with her?

609
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,430
This place is good. It's so roomy.

610
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,430
Where do I sleep then?

611
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,220
The hall, the corridor,

612
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:28,970
the stables,

613
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,750
or wherever you want.

614
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,250
I...

615
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,460
It looks like pig food.

616
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,060
Pig food?

617
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,100
Times were hard back then.

618
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,870
When I'm hungry,
I'll even steal dog food.

619
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,430
Back then, I thought

620
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,700
it would be nice
to eat something this delicious.

621
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:46,820
You still complain.

622
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,100
As long as you made it,

623
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,270
I'll eat anything, even pig food.

624
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,700
Eat up.

625
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,180
Finish and get some rest soon.

626
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,190
Huo Xiaoxie.

627
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,230

Let's go now.

It's so early.

Once Jingtian wakes up,

654
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,580
he'll know about the Jade Pearl.

655
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,990
I'll wake Wan up.

656
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:14,870
Get up now.

657
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,740
Wan, again.

658
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,540
Be quiet.

659
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:28,740
Hurry.

660
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,780
He's dead.

661
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:49,910
Mr. Qian.

662
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,990
Did you kill him?

663
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,670
Are you mad?

664
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,780
- Jingtian.
- Jingtian.

665
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,020
- Jingtian.
- Jingtian.

666
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,500
What is it?

667
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,430
Jingtian,

668
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,540
bad news.

669
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,710
Those two are gone.

670
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,390
Did you search outside?

671
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:13,870
We did.

672
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,260
Everywhere else too.

673
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,500
No one came here.

674
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:21,870
Who did it?

675
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,390
I think it was the subordinates.

676
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,300
They ran off after killing him.

677
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,150
Did you lose the Jade Pearl?

678
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,910
You killed him to frame them,

679
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,820
so there will be no proof!

680
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:31,910
I haven't killed anyone.

681
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,520
If I were to, I would kill her.

682
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,150
He has been with me the entire time.

683
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,150
He has no time to kill.

684
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,020
You.

685
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,820
Where were you last night?

686
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,580
I was in my room.

687
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,100
Who saw you?

688
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,820
- I did.
- I did...

689
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:53,780
Yao'er.

690
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Where are you going?

691
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,670
Hand over the Jade Pearl.

692
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,020
She won't do it.

693
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,060
Besides, it's not with her.

694
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,580
It's with you then.

695
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,670
Fight if you want.

696
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,230
There's no need to talk.

697
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,230
You're trying to muddy the waters
to pocket the Jade Pearl.

698
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,780
Hand it over.

699
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,190
Everyone, look out!

700
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,340
Huo Xiaoxie.

701
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,060
My aim is good, right?

702
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,190
My aim is better.

703
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,390
I was the one who aimed well.

704
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,500
I caught five.

705
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,230
There were only five inside.

706
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,260
Nonsense. I caught four at least.

707
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,580
Then, they're my catch too.

708
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:21,820
Shoot.

709
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,230
Mr. Qian is still in there.

710
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:23,990
What do we do?

711
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:24,930
