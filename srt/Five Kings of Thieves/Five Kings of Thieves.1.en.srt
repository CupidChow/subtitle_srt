[Five Kings of Thieves]

2
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,020
[Episode 1]

3
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,740
The Holy Cauldron of Five Elements

4
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,740
was handed down from the First Emperor.

5
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,270
Legend has it that

6
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,950
mysterious power has been sealed within.

7
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,780
Whoever gains it

8
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,630
will be the ruler of the martial world,

9
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,990
[Wood, Fire]
and reunite the country.

10
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,100
This cauldron has been guarded
by the five element families.

11
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,910
In the late Qing dynasty,

12
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,500
the country was in utter disorder.

13
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,030
The Yufeng Detectives
who coveted the cauldron

14
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,270
took action to grab it.

15
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,710
After a fierce battle,

16
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,460
the five element families
lost all their elites.

17
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,030
The cauldron was nowhere to be found.

18
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,460
It's said that

19
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,870
it had been delivered back
to its hometown by the Wood family.

20
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,910
They sealed the unlocking info in the

21
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,940
Jade Pearl with unique methods.

22
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,820
Twenty years later, in Fengtian,

23
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,230
the Jade Pearl reappeared.

24
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,740
All forces jumped into action.

25
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,430
As for me, Huo Xiaoxie,

26
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,430
I accidentally got involved,

27
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,940
and started

28
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,810
an incredible journey.

29
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,540
[Down with the traitors!]
an incredible journey.

30
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,270
Return the national treasures!
Down with the traitors!

31
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,180
Return the national treasures!
Down with the traitors!

32
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,630
I'll hide the stuff by then.

33
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,020
Watch the car.

34
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,540
Yeah, I was speaking of you.

35
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,940
Watch out.

36
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,820
I'm watching.

37
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,180
Come, let's take a look.

38
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,630
Stop staring.

39
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,580
Xiaoxie, we're really broke.

40
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,460
We spent all our money on buns.

41
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,710
You know what day is it tomorrow?

42
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,020
Xiaoxie,

43
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,100
who cares about tomorrow

44
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,870
when we can't even survive today?

45
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,740
Yeah.

46
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,300
Tomorrow is Godfather's 60th birthday.

47
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,740
You guys

48
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,380
must have forgotten, have you?

49
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,870
Godfather raised us since we were young.

50
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,540
He gave us food and clothes.

51
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,710
He also taught us how to read.

52
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,540
You little ingrates...

53
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,510
Xiaoxie,

54
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,870
you're right.

55
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,460
Godfather loves snacks.

56
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,460
Why don't we get some for him?

57
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,180
Good idea.

58
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,870
Xiaoxie, those look great.

59
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,540
The green ones! And the red ones!

60
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,910
They all look great!

61
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,510
No.

62
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,150
I can't give him these cheap ones.

63
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,020
Come on, let's go get something rare.

64
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,910
A little bit to the left.

65
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,820
Okay.

66
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,990
Focus, guys. Faster.

67
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,580
Hang the lanterns faster.

68
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,510
Yes, Sir.

69
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,020
Are you alright?

70
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,710
You two

71
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,790
are so clumsy-handed!

72
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,230
There will be
a lot of guests in a few days.

73
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,910
Stay alert, and work fast!

74
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,110
Got it, Butler Liu.

75
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,950
Master,

76
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,390
Police Department Security Brigade Captain,
Zheng Zedao, wants to meet you.

77
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,420
One moment.

78
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,260
Mr. Zhang, Captain Zheng's here.

79
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,180
Captain Zheng,
welcome to my humble home.

80
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,670
Sorry for the wait.

81
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,020
The Director put me
in charge of the security

82
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,070
of your auction here at Treasure Tower.

83
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,420
I am at your service.

84
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,860
Thanks

85
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,230
for the trouble, Captain Zheng.

86
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,260
I'd like to
check your security measures.

87
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,910
Do you play chess?

88
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,230
Only a little.

89
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,230
Finish this game with me.

90
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,140
Buns!

91
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,860
Take a look at these hot buns!

92
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,260
Buns!

93
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,700
Take a look at these hot buns!

94
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,230
- Sorry, coming through.
- Buns!

95
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,790
Still hot!

96
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,830
Buns!

97
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,140
Sir, be kind.

98
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,140
- Get away.
- Give us a job!

99
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,510
Sir, we haven't eaten for days.

100
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,260
Stop getting in our way.

101
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,510
Sir, have mercy!

102
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,460
Go beg somewhere else!

103
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:58,910
Enough.

104
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,390
- Sir, come on.
- Let's go.

105
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,550
Go.

106
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,670
Get in.

107
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,180
The water's here. Come get water now.

108
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,390
- Okay.
- Coming.

109
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,630
Come on, carry it.

110
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,460
Coming.

111
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,350
We need more hands.

112
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,350
Okay. Go. Now.

113
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:20,980
Coming.

114
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,460
Mr. Zhang.

115
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,550
Pl...
Please take a look at my treasures.

116
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,180
How dare you auction

117
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,230
this kind of goods at my place?

118
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,390
You must be desperately poor!

119
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,180
Huh?

120
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,110
Mr. Zhang,

121
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,700
say... say whatever you want,

122
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,110
but don't break it, please.

123
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,700
I'll take it back.

124
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,510
Take it back?

125
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,670
You think you can just

126
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,740
take your rubbish
in and get out of my place

127
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,830
like it's your living room?

128
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,550
Uh...

129
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,180
Please don't, Mr. Zhang!

130
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,740
My precious!

131
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,550
Get him out!

132
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,070
- Yes!
- Yes!

133
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:37,920
Let's go.

134
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,790
- Let's go!
- Mr. Zhang!

135
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,390
Please don't, M... Mr. Zhang!

136
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,510
You can't place one stone
on two placements.

137
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,670
My turn.

138
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,580
The security
of the Zhang Residence is impenetrable.

139
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,700
Rest assured, Captain Zheng.

140
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,910
There's always a breach.

141
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,260
Just in case,

142
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,910
please let me check.

143
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,060
Mr. Zhou.

144
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,190
Mr. Zhang.

145
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,620
Have someone show Captain Zheng around.

146
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,260
Yes.

147
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,430
Someone!

148
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:51,790
Yes, Sir.

149
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,430
Show Captain Zheng around.

150
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,670
Please.

151
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:11,700
Mr. Zhang,

152
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,940
recently, more and more students
have been protesting

153
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,020
on the streets.

154
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,750
I've asked
the police department to handle them.

155
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,020
A few poor students

156
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,700
can't make much trouble.

157
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,260
There's another thing.

158
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,310
Hearing that we're revealing
the Goddess Jade,

159
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,990
the Japanese are quite pissed.

160
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,020
By the Commander in chief's order,
adjutant Shao asked about it many times.

161
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,060
Mr. Zhang, what shall we...

162
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,310
The Goddess Jade is the key

163
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,190
to finding the Holy Cauldron.

164
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,580
The only ones who can solve this mystery

165
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,500
are those
from the five element families.

166
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,550
Mr. Zhang,

167
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,940
you're trying to lure them out, right?

168
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,550
Why are you standing there?

169
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,310
Go upstairs and get to work!

170
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,670
I'll take some of your tribute food.

171
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,940
It's for my master.

172
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,670
It's his birthday.

173
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,940
You'll understand.

174
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,620
You're the kindest.

175
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,190
You won't blame me.

176
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,580
Too sweet.

177
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:30,870
Enough.

178
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,460
Thanks!

179
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,430
That's enough.

180
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,260
Go clean the Buddha hall.

181
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,260
Yes, Sir.

182
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,310
I'm the respected daughter
of the Water family.

183
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,350
I've been here for a month.

184
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,310
But where is that thing?

185
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,700
"You'll meet your destined hero

186
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,060
in this place."

187
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,110
It's all a lie!

188
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,870
You gluttonous monkey!

189
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,310
How dare you steal food in here!

190

00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,750
This is the layout of the house.

380
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,020
Yesterday, you said I was a thief

381
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,750
who's neither heroic nor decent.

382
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,630
But I only steal from

383
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,590
those cruel and greedy bastards.

384
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,750
Look how handsome you are
in this uniform.

385
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,900
Just like a watchdog.

386
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,230
Besides helping Mr. Zhang Si
bully people,

387
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,990
you also want to
teach me a lesson, don't you?

388
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,750
Go ahead.

389
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,460
Take me in, will ya?

390
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,260
Just stop pretending, alright?

391
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,300
You make me sick.

392
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,260
More brave than wise,
that's what you are.

393
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,420
Yeah, I am.

394
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,260
But I could understand
what the students were saying.

395
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,350
Mr. Zhang Si betrayed our country!

396
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,180
He sold our treasures to the foreigners!

397
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,510
But you...

398
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,540
You're like his toyboy.

399
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,950
You're like a
treacherous minister in the opera.

400
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,590
You know the opera?

401
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,420
I know loyalty and righteousness.
And I know there's honor among thieves.

402
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,900
Alright.

403
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,020
There's a treasure called Goddess Jade
in Mr. Zhang Si's house.

404
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,300
He appears to be hosting an auction,

405
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,140
but in fact, he already
had a deal with the Japs.

406
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,990
I don't wish to see
the national treasure homeless.

407
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,110
But I can't do what I want

408
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,420
in this uniform.

409
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,230
So I think there might be
someone who can help me.

410
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,380
Me?

411
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,710
Because you're smart.

412
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,230
And the most important thing is

413
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,230
you can tell right from wrong.
You have honor.

414
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,590
So?

415
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:22,990
Are you willing to help me?

416
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,540
You did help me.

417
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,020
And I

418
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,260
don't like to owe anyone.

419
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,590
But I don't like
to be played by others, either.

420
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,470
This is a life-and-death matter.

421
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,630
Please think this through.

422
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,990
The residence is complicated
and has many traps.

423
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,830
On this map,

424
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,300
I've marked all the dangerous spots.

425
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,260
If you're coming tomorrow,

426
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,780
leave a mark
on the side door of the residence.

427
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,710
If...

428
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,140
I mean, if I went there,

429
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,950
could you do me a favor?

430
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,420
Give me one!

431
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:14,950
I want one!

432
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,230
Let's give out more flyers
to more places,

433
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,180
- so more patriots will come to help us!
- Give me one.

434
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:20,660
Come.

435
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,020
- I want one, too!
- Give me one.

436
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,470
Don't move.

437
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,110
- All of you, don't move!
- Don't move!

438
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,990
Down with the traitors!

439
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,420
Return the national treasures!

440
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,750
Down with the traitors!

441
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,900
Quiet! Everyone quiet! Listen to me!

442
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,300
This is Officer Zheng.

443
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,540
He got us out of prison.

444
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,870
He's a good guy.

445
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,260
I understand.

446
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,900
You love our country.

447
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,540
But doing things like this

448
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,110
is no different from committing suicide.

449
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,900
Saving this country

450
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,020
requires solid power.

451
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,780
You have many other ways
to protect treasures.

452
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,950
Please trust me.

453
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,470
Follow me.

454
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,180
Do you believe me?

455
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,140
Of course.

456
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,540
If you want to do this,

457
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,380
do it my way.

458
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,140
Xiaoxie,

459
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,900
what delicacy is in that box of yours?

460
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,140
I'm not gonna tell you.

461
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,020
Slow down!

462
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,780
How can she ride like that?

463
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,300
Better watch it!

464
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,140
Be careful!

465
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,230
- Who's that woman?
- Let's go.

466
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,420
Black Whipper, my good madam!

467
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,260
You want me to go into
the Zhang Residence?

468
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,660
You know what?

469
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,630
Why don't you just kill me right now?

470
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,540
Liu Sanzhi of Fengtian.

471
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,630
You're sort of a figure around here.

472
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,060
I didn't expect you to be so gutless.

473
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,540
Are you going or not?

474
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,950
I've already retired.

475
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,900
If it concerns the martial world,

476
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,540
please,

477
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,300
go look for someone else.

478
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,180
Once a thief,

479
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
always a rat.

480
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,900
The martial world
is the tail you'll never lose.

481
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,900
This tail of mine has long been cut off.

482
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,350
Not only can I not go,

483
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,830
but you'd also better not go.

484
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,510
Look how pretty you are.

485
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,590
If you end up like me...

486
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,020
What a shame it would be!

487
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,420
Still talking!

488
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,470
Let's make Godfather happy today!

489
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,630
Yeah.

490
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,540
Master, we're here for your birthday!

491
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,750
Open up!

492
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,350
What birthday?

493
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,630
I'm busy now!

494
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,950
We didn't come empty-handed.

495
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,110
We brought food! Did you smell it?

496
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,540
This is the good stuff
you've been dreaming of!

497
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,230
Smell nice?

498
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,180
Decent amount of oil. Good pastry!

499
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,380
As expected from Godfather!

500
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,660
You really grew up on the streets!

501
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,780
Master, open the door now.

502
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,980
Xiaoxie tried so hard to get it from...

503
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,500
Don't say that.

504
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,860
You little brat. What do you mean?

505
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,060
You think
I'm too old to be worth a penny?

506
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,870
Trying to trick me with

507
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,110
just a few pastries, huh?

508
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,470
Get lost now!

509
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,990
Okay, Master.

510
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,540
We'll leave it at the door.

511
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,660
We'll come back another day.

512
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,020
Get lost as far as you can!

513
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,060
What's wrong with him?

514
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,700
Isn't this the...

515
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,870
Okay.

516
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,380
Lang Deben!

517
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,870
Are you okay?

518
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,900
Stop fighting!

519
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,750
None of you is her match!

520
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,100
[Treasure Tower]

521
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,110
Hand it to me.

522
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,990
Master, what's going on?

523
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,870
What's going on?

524
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,230
Don't you have eyes?

525
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,710
This one is

526
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,380
the Black Whipper! Madam Whipper!

527
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,990
I've got quite a reputation
and she's a fan.

528
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,110
She came to ask for my help
with a treasure hunt.

529
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,870
That's why I say

530
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,950
leave if it doesn't concern you.

531
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,630
There's no supper for you tonight.

532
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,750
They're here to celebrate your birthday.

533
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,260
How can you chase them away?

534
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,350
Little brother,

535
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,110
you've been to Mr. Zhang Si's home?

536
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,750
Of course.

537
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,590
Nonsense!

538
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,900
Can you just
walk into Mr. Zhang Si's home?

539
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,020
Can you do that
like it's your own house?

540
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,380
You know what they say?

541
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,420
Rather tear Fengtian house down
than touch Mr. Zhang Si's Door!

542
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,380
Let me tell you something.

543
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,870
At Mr. Zhang Si's home,

544
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,540
he's got a leopard dog.

545
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,830
It eats people whole!

546
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,660
Whoever gets in there dies!

547
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,700
You talk too much.

548
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,910
Speak.

549
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,180
Which Buddha is enshrined
in Mr. Zhang Si's Buddha hall?

550
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,550
What incense is burnt there?

551
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,180
Tathagata.

552
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,460
Three feet tall incense.

553
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,220
Seen this?

554
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,060
Yeah.

555
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,990
He's got this pattern
in his Buddha hall.

556
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,060
Covering a half-man-tall stuff.

557
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,180
Huo Xiaoxie, you really went in there?

558
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,420
Huo Xiaoxie?

559
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,220
Yes.

560
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,580
Huo means hot fire.

561
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:29,990
Xie means odd.

562
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,630
Hot fire? Interesting.

563
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,420
I won't let you work for nothing.

564
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,420
Take it.

565
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,030
Never.

566
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,870
Shut up!

567
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,790
No. I didn't mean that.

568
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,060
I meant
you can't take his words for real.

569
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,220
He likes bragging.

570
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,620
Even if you go,

571
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,750
it should be me to go with you.

572
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,750
Think about it.

573
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,390
Mr. Zhang Si's got countless traps

574
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,270
to protect all his treasures.

575
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,750
If you go with him,

576
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,510
what if things go wrong?

577
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,990
You might even lose your life.

578
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,790
Indeed I'm a bit old.

579
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,910
But you know what they say.

580
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,180
The older, the wiser.

581
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,750
I'm like an old horse.

582
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:14,750
The old horse knows the roads better.

583
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,790
The old... Old...

584
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,310
You old geezer. I'm gonna...

585
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,590
Let go of my master!

586
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,270
Let's fight her!

587
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,620
Stop!

588
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,420
Everyone stop!

589
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:26,900
Everyone stop!

590
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,310
I'll help you.

591
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,900
But you must let my master go first.

592
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,030
Liu Sanzhi,

593
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,260
you've got a good apprentice!

594
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,590
You flatter me.

595
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,510
I'll take care of the old guy
for a couple of days.

596
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,590
When you finish your job with me tomorrow
at Zhang Residence,

597
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,620
I'll give him back to you.

598
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:44,860
- I...
- Go.

599
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,030
Move it.

600
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,420
Out of the way.

601
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,750
Xiaoxie, are we really going tomorrow?

602
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,030
What about our master then?

603
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,350
That Black Whipper
doesn't look like a good egg.

604
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,040
But...

605
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,410
But Mr. Zhang Si is way meaner.

606
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,230
You...

607
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,550
He raised us for nothing!

608
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,020
Don't go if you're scared!

609
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,300
Who says I'm not going?

610
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,850
Enough. Stop it.

611
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,610
We'll play it by ear tomorrow.

612
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,020
We have to save our master.
