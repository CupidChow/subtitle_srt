00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,020
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,860
Hurry!

4
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,500
Come on!

5
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,110
Move it!

6
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,460
- Faster!
- Move faster!

7
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,220
- Come on.
- Follow up.

8
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,820
Stop slacking! Get up!

9
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,860
What's going on?

10
00:01:59,390 --> 00:01:59,860
Baka!

11
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,070
Get up!

12
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,020
A bunch of poor bastards!

13
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,500
If anything happens
to what's inside the box,

14
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,990
all your family's lives
won't be enough to pay!

15
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,340
Where does this beggar
come from? Get lost!

16
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,300
The Fire family.

17
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,910
- Run for your lives!
- Help!

18
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,500
Run!

19
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:48,990
Run!

20
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,680
This way!

21
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,470
Thanks for your help, Water King.

22
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,830
These people
are all Zhang Si's henchmen.

23
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,140
They collude with the Japs,

24
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,270
trying to be their inside men.

25
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,470
But now something of utmost importance

26
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,950
to the five element families

27
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,550
has appeared.

28
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,060
May I ask, Water King,

29
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,190
what is that thing?

30
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,830
The Goddess Jade.

31
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,620
You mean the key
to the Three Firegate Tasks?

32
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,030
Now,

33
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,190
this treasure

34
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,550
is in the Treasure Tower

35
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,830
in Fengtian.

36
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,110
Thanks for telling us.

37
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,620
We'll take our leave.

38
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,310
[Zhang Residence]

39
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,750
Mr. Wang, long time no see.

40
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,860
Long time no see.

41
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,190
You've got the news too?

42
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,220
Yeah.

43
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,780
How can we be excluded?

44
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,580
Of course.

45
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,060
[Zhang Residence]

46
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,670
Sorry.

47
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,110
Are you okay?

48
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,150
Little brother, be careful.

49
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,780
How is it?

50
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,500
Their security is tighter than it seems.

51
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,180
And they only use their own men.

52
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,740
Mr. Zhang Si, you cunning fox.

53
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,390
Where's my master now?

54
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,300
Don't worry. He'll live.

55
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,870
When you finish helping me,

56
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,950
I'll certainly return him to you.

57
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,550
You clear about what I said yesterday?

58
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,220
Yes.

59
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,990
You three, wait for my signal
for the dynamite.

60
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,830
Okay.

61
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,780
If anything happens to me,

62
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,500
go find Zheng Zedao.

63
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,300
He'll take care of you guys.

64
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,140
Rest assured, Xiaoxie.

65
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,670
The Master's still waiting for us.

66
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,150
I'm leaving.

67
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,500
Good brother.

68
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:10,900
Let's go.

69
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,300
Mr. Zhang,

70
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,990
you've been down here
quite often lately.

71
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,390
I just wanna see these treasures more.

72
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,150
How's everything arranged?

73
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,900
I saw a lot of people coming.

74
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,150
Luring out the five element families

75
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,430
to catch them all,

76
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,460
plus finding the Holy Cauldron.

77
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,300
This is what we say
killing two birds with one stone.

78
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,740
What about the Japanese?

79
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,220
I just got the news.
Oda is arriving soon.

80
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,340
Should we brief them

81
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,870
on our plan this time?

82
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,710
Not so fast.

83
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:03,950
Yes.

84
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:05,950
[Zhang Residence]

85
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,710
- Mr. Zhang.
- Mr. Zhang Si.

86
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,710
Welcome.

87
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,180
Mr. Zhang.

88
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,270
Please come in.

89
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,990
- Mr. Zhang Si.
- Mr. Zhang.

90
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,670
Please come in.

91
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,670
Mr. Zhang Si.

92
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,870
What a surprise.
The Fire family is also here.

93
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,270
The Goddess Jade is in your house.

94
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,110
We have to show up to add to the fun.

95
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,780
I'm just a regular businessman.

96
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,150
The five element families claim
to be decent sects in the martial world.

97
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,740
You're not going
to make trouble here, are you?

98
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,270
Mr. Zhang Si, you are joking.

99
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,500
As long as you sell goods legally,

100
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,060
we will buy goods legally, too.

101
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,550
Please.

102
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,150
Mr. Zhang Si.

103
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,740
Mr. Zhang Si.

104
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,430
Allow me to introduce

105
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,870
Mr. Oda, president of the
Japanese Chamber of Commerce.

106
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,270
Mr. Zhang Si, I've heard about you.

107
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,900
Mr. Oda, pleasure to meet you.

108
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,780
Mr. Oda,

109
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,060
this event is but for show.

110
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,150
Mr. Oda, please.

111
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:42,740
Okay.

112
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,230
Please.

113
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,590
Mr. Zhou, my men are yours to command.

114
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,980
Thank you, adjutant Shao.
Please come in.

115
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,270
Mr. Zhou, what does this mean?

116
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,620
Captain Zheng,

117
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,620
you just need to
take care of the perimeter.

118
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,150
We've got our own arrangement inside.

119
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,060
My job is to keep the auction safe.

120
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,500
If anything goes wrong,

121
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,350
I don't know
how to explain it to our director.

122
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,540
Captain Zheng, don't worry.

123
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,180
I've talked to your director about it.

124
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,470
Come, please come in.

125
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,790
Thank you.

126
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,620
Young Master, what now?

127
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,860
Scatter the squad.

128
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,980
Patrol the perimeter.

129
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,660
Let's just pray that
god helps Huo Xiaoxie.

130
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,100
Yes.

131
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:45,980
Move.

132
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,390
Coming again?
You're really not afraid to die.

133
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,660
Damn, girl. It's you again!

134
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,180
Black powder?

135
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,830
Looks like you wanna
set a big fire in here.

136
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,350
Gimme that.

137
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,790
Let go!

138
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,710
Give it back.

139
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,540
I'm gonna scream.

140
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,230
Again?

141
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,180
You're no fun.

142
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,830
I shouldn't have saved you.

143
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,790
Twice.

144
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,830
You think you're my dream girl?

145
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,950
You didn't save me.

146
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,710
You screwed me up!

147
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,740
What a fool.

148
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,390
If not for me last time,

149
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,420
you'd be cut into pieces by their array.

150
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,700
Let alone this time.

151
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,100
You're full of lies.

152
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,980
Move aside.

153
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,950
This house is filled with traps.

154
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,860
They're invisible during the day.

155
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,350
But they'll
automatically turn on at night.

156
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,860
You saw that too, right?

157
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,500
If you just go in there head-on,

158
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,030
you'll end up like that leaf,

159
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,660
completely shredded.

160
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,500
How...

161
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,350
How shall we hack this array?

162
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,230
Well, I guess
you should stay away from me.

163
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,060
In case I screw you up again, right?

164
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,860
Sister, I've realized my fault.

165
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,540
Please don't blame me.

166
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,180
Please forgive a lowly one like me.

167
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,830
Fine.

168
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,590
I'll give you another chance then.

169
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,390
Help me fetch something.

170
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,710
And I'll help you hack this array.

171
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,620
How's that?

172
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,950
I gotta take the Goddess Jade first.

173
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,910
They're all in the same place.

174
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,620
Follow me.

175
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,590
Why are you avoiding me?

176
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,540
Am I not pretty enough?

177
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,620
I wouldn't dare.

178
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,660
Then you're exactly like your Fire King.

179
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,030
Not dare to be a man.

180
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,860
Enjoy being a coward.

181
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,390
Say, if I get my hands on this treasure,

182
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,270
will Fire King come out to meet me?

183
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,790
Ma'am, today's event is very important.

184
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,060
I wish that you could spare us

185
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,540
and not interfere.

186
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,100
The more you say so,
the more I wanna stay.

187
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,830
Today's treasure belongs to nobody
but me.

188
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,180
If Fire King wants it,

189
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,150
let him come for me personally.

190
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,950
Or, you may kill me,

191
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,180
and bring my body to him.

192
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,660
Why are we still waiting?

193
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,860
Start it now!

194
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,270
Yeah!

195
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,470
Why isn't it coming yet?

196
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,080
Yeah.

197
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,300
What's going on?

198
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,740
No explanation for us.

199
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,740
Everyone, be quiet.

200
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,230
The Goddess Jade accumulates

201
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,980
the essence of nature for centuries.

202
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,060
It is both a treasure

203
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,060
and a most ominous and negative object.

204
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,980
We have to place it
in front of Bodhisattva

205
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,710
and suppress it
with spells written in cinnabar.

206
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,980
We put offerings there day and night.

207
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,710
And we invited
pure children to chant sutras.

208
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,540
Only after eighty-one days

209
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,790
can we lift off the spell
and show it to people.

210
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,420
Otherwise it will bring back luck to us.

211
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,740
Today's midnight

212
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,860
will be the perfect time.

213
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,540
Stay low.

214
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,100
Isn't the Goddess Jade
in the Buddha hall?

215
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,030
Funny you should say that.

216
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,860
They put it away since a thief visited.

217
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,660
Stay close.

218
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,790
Can you be smarter?

219
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,540
This little girl!

220
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,100
I'm running in circles with her.

221
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,830
Little girl,

222
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,540
can you hurry?

223
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,790
Haste makes waste.

224
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,420
I'm telling you,

225
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,270
all the arrays in Zhang Residence

226
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,390
are extremely dangerous.

227
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,910
We are toast

228
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,060
if we're not cautious enough.

229
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:18,830
Stay close.

230
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,620
Go. What are you doing?

231
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,740
Stay close.

232
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,740
I'm telling you,

233
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,790
there's a secret chamber
beneath the river.

234
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,030
Mr. Zhang Si hides
all his treasures there.

235
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,350
What we want is right in there.

236
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,180
But the trap of this secret chamber
is quite tricky.

237
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,590
It'll need us to link our Yin and Yang.

238
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,910
It's a two-person job.

239
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,910
Link our Yin and Yang...

240
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,860
What are you thinking?

241
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,060
Did you misread something?

242
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,590
I wasn't thinking of anything.

243
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,620
You're thinking of something.

244
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,910
I...

245
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,540
No, I'm not!

246
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,300
Stay close.

247
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,540
Go.

248
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,660
Come on.

249
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,420
In the concept of tai chi,
there's a Yin and a Yang.

250
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,390
It means when we finally undo the array,

251
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,230
one person
must stand at the heaven position,

252
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,740
while the other
stands at the earth position.

253
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,180
Wouldn't that be quite dangerous?

254
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,270
As long as you listen to me,

255
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,300
I can let you live.

256
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,620
Wh... What if we misstepped?

257
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,390
What will happen?

258
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,660
Then we'll die together.

259
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,420
Follow me.

260
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:09,830
Stand here.

261
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,630
I didn't see the Goddess Jade.

262
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:28,900
Be quiet.

263
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,190
You!

264
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,390
Since the Goddess Jade isn't here,

265
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,390
I'll get half of this thing, right?

266
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,020
This isn't worth too much.

267
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,780
Really?

268
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,990
Then why do you
take such risks to come here?

269
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,950
It belonged to my late mother.

270
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,510
You want it?

271
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,550
Then help me get Goddess Jade.

272
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,510
Without me,

273
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,030
you can't walk out of this array anyway.

274
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,420
Not quite.

275
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,270
I've got a great memory.

276
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,870
I remember every step you took.

277
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,750
See you later.

278
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,630
I stepped on the death gate.

279
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,940
It has to be undone by two persons.

280
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,100
You stepped on the death gate?

281
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,510
Lying comes with a cost.

282
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,300
I'll do what you ask.

283
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,030
Alright.

284
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,630
Crying girls
are the last thing I wanna see.

285
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,990
I'm not gonna leave you behind.

286
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,700
It's just that you're so naughty.

287
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,180
I was trying to

288
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,700
teach you a little lesson.

289
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,100
Let's go.

290
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,750
Hold on.

291
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,910
Give me my mirror.

292
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,990
Take me to the Buddha hall first.

293
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,030
Then I'll give it to you.

294
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,550
You...

295
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,820
It's not that I don't trust you.

296
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,580
This thing

297
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,340
concerns my master's life and death.

298
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,870
I can't make any mistakes.

299
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,940
Fine then, follow me.

300
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,390
One sec.

301
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,670
What's this for?

302
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,750
I'm giving them a distraction.

303
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,990
Everyone, please calm down.

304
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,550
Please be patient.

305
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,990
Come, serve them tea.

306
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,260
Fine.

307
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,810
Let's just have a little patience.

308
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,200
A good dinner is worth waiting for.

309
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,740
Right?

310
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,550
Do you know who Mr. Zhang Si is?

311
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,420
If you do it like this,

312
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,630
you'll die a horrible death.

313
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,870
I'm telling you,

314
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,100
don't implicate me.

315
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,790
It's him.

316
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,150
Everyone,

317
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,700
midnight is coming.

318
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,990
You'll see the treasure right away.

319
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,010
- Finally.
- Yeah.

320
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:58,770
Yeah.

321
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,790
The priceless treasure
of the Earth family.

322
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,940
Invisibility Cloth.

323
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,270
Mr. Bao?

324
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,220
Mr. Bao is already dead.

325
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,820
I'm just borrowing his body.

326
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:53,940
Go.

327
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,550
There's a fight!

328
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:00,670
Let's go.

329
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,670
Come on, don't get hurt.

330
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,550
Who is he?

331
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:05,790
Run.

332
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,340
Skinner of the Earth family.

333
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,270
The long-disappeared Earth family
is here.

334
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,510
I'll leave this man to you.

335
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,220
Someone!

336
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,060
Take him away.

337
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,510
Yes, Sir!

338
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,580
Let's go.

339
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,300
Wh... What are you doing?

340
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,420
Let me go!

341
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,410
Sorry to startle you.

342
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,150
Let me go!

343
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,700
Please be seated. Let's continue.

344
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,390
What? Stupefied?

345
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:55,990
That was close.

346
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,700
If not for you,

347
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,030
I'd be Black Whipper's cannon fodder.

348
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,990
Come on, hurry.

349
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,150
Wait a sec.

350
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,910
Why is the fuse so short?

351
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,180
Where are you going?

352
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,340
Let's add more power.

353
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,340
What are you up to?

354
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,270
Are you blowing up people or the wall?

355
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,270
Say no more.

356
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,790
I'll light them later.

357
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,300
My skin's thick. I don't care.

358
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,180
Let's not waste any.

359
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,100
Fine then.

360
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,990
Hurry.

361
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,180
Midnight has come.

362
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,220
Let's welcome the Goddess Jade.

363
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,060
Magnificent!

364
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,790
It's really something else!

365
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,030
That's for sure.

366
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,100
Most of you here

367
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,060
came for the Goddess Jade.

368
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,630
But you don't know that its true secret

369
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,460
is giving up one's life for justice.

370
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,180
Actually, the real treasure

371
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,420
hides inside the belly of the goddess.

372
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,300
It's called the Jade Pearl.

373
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:01,940
Everyone, this is the Jade Pearl.

374
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,040
I've never seen it before.

375
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,090
I've really seen something new today!

376
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,590
Look.

377
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,270
It's glowing!

378
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,180
Everyone, now you may start bidding.

379
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,420
1,000 taels of silver!

380
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,100
1,000 taels of silver!

381
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,940
1,200 taels!

382
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,340
This gentleman is bidding
on 1,200 taels.

383
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,700
Anyone else would like to bid?

384
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,340
Me, 1,300 taels!

385
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,750
1,300 taels!

386
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,790
This gentleman is bidding
on 1,300 taels.

387
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,750
Anyone else?

388
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,790
1,000 taels of gold!

389
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,180
- 1,000 taels of gold!
- 1,000 taels?

390
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,220
- 1,000 taels of gold?
- That's too much!

391
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,460
No discussing!

392
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,820
Bid if you have money.

393
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,390
Scram if you don't.

394
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,510
What are you doing?

395
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,220
What's going on?

396
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,200
What's that noise?

397
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,910
What happened?

398
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,630
Yeah.

399
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,910
What the hell is that?

400
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,870
What was that noise?

401
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,180
Mr. Zhang, someone
broke into the secret chamber.

402
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,100
Everyone, be quiet.

403
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,420
We can go on with the bidding.

404
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,790
Please go ahead.

405
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,460
Master.

406
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,150
Master.

407
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,060
Master.

408
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,100
Master.

409
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,300
Speak.

410
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,150
Someone went into the secret chamber.

411
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,220
The Linglong Mirror is gone.

412
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,180
Seal all gates.

413
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,940
Let not a fly out of the house!

414
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,420
Yes.

415
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,340
Goujian.

416
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,990
Mr. Zhang.

417
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,630
You're up.

418
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,060
Yes.

419
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,550
1,000 taels of gold.

420
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,460
Does anyone

421
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,870
want to bid higher than this?

422
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:11,880
This is way too much.

423
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:12,940
That's a lot of money.

424
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,990
- I can't afford it.
- Too high.

425
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,180
Too high.

426
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,700
Please bid.

427
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,580
1,100 taels of gold!

428
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,990
There's really someone!

429
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,090
He added 100 taels.

430
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,820
- Does he have the gold?
- That's too much money.

431
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,670
However much
this Japanese gentleman bids,

432
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,940
I'll bid 100 more.

433
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,580
Did you bring enough money?

434
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,700
Does this Japanese gentleman
bring enough money?

435
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,100
Fellow countrymen here,

436
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,870
this thing is a national treasure.

437
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,550
It can't fall into
the hands of foreigners.

438
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,940
I don't believe

439
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,030
all of China's fortune
can't outbid a Japanese!

440
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,700
Good! Well said!

441
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,940
That's really well said!

442
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,990
That's right! Good!

443
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,340
- Yeah, exactly!
- He's right!

444
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,510
You! Who the hell are you?

445
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,630
I'm just an ordinary student.

446
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,790
We've already started raising funds.

447
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,060
That's not against the law, is it?

448
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,460
- Not at all.
- Yeah, not illegal.

449
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,750
Stop shouting! Wanna rebel or something?

450
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,820
Black Whipper!

451
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,180
There's no better timing
to act than now!

452
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,790
Little brat is selling me out!

453
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,100
Stop!

454
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,670
No!

455
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,270
Don't move!

456
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,340
Put the knife down!

457
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,630
One step closer and I'll kill him!

458
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,460
I said put the knife down!

459
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,630
Drop the gun first!

460
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,030
Put down!

461
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,820
Drop the gun! Didn't you hear?

462
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,060
Drop the gun!

463
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,030
- Drop it!
- Out of my way.

464
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,510
Give me the pearl.

465
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,030
I will when I see my godfather.

466
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,630
My good hero,

467
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,340
let's talk this through, okay?

468
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,630
Cut the crap.

469
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,220
Drop the gun. Did you hear me?

470
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,030
Fine.

471
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,460
Drop the gun.

472
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,100
Everyone, drop your gun!

473
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,550
Do it!

474
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,630
Let's go.

475
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,990
Boss, what should we do?

476
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,940
If we can't get the pearl,

477
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,820
the Japanese can't have it, either.

478
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,420
Got it.

479
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,270
I prepared a motorcycle
at the crossroad ahead

480
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,220
for you to get away.

481
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,340
What do you mean?

482
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,270
Let's go.

483
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:05,790
Go.

484
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,790
Up.

485
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,300
Stop.

486
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,030
Mr. Zhang, he's the one.

487
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,420
Hand over the Jade Pearl.

488
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,100
Mr. Zhang, he's got Mr. Oda.

489
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,940
How can you...

490
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,700
Hand over the Jade Pearl.

491
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,150
What a surprise.

492
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,630
The long-disappeared Yufeng Detective

493
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,390
actually works for the Japanese.

494
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,550
Why are the five element families
defending thieves?

495
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,030
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at?

496
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,180
No one leaves
if he doesn't hand it over.

497
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,340
The Jade Pearl
came out of the five element families.

498
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,510
Now it's only
being returned to its own master.

499
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,790
Ma'am, you go first.

500
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,460
Let's go.

501
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,340
Go.

502
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,060
After them! I'll deal with them here.

503
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,460
After them!

504
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:38,750
Go.

505
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,550
Let him go!

506
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,550
That way.

507
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,270
No sudden movements.

508
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,990
Everyone, don't move.

509
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,630
Don't move!

510
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,180
Stop moving.

511
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:54,990
Don't move.

512
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,700
Listen,

513
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,220
you can't escape.

514
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,060
Let Mr. Oda go now.

515
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:10,670
Go.

516
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,220
Dynamite! Get down!

517
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,510
- Xiaoxie.
- Xiaoxie.

518
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,550
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

519
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,300
Are you okay, Xiaoxie?

520
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,990
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

521
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,790
Get up, all of you!

522
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,750
Go! Follow them!

523
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,030
Don't move, all of you!

524
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,180
Captain Zheng?

525
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,990
How come it's you?

526
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,940
Mr. Zhou?

527
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,550
What happened, Mr. Zhou?

528
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,580
Get out of the way.

529
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,630
Mr. Zhou, I was told
to keep the auction safe.

530
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,300
But you let me patrol outside.

531
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,460
Now there's been an accident.

532
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,860
You owe me an explanation anyway.

533
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,950
Captain Zheng,
when you entered from here,

534
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,830
didn't you see

535
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,190
someone going out of the hole?

536
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,710
I came as soon as I heard the explosion.

537
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,340
There's too much smoke.
I didn't see anyone.

538
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,100
Get out of the way if you didn't!

539
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,830
I said get out of the way!

540
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,260
Or I won't be polite!

541
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:10,950
Let's move!

542
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,500
Go!

543
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,340
Follow him.

544
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,310
Retreat!

545
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,220
Just leave her.

546
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,790
Go after that brat.

547
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,550
Yes.

548
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,670
Quick. He's there!

549
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,550
Xiaoxie, go!

550
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,830
Go!

551
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,830
Stop!

552
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,220
Over there!

553
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,740
Stop!

554
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,590
Xiaoxie!

555
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,790
Hand over the pearl.

556
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,150
Without the pearl,

557
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,070
none of you leaves today.

558
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,350
Huo Xiaoxie, give him the pearl.

559
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,110
Not before I see my godfather.

560
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,460
Goujian, take them down!

561
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,740
- Run!
- Come on, run!

562
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,550
After them!

563

I don't care! I gotta save them!

592
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,610
No, Xiaoxie!

00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,340
Why not?

594
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,650

to bargain with them.
