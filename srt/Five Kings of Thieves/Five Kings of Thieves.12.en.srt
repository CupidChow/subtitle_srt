[Episode 12]

3
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,340
Pan.

4
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,270
I've got another idea.

5
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,590
What is it?

6
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,230
Looks like another scale shard
is about to be found.

7
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,360
Don't tell them
about the lethal weapon we found yet.

8
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,030
Okay.

9
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,110
Hold this.

10
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,080
Mr. Zheng,

11
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,110
would you consider parting with it?

12
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,270
You've finally joined forces.

13
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,750
Congratulations.

14
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,240
We're simply joining hands temporarily.

15
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,600
Mr. Huo,

16
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,110
are you two joining him?

17
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,160
No need.

18
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,360
I can handle this myself.

19
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,470
Again!

20
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,390
We'll pass.

21
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,440
Flower!

22
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,270
We are no match for him.

23
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,750
We'll try again when we've improved.

24
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,380
That was a good fight.

25
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,670
Zedao, where are Seven and the others?

26
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,360
I just followed the red light here.

27
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,080
San Qifeng and Seven are both dead.

28
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,550
What happened?

29
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,270
This doesn't make sense.

30
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,600
We are the only ones left.

31
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,160
But we were all busy scrambling
for the scale shards.

32
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,270
Then there must be someone else here

33
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,670
besides us.

34
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,800
Impossible.

35
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,320
Could it be

36
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,160
that the killer is among us?

37
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,080
You guys are getting crazy.

38
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,750
I don't even want

39
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,110
this Holy Cauldron anymore.

40
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,960
I'm going to the hall.

41
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,880
Flower is right.

42
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,440
I've got what I wanted anyway.

43
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,720
Guys,

44
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,160
good luck.

45
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,920
Who do you think the murderer is?

46
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,510
It's a corpse.

47
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,110
A corpse?

48
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,390
Liang Ba.

49
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,480
Huo Xiaoxie?

50
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,640
Liang Ba?

51
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,440
You're alive?

52
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,790
How did you know I was here?

53
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,000
Because of the oil agent on your hands.

54
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,320
It has a strong smell.

55
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,350
Continuing to play dead there

56
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,440
would've surely drawn attention.

57
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,040
So you had no choice but to come
to the only source of water

58
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,830
to wash the oil agent off.

59
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,070
So you were the one who got oil on me?

60
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,720
Give me the lamp.

61
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,200
How did you know

62
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,790
that the murderer was a "corpse"?

63
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,510
You hid all the bodies.

64
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,480
Could it be more obvious?

65
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,510
Where is Bing Guanzi's body?

66
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,440
At first, I thought someone
took advantage of the dim light

67
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,880
and the blind spots in vision
to attack you.

68
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,600
But then I realized something was off.

69
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,510
So I remembered something crazy
Seven said.

70
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,390
It was a ghost.

71
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,230
Yes, definitely a ghost!

72
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,550
I wondered why he would say that,

73
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,920
because there was no ghost behind us,

74
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,510
not even a person.

75
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,510
It was you who killed Red Clown

76
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,790
and staged an entire show.

77
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,880
Huo Xiaoxie,

78
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,920
I admit you're really clever.

79
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm not.

80
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,600
If I were,

81
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,270
more people would have survived.

82
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,390
You tried your best.
The rest was up to fate.

83
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,600
You shouldn't blame yourself.

84
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,110
Zedao,

85
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,600
you should've let him live.

86
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,480
There's still something
I don't understand.

87
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,640
What is it?

88
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,600
Shortly after he attacked Ruoyun,

89
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,720
Bing Guanzi died.

90
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,830
I suspect there's another murderer.

91
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,160
This scale shard should go to Ruoyun.

92
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,000
It was Huo Xiaoxie
who found the murderer.

93
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,200
It is only reasonable
that you guys take this shard.

94
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,350
Thank you.

95
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,320
We'll go look for the last shard then.

96
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,070
Let's go.

97
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,040
Come on.

98
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,550
Don't.

99
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,070
Dear Sir or Madam,

100
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,390
sorry for the disturbance.

101
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,440
Please bless us with the luck

102
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,320
to smoothly accomplish the tasks.

103
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,200
I'll kowtow to you.

104
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,110
What is it?

105
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,910
A scale shard!

106
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,200
Found it just like that?

107
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,550
A little courtesy truly goes a long way.

108
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,840
Put the scale shards in,

109
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,760
and we can move on to the final task.

110
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,030
Huo Xiaoxie,

111
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,710
if I get the Holy Cauldron,

112
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,590
I'll definitely
help you save Shui Yao'er.

113
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,670
Right, Ruoyun?

114
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,960
Thanks, buddy.

115
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,280
Huo Xiaoxie,

116
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,150
even though we are friends,

117
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,200
I still hope you'll give it your all

118
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,350
to win the Holy Cauldron.

119
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,470
Let's do our best.

120
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,470
Zedao,

121
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,880
you are the other murderer,

122
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,080
right?

123
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,440
What are you talking about?

124
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,640
Why?

125
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,350
Great ambitions require bold actions.

126
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,230
I need power.

127
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,550
Anyone who stands in my way

128
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:34,840
must die.

129
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,710
Does that include me?

130
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,670
I never thought about killing you.

131
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,360
I knew something was off

132
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,200
when Shui Yao'er's earrings fell out

133
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,030
of Mr. Zhang Si's threat letter.

134
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,150
How could he have

135
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,400
Shui Yao'er's earring?

136
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,150
It didn't occur to me

137
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,440
that you've been staying
with the Water family.

138
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,230
Getting Shui Yao'er's stuff
was a piece of cake for you.

139
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,150
I did it out of expediency.

140
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,910
You are no longer

141
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,590
the Zedao I knew in Fengtian.

142
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,000
Tell me.

143
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,470
Did you kill the Water King?

144
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,910
It was Mr. Zhang Si who killed him.

145
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,840
All you care about is love and romance.

146
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,110
What do you know?

147
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,640
Take a good look at today's China.

148
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,660
We need someone

149
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,540
to bring together the divided forces

150
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,550
in the martial world.

151
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,030
Only so will we be able
to save the country

152
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,760
when it's in peril.

153
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,590
That's just your excuse.

154
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,880
I will defeat you!

155
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,790
When I obtain
the Holy Cauldron of Five Elements,

156
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,670
you will understand.

157
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:17,710
Those are...?

158
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,960
They should be the Fire King
and the Wood King.

159
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,640
To activate
the Holy Cauldron of Five Elements,

160
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,320
they exhausted
all their strength and energy.

161
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:39,910
Let's pay our respects.

162
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,400
[Unmatched where courage is scarce]
What does it say over there?

163
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,280
[Bested all five element incompetents]
"Bested all five element incompetents"?

164
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,760
What an arrogant claim.

165
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,710
Ladies and gentlemen,

166
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,960
let me introduce you

167
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,550
to this lady.

168
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,110
She is the No. 1 martial arts master
of the Dark Dragon Gang,

169
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,710
Chiyo Uno.

170
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:32,200
She will now
accept challenges from anyone.

171
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,280
Within one day,

172
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,080
if no one can defeat her,

173
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,000
everyone from the five element families
must kowtow

174
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,550
upon seeing us.

175
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,670
How dare you!

176
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,080
Who are you to behave so recklessly

177
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,230
in the five element families' territory!

178
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,350
That was a heavy hit.

179
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,320
Hurry! Report to Mr. Yan now!

180
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,230
Here. Try this.

181
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,080
Okay.

182
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,230
Miss Lin,

183
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,030
what's wrong?

184
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,670
I don't think my master
and the Fire King

185
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,440
will come back.

186
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,320
What?

187
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,470
What do you mean
they won't come back?

188
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,880
When they left,

189
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,320
they left behind
their Soul-guarding Lamps.

190
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,840
I just went to check them.

191
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,200
They have already gone out.

192
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,030
Something's up!

193
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,080
There's a Japanese outside
challenging us.

194
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:45,960
Please let me through.

195
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,580
What a bully!

196
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,130
Are you alright?

197
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,690
Are you okay?

198
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,400
I'm fine.

199
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,640
How dare you hurt our fellow brothers
from the Fire family!

200
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,160
Shouren.

201
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,560
So that was what the famed
five element families were capable of.

202
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,280
What a disappointment.

203
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,190
Let me take you on.

204
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,230
She's very skilled.

205
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,350
I am the chief of the Fire family.

206
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,920
Someone's trying to tarnish our name

207
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,310
on our home turf.

208
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,830
I must act.

209
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,280
You'll be marching to your death.

210
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,640
I don't care.

211
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,520
There are certain things
that a great man must do,

212
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,760
even if it leads to death.

213
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:49,760
What about me?

214
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,760
If there's another life,

215
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,830
I promise I'll marry you.

216
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,520
Say it again.

217
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,040
If there's another life,

218
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,350
I promise I'll marry you.

219
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,310
Come back!

220
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,760
Don't waste time.

221
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,310
Come at me together.

222
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,280
Guard the secret door.

223
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,760
Bring anyone who comes out to me.

224
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,350
Yes.

225
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,160
Miss,

226
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:10,950
Miss,

227
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,560
why did you come out?

228
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:13,640
Mr. Three,

229
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,350
are the Three Firegate Tasks
coming to an end?

230
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,350
Miss,

231
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,760
you'd better go back
to your room and rest.

232
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,160
I need to visit the Wood family.

233
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,400
A Japanese has set up

234
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,680
a ring in the street.

235
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,280
People from the Wood and Fire families
are all there.

236
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,710
Why do you have to go there?

237
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,680
A Japanese?

238
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,040
I have to see this.

239
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,070
Miss, you...

240
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,190
What's going on here?

241
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,160
Where has
the Cauldron's guardian beast gone?

242
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,590
It's said that the Holy Cauldron
can only be owned by its destined owner.

243
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,430
They've already entered the trial.

244
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,880
We've been eliminated.

245
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,350
No need to feel sad.

246
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,800
Let's go outside
and wait for good news from Huo Xiaoxie.

247
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:38,880
Who are you?

248
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,950
I am Huo Xiaoxie.

249
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,310
"Huo" means a scorching fire,

250
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,760
and "Xie" means evil.

251
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,110
I live in Fengtian alone.

252
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,560
I have no parents

253
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,520
and was raised by my master.

254
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,310
But

255
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,880
I am neither capable

256
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,110
nor ambitious.

257
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,040
I just spend my days idly
on the streets.

258
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,280
Where is this?

259
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,430
Who are you really?

260
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,880
You are an illusion.

261
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,880
You're an illusion, aren't you?

262
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,070
An illusion?

263
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,070
I am you.

264
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,280
And I understand you better
than you do yourself.

265
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,680
Have you forgotten?

266
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,830
You caused your friends' deaths

267
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,470
and failed to win the woman you love.

268
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,520
The little pride you have left

269
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,560
was also the cause

270
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,590
of many others' deaths.

271
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,760
You are nothing but a failure.

272
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,070
Do you have the courage to kill me?

273
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,920
Killing me means killing yourself.

274
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,800
With the dark flame within you,

275
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,280
you'll eventually become a demon anyway.

276
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,070
A failure should just accept his fate.

277
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,160
Accept your fate.

278
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,000
Accept it!

279
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,640
I won't give in!

280
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,230
There is the downfall of a state

281
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,590
and the downfall of the world.

282
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:58,400
How are the two concepts different?

283
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,880
A change of ruling family or state name

284
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,920
signifies the downfall of a state.

285
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:14,110
The collapse of ethical values, leading
to a state where beasts prey on humans

286
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,070
and humans resort to cannibalism

287
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,350
marks the downfall of the world.

288
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,950
The task of preserving a state

289
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,560
falls to its sovereign, his officials,

290
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,680
and others of power.

291
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,520
However, the responsibility
of preserving the world

292
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,760
extends

293
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,470
to even the lowliest individuals
among the populace.

294
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:43,880
You...

295
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,470
You are me?

296
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,470
Are you me when I grow up?

297
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,110
Why do I not recognize you?

298
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,760
Why do I not recognize you?

299
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,560
Why do I not recognize you?

300
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,560
Why do I not recognize you?

301
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,400
Why do I not recognize you?

302
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,190
Why do I not recognize you?

303
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,830
Why do I not recognize you?

304
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,470
Why do I not recognize you?

305
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,830
Why do I not recognize you?

306
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,900
Why do I not recognize you?

307
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,400
Who...

308
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,880
Who are you?

309
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,280
Why do I not recognize you?

310
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,070
Why do I not recognize you?

311
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,640
Am I wrong?

312
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,390
Have I really gone on the wrong path?

313
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,800
Wan.

314
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,680
What are you doing here?

315
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,880
This man's been spotted
in Fengtian before.

316
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,110
He's probably colluded
with Mr. Zhang Si all along.

317
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,350
The fact that he's stirring trouble here
with the five element families

318
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,350
probably has something to do
with the Holy Cauldron of Five Elements.

319
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,310
- Jingtian!
- Mr. Yan!

320
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,400
- Jingtian! Ms. Whipper!
- Black Whipper!

321
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,110
Black Whipper, how are you holding up?

322
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,110
Ms. Whipper.

323
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,160
Ms. Whipper,

324
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,680
Ms. Whipper...

325
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,000
Stop calling me Ms. Whipper.

326
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,230
Call me Black.

327
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,350
Black.

328
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,680
All my life,

329
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,000
I've been chasing

330
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,160
and waiting.

331
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,230
It's too exhausting.

332
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,310
I'm not a great man.

333
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,310
I just want to be the woman
of a great man.

334
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,470
Even if it's just for a day,

335
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:35,640
an hour,

336
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,400
or a moment,

337
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,350
I'll be content.

338
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,640
Yan Jingtian,

339
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,280
I am so grateful

340
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,110
to have met you.

341
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,920
Black!

342
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,400
Ms. Whipper...

343
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,800
Black.

344
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,040
Black!

345
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,520
Black...

346
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,280
Jingtian! Jingtian!

347
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,710
Jingtian...

348
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,830
Jingtian...

349
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,160
Anyone else?

350
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,280
Anyone else?

351
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,000
Take Jingtian and Ms. Whipper back!

352
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,310
- Yes.
- Yes.

353
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,950
Black.

354
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,590
Jingtian.

355
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,830
Make way!

356
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,070
Give us the Holy Cauldron
of Five Elements.

357
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,310
Otherwise,

358
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,680
today will be the day

359
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,070
the five element families

360
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,040
cease to exist!

361
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,040
Wan,

362
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,350
you stay out of this.

363
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,280
I'll handle it.

364
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,280
In your condition,

365
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,430
you can barely stand.

366
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,230
Don't do this.

367
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,040
People from the five element families
can accept annihilation,

368
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,350
but they will never surrender.

369
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,710
When my father was alive,

370
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,920
I could afford to be a reckless lady.

371
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,000
But now,

372
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,710
I stand for the Water family.

373
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,230
Wan,

374
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,470
I'll get ready to fight.

375
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,350
Alright.

376
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:55,950
Let me fight!

377
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:02,760
Zedao.

378
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,070
Yao'er, let me deal with her.

379
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,280
Where's Huo Xiaoxie?

380
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:17,950
Let's call off

381
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,110
our engagement.

382
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,190
What kind of trick
are you trying to pull now?

383
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,070
Some mistakes

384
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,350
can never be undone.

385
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,070
But I can atone for them.

386
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,680
Please,

387
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,160
give me a chance.

388
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,160
Our five element families

389
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,000
are filled with capable
and virtuous people.

390
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,230
You might have your moment now,

391
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,430
but ultimately, you're just a jester.

392
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,470
Such bold words.

393
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,560
Show me what you've got.

394
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,430
Kill me.

395
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,070
Kill me, and you can have
the Holy Cauldron of Five Elements

396
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,710
and acquire the Holy Secret Technique.

397
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,640
Then,

398
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,110
you'll be the foremost leader
of the five element families.

399
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,280
Wealth,

400
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,230
women,

401
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,590
and power

402
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,110
will all be within your grasp.

403
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,040
Hurry. Do it.

404
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,190
Kill me now!

405
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:47,880
Kill me.

406
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:50,800
Stop!

407
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,820
Huo Xiaoxie, stop!

408
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,280
Come on. What are you waiting for?

409
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,680
If you don't kill me,

410
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,760
you'll remain a hooligan from Fengtian.

411
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,350
You won't even be able
to protect the woman you love.

412
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,660
You'll only be a doormat

413
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,160
that anyone can trample on.

414
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,470
Do you understand?

415
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,470
Come on.

416
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,880
Do it.

417
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,430
Kill me!

418
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,110
I decide

419
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,470
my own fate!

420
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,400
Huo Xiaoxie.

421
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,710
Shui Yao'er.

422
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,430
You are an illusion too.

423
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,830
Why do you want
the Holy Cauldron of Five Elements?

424
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,310
Because I want to save you.

425
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,040
Zheng Zedao can save me.

426
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,560
You just want to own me.

427
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,070
We love each other.

428
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,920
What's wrong

429
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,760
with wanting you to be mine?

430
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,760
The Holy Cauldron of Five Elements
bears the fortune of the nation.

431
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,160
It requires

432
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,880
a destined,

433
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:13,800
virtuous,

434
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,110
and capable person

435
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,190
to wield it.

436
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,560
The one who obtains it

437
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,110
becomes its guardian.

438
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,070
Once you become its owner,

439
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,070
you must protect it

440
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,590
and shoulder the responsibility
of revitalizing the five element families.

441
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,880
Are you ready for that?

442
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,710
I will do my best.

443
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,040
Good then.

444
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:41,880
Now,

445
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,880
kill me.

446
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,590
What?

447
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,710
Use the blood from my heart
as a sacrifice,

448
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,110
and you'll obtain
the Holy Cauldron of Five Elements.

449
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,950
How could I possibly kill you?

450
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,590
If you don't,

451
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,560
you'll never get
the Holy Cauldron of Five Elements.

452
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,760
You'll be trapped here,

453
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,320
dying as your energy gets sapped away.

454
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,190
You said obtaining
the Holy Cauldron of Five Elements

455
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,710
requires destiny,

456
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,320
capability,

457
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,970
and virtue.

458
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,760
If I were to kill

459
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,630
the woman I love most for it,

460
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,520
what virtue would remain in me?

461
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,630
I am but an illusion.

462
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,190
No.

463
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,670
That other Huo Xiaoxie

464
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,710
is a part of me,

465
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,760
of my body.

466
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,280
And you,

467
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,430
Shui Yao'er,

468
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,600
you are a part of my heart.

469
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,670
I would never harm you.

470
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,760
I'll protect you,

471
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,710
now and always,

472
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:15,230
whether in reality or in illusions,

473
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,910
even if you're just an illusion.

474
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:21,840
Blood from the heart, huh?

475
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,710
I've got it too.

476
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,150
Watch out!

477
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,470
Zedao!

478
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,670
Zheng Zedao!

479
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,120
To give me a scratch,

480
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,470
you'd risk your life?

481
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,600
If you wish to die,

482
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,840
I'll help you!

483
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:33,950
Stop!

484
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,710
Huo Xiaoxie!

485
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,600
You made it?

486
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,390
You are facing me now.

487
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:55,670
Zedao.

488
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,080
Just now,

489
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,230
I saw my young self

490
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,840
in the illusion created
by the Holy Cauldron.

491
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,230
Only then did I realize

492
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,870
I'd wronged others

493
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,040
and myself.

494
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,390
It's my fault.

495
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,520
Zedao, stop saying that.

496
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:16,800
Let's go.

497
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,190
You must stick to the right path for me.

498
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,230
Zedao,

499
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,280
I will keep your words in mind.

500
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,910
Wan, take care of him.

501
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,390
Huo Xiaoxie.

502
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,760
Be good, and wait for me.

503
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,710
So you are the winner
of the Holy Cauldron of Five Elements?

504
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,760
Yes.

505
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,120
Hand over the Holy Cauldron,

506
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,320
and I'll spare everyone.

507
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,950
You will never understand

508
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,520
the weight it carries.

509
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,630
Nice! Nice moves!

510
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,870
The Chinese saying is right.

511
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,350
Heroes do emerge young.

512
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,670
I give you a chance

513
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,520
to join us with the Holy Cauldron
of Five Elements.

514
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,000
Whatever the five element families
can give you,

515
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,560
the Dark Dragon Gang

516
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,710
can give you too.

517
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,190
I want these splendid rivers
and mountains

518
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,800
to remain China's territory.

519
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,040
Can the Dark Dragon Gang
make that happen?

520
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:20,360
Look.

521
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,420
Am I seeing things? What's going on?

522
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,230
So many duplicates.

523
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,360
Right.

524
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,150
Nice! Awesome!

525
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,670
Amazing!

526
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:19,560
Huo Xiaoxie!

527
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,200
Huo Xiaoxie is truly amazing!

528
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,190
It's over.

529
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,950
You and your guy

530
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,470
can leave.

531
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:31,280
Chiyo.

532
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:36,870
Let's go.

533
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,840
Well done!

534
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,040
Amazing!

535
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,320
Way to go!

536
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,390
Huo Xiaoxie!

537
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,890
Wonderful!

538
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,190
That was amazing!

539
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,360
From the moment I met you,

540
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:58,760
I knew

541
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,320
I had fallen in love

542
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,280
with a great hero.

543
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,120
We can finally be together now.

544
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,390
I've missed you so much.

545
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,560
I've missed you too.

546
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,800
It's finally over.

547
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,760
Over?

548
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,950
Perhaps it's just the beginning.

549
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,770
Way to go!

550
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,120
