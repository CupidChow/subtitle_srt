00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,020
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,810
Shui Yao'er, are you alright?

4
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,770
I'm fine.

5
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,300
How's everyone?

6
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,730
Jingtian!

7
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,410
Ms. Whipper!

8
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,090
Ms. Whipper!

9
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,210
Where are you, Wan?

10
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:56,810
Ms. Whipper!

11
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,700
Is everyone okay?

12
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,090
You're so heavy!

13
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,580
Ms. Whipper!

14
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,340
Ms. Whipper!

15
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,730
Just put me down.

16
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,530
I'm doing it.

17
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:14,730
Okay.

18
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,090
Jump.

19
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,370
I'll catch you.

20
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,620
Catch me.

21
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,980
I'm letting go.

22
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,140
Are you alright?

23
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,170
Get up.

24
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,060
You did that on purpose.

25
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,010
Are you hurt?

26
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,620
Why are we all chained up?

27
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,570
Jingtian!

28
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,290
I'm chained up.

29
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,730
We're all chained up.

30
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,780
What's going on here?

31
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,530
Be careful.

32
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,370
Are you guys all right?

33
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,010
Are you alright, Wan?

34
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,700
Are you all right?

35
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,450
Lin Wan, hand over the Jade Pearl!

36
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,530
I'll take the Jade Pearl back

37
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,450
to my master.

38
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,060
Don't worry about it.

39
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,340
You...!

40
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,340
Still arguing over it at this time?

41
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,420
Fine, we'll talk about this later.

42
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:12,900
Where's Shouzhen?

43
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,700
Shouzhen?

44
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,810
Find Shouzhen.

45
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,370
Shouzhen!

46
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,260
- Shouzhen!
- Shouzhen!

47
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,730
Here it is.

48
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,060
Shouzhen!

49
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,370
Wake up.

50
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,860
Shouzhen!

51
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,780
Aren't the Wood family's
medical skills unparalleled?

52
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,010
I'm begging you.

53
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,450
Save him.

54
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,860
Shouzhen!

55
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,170
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,290
Shouzhen!

57
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,600
Shouzhen!

58
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,340
Shouzhen!

59
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:58,860
Shouzhen!

60
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,290
Shouyi.

61
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,810
Shouzhen!

62
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,540
Shouyi!

63
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,010
The situation is critical.

64
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,980
It's not time to grieve.

65
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,170
Get a grip.

66
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,530
Pull yourself together!

67
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,340
Where's Mr. Qian?

68
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,980
He was just here.

69
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,810
He's not here.

70
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,620
Ms. Whipper.

71
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,010
Where are we?

72
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,210
There must be a way out.

73
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,620
Let's look around.

74
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:51,940
What is this?

75
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,450
I'm sure I can unlock it!

76
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,620
Mr. Zhang!

77
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,660
From Mr. Qian.
They are under control now.

78
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,900
Alright, let's go.

79
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,820
Looks like they've got some news
about Huo Xiaoxie.

80
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,250
Feeling better, Ms. Whipper?

81
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,540
Yeah. Nothing serious.

82
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,060
I will avenge Shouzhen's death.

83
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,900
Don't worry, Ms. Whipper.

84
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,290
I'll get you out of here safely.

85
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,340
I'm not so weak
as to be under your protection.

86
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,100
Jingtian, let me
break the chain for you.

87
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,010
I'm afraid these cuffs are made
of refined black iron.

88
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,450
There's also a special mechanism
for the lock hole.

89
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,410
Without the key, it's useless.

90
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,620
I'd advise you not
to get your head around it.

91
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,130
What is this?

92
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,380
Then what to do?

93
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,850
Check it out, guys.

94
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,780
Outside is a hard stone wall.

95
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,500
Unless we find the mechanism,

96
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,570
or we'll be stuck here.

97
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,820
Put it this way.

98
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,820
The person who designed this

99
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,920
didn't want to leave anyone alive.

100
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,740
Don't be so downhearted.

101
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,530
Wan, you are knowledgeable.

102
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,540
Does this mechanism ring a bell?

103
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,050
I think
it's the Earth family's formation.

104
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,220
Could it be

105
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,570
Giant Killing Array?

106
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,050
I heard a rumor.

107
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,050
Thirty years ago,

108
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,780
Yufeng Detective
attacked the five element families

109
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,250
for the Holy Cauldron.

110
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,690
They didn't have any chance of winning.

111
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,740
But there was a traitor
in the Earth family.

112
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,090
And that person, Burrower,
is a master of mechanism.

113
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,050
During that battle,

114
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,720
the Earth King passed away.

115
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,150
The Earth family was devastated

116
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,300
and lost their talents.

117
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,740
Since then,

118
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,300
the Earth family gradually disappeared.

119
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,130
I've heard my father say that before.

120
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,250
That person is a master of mechanism.

121
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,490
I didn't think he'd hide here

122
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,780
and put up such a big formation.

123
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:24,980
All this effort

124
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:26,930
just

125
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,410
to get at us?

126
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,250
I don't think so.

127
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,010
We're in big trouble now.

128
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,300
Giant Killing Array is that powerful?

129
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,340
Yeah.

130
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,180
It is the Earth family's
most treasured possession.

131
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,130
Is there a way to break it?

132
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,130
It's a secret of the Earth family.

133
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,420
No one can solve it
but the one who made it.

134
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,610
It's impossible none of your
five element families know about it.

135
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,220
Jingtian, do you know about it?

136
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,050
I've heard another theory.

137
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,980
Turning the tide,

138
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,220
and destroying everything.

139
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,490
Sounds like a bluff.

140
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,930
I've seen a lot of mechanisms

141
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,100
and formations over the years.

142
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,300
There's no place
where I can be trapped.

143
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,450
Yeah.

144
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,250
You're Black Whipper.

145
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,980
Screwing people over,

146
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,490
and even making it alive
against Mr. Zhang Si.

147
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,730
I'm very impressed with you.

148
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,440
Huo Xiaoxie,

149
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,600
keep talking like that

150
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,330
and I'll pull your tongue out.

151
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,890
You're the one who got Mr. Qian killed.

152
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,220
You got Mr. Qian killed.

153
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,420
I didn't even let you touch the hammer

154
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,780
and you activated the mechanism.

155
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,220
What did you just do?

156
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,300
It was you.

157
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,100
Mr. Qian!

158
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,340
Mr. Qian!

159
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:56,930
Mr. Qian!

160
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,860
Mr. Qian, I thought you were dead.

161
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,740
Who are you calling dead?

162
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,860
Sir, I thought you weren't coming back.

163
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,660
Who are you saying can't come back?

164
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,360
Mr. Qian, your trick

165
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,860
of luring them to the hall

166
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,050
was really good!

167
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,130
Totally brilliant!

168
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,610
Don't flatter me.

169
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,610
Let's get to work.

170
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,420
Got it.

171
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:17,930
Let me see.

172
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,670
Sir, please let me in.

173
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,890
Slice and dice.

174
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,980
It's going to be a blast.

175
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,930
It won't be fun if the trap

176
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,180
kills them all.

177
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,420
Please, let me have some fun.

178
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,180
What did I teach you?

179
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,690
Killing

180
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,570
is the same as cooking.

181
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,930
The stew should be

182
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,220
slow-cooked over a gentle fire.

183
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,740
I want to see it this time.

184
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,060
These Earth family hypocrites
who look down on us,

185
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,300
let's see how long will they last.

186
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,690
If you are watching that,

187
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,120
I'll prepare some food and drinks.

188
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,740
Go.

189
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,610
You,

190
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,080
go and bring me my good wine.

191
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,240
Alright.

192
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,370
If it wasn't for you,

193
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,520
my martial brothers and my master
wouldn't be dead.

194
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,840
I'll settle this with you
sooner or later.

195
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,810
Yeah, anytime.

196
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,670
I'd like to see

197
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,250
if your skill is good enough.

198
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,280
Black Whipper, don't go too far!

199
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,390
If it wasn't for the Fire King,

200
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,680
you'd be dead already.

201
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,120
For the Fire King?

202
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,320
Fine, fight me together!

203
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,390
Enough!

204
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,630
Why are you still arguing at this hour?

205
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,950
We are all

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,120
in the same boat now.

207
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,440
We can't fight with each other now.

208
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,480
Besides, if Mr. Qian is dead,

209
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,240
his body doesn't just disappear.

210
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,670
There's got to be an exit.

211
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,070
Let's all have a good look around.

212
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,270
Let's see if we can
find some kind of mechanism.

213
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,440
Go!

214
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,320
Don't you guys think it's weird?

215
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,510
Could this trap designed by Mr. Qian

216
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,150
have anything to do with Zhang Si?

217
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,630
It's very possible.

218
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,000
Burrower was angry

219
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,750
with the five families back then.

220
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,120
I'm not surprised if he works

221
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,390
for Mr. Zhang Si.

222
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,950
He's not going to trap us here

223
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,510
until Mr. Zhang Si comes along, is he?

224
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,750
I've always felt that this formation

225
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,510
is more than just a way to trap us.

226
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Let's be careful.

227
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,810
Cheers!

228
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,540
Go!

229
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,330
Careful!

230
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,070
Get out of the way!

231
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,920
Huo Xiaoxie, don't move!

232
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,680
Everybody stay put!

233
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,120
Our chains are all connected.

234
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,950
What are you doing, Huo Xiaoxie?

235
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,750
Stop, Huo Xiaoxie!

236
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,190
They are fighting!

237
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,630
They are fighting!

238
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,430
They are fighting!

239
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,720
How fun!

240
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,160
- That way.
- That way.

241
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,740
Over there.

242
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,300
Keep going, kid.

243
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,830
This is the closest you've come
to avenging your master's death.

244
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,070
Ms. Whipper.

245
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,330
Really?

246
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,360
Ms. Whipper.

247
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,480
Don't move!

248
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,360
Huo Xiaoxie.

249
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,360
Drop the chain!

250
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,440
Huo Xiaoxie.

251
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,440
Drop the chain!

252
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,800
The chain's being recovered.

253
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,270
Wan!

254
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,320
Yan Shouyi, we're tied together!

255
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,830
Everybody stays put.

256
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,190
Calm down.

257
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,070
This is not the way to go.

258
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:43,830
Shouyi,

259
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,270
throw that net in.

260
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,680
Looks like it's really dangerous here.

261
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,240
If there's a chance, escape by yourself.

262
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,480
Just leave me.

263
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:09,950
Don't talk nonsense.

264
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,600
We'll definitely go out together.

265
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,720
Interesting, right?

266
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,920
Interesting.

267
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,800
It's interesting.

268
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,840
Back in those days,

269
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,870
I was expelled

270
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,720
for making such a small mistake.

271
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,230
I won't believe

272
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,470
they don't make mistakes.

273
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,720
Yeah.

274
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,320
I'm going to give them a little more.

275
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,560
Alright.

276
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,270
Shui Yao'er,

277
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,730
what happened to you?

278
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,840
Fire King.

279
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:37,980
Ms. Whipper.

280
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,760
You finally showed up.

281
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,870
Ms. Whipper.

282
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,150
Fire King, why are you avoiding me?

283
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,960
I'll make it so you can't leave me
for the rest of your life.

284
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,510
Ms. Whipper...

285
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,510
Why are you avoiding me?

286
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,080
Why are you avoiding me?

287
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,470
Why?

288
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,800
How dare you bully the chief?

289
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,390
Yao'er.

290
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,720
Yao'er.

291
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,200
Mother.

292
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,230
Yao'er.

293
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,200
Come to mother.

294
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,560
Mother.

295
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,680
You've come to me.

296
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:47,800
Mother.

297
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,610
Quickly.

298
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,630
Save me, mother.

299
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,040
Yao'er.

300
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:54,990
Don't go.

301
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,050
Save me.

302
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,370
Shui Yao'er.

303
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:57,820
Mother.

304
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,920
Shui Yao'er, don't!

305
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,840
Mother!

306
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,720
Shui Yao'er.

307
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,840
Don't touch me!

308
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,800
- Shui Yao'er.
- Lin Wan.

309
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,870
Give me back the Jade Pearl.

310
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,270
Mother!

311
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,150
Lin Wan!

312
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,350
You can't go there!

313
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,350
Give me back the Jade Pearl!

314
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,510
I won't give you even if I die!

315
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,680
Give me back the Jade Pearl!
Did you hear me?

316
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,390
Don't go there!

317
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:34,870
Come on.

318
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,600
The Jade Pearl...!

319
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,320
Give me back the Jade...!

320
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,230
Mother!

321
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,110
Shui Yao'er.

322
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,350
Mother!

323
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,320
Don't touch me!

324
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,150
Let go of her.

325
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,600
Mother!

326
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Wan, drop dead!

327
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,320
Black Whipper!

328
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,990
The show has begun.

329
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,960
Want to watch?

330
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,040
Here you go.

331
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,440
So fun.

332
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,110
It's the Giant Killing Array.

333
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,470
It's spectacular.

334
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,200
Get in there.

335
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,750
We can't lose Shui Yao'er.

336
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,350
Let's go.

337
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,200
Sir.

338
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,560
Hurry up.

339
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,990
You're seeking for death, Black Whipper!

340
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,800
Turn it.

341
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,080
Turn it.

342
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,720
Is he

343
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,290
the survivor?

344
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,230
We've prepared so much fun

345
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,320
but it's useless.

346
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,320
That's right.

347
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,470
Take your thing.

348
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:22,680
Get in there and take a look.

349
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,600
Let's go.

350
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,350
Go.

351
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,470
The five families are all dead.

352
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,840
Young man.

353
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,680
Young man.

354
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,680
Why are you the only one left alive?

355
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,040
Say it!

356
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,200
Qingzi!

357
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,270
You!

358
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,320
Give me back the Jade Pearl!

359
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,080
I won't give you even if I die!

360
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,110
Don't touch me!

361
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:34,510
Shui Yao'er.

362
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,080
Let go of her.

363
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,560
What was I doing?

364
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,750
How did you get hurt?

365
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,320
There's mind-altering poison in the air.

366
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,720
It can be detoxified by puncturing
the Hegu point with a silver needle.

367
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,350
I know where Mr. Qian is.

368
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,870
He's been watching us.

369
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,800
He wants us to kill each other.

370
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,110
So, now what?

371
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,350
We have to find a way

372
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,840
to draw him out.

373
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,230
How?

374
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,320
Wan,

375
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,110
drop dead!

376
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,720
You're seeking death, Black Whipper!

377
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,870
Just bear with it.

378
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,230
Mr. Qian's watching us.

379
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,390
He wants us to kill each other.

380
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,560
We have to show him.

381
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:19,840
Hit me!

382
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,470
Black Whipper!

383
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,960
Cut the crap! Come on!

384
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,270
Someone's watching us.

385
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,800
Jingtian, play dead.

386
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,560
Jingtian,

387
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,510
let me kill you all.

388
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,330
Stop it!

389
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,560
Stop it!

390
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,150
Mr. Zhang Si,

391
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,040
I've done everything you asked.

392
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,870
But he's still trapped inside.

393
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,440
My brother...
They killed my brother too.

394
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,600
Open the trap.

395
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,840
No way!

396
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,850
Mr. Zhang Si,

397
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,350
they still have Mr. Qian.

398
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,720
Say it!

399
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,350
How do you open this lock?

400
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,530
I can't open it.

401
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,230
I have a name for this lock.

402
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,600
Heart-juxtaposing Locks.

403
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,270
That's the name of this darn thing?

404
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,470
Juxtaposing means

405
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:56,040
conjoining two persons.

406
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,510
I'm just asking you how to unlock it.

407
00:26:59,390 --> 00:26:59,920
Uhm...

408
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,470
When they are connecting together...

409
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,230
Be careful.

410
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:11,800
Shouyi!

411
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,560
Jingtian.

412
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,640
Jingtian, I'm avenging Shouzhen!

413
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,050
Shouyi!

414
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,920
Shouyi!

415
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,320
Shouyi!

416
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,560
Shouyi!

417
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,230
Everybody spread out.

418
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,930
My chain is open.

419
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,440
Now I know what the Burrower means.

420
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,270
Two people are linked together.

421
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,870
When one dies,

422
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,510
the other's chain opens up.

423
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,920
Wan, it's a trap.

424
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,240
Find the switch.

425
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,560
There should be one of them left.

426
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,960
Okay, I'll find the switch now.

427
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,270
Wait for me to get back.

428
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,320
Be careful.

429
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,470
I don't think we can get out of here.

430
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,600
Don't be a downer!

431
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,510
Hang on!

432
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:52,870
Huo Xiaoxie,

433
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,600
if you have the chance to go out now,

434
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,350
what would you like to do the most?

435
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,720
I want to get out of here.

436
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,630
I wonder when Wan will be back.

437
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,630
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

438
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,080
I have an idea.

439
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,750
Shui Yao'er,

440
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,840
whatever your plan is,

441
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,150
we will listen to you.

442
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,510
Jingtian,

443
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,510
you've been protecting Black Whipper.

444
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,470
Why do you care so much about her?

445
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,080
I...

446
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,200
She's Fire King's woman.

447
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,800
I sure have to protect her.

448
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:26,750
Nonsense!

449
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,600
You like Black Whipper.

450
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,150
You're afraid to admit it.

451
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,150
I'm telling you.

452
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,150
I like Huo Xiaoxie,

453
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,870
so I have to get him out of here alive.

454
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,510
And you have to teach him martial arts

455
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,320
and help him pass
the Three Firegate Tasks.

456
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,390
If you promise me that,

457
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,230
I'll let Black Whipper get out alive.

458
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,870
What's your solution?

459
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,200
The solution is simple.

460
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,720
Simply by chopping off my feet,

461
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,390
the lock
on the Black Whipper's feet will open.

462
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,470
Once you chop off your feet,

463
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,840
Huo Xiaoxie can survive and get out.

464
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,040
Huo Xiaoxie,

465
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,630
you promised to marry me.

466
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,840
If I become disabled,

467
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,440
you won't regret it, won't you?

468
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,960
I won't allow you to do this.

469
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,080
Why?

470
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,800
Are you already disdainful of me?

471
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,840
Shui Yao'er,

472
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,320
don't hurt yourself.

473
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,040
Please promise me!

474
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,040
I promise you!

475
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,230
Shut up, Jingtian!

476
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,200
I don't agree!

477
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,990
Yan Jingtian, don't mess around!

478
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,390
I don't need all your kindness.

479
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,150
I'd rather not owe anything
to the Fire family either.

480
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,510
Cut the crap!

481
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,040
Shui Yao'er, don't do it.

482
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,510
I've got an idea.

483
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,040
Black Whipper,

484
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,440
please help me out.

485
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,870
This lotus

486
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,960
seems unable to break this chain.

487
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,750
Help me throw that chain in.

488
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,560
Hurry up!

489
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,080
Dangerous places
are paradoxically safer.

490
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,560
We'll wrap this chain around the lotus,

491
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,080
then run in the opposite direction.

492
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,600
Aren't you seeking death?

493
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,350
Jingtian!

494
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,350
Okay, I trust you.

495
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,390
Me too!

496
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,870
Jingtian, we go first!

497
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,600
One, two, three!

498
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,800
These few guys have some ability.

499
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,600
I'll go meet up with them.

500
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,840
Mr. Zhang, there are others here.

501
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,390
Mr. Zhang, the current situation
is uncertain.

502
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,440
Rush to the entrance to wait for us.

503
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,920
We'll bring you the person soon.

504
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,230
It's you.

505
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:50,960
Why are you here?

506
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,470
My friends have been locked inside.

507
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,750
Can you help them out?

508
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,720
Are they Huo Xiaoxie and Shui Yao'er?

509
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,470
Yes.

510
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,720
We need to locate the secret chamber.

511
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,990
Otherwise, they're in danger now.

512
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,800
Don't worry! I'm here.

513
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,680
They won't be in danger.

514
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,600
Cover your mouth first.

515
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,390
Okay.

516
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,920
What exactly can stop them?

517
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,110
Let's try pushing it up.

518
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:42,750
Okay.

519
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,080
It stopped!

520
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,360
We did it!

521
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,470
My chain is unlocked.

522
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:51,990
It's unlocked.

523
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:56,840
Where's the smoke coming from?

524
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,320
Is it poisonous?

525
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,400
It should be Wan's doing.

526
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,990
Let's find a place to hide.

527
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,470
Sir, this way.

528
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,040
I've got some hay here.

529
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,510
Burn it all.

530
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:43,880
Okay.

531
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,470
Search!

532
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:58,950
Quickly!

533
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:05,950
Who's there?

534
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,710
It's me!

535
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,190
After him!

536
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,510
The door is now open.

537
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,950
Huo Xiaoxie.

538
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,600
You're not hurt, are you?

539
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,400
Shui Yao'er, you all go this way.

540
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,400
Let's go together.

541
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,040
I'll stay here.

542
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,880
No way!

543
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
You've promised me

544
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,800
that we'd stay together

545
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,950
no matter dead or alive.

546
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,360
You guys, hurry up and go.

547
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,320
I know how to get away.

548
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,600
Are you sure?

549
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,880
Don't you trust me?

550
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,430
Hurry up and go.

551
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,320
Ms. Whipper,

552
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:40,800
thank you!

553
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:43,880
Quickly go!

554
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,510
Hurry up!

555
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,430
Go!

556
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,270
Trust me!

557
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,510
Captain Zheng!

558
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,190
Mr. Zhou.

559
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,080
It's you!

560
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,160
We meet again.

561
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,400
Sir, this way.

562
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,510
Where are you running? Stop there!

563
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:12,840
Huo Xiaoxie,

564
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,360
we go our separate ways.

565
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:14,750
Okay.

566
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,600
Shui Yao'er!

567
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:19,880
Don't come closer!

568
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,270
Whoever comes, I'll kill her!

569
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,430
Do you know who she is?

570
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,090
She's the daughter of Water King.

571
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,560
Release her first,

572
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,640
and we'll hand over the Jade Pearl.

573
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:32,910
Tell me!

574
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,510
How did your mother die?

575
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,880
It's not your concern!

576
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,710
If you won't tell me,

577
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,470
I'll kill you.

578
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,600
Next,

579
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,360
I'll kill your father.

580
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,430
Your pathetic life

581
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,320
was granted by my father.

582
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,600
Let her go!

583
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,640
Shui Yao'er.

584
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,910
Huo Xiaoxie!

585
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,040
You all hurry up and go!

586
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,470
- Hurry up and go!
- Mr. Zhang!

587
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,600
Retreat...

588
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,600
Retreat!

589
