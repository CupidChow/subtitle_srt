00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,060
[Episode 11]

3
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,620
Bro.

4
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,300
Pan

5
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:11,940
Wake up.

6
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,900
- Man.
- It's okay.

7
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,810
We've been drugged.

8
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,140
Yes.

9
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,620
Ruoyun.

10
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,900
Wake up.

11
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,340
Who drugged us?

12
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,860
Who drugged us?

13
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,370
Who did it?

14
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,810
Who did it?

15
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,810
Flower, are you OK?

16
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,450
Are you OK?

17
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,060
Gui Long?

18
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,370
What a tiny wound.

19
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Who used a knife?

20
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,260
Many people used knives at that time.

21
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,780
A knife that could make a cut like this

22
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,500
must have a very thin blade.

23
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,450
Guys,

24
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,170
the most important thing now is

25
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,700
to figure out who is
the best at drugging among us.

26
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,980
Don't slander me.

27
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,490
I've never killed anyone with drugs.

28
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,810
You want to hurt Miss Flower?

29
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,860
You have to go through me first.

30
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,900
I thought

31
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,140
you two looked like a team.

32
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,980
You want to get rid of us, right?

33
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,370
Listen,

34
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,140
even if I die here today,

35
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,140
I'll kill two people first.

36
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,700
If you don't believe me,

37
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,930
come and try.

38
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,730
Come on!

39
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,860
Calm down, everyone.

40
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,530
Don't act rashly

41
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,980
until we know what's going on.

42
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,340
The fat guy is gone.

43
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,620
Fat guy?

44
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,370
What would you do if you were the one

45
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,370
who gave the drug?

46
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,700
Find the scales.

47
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,220
Let's go.

48
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,450
Wan.

49
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,140
What's the matter?

50
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:13,700
Nothing.

51
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,140
There are still Zhang Si's remnants
in the city.

52
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,530
Our men are still investigating.

53
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,090
We'll have them all killed tonight

54
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,420
to avoid any other trouble.

55
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,660
OK.

56
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,410
This is the Fire family's
Fire Unicorn Lamp.

57
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,340
It's said to be made
from Jin Wu's feathers.

58
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,250
Let's take one.

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
It'll come in handy.

60
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,850
What's that?

61
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,380
I don't know.

62
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,380
Pang Haowei is here.

63
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,010
Get in here.

64
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,010
Wait.

65
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,290
What are you doing?

66
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,490
Wait.

67
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,590
What are you doing now?

68
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,870
Someone put poison in our food.

69
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,960
Gui Long is dead.

70
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:43,800
What?

71
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,710
Wait a minute.

72
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,830
I was knocked out just as I came in.

73
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,110
Everyone was eating

74
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,240
when you went into the cave.

75
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,480
Do you mean there was someone else?

76
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,430
This place hasn't been opened
in centuries.

77
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,640
Even if someone was here,

78
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,830
they'd all be dry corpses.

79
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,040
I was knocked out
just as I came in. It's true.

80
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,150
Why don't we just go our separate ways

81
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,520
and find our own way out?

82
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,240
No.

83
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,830
No one can leave until we figure out

84
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,550
what's going on.

85
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:11,800
That's right.

86
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,870
The killer must be among us.

87
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,550
You don't want to be killed
by someone

88
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,480
while you're breaking through, right?

89
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,040
How can we trust you?

90
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,430
I trust him.

91
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,360
Why are you looking at me?

92
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,920
What's going on?

93
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,680
Did you poison us?

94
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,640
I fainted with you.

95
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,310
I didn't kill him.

96
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,960
I don't know

97
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,960
when my clothes were broken.

98
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,310
If you didn't kill him,

99
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,480
who else could it be?

100
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,820
Come on.

101
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't scare me anymore, okay?

102
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,270
You can kill me if you want to.

103
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,080
I didn't kill him anyway.

104
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,800
Since we've all fainted,

105
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,310
it's possible

106
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,800
that someone deliberately provoked us

107
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,520
to kill each other.

108
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,480
What do you think we should do now?

109
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,150
Tie her up first.

110
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,390
Get up.

111
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,320
She is the murderer?

112
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,590
Could she kill Gui Long by herself?

113
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,870
Since the murderer has been caught,

114
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,110
we'll go ahead.

115
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,310
Gentlemen.

116
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,770
- See you.
- See you.

117
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,520
See you.

118
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,920
I'll wait for you there.

119
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,610
Be careful.

120
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,360
Don't worry.

121
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,270
Let me check the knife.

122
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,800
It's not the murder weapon.

123
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,510
Pang Haowei.

124
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,390
Please take care of her.

125
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,150
Don't worry.

126
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,070
When it's over,

127
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,190
I'll put her at Mr. Yan's disposal.

128
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,510
Thank you.

129
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,440
Let's go.

130
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,390
It's such a mess.

131
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,150
I'd better do a good deed first.

132
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,150
Let me put you to rest.

133
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,390
Be careful.

134
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,070
Where do you think

135
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,680
the scales are going to be?

136
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,830
I'm scared.

137
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,510
Would someone be disgusting enough
to hide them in a skeleton?

138
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,150
Jingtian keeps talking about luck.

139
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,390
Could this be some kind of clue?

140
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,070
Luck...

141
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:05,800
What are you laughing at?

142
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,880
My father said

143
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,320
those who often laugh

144
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,120
will have good luck.

145
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,040
Let's laugh together.

146
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,680
What's this?

147
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,240
I think it's a ghost fire.

148
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,920
It used to happen
when I was in Mass Grave Hill.

149
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,950
It's a vision.

150
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,830
There must be a treasure.

151
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,560
Let's go.

152
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,800
What is it?

153
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,000
I can't see anything.

154
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,320
Let's go.

155
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,190
Be careful.

156
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,950
Maybe we should go back.

157
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,750
Go back where?

158
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,720
It's not safe anywhere.

159
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,750
We might as well take a risk.

160
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,000
Let's go.

161
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,480
What do you want?

162
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,360
We want to avenge your murder.

163
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,680
Why make such a big deal out of it

164
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,070
just to reduce the number of rivals?

165
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,000
Mr. Yan said

166
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,240
we're not allowed to kill anyone.

167
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,070
We won't kill you.

168
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,270
We're just practicing in advance

169
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,120
so that we know whose scales

170
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,590
to grab when we find them.

171
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,710
Bro.

172
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,800
What should we do now?

173
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,670
Punch one of them as hard as you can.

174
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,040
Then, I'll go for this one-eyed guy.

175
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,250
Are you OK?

176
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:17,920
I'm OK.

177
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,040
Take him down.

178
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,710
If you take one more step,

179
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,560
I'll strangle him.

180
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,000
Young master.

181
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,040
Help me!

182
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,240
If you let him go, we'll go.

183
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,630
Let go of me!

184
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,510
Seven, go! Now!

185
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,150
Who's there?

186
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,800
What are you doing?

187
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,270
How about we make a deal?

188
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,590
You want me to let you go?

189
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,360
You don't want to be here, do you?

190
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,360
The guy who killed him

191
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,000
will be back any minute.

192
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,880
You have nothing to gain by killing me.

193
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,800
I didn't come here for tests.

194
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,190
Don't you want the Holy Cauldron?

195
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,800
I know who the killer is.

196
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,590
You wanna trick me?

197
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,520
Why didn't you tell us
when you were caught?

198
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,950
What benefits would it bring me

199
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,830
if they knew?

200
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,320
Have you tried to fish
in troubled waters?

201
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,120
Tell me, who is it?

202
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,630
Let me go first.

203
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,800
Do you believe I'll ruin your face?

204
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,830
Really?

205
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,320
Don't leave me here alone.

206
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,710
It's not good for you

207
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,440
if I die.

208
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,480
If you dare to lie to me,

209
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,150
I won't spare you.

210
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,390
You can verify it.

211
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,830
Come here.

212
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,150
Come here.

213
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,510
I have something to tell you.

214
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,390
Don't you like me?

215
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,150
I just like a handsome guy like you.

216
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,630
Tell me.

217
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,190
Do you like me?

218
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,360
If you do,

219
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,880
why don't you

220
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,000
tell me your secret?

221
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,360
I don't have any secrets.

222
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,710
You're a member of the Fire family,

223
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,270
so you should know something.

224
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,560
I am a sham.

225
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,270
What?

226
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,950
Then tell me

227
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,960
why you let that sick woman go.

228
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,770
She exchanged a secret with me.

229
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,600
What secret?

230
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,040
Yan Chong.

231
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,840
Yan Chong.

232
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,150
Miss Flower is gone again.

233
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,750
Listen.

234
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,350
Women can't be spoiled.

235
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:50,840
Come on.

236
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,390
Have a drink.

237
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,080
Maybe she'll be back soon.

238
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,350
What should we do?

239
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,750
At this rate,

240
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,990
even if we find the scales,
they'll be taken away.

241
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,440
There's always a way out.

242
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,680
Let's talk about it,

243
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,820
so we can work together.

244
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,720
Work together?

245
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,630
I'm gold, and you're fire.

246
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,470
How can we work together?

247
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,510
I want to know how Ruoyun is doing.

248
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,990
Why are you like this after meeting her?

249
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,470
You don't understand.

250
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,200
The first time I saw her,

251
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,270
I felt like we'd known each other
for years.

252
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,270
How did you feel when you

253
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,040
and Shui Yao'er first met?

254
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,630
Ruoyun.

255
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,870
Give it to me.

256
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:44,990
Ruoyun.

257
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,560
Are you okay?

258
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,720
Wake up. Get up.

259
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,320
Be careful.

260
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,270
What happened?

261
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,390
Are you okay?

262
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,080
Did you get a good look
at the attacker?

263
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,870
No.

264
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,510
I think he was trying to take my scales.

265
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,920
But he didn't get it.

266
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,390
- Who?
- Again?

267
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:06,630
What's going on?

268
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,320
Let's go.

269
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:12,800
Be careful.

270
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:23,870
This is Bing Guanzi.

271
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,440
She's dead?

272
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,400
Did you see anything?

273
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,040
No.

274
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,660
She was already dead

275
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,680
when we heard the noise and came.

276
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,840
Is it Pang Haowei?

277
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,200
Pang Haowei?

278
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,440
He's dead.

279
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,870
What is this?

280
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,600
Fainting Powder.

281
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,560
It's the drug we were given at lunch.

282
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,150
Looks like Pang Haowei is not part
of the Fire family at all.

283
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,230
Why were people killed again?

284
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,600
The murderer is one of us.

285
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,400
I have a few questions for you.

286
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,170
Bro.

287
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,870
What's wrong with you?

288
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,150
You killed so many people
just a few days ago.

289
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,600
Just now, you said
Bing Guanzi was the murderer.

290
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,320
But now both Bing Guanzi
and Pang Haowei are dead.

291
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,470
It seems you're the murderer.

292
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,720
Nonsense.

293
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,350
Huo Xiaoxie has been with us all along.

294
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,960
We're all suspects now.

295
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,720
If you have any questions, just ask me.

296
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,990
I have nothing to ask

297
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,560
or answer.

298
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,150
Liang.

299
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,390
You'd better follow us at this time.

300
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,800
It's better for everyone.

301
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,630
Ruoyun.

302
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,230
You've fought with the killer before.

303
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,320
Do you remember anything?

304
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,440
Looks like a man.

305
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,560
Very strong.

306
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,920
Very agile.

307
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,200
Who's been alone around here?

308
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,990
I was alone.

309
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,990
I was with San Qifeng and Seven.

310
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,230
I was with Red Clown.

311
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,680
That's strange.

312
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,150
How could the killer attack Ruoyun

313
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,560
and kill Bing Guanzi and Pang Haowei

314
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,110
within such a short time?

315
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,750
No.

316
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,230
I think it's a ghost.

317
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,270
Shut up!

318
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,270
I think

319
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,920
someone is lying.

320
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,620
[Yun]

321
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,110
There's a "Yun" character.

322
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,440
Ruoyun.

323
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,470
You did it?

324
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,510
The name that Pang Haowei wrote

325
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,840
before he died must be the killer's.

326
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,150
I was just with the three of them

327
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,080
and heard Bing Guanzi's screams.

328
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,230
Who knows if you have any accomplices?

329
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,040
Ruoyun.

330
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,080
Why would he write your name?

331
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,270
Maybe

332
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,510
someone knows my identity is fake.

333
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,390
My chance came from someone else.

334
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,110
Mr. Yan knows all about it.

335
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,350
I just don't need to tell you.

336
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,350
Mr. Yan isn't here anyway.

337
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,560
You can make up whatever you want.

338
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,390
You'd better make it clear.

339
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,960
Who gave you this chance?

340
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,990
And why did he or she give you
such a good chance?

341
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,600
Tell me.

342
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,510
If you don't tell me today,

343
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,440
you're the murderer.

344
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,470
In order to get a chance

345
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,040
to participate
in the Three Firegate Tasks,

346
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,440
I promised to marry

347
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,750
the Master of Cloud Fall Peak.

348
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,390
Master of Cloud Fall Peak?

349
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,110
Isn't he over 60 years old?

350
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,150
Stop.

351
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:41,800
Where are you going?

352
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,320
How dare you stop me?

353
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,110
Everyone suspects you're the murderer.

354
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,720
I promise she'll stay

355
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,630
with me from now on.

356
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,040
If more people die,

357
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,150
she is not the murderer.

358
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,680
Huo Xiaoxie, what are you looking for?

359
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,560
I'm looking for the murder weapon.

360
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:14,960
How are you sure

361
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,230
the murder weapon is here?

362
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,870
The murderer must have hidden

363
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,110
the murder weapon and clothes

364
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,230
after the killing.

365
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,270
This is right in the middle
of where the murders took place.

366
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,720
So the murder weapon must be around.

367
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,990
But there's no one

368
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,040
among the men who acted alone.

369
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,270
We've been going around here three times

370
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:35,870
and haven't found anything.

371
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,200
Let's stop.

372
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:40,920
We'll do it tomorrow.

373
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,470
The murderer will choose
a different place tomorrow.

374
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,510
We can't keep searching like this.

375
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,320
He'll leave us some clues.

376
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:53,960
Let's find a place to rest first.

377
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:03,840
Zedao.

378
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,560
Let's rest here.

379
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,470
I'll go check around.

380
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,150
Call me if you need anything.

381
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,870
I don't like the look of him.

382
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,390
He doesn't seem like a good guy.

383
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:24,800
Don't say that.

384
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,440
In Fengtian,

385
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,600
he was the only one
who respected punks like me.

386
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,110
He's obviously your love rival

387
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,150
but puts on that good face.

388
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,630
Don't you think he's hypocritical?

389
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,960
If someone had dared to hurt my woman,

390
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,840
I'd have dismantled him long ago.

391
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,560
Thank you.

392
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,230
But you heard it just now.

393
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,110
Don't have any more illusions.

394
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,110
Now we're in the same boat.

395
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:52,990
I'm going to bed.

396
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,560
Be safe.

397
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,920
She and I will kill the two guards.

398
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,390
You guys go to the front room.

399
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

400
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:55,630
Let's go!

401
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,040
Yan Jingtian.

402
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,350
It's time

403
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,150
to settle a score with.

404
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,470
Great.

405
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,350
I'm looking forward

406
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,200
to fighting you.

407
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,110
This is for my brother.

408
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,600
If I wasn't injured,

409
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,720
you guys wouldn't match me.

410
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,140
Dark Dragon Gang
has received the message.

411
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,720
They'll be here tomorrow morning.

412
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,510
None of you will survive.

413
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,440
They've set up a crystal line.

414
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,040
Pretty vigilant.

415
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,630
It's the scales we want.

416
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,990
We can't afford to kill anyone.

417
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,470
The three of us can't beat four guys.

418
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,870
It's okay.

419
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,270
A good hunter

420
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,680
has to be patient.

421
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,470
We can still wait.

422
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:43,490
Let's go.

423
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,150
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

424
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,840
Can you not leave me?

425
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,920
What I can do now

426
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,350
is to leave you.

427
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,440
Forget about me.

428
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,350
No.

429
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,630
Huo Xiaoxie.

430
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,920
Huo Xiaoxie.

431
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,320
Don't go.

432
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,320
Miss.

433
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,680
Miss.

434
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,150
Miss, I'll bring you some more medicine.

435
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,750
It's so easy.

436
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:24,840
Oh, no!

437
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,990
If you touch her,

438
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,680
I'll destroy your sect.

439
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,600
Girl.

440
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,390
Hand over the scale now!

441
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,870
No way.

442
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,040
Then, don't blame us for being rude.

443
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,270
Are you OK?

444
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,200
I'm fine.

445
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:06,960
What?

446
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,230
Still want to fight?

447
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,390
As long as I have breath,

448
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,990
you can't get past here.

449
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:13,750
Girl.

450
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,720
Hand it over now.

451
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,600
I'll let you two go.

452
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:26,920
Girl.

453
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,350
It's up to you.

454
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,720
I don't want to kill anyone.

455
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,720
Let's go.

456
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,600
Let's go.

457
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,800
Why did you give them the scale?

458
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,150
Nothing is worth more than a life.

459
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,750
I'm sorry.

460
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,470
What happened?

461
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,990
I fell for their ruse.

462
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,040
Liang Ba took the scale

463
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,800
that Ruoyun found.

464
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,470
I'll get it back for you.

465
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:01,960
Zedao.

466
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:05,680
Are you alright?

467
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,320
We finally got the scale.

468
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,350
Let's stay here

469
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,990
for the rest of the day.

470
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,750
Stay here?

471
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,440
Yes.

472
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,470
It's got a great view.

473
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,750
We'll know if someone attacks us.

474
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,800
Even if someone tries
to take the scale,

475
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,800
the three of us can deal
with them together.

476
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,350
OK.

477
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,080
Why don't we grab some more?

478
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,720
There are only four of these scales.

479
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,040
It's not easy to get one.

480
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,080
Even the three of us together

481
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,230
can't grab the other three.

482
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,990
Then who will go to the third level?

483
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,750
Where are you going?

484
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,110
Sorry about yesterday.

485
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,200
Thank you for taking care of me.

486
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,800
I'll get your scale back for you.

487
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,430
I'll tell you a secret.

488
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,910
What secret?

489
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,840
The Tomb Beast really exists.

490
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,840
The scale just appears with it

491
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,160
and it's accompanied by a red light.

492
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,710
So it's real.

493
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,190
I checked the time.

494
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,600
It happens once every six hours.

495
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,230
That means

496
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,400
we need to wait

497
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,750
for the red light for six hours.

498
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,160
There is one more thing.

499
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,900
Holy Cauldron must never be gotten

500
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,230
by Mr. Zhang Si's people.

501
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,270
It's San Qifeng.

502
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,840
Said he'd team up to get through,

503
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,360
but he stole the scale.

504
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,040
Seven!

505
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,950
Go find this scum for me!

506
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,400
Where is he?

507
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,670
I've been looking for you

508
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,080
and didn't expect you to hide
in the hall.

509
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,840
You?

510
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,360
What do you want?

511
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,040
You stole my friend's stuff.

512
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,640
Give it back to her.

513
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,750
Go to San Qifeng.

514
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,400
He's the one who took it.

515
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,120
He took something so important

516
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,430
from you so easily?

517
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,270
Mr. Zheng.

518
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,120
You're a smart man.

519
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,670
If I still have the scale,

520
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,400
why would I go back into the cave?

521
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,670
If you don't believe me,

522
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,950
search me.

523
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,910
Come on.

524
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:42,800
Really?

525
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,470
Yes.

526
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,880
I'm starving.

527
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,650
If I'd known this would happen,

528
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,710
I wouldn't have come.

529
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,840
It would have been better to stay home

530
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,160
and inherit my dad's position
as the head of the family.

531
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,880
Shut up, you loser!

532
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,470
How could your father
have such a lousy son like you?

533
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,880
Are you still a man?

534
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,270
Who?

535
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,600
Red Clown.

536
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,840
Gentlemen.

537
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,750
Can we work together?

538
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,230
Aren't you with Yan Chong?

539
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,510
What are you doing?

540
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,510
We were supposed to work together,

541
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,120
but that guy
was just courting Miss Flower.

542
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,640
I don't think

543
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
that's a good idea.

544
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,040
We can work together.

545
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,080
But let's get one thing straight.

546
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,750
The three of us will compete fairly

547
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,710
when we find the scale.

548
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,740
What do you think?

549
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,510
No problem.

550
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,320
Then, a promise

551
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,360
is a promise.

552
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,190
Who is it?

553
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:51,710
Someone's there.

554
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:52,640
Let's go.

555
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:53,940
Let's go.

556
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,430
Do you think it's haunted?

557
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,670
Could this be the lair of the Beast?

558
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,360
Shut up!

559
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,560
Or I'll dismember you.

560
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,430
But I'm just scared.

561
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,800
I can't help it.

562
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,230
Come and take a look.

563
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,270
What's this?

564
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,040
The hoofprints of a monster.

565
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,270
Seven.

566
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,120
You stay here and keep watch.

567
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,170
Only me?

568
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:35,610
Let's go.

569
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,270
Let's go.

570
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,880
San Qifeng, come out!

571
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,710
Do you think

572
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,080
you can hide forever?

573
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,950
Give me the scale.

574
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,040
Come out.

575
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,800
Red Clown.

576
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,190
Who's there?

577
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,560
Who's there?

578
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:06,750
Come out.

579
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,080
Come out.

580
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,120
Seven!

581
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,340
Seven, help me!

582
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:14,840
Young master.

583
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,040
Seven!

584
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,320
Young master.

585
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,320
Hold on.

586
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,320
Seven, help me!

587
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,250
Hold on.

588
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,600
Don't let go!

589
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,510
Seven!

590
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,840
Seven, help me!

591
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,710
A ghost!

592
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,320
A ghost!

593
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,040
It's the same as before.

594
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,080
It's the same knife.

595
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,190
Seven.

596
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,420
You really didn't see anyone?

597
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,320
No, I didn't.

598
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,510
It's a ghost. It must be a ghost.

599
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,430
If not, it must be San Qifeng.

600
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,080
He's the one who stole the scale.

601
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,120
He's afraid of retaliation.

602
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,360
So...

603
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,430
So...

604
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:01,970
When Bing Guanzi died,

605
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,040
you were with Sanqifeng?

606
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,600
Yes.

607
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:05,950
Yes.

608
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,270
Yes.

609
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,800
I stole the scale,

610
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,710
but I didn't kill anyone.

611
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,600
And I didn't break any rules.

612
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,120
You have to come back with us.

613
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:16,950
No way.

614
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,820
Don't think I don't know

615
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,750
what you're thinking.

616
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,430
I have the scale now.

617
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,570
You all want it.

618
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,190
San Qifeng.

619
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,840
It's not him.

620
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,360
That guy

621
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,400
wasn't him.

622
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,370
You say it was him

623
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,160
and then you say it wasn't.

624
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,090
Did you get a good look at him?

625
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,120
Yes, I did.

626
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,190
It's definitely a monster.

627
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,430
That's right.

628
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:44,990
It must be a monster.

629
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,990
It's a conspiracy!

630
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,230
It's a conspiracy!

631
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,840
It's the five element families' trick.

632
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,950
I quit.

633
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,120
- I quit.
- I'm going to San Qifeng.

634
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,660
Ghost!

635
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,270
What are you looking for?

636
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,670
Remember what Seven said?

637
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,080
That monster

638
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,640
suddenly appeared behind Liang Ba.

639
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,560
Don't scare me.

640
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,840
What monster?

641
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,750
Did he not see it clearly in the dark?

642
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,800
But Liang Ba was holding a fire,

643
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,080
so he should have seen someone
passing by.

644
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,220
Seven's scream

645
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,320
drew everyone's attention.

646
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,990
So the killer had to take off
his disguise quickly

647
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,430
and hide the murder weapon
and the disguise.

648
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,400
If I'm not mistaken,

649
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,360
the murderer must

650
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,990
have moved the weapon

651
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,430
and the disguise here.

652
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,560
Let's look for it.

653
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,270
