1
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:17,662
I wonder how many people in the world love themselves.

2
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:24,836
I feel as though I've been stuck in a long, endless tunnel.

3
00:01:29,942 --> 00:01:31,242
Like I said...

4
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:32,577
isn't this strange?!

5
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:33,444
What is?

6
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:35,246
These estimates are definitely proof.

7
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:36,948
It's impossible to reach the delivery deadline.

8
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:39,117
Is there any point taking this job?

9
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:40,618
You never know until you try it.

10
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,252
But

11
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:42,387
No "Buts”!

12
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:45,256
You're all talk and no action.

13
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:47,025
All you do is make complaints!

14
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:50,628
Do you know what we call people like you?

15
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:53,231
A useless human being!

16
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,141
Are you running away, Kozuka?

17
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:07,445
Kozuka!

18
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:48,486
Mitsuomi!

19
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:51,155
Mitsuomi!

20
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:58,329
Mitsuomi!

21
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,044
You're Mitsuomi?

22
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:14,278
Yes?

23
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,481
I knew it!

24
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:18,483
I immediately recognized you!

25
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:20,618
You haven't changed at all!

26
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,053
Uh...

27
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:24,722
You seem a little refined.

28
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,058
You have become so Tokyo-like.

29
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:28,626
Well...

30
00:03:30,028 --> 00:03:31,996
Heading to your family's house, right?

31
00:03:32,064 --> 00:03:32,630
What?
Right.

32
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,233
Uh, wait!

33
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:44,242
Well, get in.

34
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:47,345
There's no need to hesitate.

35
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:47,845
Okay?

36
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:49,547
That's not it.

37
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:50,314
Quick, quick!

38
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:51,582
You must be tired, right?

39
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,517
But...

40
00:03:52,518 --> 00:03:53,718
No worries, no worries!

41
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:02,527
How long has it been since you've last visited?

42
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:05,396
Seven or eight years ago.

43
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:07,832
Since then, a lot has changed.

44
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,734
Well, not so much.

45
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:10,701
Oh.

46
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:14,038
We got an AEON on the other side of the highway.

47
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:15,173
I see.

48
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:17,074
The other day, for the first time in my life...

49
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,010
I went to Yoshinoya (Beef bowl restaurant).

50
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:20,878
It was so good!

51
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:22,246
I see.

52
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:40,031
Hello?

53
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:42,033
Oh, Mitsuomi?

54
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:43,568
Mom, where are you now?

55
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:46,270
I'm stuck at a Women’s association meeting.

56
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:48,639
I had asked Yamato to pick you up instead.

57
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,308
Yeah, I've already met him.

58
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:51,742
Actually I've already got on.

59
00:04:51,743 --> 00:04:53,311
Actually, what? Who is he?

60
00:04:53,312 --> 00:04:54,412
Yamato Kumai.

61
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,647
He's the son of Grandpa Kumai.

62
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,549
Grandpa Kumai?

63
00:04:58,717 --> 00:05:00,151
He had a son?

64
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,053
He's the same age as you.

65
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:03,621
Get along with him, will you.

66
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:04,388
What?

67
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:06,624
Wait! Hello? Mom?

68
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:10,094
Sorry, I made you wait.

69
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,735
Are you Grandpa Kumai’s son?

70
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:19,637
Yeah.

71
00:05:19,638 --> 00:05:21,339
So you're...

72
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,808
I'm his adopted son.

73
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:26,410
Oh, I see.

74
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:30,081
Nice to meet you, Mitsuomi.

75
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,984
Well, let's go.

76
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:34,418
Alright.

77
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:43,160
Kumai?

78
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:45,196
You can call me Yamato.

79
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:47,999
This is the first time we met, right?

80
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,700
Yeah.

81
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:54,105
I came here after you had left for Tokyo.

82
00:05:54,373 --> 00:05:55,873
Are you familiar with the Kumai's?

83
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,608
Too familiar.

84
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:00,544
Because they're friendly.

85
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:04,949
When I first met your Mom...

86
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,718
she couldn't stop talking about you.

87
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:09,287
What?

88
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:16,727
I've always wanted to meet you and get to know you.

89
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:20,364
You're the real Mitsuomi.

90
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,034
I finally got to meet you.

91
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:25,403
Aren't you a little too excited

92
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:29,507
Even the way you talk sounds very Tokyo-like.

93
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:31,976
That's so cool.

94
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:02,073
Dear, dinner's ready.

95
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:04,909
Dear, dinner's ready.

96
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,244
Hurry up and eat.

97
00:07:25,397 --> 00:07:27,231
What a surprise.

98
00:07:27,232 --> 00:07:30,634
Mitsuomi came back; it's a happy occasion

99
00:07:32,804 --> 00:07:34,438
Would you like some hot sake?

100
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,239
Yeah.

101
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,874
Okay.

102
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,112
He came back because he got fired.

103
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,080
How's that a happy occasion?

104
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:45,449
I quit on my own.

105
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:47,952
Don't go making assumptions.

106
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:54,625
Don't go thinking it's tough living on your own
or how irrational it feels for you.

107
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:58,496
That's what it's like to have a job.

108
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:02,833
So, what are your plans now

109
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:05,302
Any jobs in mind?

110
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:09,440
I could take over the family business.

111
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:13,644
It would be great if there's an inheritor after dad, right?

112
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:16,580
I'll take over it.

113
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:19,950
Besides, there's only me.

114
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:25,589
Do you...

115
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:28,492
remember what you said ten years ago?

116
00:08:28,894 --> 00:08:30,561
What?

117
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:33,330
"It's so boring here in the countryside!

118
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:36,400
Even if I die, I don't want to deal with furniture!”

119
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:40,137
That's the last thing you said and left this house.

120
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:41,605
Even though I said that...

121
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:45,376
Don't say something on a whim
because things didn't work out for you in Tokyo!

122
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:46,277
Dear.

123
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:47,378
What the hell?

124
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:48,379
I'm being serious!

125
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,015
I could tell by your face whether you're serious or not!

126
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:58,856
You'll eventually become tired and run away.

127
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:03,694
I have no intention of leaving the business to you.

128
00:09:05,564 --> 00:09:09,033
There's no need for you to be the next inheritor.

129
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:05,356
Good morning.

130
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,924
Good morning.

131
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:09,593
What's for breakfast?

132
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:11,629
It's already eleven.

133
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:14,899
Then, lunch.

134
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,133
Okay, okay.

135
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,768
Wait just a minute.

136
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:25,276
As we continue, here is the latest news for Chikuma.

137
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:28,112
How long are you going to continue being sloppy?

138
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:31,949
It's been ten days since you've come back.

139
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:37,721
Are you serious about continuing the family business?

140
00:10:37,956 --> 00:10:40,658
Go and apologize to your father.

141
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:42,226
Yeah.

142
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:44,995
So, you're not eager, after all.

143
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:47,298
I am.

144
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,099
Jeez.

145
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:52,269
I don't want you to become a NEET.

146
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:22,760
Oh, you're Mitsuomi.

147
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:24,928
It's been a while.

148
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,830
So, you came back.

149
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,565
Uh, yes!

150
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:51,889
Mitsuomi.

151
00:12:51,923 --> 00:12:52,756
Mister.

152
00:12:53,391 --> 00:12:54,725
Here's what you asked for.

153
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:55,993
Yes, thank you.

154
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:58,929
What are you reading?

155
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:02,366
Are you looking for a job?

156
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:03,734
Uh, why are you here?

157
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:05,369
Delivery.

158
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,137
Oh, I see.

159
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:09,473
See ya.

160
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:13,310
You came back to take over your Dad's business, right?

161
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:15,913
That's none of your business, Kumai.

162
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,282
Just call me Yamato.

163
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:20,417
Why don't you come over to my place?

164
00:13:20,452 --> 00:13:21,318
Huh?

165
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:23,120
After hearing that you've come back,

166
00:13:23,154 --> 00:13:25,055
Grandpa wants to meet you.

167
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,957
Some other time.

168
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:28,092
Come over.

169
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:29,493
What..what's with you?

170
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:30,994
Come on, come on, come on.

171
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:32,162
I don't want to.

172
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,130
Come over!
What the hell?

173
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:35,566
Let go!

174
00:13:37,102 --> 00:13:37,668
Hey.

175
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:39,269
Hey!

176
00:13:39,337 --> 00:13:41,105
Get off!

177
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:52,516
Huh?

178
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:54,084
What's wrong, Mitsuomi?

179
00:13:54,753 --> 00:13:56,086
Nothing.

180
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,659
Huh?

181
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:04,328
Grandpa?

182
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:05,863
What?

183
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,931
What do you mean you're leaving?

184
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:10,100
Now, now! Calm down!

185
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:13,937
I don't understand you.

186
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:15,139
Grandpa!

187
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:16,106
What's going on?
Yamato!

188
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,342
(Speaking Vietnamese)

189
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:20,277
(Speaking Vietnamese)
What?

190
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:21,712
Guego, calm down.

191
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:23,180
Guego, wait!

192
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:24,381
This is not what we talked about.

193
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:26,350
You said you'll be here until spring.

194
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:28,786
I beg you! Please reconsider your decision!

195
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:29,553
Please.

196
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:32,322
I'm sorry, thank you.

197
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:33,223
What?

198
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,391
Guego!
Wait!

199
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,393
Guego!

200
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:42,866
Technical intern?

201
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:47,004
He came from Vietnam to work here.

202
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:50,140
We teach him a lot of things around here.

203
00:14:50,308 --> 00:14:54,478
Because it's cheaper to hire foreign workers, right?

204
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:56,380
We don't do that here.

205
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:58,315
That's my seat.

206
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,517
Oh, my bad.

207
00:15:00,585 --> 00:15:03,420
Wow, it's been a while, Mitsuomi!

208
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:06,056
It's been a while seeing you too.

209
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:09,026
I have no intention to see Grandma yet.

210
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:11,495
I'm home!

211
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:13,096
Oh, how did it go?

212
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:17,534
Guego is going to back to Vietnam no matter what.

213
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:20,938
He became homesick because his girlfriend misses him.

214
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:23,574
That's my seat.

215
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:25,609
Oh, what the hell...

216
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:27,711
This is a problem.

217
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:30,914
It's nearing the time for greenhouse labour.

218
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:31,715
Greenhouse
Yeah.

219
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:34,051
Mandarins and strawberries.

220
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:36,119
It's the busiest time of the year.

221
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:39,189
It will be too difficult with only I and Yamato.

222
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:41,625
That must be tough.

223
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,062
Oh, Mitsuomi, help us out!

224
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:46,463
Huh?

225
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:48,098
You're looking for a job, right?

226
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:49,600
Is that true, Mitsuomi?

227
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:50,300
No, I...

228
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:53,871
Didn't you come back to take over your father's business?

229
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:54,638
No, I...

230
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,040
It will be a huge help if you help us!

231
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,976
I don't even have a license, so I can't drive

232
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:01,545
So, I definitely won't be helpful!

233
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:02,980
That's not true.

234
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:03,714
Right?
Yeah.

235
00:16:04,282 --> 00:16:06,116
But, I've never done farming!

236
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:07,818
In fact, I'm an indoor person!

237
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:09,286
It's alright!

238
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,287
I'll teach you.

239
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:11,922
It's okay right, Grandpa?
Yeah.

240
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:15,092
I'm okay if Mitsuomi says so.

241
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:17,060
I didn't say I want to do it!

242
00:16:17,128 --> 00:16:19,563
Let's do it together, Mitsuomi!

243
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:21,632
But...

244
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,799
That's great!

245
00:16:23,735 --> 00:16:25,602
I'm so relieved.

246
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,303
Morning.

247
00:16:59,671 --> 00:17:01,772
Oh, good morning, Mitsuomi!

248
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,839
He came.

249
00:17:02,941 --> 00:17:05,309
Late on your first day?

250
00:17:05,543 --> 00:17:07,811
I still woke up early.

251
00:17:08,212 --> 00:17:10,781
I came because you guys asked me.

252
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:12,182
Stop your complaining!

253
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,651
You promised to do the job!

254
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:17,054
Now, now, now!
You guys made me promise.

255
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:19,690
Here Mitsuomi! Your change of clothes.

256
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:20,557
Thanks.

257
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,192
Looking forward to working with you.

258
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:56,660
Oh, Mitsuomi!

259
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:58,362
It suits you!

260
00:17:58,563 --> 00:17:59,696
Right, Grandpa?

261
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:00,831
Yeah.

262
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:04,167
Alright, I'll let you help me here.

263
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:06,003
Alright.

264
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:09,339
Cut the branch that's close to the mandarin.

265
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:10,874
Okay?

266
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:14,845
If you cut the branch with the mandarin it will leave a mark on it...

267
00:18:14,912 --> 00:18:16,380
so, we won't be able to ship them.

268
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:18,048
So, be careful with them.

269
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:19,249
Okay.

270
00:18:19,384 --> 00:18:20,283
Got it?

271
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:21,952
You got it?

272
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:24,121
I got it.

273
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:29,526
Mitsuomi!

274
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:31,728
I told you to cut closer to the branch.

275
00:18:32,397 --> 00:18:33,730
Actually...

276
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:35,899
why can't we pick them like this?

277
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:38,568
Oh!

278
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,804
We can't sell them like that.

279
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:42,572
Hey, hey! We're counting on you!

280
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,381
We'll avoid picking green and crooked shaped ones.

281
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:53,917
We'll pick fifteen nicely shaped ones.

282
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:55,452
That will be one pack.

283
00:18:55,753 --> 00:18:58,989
This time we'll gently snap them like this.

284
00:18:59,157 --> 00:18:59,656
Okay.
Gently.

285
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:01,558
I got it.

286
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,627
Gently, Mitsuomi.

287
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:05,562
I got it.

288
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,263
Okay.

289
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:07,330
In the pack...

290
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:09,266
from the bottom we'll add them in twos three times.

291
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:11,101
Then threes three times.

292
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:18,909
Oh, Mitsuomi!

293
00:19:18,943 --> 00:19:20,577
Be more gentle.

294
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:21,978
Snap.

295
00:19:22,146 --> 00:19:22,979
Okay.

296
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,014
We're selling these.

297
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:25,482
Be gentle.

298
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:26,983
Got it.

299
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:28,485
Like this.

300
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:31,788
Whoa, a bee!

301
00:19:31,823 --> 00:19:33,323
Why is there a bee here?

302
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:36,426
The bees bring out the shapes in the strawberries.

303
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:37,127
There's more here too!

304
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:38,295
Bees! Bees! Bees!

305
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:39,863
Are you scared of bees, Mitsuomi?

306
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:45,102
My back hurts.

307
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:47,771
How long are we doing this?

308
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:50,006
We'll cover all the way until there.

309
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:51,141
What?

310
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,776
We still have a long way to go.

311
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,644
A long way to go.

312
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:56,947
Hang in there, Mitsuomi.

313
00:20:03,554 --> 00:20:05,555
Alright, we'll finish here today.

314
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:06,456
Yeah.

315
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:09,793
I'm so tired!

316
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:11,495
This is hard work!

317
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:13,563
Pathetic, we've only done this much.

318
00:20:13,564 --> 00:20:15,165
Mitsuomi, are you okay?

319
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,000
Ow, my back hurts.

320
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:19,035
Good work.

321
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:21,138
Yes, good work.

322
00:20:21,205 --> 00:20:23,039
Oh, you picked a lot.

323
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:24,174
It hurts!

324
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,850
You're not exhausted at all.

325
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:36,186
I'm used to it.

326
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:38,722
Hey.
Yeah?

327
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:40,991
When is your day-off?

328
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:42,692
My day-off?

329
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:45,829
If you don't have a day-off, your body will be all worn out.

330
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:48,565
That may be impossible for a while.

331
00:20:50,101 --> 00:20:52,502
Have you heard of work-style reforms?

332
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,170
Oh...

333
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:55,605
After the greenhouse work is done, I could relax, but...

334
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:58,542
right now, it's the busiest time of the year.

335
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:09,352
See you tomorrow.

336
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:13,123
As if I'll go

337
00:21:36,247 --> 00:21:37,881
Ugh!

338
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:40,784
Jeez!

339
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:46,790
Morning.

340
00:21:47,925 --> 00:21:49,159
Oh.

341
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:50,227
Huh?

342
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:53,463
I was about to give up but he actually came.

343
00:21:53,598 --> 00:21:55,565
See, I told you he'll show up.

344
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,467
You're on dinner duty, Grandpa.

345
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:59,069
I lost, it can't be helped.

346
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:01,004
You guys had a bet on me?

347
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:03,106
Mitsuomi, it's your fault!

348
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,907
Huh?

349
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:05,809
Mitsuomi, thank you for coming.

350
00:22:05,843 --> 00:22:07,744
Don't toy with me.

351
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:09,813
Well, let's start working.

352
00:22:09,914 --> 00:22:12,082
Mitsuomi, we'll be counting on you again.

353
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:14,251
Okay.

354
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:22,659
Hang in there, Mitsuomi.

355
00:22:22,693 --> 00:22:24,094
After this, we'll do the deliveries.

356
00:22:24,095 --> 00:22:24,961
Okay.

357
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:26,529
Grandpa, we're off to do deliveries.

358
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:27,964
Okay, I'm counting on you both.

359
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:40,043
Oh, if it isn't Yamato.

360
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:43,780
Oh, Aunt Obotaro.

361
00:22:43,848 --> 00:22:46,449
Your mandarins are so delicious.

362
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:48,051
I bought them today.

363
00:22:48,152 --> 00:22:50,120
Thank you for always buying them.

364
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:51,288
Who's he?

365
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,522
Right.

366
00:22:52,657 --> 00:22:54,824
He's helping us with the greenhouse.

367
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:56,359
I'm Kozuka.

368
00:22:56,394 --> 00:22:58,528
Oh, Kozuka’s son.

369
00:22:58,696 --> 00:23:01,364
Weren't you working in Tokyo?

370
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:04,167
I came back here last month.

371
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:07,404
I see, so you're finally taking over the family business.

372
00:23:07,505 --> 00:23:09,072
Looking forward to it, right?

373
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,740
See you.

374
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:11,708
Take care.
Thank you.

375
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:18,348
I wonder why everyone tells me the same thing.

376
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:19,883
Huh?

377
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:22,085
Like I'm going to inherit after my Dad...

378
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,888
or I came back to take over the family business.

379
00:23:25,423 --> 00:23:28,191
They're expecting a lot from you, Mitsuomi.

380
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,327
Just so you know...

381
00:23:30,394 --> 00:23:34,064
my Dad doesn't want me to take over the business.

382
00:23:34,532 --> 00:23:36,066
Why?

383
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:38,902
It's nothing.

384
00:23:38,936 --> 00:23:40,170
Huh?

385
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:48,178
Hello? Kumai delivery!

386
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,913
Oh, Yamato.

387
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:51,915
Oh, today's your shift?

388
00:23:51,949 --> 00:23:52,916
Yeah.

389
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:54,718
Oh, this is Ueda.

390
00:23:54,785 --> 00:23:56,052
My buddy from high school.

391
00:23:56,587 --> 00:23:57,620
Ueda, this is...

392
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,189
Oh, I know you.

393
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:03,259
My Dad told me the furniture dealer's son is back.

394
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:08,765
You came back to take over the family business, right?

395
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,633
Why are you helping Yamato?

396
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:11,768
How's your dad?

397
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:12,736
He's in Matsumoto.
What?

398
00:24:13,471 --> 00:24:15,705
Somebody named Tenkakashi is here.

399
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,409
Oh, your Dad does like music.

400
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,046
He's pushing all the work onto me so he could play around.

401
00:24:23,147 --> 00:24:25,949
It doesn't hurt for you to tend the store once in a while.

402
00:24:25,983 --> 00:24:27,550
Why, you!

403
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:30,120
Could you not talk like I slack off from work!

404
00:24:30,154 --> 00:24:30,787
But, it's true.
Why, you!

405
00:24:31,455 --> 00:24:33,123
Yamato!

406
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:34,424
What?

407
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:37,994
Oh, could you place them there?

408
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:41,464
Why you! We'll not accept your mandarins in our store.

409
00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:43,233
Stop it!

410
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:44,901
Will you stop it!

411
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:48,671
Whoa, Put me down, you stupid!

412
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:50,006
Ow!

413
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:53,943
Hey, what'll we do with the class reunion?

414
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:55,178
You're organizing it?

415
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:55,979
Yeah.

416
00:24:56,147 --> 00:24:58,948
It will be a problem if it's not lively while I'm in charge.

417
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,785
Then, I'll contact as many people as I can.

418
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,088
Yamato! You're a nice guy!

419
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:08,258
We're buddies after all.

420
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:09,092
See you later.

421
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:10,326
Yeah.

422
00:25:27,978 --> 00:25:28,845
We're back!

423
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:29,846
Oh.

424
00:25:32,516 --> 00:25:34,117
I'm tired.

425
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:36,352
Take a bath and warm yourselves up.

426
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:37,620
Okay.

427
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:53,903
Hey! What the hell?

428
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:54,737
It's alright!

429
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,139
We're both men!

430
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:57,507
Don't come in!

431
00:25:57,575 --> 00:25:58,641
It's so cold!

432
00:26:01,912 --> 00:26:04,747
You're surprisingly muscular.

433
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:06,683
What?

434
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,184
Really?

435
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:09,352
Yeah.

436
00:26:09,587 --> 00:26:12,722
It's because I'm always lifting heavy things.

437
00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:19,095
Why did you decide to do it?

438
00:26:19,196 --> 00:26:20,930
What?

439
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:23,733
It's tough, this job.

440
00:26:23,868 --> 00:26:26,870
Did Grandpa ask you to take over?

441
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:29,772
I wanted to do it.

442
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:33,576
There are tons of other jobs.

443
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:39,082
I was raised in an orphanage.

444
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,950
What?

445
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:44,687
Grandpa asked me to be a part of the family.

446
00:26:44,755 --> 00:26:47,457
When I graduated high school, I became his adopted son.

447
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:51,895
I love Grandpa.

448
00:26:52,062 --> 00:26:53,696
I respect him.

449
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:58,535
That's why I wanted to do the same job as him.

450
00:26:58,903 --> 00:27:02,038
I wanted to get more work from him.

451
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:06,476
Huh?

452
00:27:07,611 --> 00:27:09,646
Oh, nothing.

453
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:11,447
How long are you both in there?

454
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:12,615
Meals ready!

455
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,750
Got it!
Got it!

456
00:27:54,992 --> 00:27:56,159
Mitsuomi.

457
00:27:57,027 --> 00:27:58,094
Yeah?

458
00:27:58,662 --> 00:28:00,396
Your snaps have improved.

459
00:28:01,298 --> 00:28:02,665
For real?

460
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:05,902
The mandarins are becoming more lovely.

461
00:28:08,172 --> 00:28:10,206
Well, it was worth it...

462
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:12,842
betting on teaching a helping hand.

463
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,844
A helping hand?

464
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:17,513
It hasn't been too long since you've started.

465
00:28:17,615 --> 00:28:19,716
It's my words of gratitude.

466
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,619
If you get carried away, you'll fall.

467
00:28:22,653 --> 00:28:24,387
It's okay; it's okay.

468
00:28:24,455 --> 00:28:25,288
Ah! Whoa!
Mitsuomi!

469
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,557
Y-You okay, Mitsuomi

470
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,625
Thank you.

471
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:30,059
Be careful!

472
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:31,861
That was close.

473
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:34,197
What did I tell you.

474
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:39,469
Here we go.

475
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:42,405
Here we go.

476
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:45,375
Alright.

477
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:50,146
Try it.

478
00:28:58,856 --> 00:29:00,556
It's so good!

479
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:02,325
Right!

480
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,594
Mitsuomi.

481
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:09,499
Let's do our best tomorrow.

482
00:29:12,403 --> 00:29:13,336
Yeah.

483
00:29:26,216 --> 00:29:27,083
Alright.

484
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:38,294
And here I thought you were so annoying.

485
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,347
Hello? Mitsuomi?

486
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:34,417
We'll take a break today.

487
00:30:35,753 --> 00:30:36,686
What?

488
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,689
Grandpa has a farmers cooperative meeting.

489
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,959
Then, we could both continue the work.

490
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:46,963
I'll have to pick up the repaired farming equipment from Matsumoto.

491
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:48,998
I see.

492
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,768
Mitsuomi, take a break once in a while.

493
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:53,469
Well, bye.

494
00:31:29,907 --> 00:31:32,241
Don't touch it.

495
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:06,576
Is it your day-off?

496
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:13,749
Lightly salted, huh?

497
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:16,252
Consomme is better.

498
00:32:16,587 --> 00:32:18,855
That'll be 400 yen.

499
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:22,625
Mitsuomi,

500
00:32:23,126 --> 00:32:25,528
What's your relationship with Yamato?

501
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:27,930
Nothing.

502
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:29,799
I'm just helping him out.

503
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,034
You still seem to get along with him.

504
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:37,139
Hey!

505
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:41,711
Should I tell you about his secret?

506
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,946
His secret?

507
00:32:44,114 --> 00:32:46,015
Do you wanna know?

508
00:32:50,153 --> 00:32:51,420
Not really.

509
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:53,256
I don't want to know.

510
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:57,493
Thank you for coming!

511
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:09,739
Hey.

512
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,941
What's Ueda like?

513
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:12,975
Ueda?

514
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:13,743
Yeah.

515
00:33:13,777 --> 00:33:15,011
Why?

516
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,246
No, I just felt like asking.

517
00:33:19,016 --> 00:33:20,816
He's a nice guy.

518
00:33:21,451 --> 00:33:22,685
I see.

519
00:33:22,986 --> 00:33:26,989
During high school, we were always in the same class.

520
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:29,258
Out of all my friends left in this town...

521
00:33:29,293 --> 00:33:32,094
He's definitely the one who gets me.

522
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:38,034
We bought clothes and hung out together.

523
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:41,771
Sometimes I don't know what he's thinking but...

524
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:45,308
he's a really cool guy.

525
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:48,444
I see.

526
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:51,280
What?

527
00:33:51,548 --> 00:33:54,216
Mitsuomi, are you in a bad mood?

528
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:56,218
I'm not.

529
00:33:56,353 --> 00:33:58,120
Why are you angry?

530
00:33:58,221 --> 00:33:59,989
I'm not angry.

531
00:34:01,058 --> 00:34:02,191
You're angry.

532
00:34:02,225 --> 00:34:04,160
Hey, you stupid! Don't touch me!

533
00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:05,728
Cheer up.

534
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:08,998
Come on! come on!

535
00:34:09,032 --> 00:34:10,166
I'm not angry!

536
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:10,833
You sure are!

537
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:12,034
I'm not angry!

538
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:13,169
Your face is angry!

539
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:16,405
Grandpa?

540
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,207
What was that?

541
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:20,009
Grandpa?

542
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,246
Grandpa?!

543
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,083
Grandpa!

544
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,517
Are you okay?

545
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:29,418
Grandpa!

546
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:30,720
Where abouts did you hit yourself?

547
00:34:30,754 --> 00:34:31,554
Your foot?

548
00:34:31,588 --> 00:34:32,888
Did you hit your foot?

549
00:34:34,024 --> 00:34:35,257
Mitsuomi!

550
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:36,258
Call an ambulance!

551
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,426
Right.

552
00:34:37,561 --> 00:34:38,828
Hang in there.

553
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:41,897
Are you hurting?

554
00:34:42,032 --> 00:34:43,199
Are you okay?

555
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:53,075
I told you to ask for my help with reaching high places.

556
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:55,945
It's just a little fracture.

557
00:34:56,046 --> 00:34:58,547
Hospitalizing me is an exaggeration.

558
00:34:58,782 --> 00:35:01,417
When you grow older, your body heals slower.

559
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:03,719
Don't push yourself.

560
00:35:03,787 --> 00:35:06,789
I'm stronger than a bean sprout like you.

561
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:09,025
Who are you calling bean sprout.

562
00:35:09,126 --> 00:35:11,761
There's still some work left over, right?

563
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:13,863
But...

564
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:18,367
Seeing you two won't magically heal my foot.

565
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:24,940
I'll be okay.

566
00:35:25,142 --> 00:35:26,809
Go home.

567
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:34,650
Grandpa was mean for calling me a bean sprout.

568
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:41,290
Well, it's a relief he didn't hit his head.

569
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:51,967
I'm so relieved.

570
00:35:53,003 --> 00:35:55,771
If something happened to him I...

571
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:58,607
You're exaggerating.

572
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:04,113
If he has the energy to talk, it means he's well.

573
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:10,453
But,

574
00:36:11,154 --> 00:36:13,756
I only have Grandpa.

575
00:36:21,498 --> 00:36:26,802
He's my family.

576
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:06,575
I'm home.

577
00:37:06,676 --> 00:37:07,910
Oh.

578
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:14,717
What's with the drawer?

579
00:37:14,885 --> 00:37:17,153
I was asked to fix it.

580
00:37:18,555 --> 00:37:20,589
Could it be fixed?

581
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,424
Of course it can.

582
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:24,593
The wood is alive.

583
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:30,099
I see.

584
00:37:31,268 --> 00:37:34,403
I heard Grandpa Kumai is hospitalized.

585
00:37:34,871 --> 00:37:36,772
Oh, yeah.

586
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:39,775
But, it's not too serious.

587
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:41,944
I see.

588
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:45,915
Well, be of support to Yamato.

589
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:48,751
Okay.

590
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:51,020
He seems lively, but,

591
00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:52,922
Grandpa is already old.

592
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:57,092
He could take a break once in a while.

593
00:37:59,729 --> 00:38:02,531
Dad, you're also getting old.

594
00:38:02,732 --> 00:38:05,868
Shouldn't you be worried about yourself.

595
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:11,640
Speak for yourself.

596
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:17,813
Think carefully about your future.

597
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:22,651
I know.

598
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:52,648
See you.

599
00:38:52,682 --> 00:38:53,816
Thanks for visiting.

600
00:39:11,635 --> 00:39:12,434
Huh?

601
00:39:12,702 --> 00:39:14,203
Oh, Mitsuomi!

602
00:39:14,337 --> 00:39:15,471
Are you guys going somewhere?

603
00:39:15,538 --> 00:39:16,672
For an examination.

604
00:39:16,806 --> 00:39:19,174
If you don't mind, could you wait over there?

605
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:21,710
That's right; this is from my Mom.

606
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:22,711
It's Ohagi (Bean cake).

607
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,480
Yoshiko’s Ohagi (bean cake).

608
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:27,283
Grandpa loves her Ohagi (bean cake).

609
00:39:28,351 --> 00:39:30,219
Well, we'll be off.

610
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,391
He seems lively but,

611
00:39:35,558 --> 00:39:37,459
Grandpa Kumai is already old.

612
00:39:38,061 --> 00:39:39,361
If something happened to him...

613
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:40,996
the land will be left to Yamato.

614
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:45,567
I understand it's troublesome to find an inheritor
but he doesn't have to leave it to his adopted son.

615
00:39:45,702 --> 00:39:47,670
He doesn't have a choice.

616
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:50,139
Yamato does have sociable manners.

617
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:54,043
Even so, we don't know what he's actually thinking.

618
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:56,879
He's bound to do something bad.

619
00:39:57,347 --> 00:39:59,081
Oh, piss off!

620
00:39:59,149 --> 00:39:59,848
Huh?

621
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:01,650
What the hell do you know about him?!

622
00:40:01,718 --> 00:40:03,085
You guys know nothing about him!

623
00:40:03,186 --> 00:40:05,988
Don't go making assumptions when you guys know nothing about him!

624
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,691
Yamato is not that kind of guy!

625
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:09,558
What's with you?!

626
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:12,094
Watch your mouth when you talk to others!

627
00:40:12,195 --> 00:40:13,829
Don't look down on your elders!

628
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,030
Who do you think you are?!

629
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:16,065
Listen, he is-
Mitsuomi!

630
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:18,000
Let it go, Mitsuomi.

631
00:40:18,034 --> 00:40:19,368
What's going on here?

632
00:40:29,212 --> 00:40:30,579
Are you still angry?

633
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:34,583
That doesn't bother me.

634
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:37,019
Why are you getting all angry about it?

635
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:39,755
Doesn't it piss you off at all?

636
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:41,190
I'm used to it.

637
00:40:41,257 --> 00:40:43,225
Don't get used to it!

638
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:43,859
But...

639
00:40:43,893 --> 00:40:45,127
Just so you know...

640
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:46,996
I'm pissed off at you too!

641
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,398
Don't you have any pride?!

642
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:50,232
Pride?

643
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:53,202
Don't go smiling while you're being made fun of!

644
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,403
Got it.

645
00:40:57,073 --> 00:41:00,709
I feel stupid for making a fuss by myself.

646
00:41:08,485 --> 00:41:10,085
Thank you.

647
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:15,891
For getting angry as if it was about you.

648
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:19,428
It was nothing, I...

649
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:20,763
Mitsuomi!

650
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:21,897
Hey!

651
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:23,065
Thank you, Mitsuomi!

652
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:24,133
Get off!

653
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:24,900
I don't want to!

654
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:26,101
Get off!

655
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:26,902
I don't want to!

656
00:41:26,936 --> 00:41:28,137
I'm going to suffocate!

657
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:29,505
I don't want to!

658
00:41:29,606 --> 00:41:30,272
Hey!

659
00:41:30,306 --> 00:41:31,306
Get off!

660
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:32,574
Tickle, tickle!

661
00:41:32,776 --> 00:41:33,442
Stop it!

662
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:34,676
I give up! I give up!

663
00:45:05,388 --> 00:45:06,655
Mitsuomi!

664
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:08,557
You're late!

665
00:45:08,858 --> 00:45:11,226
I told you we're picking strawberries today!

666
00:45:11,327 --> 00:45:12,828
Did you go to the wrong greenhouse?

667
00:45:12,862 --> 00:45:13,795
My bad.

668
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,397
It seems I have a bit of a cold.

669
00:45:15,665 --> 00:45:16,365
Huh?

670
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:18,700
That's not good.

671
00:45:19,035 --> 00:45:20,068
Do you have a fever?

672
00:45:20,236 --> 00:45:22,371
I d-don't have a fever.

673
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:25,073
That's right, last night...

674
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:26,174
When did you go-

675
00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:27,242
Oh, should I cover this side?

676
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,076
What?

677
00:45:28,177 --> 00:45:29,077
Okay...

678
00:45:29,178 --> 00:45:30,712
I-I got it.

679
00:45:44,994 --> 00:45:46,194
Mitsuomi!

680
00:45:46,229 --> 00:45:47,029
What?

681
00:45:47,063 --> 00:45:48,864
I told you to pick them more gently.

682
00:45:48,898 --> 00:45:50,198
Ah!

683
00:45:50,266 --> 00:45:52,034
What's the matter with you today?

684
00:45:52,068 --> 00:45:53,368
Are you okay?

685
00:45:54,103 --> 00:45:55,103
Sorry.

686
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:02,277
Mitsuomi!
What?

687
00:46:03,246 --> 00:46:07,082
I'll cover this area, so you pick the leaves over there.

688
00:46:08,051 --> 00:46:08,917
Okay.

689
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:12,788
Yamato?

690
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,693
Oh, Ueda!
Hey.

691
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:19,628
I heard Grandpa is hospitalized.

692
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:21,063
I came to help you out.

693
00:46:21,097 --> 00:46:22,097
Thank you.

694
00:46:23,966 --> 00:46:25,233
I wonder if I'll get sunburnt...

695
00:46:25,268 --> 00:46:27,235
even though I brought sunscreen.

696
00:46:27,303 --> 00:46:29,404
You put sunscreen on during winter?

697
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:31,640
It's common sense to prevent skin-damage.

698
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:32,607
What do you want me to do?

699
00:46:32,742 --> 00:46:33,608
Right.

700
00:46:33,776 --> 00:46:35,877
Then, I want you to pack those strawberries.

701
00:46:35,912 --> 00:46:36,611
Okay.

702
00:46:37,313 --> 00:46:38,113
Here

703
00:46:38,147 --> 00:46:39,448
Oh, okay.

704
00:46:39,882 --> 00:46:41,249
You're a real help

705
00:46:42,218 --> 00:46:43,585
Wow, they look so good!

706
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,920
Be gentle with them.

707
00:46:44,987 --> 00:46:46,688
Hey! Pack them gently!

708
00:47:02,805 --> 00:47:06,241
The sweetness is not too bad.

709
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:14,616
I'm sorry, it's nothing.

710
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:17,953
Did something happen?

711
00:47:19,088 --> 00:47:22,124
You could share your troubles.

712
00:47:26,095 --> 00:47:27,662
Hey, Grandpa...

713
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:31,533
When do you usually kiss someone?

714
00:47:32,034 --> 00:47:33,335
Huh?

715
00:47:33,669 --> 00:47:37,372
When you're not lovers, is there that kind of kiss?

716
00:47:38,841 --> 00:47:43,512
Like those dramas where the parent kisses their sleeping child.

717
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,948
Did you kiss someone?

718
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:48,483
Uh...

719
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:50,786
Did you find someone you like?

720
00:47:52,054 --> 00:47:53,655
It's not like that...

721
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,791
There's no need to feel embarrassed!

722
00:47:55,825 --> 00:47:57,359
You're still young.

723
00:47:57,393 --> 00:47:59,194
You could kiss once, twice, thrice-

724
00:47:59,228 --> 00:48:01,229
I told you it's not like that.

725
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,667
It's not like that.

726
00:49:09,565 --> 00:49:10,765
Mitsuomi!

727
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,034
Could you come down.

728
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:23,778
Yeah?

729
00:49:24,614 --> 00:49:26,581
What do you think?

730
00:49:27,216 --> 00:49:28,750
What do I think?

731
00:49:28,818 --> 00:49:32,087
It's getting close to that age so I thought she would be suitable.

732
00:49:32,154 --> 00:49:34,823
No, I have no interest in arranged marriage or marriage in general.

733
00:49:34,891 --> 00:49:35,891
Not you!

734
00:49:35,925 --> 00:49:37,225
I'm talking about Yamato!

735
00:49:37,293 --> 00:49:38,226
What?

736
00:49:38,261 --> 00:49:39,728
You're unemployed!

737
00:49:39,762 --> 00:49:41,296
I can't arrange a marriage for you!

738
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:43,465
Don't say "unemployed" towards your son.

739
00:49:43,499 --> 00:49:45,567
The constitution is simple.

740
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:47,669
Could you ask Yamato?

741
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,503
Me?

742
00:49:48,604 --> 00:49:52,340
If I ask him, I would come across too formal.

743
00:49:52,942 --> 00:49:56,344
I want him to casually meet her.

744
00:49:56,679 --> 00:49:59,614
Grandpa Kumai is already old.

745
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:03,485
There's no telling whether he'll have another incident like before.

746
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:09,124
If Yamato finds someone, Grandpa will be so relieved.

747
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:10,959
But still...

748
00:50:11,027 --> 00:50:13,662
Yamato decides if he accepts it or not.

749
00:50:13,963 --> 00:50:15,997
At least consider my suggestion.

750
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,008
Ugh!

751
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,344
My back hurts!

752
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:31,046
Sorry.

753
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,714
Let's call it a day.

754
00:50:32,882 --> 00:50:35,183
My arms are killing me.

755
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:44,893
Hey.

756
00:50:45,061 --> 00:50:47,128
Do you have time tonight?

757
00:50:47,163 --> 00:50:47,996
Tonight?
Yeah.

758
00:50:48,698 --> 00:50:50,932
Just between us, I have something to tell you.

759
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:52,701
Okay.

760
00:51:02,678 --> 00:51:03,912
Good work!

761
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:04,980
Cheers!

762
00:51:05,414 --> 00:51:06,348
Cheers!

763
00:51:06,749 --> 00:51:08,216
I didn't invite you.

764
00:51:09,352 --> 00:51:10,719
I told you it was only between us.

765
00:51:11,253 --> 00:51:12,354
This is so good!

766
00:51:12,421 --> 00:51:14,823
Mitsuomi, Ueda...

767
00:51:14,857 --> 00:51:16,191
Thank you.

768
00:51:16,225 --> 00:51:17,225
You guys really helped me.

769
00:51:17,326 --> 00:51:19,094
At least invite me if you're going to celebrate!

770
00:51:19,228 --> 00:51:20,562
You're so cold, Mitsuomi.

771
00:51:20,596 --> 00:51:21,896
That's not what I meant.

772
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:22,731
Excuse me!
Yes!

773
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:26,735
I'll have a moriyama set...

774
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:27,369
Yes.

775
00:51:27,403 --> 00:51:29,337
And a motsubasashi.
What did you want to talk about?

776
00:51:29,372 --> 00:51:31,039
Yes, one moment please.

777
00:51:32,241 --> 00:51:34,175
A matchmaking for you.

778
00:51:34,243 --> 00:51:35,410
A matchmaking?!

779
00:51:37,113 --> 00:51:39,381
My Mom got asked by her friend.

780
00:51:39,949 --> 00:51:42,017
She wanted me to ask you.

781
00:51:42,385 --> 00:51:44,352
She's a twenty-seven year old nurse.

782
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,854
Not bad.

783
00:51:45,921 --> 00:51:46,454
See.

784
00:51:46,555 --> 00:51:48,523
I heard she's a really nice person.

785
00:51:49,525 --> 00:51:51,459
I shouldn't say this.

786
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:53,795
I'm sorry.

787
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:56,197
Can you apologize to your Mom for me.

788
00:51:57,633 --> 00:51:59,701
Well, she was just being noisy.

789
00:52:13,616 --> 00:52:15,650
Thank you!

790
00:52:18,988 --> 00:52:21,156
Well, marriage is quick here in the countryside.

791
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:24,492
Like our mate, Murase got married last month.

792
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:25,493
What?

793
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:26,828
Really? Yeah.

794
00:52:27,096 --> 00:52:29,798
I heard Morimoto is also getting married.

795
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:31,833
Yoshiyoka already has two kids.

796
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:33,435
That sounds nice.

797
00:52:33,502 --> 00:52:35,637
I want to get married too!

798
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:37,005
Right, Mitsuomi?

799
00:52:38,007 --> 00:52:39,507
Yeah, maybe someday.

800
00:52:39,575 --> 00:52:40,408
Huh?

801
00:52:40,443 --> 00:52:42,010
I want to get married by thirty.

802
00:52:42,678 --> 00:52:44,913
What about you, Yamato?

803
00:52:47,183 --> 00:52:48,683
I'm good.

804
00:52:48,751 --> 00:52:49,584
Huh?

805
00:52:49,652 --> 00:52:51,086
I've decided not to.

806
00:52:51,153 --> 00:52:52,787
Why?

807
00:52:53,823 --> 00:52:55,023
Toilet.

808
00:53:01,497 --> 00:53:03,298
Another wall.

809
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:04,866
A wall?

810
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:06,134
Yeah.

811
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:07,502
How should I say this...

812
00:53:07,603 --> 00:53:09,604
he has a wall around him

813
00:53:09,638 --> 00:53:12,173
He occasionally closes himself off.

814
00:53:16,612 --> 00:53:20,048
Earlier, you told me you know his secret.

815
00:53:21,817 --> 00:53:24,018
So you wanna know after all.

816
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:29,357
He's dating a woman.

817
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:31,192
What?

818
00:53:31,494 --> 00:53:33,728
He meets up with her at Usa restaurant.

819
00:53:33,863 --> 00:53:35,897
I saw them together a few times.

820
00:53:35,998 --> 00:53:38,199
I'd say she's older than him.

821
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,001
She was pretty fine.

822
00:53:41,337 --> 00:53:43,404
You said he has a wall around him.
Yeah?

823
00:53:43,506 --> 00:53:45,974
Having that while dating a woman, isn't that contradicting?

824
00:53:46,008 --> 00:53:47,142
That's why!

825
00:53:47,176 --> 00:53:48,810
He's a mystery.

826
00:54:10,366 --> 00:54:14,502
Sorry about it since you've generously suggested a matchmaking.

827
00:54:14,603 --> 00:54:16,104
Grandpa, you knew about it?

828
00:54:16,172 --> 00:54:18,773
I heard it from your mother.

829
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,414
I wonder if he has a girlfriend.

830
00:54:26,448 --> 00:54:27,549
Huh?

831
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:32,921
I wonder if Yamato is dating someone.

832
00:54:33,556 --> 00:54:36,224
I don't know if he's dating someone but...

833
00:54:36,525 --> 00:54:38,960
it seems he has kissed someone.

834
00:54:39,862 --> 00:54:40,895
Kissed?

835
00:54:41,063 --> 00:54:44,232
I wonder if I could hold my grandchild soon.

836
00:54:47,236 --> 00:54:48,603
Alright, let's go!

837
00:54:48,637 --> 00:54:49,404
Yeah.

838
00:54:49,738 --> 00:54:50,705
Hey.

839
00:54:50,739 --> 00:54:51,406
Yeah?

840
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,141
How much was the hospital fee?

841
00:54:54,276 --> 00:54:56,811
Grandpa, don't worry about it.

842
00:54:59,748 --> 00:55:00,648
Let's go.

843
00:55:01,217 --> 00:55:02,083
Slowly, slowly.

844
00:55:03,485 --> 00:55:04,986
We're almost there grandpa.

845
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,788
We're here, we're here.

846
00:55:06,822 --> 00:55:08,122
While you were gone grandpa...

847
00:55:08,224 --> 00:55:09,724
Mitsuomi did a great job.

848
00:55:09,792 --> 00:55:10,658
I see.

849
00:55:10,726 --> 00:55:11,793
Right, Mitsuomi?

850
00:55:11,961 --> 00:55:12,994
That's a real help.

851
00:55:13,062 --> 00:55:14,429
Ryoko is here!

852
00:55:17,433 --> 00:55:21,102
One, two, one, two, one, two.

853
00:55:22,338 --> 00:55:23,404
We're home!

854
00:55:23,472 --> 00:55:24,639
Welcome back!

855
00:55:26,475 --> 00:55:27,442
You came!

856
00:55:27,476 --> 00:55:28,910
I heard you were discharged!

857
00:55:28,911 --> 00:55:30,111
You guys came pretty late.

858
00:55:30,145 --> 00:55:31,579
It was very busy.

859
00:55:31,614 --> 00:55:33,748
Congratulations on your discharge!

860
00:55:33,782 --> 00:55:35,817
I'm sorry for making you worry.

861
00:55:35,851 --> 00:55:37,085
Not at all.

862
00:55:37,419 --> 00:55:39,087
Nice to meet you, I'm Shikano.

863
00:55:39,188 --> 00:55:40,655
I'm Kozuka.

864
00:55:41,757 --> 00:55:43,057
I'll help!

865
00:55:44,026 --> 00:55:45,326
Here we go.

866
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:54,002
Ryoko, you did our laundry?!

867
00:55:54,103 --> 00:55:55,937
There were so many piled up.

868
00:55:55,971 --> 00:55:57,238
You should wash it while there's less.

869
00:55:57,339 --> 00:55:58,973
You even washed our underwear!

870
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:01,609
There's no need to feel embarrassed by showing your underwear.

871
00:56:03,345 --> 00:56:04,445
You had dinner?

872
00:56:04,513 --> 00:56:05,613
Are you going to eat here?

873
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:07,148
But I'll be home late.

874
00:56:07,182 --> 00:56:08,283
It's okay once in a while!

875
00:56:08,317 --> 00:56:09,884
Stay for a while, Ryoko

876
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:10,652
Right.

877
00:56:10,953 --> 00:56:12,353
Then... just a bit longer.

878
00:56:13,856 --> 00:56:16,958
Then, I... should get going.

879
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:17,692
What?

880
00:56:17,726 --> 00:56:19,827
Thank you, Mitsuomi.

881
00:56:19,962 --> 00:56:21,062
Mitsuomi?!

882
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:27,368
Mitsuomi!

883
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:29,237
Mitsuomi!

884
00:56:29,338 --> 00:56:31,306
You promised we'll celebrate Grandpa's discharge.

885
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,374
I'm sorry, I remembered I had plans.

886
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:35,376
Plans? What for?

887
00:56:36,812 --> 00:56:37,879
What's wrong, Mitsuomi?!

888
00:56:37,913 --> 00:56:39,547
Nothings wrong!

889
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,554
Is something wrong?

890
00:57:16,051 --> 00:57:20,755
I wonder if Mitsuomi plans to continue working for Grandpa Kumai.

891
00:57:20,956 --> 00:57:25,927
They even joked around saying
"Did Mitsuomi get adopted too?" at the women's association.

892
00:57:26,395 --> 00:57:29,697
At least he has a job and isn't roaming around.

893
00:57:29,765 --> 00:57:31,532
That's true but...

894
00:57:32,267 --> 00:57:34,635
Dear, are you okay with it?

895
00:57:38,073 --> 00:57:42,810
Don't you want him to take over the family business?

896
00:57:53,555 --> 00:57:55,990
Do you know what type of wood this is?

897
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,992
Keyaki (Zelkova wood)

898
00:57:58,227 --> 00:58:01,996
How many years do you think I've been working in this town?

899
00:58:02,598 --> 00:58:05,166
They may be the same type but...

900
00:58:05,634 --> 00:58:08,302
each of them are different in their own way.

901
00:58:12,508 --> 00:58:14,776
Touching it.

902
00:58:16,178 --> 00:58:19,781
Smelling it.

903
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:22,483
Talking to it.

904
00:58:23,485 --> 00:58:26,421
Turning it into a wonderful drawer.

905
00:58:27,656 --> 00:58:35,830
From the first cut to the second...

906
00:58:36,965 --> 00:58:39,600
You devote your heart into this work.

907
00:58:42,671 --> 00:58:45,306
Do you really believe...

908
00:58:45,774 --> 00:58:49,010
he feels the same way about this job?

909
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:50,505
Yamato

910
01:00:13,228 --> 01:00:16,063
Thank you.

911
01:00:16,899 --> 01:00:18,766
For what?

912
01:00:19,134 --> 01:00:23,771
For helping us with the greenhouse.

913
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:28,809
It was nothing... I barely helped.

914
01:00:30,879 --> 01:00:32,480
Yeah, true.

915
01:00:35,484 --> 01:00:37,451
Shut up!

916
01:00:42,624 --> 01:00:44,592
Where are we going?

917
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,761
Don't worry; follow me.

918
01:00:48,797 --> 01:00:50,498
Ryoko!

919
01:01:02,744 --> 01:01:04,679
Thanks for waiting.

920
01:01:05,581 --> 01:01:07,615
Nice to meet you the other day.

921
01:01:07,749 --> 01:01:09,684
Nice to meet you.

922
01:01:10,452 --> 01:01:12,653
This is Ryoko’s husband.

923
01:01:12,754 --> 01:01:14,589
And this is Taku.

924
01:01:14,656 --> 01:01:15,823
Husband?

925
01:01:15,857 --> 01:01:17,091
Yeah.

926
01:01:17,192 --> 01:01:19,794
Mitsuomi, I think there was a misunderstanding.

927
01:01:19,928 --> 01:01:21,929
Hello, I'm Shikan.

928
01:01:22,164 --> 01:01:24,365
Taku, say hello.

929
01:01:24,499 --> 01:01:25,766
Hello.

930
01:01:25,968 --> 01:01:27,668
Uh...

931
01:01:28,136 --> 01:01:30,671
Taku, there's a goat over there.

932
01:01:30,806 --> 01:01:31,939
A goat?

933
01:01:32,107 --> 01:01:33,641
Ready, set, go!

934
01:01:33,709 --> 01:01:34,375
Hey!

935
01:01:34,443 --> 01:01:36,444
Gooaaat!
Wait a minute!

936
01:01:43,118 --> 01:01:44,318
Goat!

937
01:01:44,353 --> 01:01:45,853
Maa!

938
01:01:46,555 --> 01:01:48,489
Maa!

939
01:01:51,627 --> 01:01:52,793
Mitsuomi!

940
01:01:52,861 --> 01:01:54,262
There's a Goat!

941
01:01:55,897 --> 01:01:57,498
I'm not going!

942
01:01:57,733 --> 01:01:58,766
What?

943
01:02:00,002 --> 01:02:01,969
You two get along.

944
01:02:02,004 --> 01:02:04,071
How long have you known each other?

945
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,008
We've just met recently.

946
01:02:07,042 --> 01:02:08,042
Is that so?

947
01:02:09,044 --> 01:02:10,745
How long have you known him

948
01:02:11,013 --> 01:02:12,780
I believe twenty years.

949
01:02:13,181 --> 01:02:14,815
That long?

950
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:16,751
Yamato didn't tell you?

951
01:02:16,918 --> 01:02:19,253
We were raised in the same orphanage.

952
01:02:19,721 --> 01:02:21,088
What?

953
01:02:21,189 --> 01:02:23,958
We were living together at the orphanage until I was adopted.

954
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,395
We're like siblings.

955
01:02:27,863 --> 01:02:30,398
Is that so?

956
01:02:31,433 --> 01:02:33,534
Were you worried?

957
01:02:33,835 --> 01:02:34,769
Huh?

958
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:37,605
Did you think an older woman was flirting with him?

959
01:02:38,106 --> 01:02:40,107
No, not at all.

960
01:02:40,242 --> 01:02:43,511
The other day, you were giving me the death stare.

961
01:02:44,246 --> 01:02:46,047
Mitsuomi!

962
01:02:46,448 --> 01:02:47,415
Goat!

963
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:50,418
I told you, I'm not going!

964
01:02:52,054 --> 01:02:53,721
What am I, a child?

965
01:02:56,591 --> 01:02:58,559
I'm so relieved

966
01:02:58,694 --> 01:03:01,195
he got a good friend.

967
01:03:02,964 --> 01:03:05,766
Yamato is always smiling.

968
01:03:06,368 --> 01:03:08,302
But, he isn't.

969
01:03:08,537 --> 01:03:10,705
He does that on purpose.

970
01:03:15,077 --> 01:03:19,980
People usually ask what's wrong when a person looks sad or in pain but...

971
01:03:21,049 --> 01:03:24,251
They don't ask when someone seems happy.

972
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:30,124
Does that mean... he's actually hurting?

973
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,264
He puts on a happy face to create a barrier around him.

974
01:03:38,834 --> 01:03:43,671
He doesn't want to let people in.

975
01:03:45,273 --> 01:03:51,512
It seems a child raised without his parents doesn't know how to give love back.

976
01:03:51,913 --> 01:03:56,751
When receiving kindness, he doesn't know what to do with it.

977
01:03:56,985 --> 01:03:59,854
I was like that too.

978
01:04:00,155 --> 01:04:04,125
You end up creating a wall around yourself.

979
01:04:04,459 --> 01:04:09,296
My wall, he broke it for me.

980
01:04:09,664 --> 01:04:14,502
I wish Yamato could meet someone like that soon.

981
01:04:35,557 --> 01:04:36,791
Thanks for waiting.

982
01:04:37,626 --> 01:04:38,826
Here, here.

983
01:04:39,027 --> 01:04:40,394
This is the address.

984
01:04:40,495 --> 01:04:44,165
I've contacted the customer both of you will be delivering it.

985
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:45,166
Got it.

986
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,067
I'm sorry when you have work.

987
01:04:47,135 --> 01:04:48,502
Don't worry about it.

988
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:51,172
Besides, is Uncle okay?

989
01:04:51,873 --> 01:04:53,874
It's just a strained back.

990
01:04:54,643 --> 01:04:55,576
Then, let's go.

991
01:04:55,844 --> 01:04:57,845
Yes, I'm counting on you both.

992
01:04:59,514 --> 01:05:01,048
Be careful.

993
01:05:01,316 --> 01:05:02,883
Wait!

994
01:05:03,485 --> 01:05:06,220
Actually, I'll...

995
01:05:07,222 --> 01:05:08,722
Dear!

996
01:05:09,357 --> 01:05:11,091
Get some rest.

997
01:05:11,193 --> 01:05:13,594
Uncle, it's best not to push yourself today.

998
01:05:21,269 --> 01:05:23,771
I'm sorry for bringing you along.

999
01:05:24,105 --> 01:05:25,873
No worries, no worries.

1000
01:05:27,242 --> 01:05:31,712
It's out of the question to have my dad deliver with his condition.

1001
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,181
He cares so he couldn't help it

1002
01:05:34,282 --> 01:05:37,017
He has worked so hard on his job.

1003
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:31,171
That's strange.

1004
01:06:32,207 --> 01:06:34,341
We should have turned right on the last road.

1005
01:06:34,476 --> 01:06:35,976
You said left.

1006
01:06:36,077 --> 01:06:37,578
You thought so too.

1007
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:39,446
It's because you seemed so confident about it.

1008
01:06:39,481 --> 01:06:40,481
I didn't say that!

1009
01:06:40,515 --> 01:06:41,882
Did too!

1010
01:06:42,918 --> 01:06:44,351
Oh, hey!

1011
01:06:45,487 --> 01:06:47,988
Is there Mizushima’s house around here?

1012
01:06:48,223 --> 01:06:49,423
Mizushima?

1013
01:06:49,491 --> 01:06:52,660
We have a delivery for Mizushima.

1014
01:06:52,761 --> 01:06:54,562
That's my house.

1015
01:07:04,339 --> 01:07:06,206
Please have some tea.

1016
01:07:10,612 --> 01:07:13,180
Wow, it's fixed!

1017
01:07:13,348 --> 01:07:15,716
It sure is.

1018
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:18,552
Thank you for coming all this way.

1019
01:07:18,587 --> 01:07:19,920
Not at all.

1020
01:07:19,955 --> 01:07:21,455
Hope you didn't get lost.

1021
01:07:21,756 --> 01:07:24,325
Yes, we somehow made it.

1022
01:07:31,433 --> 01:07:34,201
My Dad couldn't make it because of a strained back.

1023
01:07:34,502 --> 01:07:37,237
He wanted me to give you his best regards.

1024
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:39,440
Here you are.

1025
01:07:39,774 --> 01:07:40,841
Thank you.

1026
01:07:40,909 --> 01:07:43,010
She is going to get married soon.

1027
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:45,846
I want her to have this drawer.

1028
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,481
Is that so?

1029
01:07:48,717 --> 01:07:53,721
While I was about to get married, I brought this drawer here.

1030
01:07:54,055 --> 01:07:57,958
I had your grandfather make it for me.

1031
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:03,230
Your grandfather made it while your father fixed it.

1032
01:08:03,465 --> 01:08:06,166
The next time we have it fixed..

1033
01:08:06,601 --> 01:08:09,670
You may be fixing it for us.

1034
01:08:39,234 --> 01:08:40,801
Thanks.

1035
01:08:48,243 --> 01:08:49,810
They seemed very happy.

1036
01:08:50,512 --> 01:08:52,746
When we get back, tell your dad about it.

1037
01:08:56,084 --> 01:08:57,518
Mitsuomi?

1038
01:09:07,395 --> 01:09:11,432
I used to hate my dad's job.

1039
01:09:14,002 --> 01:09:16,103
I said it was "lame and boring."

1040
01:09:16,271 --> 01:09:18,706
I also said it was ’’old-fashioned."

1041
01:09:20,442 --> 01:09:27,181
I went to Tokyo because I wanted to do something cool and interesting.

1042
01:09:30,385 --> 01:09:34,788
But, I couldn't find anything.

1043
01:09:39,494 --> 01:09:44,465
Back at the company, I was called a useless human being.

1044
01:09:50,438 --> 01:09:53,907
Just earlier, I remembered something.

1045
01:09:54,876 --> 01:09:59,947
When I was a child, I would go into my dad's workplace.

1046
01:10:02,684 --> 01:10:06,053
It was filled with the nice smell of wood.

1047
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:09,790
I could hear the sound of chisel and plane.

1048
01:10:11,559 --> 01:10:16,597
I was fascinated by seeing drawers and dining tables being made.

1049
01:10:19,768 --> 01:10:24,538
I was always watching my dad work.

1050
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:33,542
I...

1051
01:10:38,653 --> 01:10:44,258
Your thoughts, you should tell him how you really feel.

1052
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:11,618
Is your back okay?

1053
01:11:13,588 --> 01:11:16,356
I'm sorry about today.

1054
01:11:20,428 --> 01:11:23,463
They were so happy with the drawer.

1055
01:11:24,566 --> 01:11:26,767
I see.

1056
01:11:32,874 --> 01:11:34,741
Dad...

1057
01:11:37,278 --> 01:11:39,279
What is it?

1058
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,355
Actually, I...

1059
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:52,793
I want to be a furniture craftsman.

1060
01:11:54,529 --> 01:11:57,564
I want to take over the family business.

1061
01:12:00,835 --> 01:12:03,871
There you go, making suggestions again.

1062
01:12:04,305 --> 01:12:06,673
I told you, I have no intention of leaving it to you.

1063
01:12:06,741 --> 01:12:08,742
It's not a suggestion.

1064
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:18,619
I know.

1065
01:12:21,789 --> 01:12:24,558
I've been arrogant and said a lot of things.

1066
01:12:25,426 --> 01:12:28,829
I blamed everyone when things didn't go well.

1067
01:12:29,063 --> 01:12:31,331
I kept running away.

1068
01:12:34,469 --> 01:12:38,071
I'm fully aware of my wrong actions.

1069
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,874
But,

1070
01:12:41,943 --> 01:12:44,511
I don't want to remain as a no good person!

1071
01:12:44,612 --> 01:12:47,147
I want to change!

1072
01:12:53,054 --> 01:12:55,622
I also...

1073
01:12:57,625 --> 01:13:00,827
want to make people happy with my job.

1074
01:13:04,465 --> 01:13:07,234
I want to be like you.

1075
01:13:15,777 --> 01:13:17,744
Please..

1076
01:13:18,313 --> 01:13:20,814
Teach me your ways.

1077
01:13:22,016 --> 01:13:23,684
Please!

1078
01:13:32,627 --> 01:13:34,528
First,

1079
01:13:35,229 --> 01:13:37,364
You must sharpen your chisel and plane!

1080
01:13:48,009 --> 01:13:50,143
Got it?

1081
01:13:52,513 --> 01:13:54,481
Yes!

1082
01:14:54,776 --> 01:14:55,942
Yamato!

1083
01:14:57,678 --> 01:15:00,247
Mitsuomi! What's wrong?

1084
01:15:01,082 --> 01:15:02,315
He said yes!

1085
01:15:02,617 --> 01:15:03,817
What?

1086
01:15:04,052 --> 01:15:05,419
My Dad said yes!

1087
01:15:05,653 --> 01:15:06,653
What!

1088
01:15:06,687 --> 01:15:08,121
That's great!

1089
01:15:08,189 --> 01:15:09,756
What's great?

1090
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:10,957
Grandpa!

1091
01:15:10,992 --> 01:15:12,726
My Dad said I could take over the business.

1092
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,361
Well, that's great to hear!

1093
01:15:14,395 --> 01:15:16,163
Give it your best!
Yeah.

1094
01:15:17,165 --> 01:15:19,900
Become a good furniture craftsman, Mitsuomi.

1095
01:15:20,535 --> 01:15:22,002
That's great!

1096
01:15:24,872 --> 01:15:27,941
Your father now has a good inheritor.

1097
01:15:28,242 --> 01:15:30,610
I'm looking forward to your work!

1098
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,936
Grandpa, can I have a moment?

1099
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:57,237
Yeah.

1100
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:03,710
I'm heading to Tokyo tomorrow.

1101
01:16:03,845 --> 01:16:05,846
Tokyo?

1102
01:16:06,114 --> 01:16:09,049
The government office in Kameido.

1103
01:16:11,986 --> 01:16:13,453
I see.

1104
01:16:15,022 --> 01:16:18,091
I'll have to take a day-off from work.

1105
01:16:18,226 --> 01:16:21,228
It's alright, go ahead.

1106
01:16:27,869 --> 01:16:30,036
Good night.

1107
01:16:31,272 --> 01:16:33,173
Yamato.

1108
01:16:42,984 --> 01:16:47,721
Thank you for coming to this house.

1109
01:16:56,998 --> 01:16:59,299
Grandpa...

1110
01:17:00,034 --> 01:17:02,369
Thank you.

1111
01:17:18,252 --> 01:17:20,420
It's so cold.

1112
01:17:23,824 --> 01:17:26,193
Sorry for bringing you out this early.

1113
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:29,629
That's okay, but where are we going?

1114
01:17:33,367 --> 01:17:37,771
I have to face something properly.

1115
01:18:20,448 --> 01:18:26,586
I was... an abandoned child.

1116
01:18:29,991 --> 01:18:33,793
I've heard I was found in Tokyo but...

1117
01:18:34,962 --> 01:18:37,831
I don't know anything about my parents.

1118
01:18:41,502 --> 01:18:44,371
My parent is Grandpa.

1119
01:18:44,872 --> 01:18:47,974
That's why, I haven't taken the time to search for them.

1120
01:18:51,078 --> 01:18:52,512
But,

1121
01:18:54,215 --> 01:18:56,516
I thought maybe I'll reach a conclusion...

1122
01:18:58,586 --> 01:19:00,553
or draw the line.

1123
01:19:02,523 --> 01:19:04,624
After seeing you recently.

1124
01:19:05,459 --> 01:19:07,761
I've decided to move forward.

1125
01:19:13,834 --> 01:19:15,835
If I'm with you, Mitsuomi...

1126
01:19:16,504 --> 01:19:19,005
I think I could go for it.

1127
01:19:50,671 --> 01:19:53,473
Whoa, it's the sky tree!

1128
01:19:54,108 --> 01:19:56,076
You're definitely a countrysider.

1129
01:19:56,177 --> 01:19:57,444
It's my first time seeing it.

1130
01:19:57,611 --> 01:19:58,978
It's so tall!

1131
01:19:59,013 --> 01:20:00,547
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1132
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,451
I'm sorry.

1133
01:20:05,986 --> 01:20:07,420
Did I make him angry?

1134
01:20:07,521 --> 01:20:08,688
Don't worry about it.

1135
01:20:08,723 --> 01:20:09,656
But...

1136
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:11,591
It happens a lot here.

1137
01:20:12,393 --> 01:20:13,360
Let's go.

1138
01:20:13,461 --> 01:20:14,494
Okay.

1139
01:20:22,403 --> 01:20:23,203
I will leave this to you.

1140
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:24,604
I will take that.

1141
01:20:26,006 --> 01:20:30,210
It will take some time to prepare the dismissal copy.
So, would you mind waiting for a while?

1142
01:20:30,311 --> 01:20:31,378
Yes.

1143
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:34,347
I do apologize, please have a seat.

1144
01:20:35,049 --> 01:20:41,988
Visitor 33
please come forward to the counter.

1145
01:20:44,825 --> 01:20:48,094
It's going to take a while.

1146
01:20:48,629 --> 01:20:50,397
I see.

1147
01:20:58,005 --> 01:21:04,144
If you find your parents, would you visit them?

1148
01:21:06,347 --> 01:21:08,047
I don't know.

1149
01:21:08,249 --> 01:21:09,883
Do you want to see them?

1150
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,621
I don't know.

1151
01:21:16,624 --> 01:21:18,625
I see.

1152
01:21:31,105 --> 01:21:33,006
I have to say...

1153
01:21:34,141 --> 01:21:37,210
It feels weird to have you sitting on my right side.

1154
01:21:37,845 --> 01:21:40,447
You're always on my left.

1155
01:21:43,818 --> 01:21:46,085
I was thinking the same thing.

1156
01:21:46,387 --> 01:21:47,387
You did?

1157
01:21:47,455 --> 01:21:48,455
Yeah.

1158
01:22:00,367 --> 01:22:02,769
Yeah, I definitely prefer this side.

1159
01:22:03,537 --> 01:22:04,871
Right?

1160
01:22:11,278 --> 01:22:13,680
It's going to be okay.

1161
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,120
Yeah.

1162
01:22:28,796 --> 01:22:31,598
I didn't think it would take until tomorrow.

1163
01:22:31,832 --> 01:22:34,701
Going through all those paper work must be a hassle.

1164
01:22:35,102 --> 01:22:38,605
How can I say, am I relieved?

1165
01:22:38,739 --> 01:22:41,708
I'm sorry, you have to tag along for another day.

1166
01:22:41,942 --> 01:22:43,243
It's alright.

1167
01:22:43,544 --> 01:22:46,613
Let's grab a bite and find a hotel.

1168
01:22:58,025 --> 01:23:00,126
Excuse me, can we stay for the night?

1169
01:23:00,227 --> 01:23:01,327
Welcome. Two guests?

1170
01:23:01,362 --> 01:23:01,995
Yes.

1171
01:23:02,029 --> 01:23:03,730
Which room would you like to choose?

1172
01:23:04,965 --> 01:23:06,499
Together is fine, right?

1173
01:23:06,534 --> 01:23:07,467
It's just the two of us.

1174
01:23:07,501 --> 01:23:08,668
Double is fine, right?

1175
01:23:08,769 --> 01:23:09,636
What? You stupid!

1176
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:11,170
We're obviously picking twin beds!

1177
01:23:11,238 --> 01:23:12,472
Doubles are for...

1178
01:23:12,506 --> 01:23:15,441
I do apologize, our twin rooms are all full.

1179
01:23:15,509 --> 01:23:18,578
We only have a double room available for two guests.

1180
01:23:18,612 --> 01:23:19,546
What?

1181
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:20,547
Then, we'll go with that.

1182
01:23:20,581 --> 01:23:22,615
Yes, please fill in your details.

1183
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:24,317
Great.

1184
01:23:44,705 --> 01:23:46,839
Why are you all the way to the corner'?

1185
01:23:48,676 --> 01:23:50,743
So you don't kick me.

1186
01:23:51,278 --> 01:23:53,413
Do I toss around that much?

1187
01:23:54,048 --> 01:23:56,182
You're like a child.

1188
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:59,218
That night I stayed at your place too...

1189
01:24:12,466 --> 01:24:13,766
Hey.

1190
01:24:14,768 --> 01:24:16,569
Yeah?

1191
01:24:17,538 --> 01:24:22,709
That night, why... did you kiss me?

1192
01:24:26,614 --> 01:24:30,917
You... knew about it?

1193
01:24:33,821 --> 01:24:38,291
I always thought what that was all about.

1194
01:24:41,428 --> 01:24:46,299
Well, that was...

1195
01:24:50,838 --> 01:24:52,171
Sorry.

1196
01:24:52,306 --> 01:24:55,842
I guess if I asked you'll feel troubled.

1197
01:25:01,649 --> 01:25:03,816
It's because I like you.

1198
01:25:07,755 --> 01:25:09,422
What?

1199
01:25:14,128 --> 01:25:19,065
It's because I like you.

1200
01:25:24,738 --> 01:25:27,674
Does that mean...

1201
01:25:28,609 --> 01:25:31,711
what you've just said?

1202
01:25:32,112 --> 01:25:36,049
That's right.

1203
01:25:37,484 --> 01:25:40,253
I'm a guy, though.

1204
01:25:47,227 --> 01:25:49,629
I know that.

1205
01:25:52,099 --> 01:25:55,134
I think so too.

1206
01:25:55,202 --> 01:25:59,005
"What's so great about liking a guy."

1207
01:25:59,073 --> 01:26:01,641
"Why is it you?"

1208
01:26:05,846 --> 01:26:07,580
But, I can't help it.

1209
01:26:08,215 --> 01:26:10,483
I fell for you.

1210
01:26:25,265 --> 01:26:29,836
I once got confessed to.

1211
01:26:31,638 --> 01:26:35,708
I didn't hate her.

1212
01:26:36,643 --> 01:26:39,178
I thought she was a really nice person.

1213
01:26:41,381 --> 01:26:42,882
But,

1214
01:26:43,484 --> 01:26:45,551
I couldn't be with her.

1215
01:26:49,923 --> 01:26:54,494
I don't have the confidence to like someone.

1216
01:26:57,664 --> 01:27:00,166
I'm scared to.

1217
01:27:02,569 --> 01:27:03,636
Yeah?

1218
01:27:14,214 --> 01:27:16,916
Please give me more time.

1219
01:27:18,585 --> 01:27:20,686
Okay.

1220
01:27:28,262 --> 01:27:30,530
Can I hug you?

1221
01:27:32,633 --> 01:27:35,802
Don't ask after you do it.

1222
01:27:40,607 --> 01:27:42,975
You're right.

1223
01:27:58,692 --> 01:28:01,794
Yamato

1224
01:28:01,929 --> 01:28:04,163
As expected, nothing was written on it.

1225
01:28:06,133 --> 01:28:07,733
Now, I feel so refreshed.

1226
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:11,137
- Excuse me
- Yes?

1227
01:28:11,205 --> 01:28:13,573
Is Tsubaki Park close from here?

1228
01:28:13,607 --> 01:28:15,208
A park?

1229
01:28:15,275 --> 01:28:16,976
It seems I was picked up from there.

1230
01:28:17,044 --> 01:28:18,711
I want to go there but is that okay?

1231
01:28:18,745 --> 01:28:20,413
Of course

1232
01:28:28,355 --> 01:28:30,857
Excuse me.

1233
01:28:38,699 --> 01:28:42,101
I remembered while listening to your conversation...

1234
01:28:44,771 --> 01:28:49,475
that I was also there when you were picked up.

1235
01:28:52,012 --> 01:28:57,083
You were sleeping on a bench wrapped around in a new towel.

1236
01:28:59,853 --> 01:29:05,258
There was a name written on a note between the towel.

1237
01:29:07,661 --> 01:29:11,297
It read "Yamato."

1238
01:30:00,247 --> 01:30:02,481
My name.

1239
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:09,989
I thought someone from the government office or the orphanage gave me that name.

1240
01:30:15,562 --> 01:30:23,369
I wonder why they bothered to name me
when they were going to abandon me anyway.

1241
01:30:45,826 --> 01:30:55,134
Names are firstly given to us by our parents, right?

1242
01:31:03,777 --> 01:31:10,349
It's like receiving a first gift by our parents.

1243
01:31:16,656 --> 01:31:26,565
If they had no love for you, they probably wouldn't have thought up a name for you.

1244
01:31:53,827 --> 01:31:55,294
Yamato.

1245
01:32:05,705 --> 01:32:08,207
Could you say it again?

1246
01:32:11,878 --> 01:32:13,913
Yamato.

1247
01:32:22,789 --> 01:32:24,824
Yamato.

1248
01:33:15,041 --> 01:33:17,409
Isn't it amazing?

1249
01:33:19,446 --> 01:33:21,480
All around the world,

1250
01:33:21,581 --> 01:33:26,785
There are so many people with moms and dads.

1251
01:33:29,523 --> 01:33:31,223
That's true.

1252
01:33:37,464 --> 01:33:41,800
I wonder if my parents are out there somewhere.

1253
01:33:47,107 --> 01:33:50,109
I wish them all the happiness.

1254
01:33:56,750 --> 01:34:02,621
Because I'm currently happy.

1255
01:34:12,132 --> 01:34:15,167
I wonder if I can love someone too.

1256
01:38:20,513 --> 01:38:28,556
(Restart After Come Back Home)
