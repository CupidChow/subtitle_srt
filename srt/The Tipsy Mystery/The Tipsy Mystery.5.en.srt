1
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,320
You two need to find out more from that place.

2
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:09,445
And I'll be looking for Ping.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,171
That the place!

4
00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:13,680
How dare you come to this place?!?!

5
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:16,440
You took my money, didn't you? Give it back to me. / Nope.

6
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:19,562
Last night, you were here with a woman.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,651
A tattoo parlor! Looks like fun. We should get tattoos. / Huh?

8
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:25,120
Hey! Someone is about to open a freezer.

9
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:27,840
If someone sees my body, you all will be in trouble.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,800
Where is the swimming pool?

11
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,330
Right, you want some papaya salad?

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,040
Damn it!

13
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:35,160
We got a problem.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,800
I can't find drugs in the place where Bam said she hid them.

15
00:00:37,883 --> 00:00:39,800
Well you need to find Bam.

16
00:00:39,804 --> 00:00:42,200
When I'm done using the bathroom, I need my drugs, okay?

17
00:00:43,337 --> 00:00:44,338
Fuck!

18
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:46,320
Hey, I know who killed Bam.

19
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:46,960
What did you just say?

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,560
Who killed her? / It's you, Phee.

21
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,920
You killed her.

22
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,840
10:00 PM. 5 years ago

23
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,080
What's wrong? Why're you playing too hard to get?

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,481
You filthy face!

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,560
No one has ever called me that before

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,080
especially a woman like you.

27
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:49,920
You can't call me that, you whore!

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,481
Hey!

29
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:01,400
Start counting your prayers.

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,720
Ah! Why did you hit me?

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,321
I'm your client.

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,880
You're not my father.

33
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:12,400
You can be a man and a drug dealer.

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,400
She didn't give you consent, stop acting like a moron.

35
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:16,984
You hear me?

36
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,480
You don't get it, do you?

37
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:23,000
I should just give you another one.

38
00:02:25,357 --> 00:02:26,840
This is so much fun, Boss.

39
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:34,240
I've hated him for such a long time. He's so rude.

40
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:37,280
He needed to be humbled once in a while.

41
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,091
You're not gonna eat?

42
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:44,504
Not hungry?

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,241
This place is good.

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,280
If you want to sleep with me, we can skip this meal.

45
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,883
Who hurt you?

46
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:56,118
I'm just coughing.

47
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:57,878
Just coughing.

48
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,641
Brave guy.

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,120
How was you raised?

50
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,300
Why're you so pessimistic.

51
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,880
I really invited you out for late night dinner.

52
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:14,797
Let me tell you something,

53
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:17,903
The world isn't such a horrible place.

54
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,480
There're some positive things to look at.

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,220
Someone once said that there's a corner of positive things in this world.

56
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,801
But you know what?

57
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:36,440
A person who told me this was a liar as well.

58
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:42,360
You're so harsh.

59
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,841
I like it.

60
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:51,000
Why don't you come and work for me?

61
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,880
No one can be rude to you again.

62
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:07,578
That's more like it.

63
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,040
Wait, we need to talk. / Hey! Stop!

64
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:33,258
Turn around.

65
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,450
I told you to turn around.

66
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:46,800
I told you not to run away, and just come here to talk.

67
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,870
Talk about what? He's an officer.

68
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,120
It's okay, don't worry.

69
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:52,698
He's my friend.

70
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,311
What?

71
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:56,124
Friend?

72
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,213
How? When?

73
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,821
My childhood friend.

74
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,320
We grew up in the orphanage together. It's such a small world

75
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:05,960
and now we reunited.

76
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,840
Such a relief. / About fucking what?

77
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,640
Damn it! I can relax for only a minute.

78
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,440
What did you say earlier? Who killed Bam?

79
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,600
Tell me who killed her.

80
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,520
I said tell me! / It's Phee.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,680
Ter, stop saying something nonsense.

82
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:26,480
Nonsense what? You and I heard the same thing.

83
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:29,744
I heard it but it doesn't mean that Phee killed Bam.

84
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,801
I killed Bam?

85
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,881
I don't think so. / What was going on?

86
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,040
That's enough. You need to sit down…

87
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:39,120
I told you to have a seat….

88
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,320
Listen to me!

89
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,171
Argh!

90
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,520
How long are you gonna scream like mad dogs?

91
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,877
Can't you just talk like normal people?

92
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:54,618
And you

93
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,280
What you said is understandable.

94
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:04,160
You need to shut up.

95
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,800
Tell me. What's going on?

96
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,051
It is…. / Why're you smiling?

97
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,681
Great service from my heart.

98
00:07:22,503 --> 00:07:23,504
All done.

99
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,760
He's asleep.

100
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,100
Your friend is a funny guy.

101
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:43,160
Hey! You're here to get a tattoo?

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,240
I'm here to see my friend. / Phee!

103
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,400
Bam!

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,520
You're here, I've been looking everywhere for you.

105
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:58,410
What is he doing here?

106
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:01,480
We were just having fun.

107
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:03,158
Having fun?

108
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:13,120
Where is she going?

109
00:08:14,423 --> 00:08:16,224
Ter?

110
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,090
Hey! / What?

111
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,391
I need to ask you a favor, can you take care of my friend?

112
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,520
I'll come back later to pay for tattoo.

113
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,800
All right, the price for tattoo,

114
00:08:27,937 --> 00:08:30,480
and numbing cream are…. What?

115
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,400
Bam? Where are you going?

116
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,520
I'm heading back to the hotel. / Good, it's getting cold.

117
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:43,880
We should go back to the room. / Who said I would go back there?

118
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,063
Where are you heading to. / A rooftop.

119
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:48,680
Rooftop ?

120
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,680
What? Why do you want to go there?

121
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,361
Bam?

122
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,201
Bam?

123
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:02,240
If what the tattoo artist said was true, why did she come up to the rooftop?

124
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,760
Isn't it your liquor? / That's right.

125
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,560
So Bam was really here last night.

126
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,001
Friday, 15th at 03:00 AM.

127
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:46,724
Bam

128
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,720
I don't think you should drink this.

129
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
It made me drunk in a weird way.

130
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,800
You still drink it?

131
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,800
It's so cool up here.

132
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,640
When I'm up here, I feel like I'm a flying bird.

133
00:10:15,337 --> 00:10:16,520
Are you okay?

134
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,441
Thank you.

135
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,440
You and your friends completely made my last night memorable.

136
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,840
I'm glad to have met you too.

137
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,960
Last night?

138
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,840
What do you mean?

139
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,560
I used to think of being a bird with freedom

140
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,320
so I could fly away from this horrible life.

141
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,200
But there's only way to

142
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,401
get my freedom.

143
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,543
You mean that?

144
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,880
She committed a suicide? / No true.

145
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,201
Bam? Committed a suicide?

146
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,124
You're lying.

147
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:10,360
You killed her and made it look like she took her own life, didn't you?

148
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,000
Bam wouldn't leave me like that for sure.

149
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,040
Tell me that you lied. Tell me!

150
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,560
He's not lying, Ping.

151
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,200
I remember what happened up here.

152
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,600
I really wanted to commit a suicide.

153
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,281
What did you just say, Bam?

154
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,351
Bam? Really?

155
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,041
Who are you talking to?

156
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,531
Officer

157
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,880
Ping can communicate with Bam as a ghost.

158
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:43,657
A ghost?

159
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:51,080
Confusing, huh? You're too stunned just like a statue.

160
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,600
You need to stop talking? Aren't you afraid of his gun?

161
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:00,720
What were you thinking?

162
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:02,960
Why did you do that?

163
00:12:05,043 --> 00:12:06,244
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,600
No matter how hard I tried to tolerate my horrible life.

165
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,480
It seemed like nothing good had ever happened to me, ever.

166
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,520
I didn't want you to hold back on life because of me.

167
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:21,223
When I told you to go away,

168
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,983
it wasn't because I was mad that you broke your promises

169
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:29,520
but I thought that you would have a better chance at a better life,

170
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,200
better than I would have.

171
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:34,520
I didn't want to burden you again.

172
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:36,524
Bam.

173
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:41,960
In my life, being your friend

174
00:12:42,423 --> 00:12:43,880
is the best thing that has ever happened.

175
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:51,778
Wait.

176
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,880
If Bam really jumped off the building,

177
00:12:55,237 --> 00:12:57,440
why didn't she mess up her body? / That's right.

178
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,440
How did her body end up in the back of Dung's car? Who put her there?

179
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,241
Good question.

180
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,680
You're lying?

181
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,760
You killed her and you hid her body?

182
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,040
Tell me! / Calm down.

183
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:13,600
Just tell me! / Calm down.

184
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:16,924
I remember it now.

185
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,280
What the hell is wrong with her?

186
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:40,040
She can't rest in peace.

187
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,721
Crossed eyes?

188
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:56,624
Sek

189
00:13:57,392 --> 00:14:00,360
you need to hide her body so that no one can find her. / Got it.

190
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,500
And you need to talk to Loanzing gang with me.

191
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,800
When I'm done dealing with my drugs,

192
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,760
I'll handle those who made Bam become this way.

193
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,040
Calm down. / I remember it now.

194
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:18,360
About what's going on next.

195
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,361
What're you doing?

196
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:26,960
Let me go. / No, I won't.

197
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,180
Get up here. I'm not letting you go. We need go talk. / I told you to let me go.

198
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,080
Let me go. / No, I won't.

199
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,040
Don't let go of my hands.

200
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:37,120
Please hold my hands tight.

201
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,480
Pull me up.

202
00:14:39,723 --> 00:14:42,920
It's so freaking high. / I'm pulling you up.

203
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,280
You okay?

204
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,000
Are you alright? / I'm fine.

205
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,880
Don't tell anyone that I tried to save people from jumping off the building

206
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,370
but I ended up being the one who fell.

207
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:28,480
So stupid of me.

208
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,960
Let me help you. / I'm fine.

209
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,840
I can get up on my own.

210
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,120
I'm ready.

211
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:48,203
Let's go back to the room.

212
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:50,818
What ?

213
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:53,640
Where is she going?

214
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,301
What a coincidence?

215
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,640
You didn't die because that cart was just right there.

216
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,920
It's true.

217
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:15,218
What do you say?

218
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:17,640
It's true.

219
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,641
True.

220
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,840
You're so lucky.

221
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,400
You fell off this high. If I could bet, my money would be on your death.

222
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:34,178
Phee?

223
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:38,240
So you didn't kill Bam?

224
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,841
That's right.

225
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,700
See? I told you not to jump to conclusion.

226
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:49,018
Now we go back to what we started.

227
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:51,320
We have no idea how Bam died.

228
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:56,250
Why don't you take me to see Bam's body?

229
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,320
If I see her body, I can speculate how she died.

230
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,500
And it could lead to her murderer.

231
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,240
Where did you hide her?

232
00:17:14,723 --> 00:17:17,123
Damn it! She's gone.

233
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:18,364
What? / What?

234
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,640
You think this is a joke?

235
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,640
Am I a joke to you? Where did you take her?

236
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,400
They look like magnets, don't you think?

237
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:27,564
That's right.

238
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,320
This is not my trick.

239
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,280
I really hid her in this bathroom.

240
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,503
I also put up a sign but now

241
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,500
it's gone.

242
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,251
Hey!

243
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,280
You think she could walk off the bathroom?

244
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,080
I like your idea.

245
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,000
Did you listen too many ghost stories radio? / What're you talking about?

246
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:54,200
Ping said that she can see a ghost.

247
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,120
Why can't I assume that Bam could walk off the bathroom by herself?

248
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,480
It's different, a ghost and a corpse.

249
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:02,560
How did you know? Have you ever been dead?

250
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,520
And become a ghost? Stupid you!

251
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:08,623
Stupid you! / Stupid you!

252
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,400
Stupid you! / Enough!

253
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:15,040
Why're you two keep arguing?

254
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,640
He left the orphanage or

255
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,041
a dog shelter? He barked like a dog. / True.

256
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,880
Or could it be…

257
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,840
that the other officer found her?

258
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,131
That's right.

259
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,040
I'll talk to my buddy

260
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,720
maybe he could move her body somewhere else.

261
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
And all of you need to look her up too.

262
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,480
But don't ever think of any funny business.

263
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,271
Especially you.

264
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,600
Who talked about me behind my back?

265
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:01,320
Don't let me hear it again.

266
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:20,004
What?

267
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,731
Don't you think it's enough?

268
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,998
Enough of what?

269
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,440
Enough of this messy situation.

270
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,480
We've proved ourselves that we didn't kill Bam.

271
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,250
We have nothing to do with this.

272
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:36,478
True.

273
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,100
It's time for us to go home

274
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,120
or Ter could miss his flight.

275
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:45,840
But we haven't found out how Bam ended up in the back of the car.

276
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,280
Or who killed her? What about Dung?

277
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:50,200
Don't you care about his feeling?

278
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,440
He could be scared to death.

279
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,360
Dung could save himself and run back home.

280
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,400
Listen to me.

281
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,360
We're nobody.

282
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,440
We're not superheroes, not Sherlock Holmes

283
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,080
not Kudo Shinichi, not even Conan.

284
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,300
And that medium found her old police friend already.

285
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:09,400
You should stop playing a hero just to impress a woman… / What are you talking about?

286
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,523
Impress what?

287
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:15,088
We've been involved in this mess because you invited her to the car.

288
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,960
I've been your friends for years.

289
00:20:17,597 --> 00:20:19,300
I can tell that you have a crush on her.

290
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:23,482
If you want to help her out, be my guest.

291
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,050
But I don't want to risk my future… / What's wrong with you?

292
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,480
If you miss the flight, I'll buy you new ticket.

293
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,880
You think your money can solve anything?

294
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,242
If you're involved in this messy loop and your Dad finds out that

295
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,841
you ruins his family name again,

296
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,250
I don't think he will help you out this time.

297
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,200
He will cut you off completely for sure, think about it.

298
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,690
You should go. I have someone to help me out here.

299
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:12,738
What do you say?

300
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:27,000
I hope you can find Bam's murderer.

301
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:34,278
Wait!

302
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,520
I haven't returned your money yet.

303
00:21:43,683 --> 00:21:45,084
What the hell is this?

304
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,880
Or you don't believe a police officer like me.

305
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,920
Of course, I do believe in you.

306
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:15,560
But I just want to make sure that your work is worth 2.5 million.

307
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,241
Don't worry, Mr.Charn.

308
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,921
I'll arrest your medium girl and deliver her back to you for sure.

309
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm a man of my word.

310
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,280
But I'm not sure if this gets messier than this,

311
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,880
you would get your girl back dead or alive.

312
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,800
What did you just say?

313
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:41,600
You need to catch her alive.

314
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,200
I want her to crawl back at my feet and come work for me.

315
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,560
If someone deserved to kill her

316
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:51,400
that person would be me.

317
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,631
You hear me?

318
00:22:56,282 --> 00:22:58,283
Fine, as you wish.

319
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,480
Hey! When did you get here?

320
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,840
I just walked in, who did you talk to?

321
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,320
I talked to my wife, nothing much.

322
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,600
Where have you been?

323
00:23:16,117 --> 00:23:17,360
Did you get anything?

324
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,120
Did you find that medium?

325
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,160
I didn't. / You didn't ?

326
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,520
Or you didn't want to tell me?

327
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:29,544
What do you mean by that?

328
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,160
You're not the only one who checked for her history when she was a child.

329
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,360
I know everything

330
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,760
I know that you both used to live in the same orphanage.

331
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,480
You're an officer and you're siding with the criminal?

332
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,791
You're also a criminal.

333
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,483
You're working for Mr.Charn.

334
00:23:57,761 --> 00:24:00,320
I heard it all about your plan. Why's that?

335
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,520
Why did he want you to arrest her back to him?

336
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:09,520
Is there something more than the money?

337
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,760
You keep asking me questions, I don't have to answer to you.

338
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,971
Let just say that

339
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,680
I'll show you that the real world

340
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:22,920
is far beyond different from your ideal world.

341
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,600
I need to get to work and you

342
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,490
need to to sleep and get out of my way.

343
00:25:32,857 --> 00:25:33,858
Phee?

344
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,500
You hid the money in Dung's car? / That's right.

345
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,120
Where did you hide it?

346
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,520
I want to see that much money with my own eyes for once.

347
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,721
Damn it! Money's gone. / What?

348
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,520
So that is 5 million baht.

349
00:26:57,377 --> 00:26:59,400
Are you insane? What kind of sick joke is this?

350
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,360
It's not a joke. I really hid your money under the seat.

351
00:27:02,443 --> 00:27:03,447
Where is it?

352
00:27:05,543 --> 00:27:08,080
Say it again? What is it?

353
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,120
The drugs are missing? / They are missing?

354
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,480
I knew it.

355
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,560
You don't believe me, do you? / I'd be a stupid guy to belive you.

356
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,920
Is this your trick? To deceive me like this?

357
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,788
You won't end well. / I didn't deceive you.

358
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,520
Stop insulting me!

359
00:27:31,103 --> 00:27:34,200
I've been working on this illegal job with an honest heart

360
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:35,960
since your mom was breastfeeding you.

361
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,240
I wasn't breastfed,

362
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,240
I was fed with formula.

363
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,100
And I don't like it when people are trying to deceive me.

364
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:48,040
If you don't believe me, then just shoot me.

365
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,983
Damn it! Too much?

366
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,123
Oh my goodness!

367
00:28:00,857 --> 00:28:04,000
Are you selling weapon? Why don't you just shoot me with a machine gun?

368
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:06,783
You shouldn't have challenged them.

369
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,401
You're gonna be covered in holes.

370
00:28:20,803 --> 00:28:21,804
Fine, I believe you.

371
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:27,440
Where are the drugs, then? / If I know, would they be gone missing?

372
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:30,560
I told my girl to keep them

373
00:28:30,623 --> 00:28:32,320
and suddenly they disappeared from hidden spot.

374
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,640
I think the drugs are still in the hotel.

375
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:39,240
We'll find out soon enough.

376
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:43,958
What the hell are you doing?

377
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,320
Kheo Ngern has strong sense of smell.

378
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,760
He'll find out where the drugs are.

379
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:51,418
Smart dog.

380
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:54,400
He's not just a smart dog, he's a genius….

381
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,163
What a moron!

382
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,600
Let me suggest you something, you shouldn't hide anything anymore.

383
00:29:05,737 --> 00:29:08,400
You hid a body and she's gone. You hid the money and it's gone.

384
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,720
Stupid you!

385
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:11,960
Can you keep your mouth shut for a sec? No one would call you a mute.

386
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,160
Is it true though? / How could I know?

387
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,120
You two need to stop fighting.

388
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:22,920
What the hell are you looking at? / How could the money go missing?

389
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,700
We know about the money and that's it. It's only you

390
00:29:25,857 --> 00:29:27,520
who have trouble with debts, high debts.

391
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:29,100
You took the money, didn't you?

392
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,920
Wait! I didn't even know about you hiding the money.

393
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,300
How could I steal it?

394
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:36,960
I am in debts but I'm not a thief.

395
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,371
You believe me, right?

396
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,084
Are you sure about that?

397
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,840
What the hell is wrong with you two?

398
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:49,100
I'm the only target when it comes to money?

399
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,701
I'm your friend? What is this?

400
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,371
What?

401
00:30:03,477 --> 00:30:04,640
I found something.

402
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,200
I saw in news

403
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,500
this is drug.

404
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,631
What? / What?

405
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,360
How did it end up under your car?

406
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,440
It's mine.

407
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,951
What did you just say?

408
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,250
I hid the drug here.

409
00:30:47,923 --> 00:30:49,080
Why did you do that?

410
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,560
You're involved with drug dealer, Bam? / What?

411
00:30:58,183 --> 00:30:59,184
Hurry up!

412
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:05,000
Damn it! A gangster like me needs to follow a dog?

413
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:09,758
Boss?

414
00:31:11,817 --> 00:31:12,818
Stupid bucket in my way! Argh!

415
00:31:14,317 --> 00:31:15,318
Boss?

416
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:18,920
Why did you do that? Why were you involved with drugs?

417
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,700
It was my life. That's why I didn't want you to be a part of it.

418
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:31,520
What the hell is this? This is too fucked up!

419
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,520
We don't remember anything. There's a dead body in the trunk

420
00:31:35,703 --> 00:31:37,040
and now we found drugs?

421
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,280
You all should just walk to jail by now. Damn it!

422
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,170
You need to toss that drugs away.

423
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,170
Now, before the police came.

424
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,017
Don't mess with my drugs.

425
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,600
Send them to me or I'll shoot you.

426
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,061
Don't mess with Ping.

427
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:09,400
Who the hell are you?

428
00:32:09,783 --> 00:32:11,322
None of your business.

429
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,000
But I need Ping back.

430
00:32:17,157 --> 00:32:19,250
Send me 5 million, now.

431
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,411
My drugs.

432
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,720
You all took my drugs.

433
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:38,560
Damn it! / What the hell?

434
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:40,045
Still the same shit.

435
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,520
Give me back my drugs.

436
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,040
I think you all should calm down, drop your guns and just talk.

437
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,080
I won't! / Nope.

438
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:07,000
I won't either. / I know.

439
00:33:07,377 --> 00:33:09,300
No one listens to me.

440
00:33:10,297 --> 00:33:12,320
I'm a police officer, will you drop yours?

441
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,183
You all need to drop your guns.

442
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,911
This is an order.

443
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,241
Do it now!

444
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:36,040
You need to drop your gun. / What?

445
00:33:45,177 --> 00:33:46,178
Boss?

446
00:33:47,078 --> 00:33:48,870
Why are they pointing gun to his buddy?

447
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,880
How the fuck could I know? I'm here at the same time as you.

448
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,211
Yeah?

449
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,117
You're up now, bro?

450
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,480
Yes, I'm wide awake now.

451
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,840
You carried two guns?

452
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:09,440
I taught you well.

453
00:34:27,437 --> 00:34:29,160
Bam? / Bam?

454
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,291
Bam? / How did she get into the bucket?

455
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:34,400
What's that?

456
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:43,800
A monk? / A monk?

457
00:35:09,377 --> 00:35:10,680
Dung? / A monk.

458
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,400
That's right, I am.

459
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,401
What the hell is a monk doing here? / How could I know?

460
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:18,442
I can't follow this messed up story.

461
00:35:19,442 --> 00:35:20,600
What kind of fucking monk is that?

462
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,160
How could he be a monk when he's already a doctor? / I know.

463
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:28,500
Why are you cosplaying as a monk? / That's right.

464
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,960
I'm not cosplaying. I really went into monkhood just now.

465
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:36,918
Ouch!

466
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,600
He really did.

467
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,763
Why're you becoming a freaking monk?

468
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,360
I mean why're you becoming a monk, sir?

469
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:56,480
I felt guilty about what happened to Bam.

470
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,100
I was so overwhelmed and I didn't know where to go.

471
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,520
I kept walking and I saw a temple

472
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,080
then I realized that this is it.

473
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,760
This is a way to my peace.

474
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:15,300
So I came to see head of the temple and asked to be ordained to purify my sin.

475
00:36:15,443 --> 00:36:17,040
But you're not…. / Stop talking.

476
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,597
I don't know what you're fighting about,

477
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,401
but you're aiming for one's life.

478
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,600
If it's about Bam,

479
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,800
I'd like to take full responsibility for it.

480
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,760
(Chanting)

481
00:36:34,963 --> 00:36:36,360
Karma will be seen

482
00:36:36,397 --> 00:36:38,920
by those who did it.

483
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:40,640
Stop preaching.

484
00:36:40,703 --> 00:36:42,560
We're enlightened already.

485
00:36:42,723 --> 00:36:45,410
We know that you didn't kill Bam. / Bless you.

486
00:36:47,297 --> 00:36:48,298
What?

487
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,611
Take cover!

488
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,411
Damn it!

489
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,000
You crazy? Stop using my dead body like that.

490
00:37:23,203 --> 00:37:25,310
Hey! Share her with me.

491
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,423
Then they will shoot me, give her back to me.

492
00:37:28,657 --> 00:37:30,760
Bring her to the middle.

493
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,743
What the hell are you doing?

494
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,080
Shield our bodies. / That's Bam.

495
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:40,078
She's dead already, she can be dead twice.

496
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,700
But we're not dead so please?

497
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,871
Ping?

498
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:01,080
Are you okay? Did you get shot? / Nope.

499
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,360
Pao! / Pao!

500
00:38:08,017 --> 00:38:09,040
Yong?

501
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:21,100
You can't shoot me, I have thick skin.

502
00:38:27,477 --> 00:38:30,320
Dung! Where's your side-view mirror?

503
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,120
It got stuck right here.

504
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,600
Damn it! I can't be covered from the mirror?

505
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,480
Then you all should face this.

506
00:38:41,757 --> 00:38:43,840
How about Mr.Bomb?

507
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:54,480
Pao! Let's move! Hurry!

508
00:39:06,863 --> 00:39:08,000
Where are they?

509
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:15,280
What the hell is this?

510
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,631
Listen,

511
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,383
we need to get off from the main road

512
00:39:30,517 --> 00:39:31,920
otherwise the police will stop us for sure.

513
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:33,600
Where do I need to turn?

514
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:36,320
I have no idea. / What?

515
00:39:37,103 --> 00:39:38,104
I know.

516
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
I've been here before. Just go straight.

517
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,640
But you need to hurry, the police car is after us.

518
00:39:45,157 --> 00:39:46,920
How did you know about this?

519
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,270
I looked at the side-view mirror, stupid you!

520
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:55,440
So cool, you have your own side-view mirror.

521
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,600
You want it on you? / I'm sorry.

522
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:05,357
Turn right. / Turn right.

523
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:08,360
Turn left.

524
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:12,700
Turn right up there.

525
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:19,240
Turn left at the end of the road and get on the side of the road. / Which one?

526
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,920
How did you know that we need to hide here?

527
00:40:34,657 --> 00:40:35,658
Cause I'm smart.

528
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:39,720
Let's go. Keep going.

529
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,960
Wait!

530
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,122
Who's there?

531
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,031
How's your bike?

532
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,440
It broke down. / Hey!

533
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,031
Money!

534
00:41:01,023 --> 00:41:02,160
It's mine.

535
00:41:02,203 --> 00:41:04,840
It's mine. / It's mine.

536
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,520
It's my money. / I hid it in the car.

537
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:08,284
It's my money. / My money.

538
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:15,160
Get in!

539
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,720
You should have kicked him in the other way. He's blocking our way.

540
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:29,250
My money. 5 million is gone!

541
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:32,560
He's dead.

542
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,961
He's dead too.

543
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,963
One deceased worked for Loanzing.

544
00:41:39,503 --> 00:41:40,590
and one deceased worked for Mr.Charn.

545
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,080
We can arrest two of them, the rest ran away.

546
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,280
Damn it, this is embarrassing.

547
00:42:03,097 --> 00:42:04,277
Where the hell is this place?

548
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:08,560
How did you know about this place?

549
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,200
How did I know? I often traded drugs at this place.

550
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,760
This is an abandoned house in the forest, not everyone can get in.

551
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:22,250
After you're done confusing, can you heal my wound?

552
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,680
Hey! / Hey!

553
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:29,137
(Chanting)

554
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,360
I'm still alive.

555
00:42:30,637 --> 00:42:31,638
Just too painful.

556
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,620
We should bring him there.

557
00:42:35,197 --> 00:42:36,480
Let's go, hurry up. / Let's go!

558
00:42:36,617 --> 00:42:37,618
I can't open the door.

559
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:40,378
Why is it too hard to open?

560
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:42,771
Watch out!

561
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:49,560
The mirror stuck in him like this, he must be in so much pain.

562
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,880
We should get it out.

563
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,800
Why did you pull it out like that? He could bleed to death.

564
00:42:53,997 --> 00:42:55,250
You didn't tell me.

565
00:42:57,397 --> 00:42:59,370
You pulled it out and you didn't need to put it back.

566
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,977
Why did you put it back? / I shouldn't, huh?

567
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:04,800
Easy there.

568
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,251
There's a silver lining in this situation.

569
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,560
My Mom told me to carry

570
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:12,320
my medical kit in my car.

571
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,520
Otherwise, it'd be worse than this.

572
00:43:15,483 --> 00:43:16,583
Oh my! / What?

573
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,120
I got the wrong one. / What?

574
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,200
Just kidding.

575
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,080
It's not the time. / Let me help you.

576
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:27,844
Out of the way. / Why did you just stand there for too long?

577
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:31,523
What? / You're an officer, don't touch me.

578
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,841
You want to die? You want to bleed to death?

579
00:43:35,623 --> 00:43:36,717
If not, then shut up.

580
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,171
Come here.

581
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,760
Look at the wound.

582
00:43:43,603 --> 00:43:45,117
Good thing it wasn't too deep.

583
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,080
But I didn't have any numbing product.

584
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,840
I need to scrape off your skin

585
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,560
and then raw stitches, can you handle it?

586
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:58,920
I got shot my whole life

587
00:43:59,897 --> 00:44:03,050
raw stitches got nothing on me.

588
00:44:04,343 --> 00:44:07,000
You're so cool. / I like this kind of patient.

589
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:09,591
Let me see.

590
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,437
Why're you screaming? I haven't done anything.

591
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,703
And you said you got shot your whole life.

592
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,640
Don't worry, let's go.

593
00:44:23,677 --> 00:44:26,280
Did you start suturing? / Why didn't you cry? I did it.

594
00:44:31,642 --> 00:44:33,200
It needs stitches in and out.

595
00:44:41,077 --> 00:44:42,680
All done. / Why is it too fast?

596
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,560
I'm fast like that, you want to get sterilized too?

597
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,960
Hey! / Hey!

598
00:45:13,363 --> 00:45:14,364
Wang!

599
00:45:17,877 --> 00:45:18,878
Wang!

600
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:29,960
You must be so exhausted.

601
00:46:10,817 --> 00:46:12,240
I love you.

602
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:37,911
See?

603
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:40,480
Look at this small needle sign.

604
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,920
It's inflamed around this.

605
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,880
My guess is syringe.

606
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,761
Wait.

607
00:46:48,783 --> 00:46:49,784
I remember it now.

608
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,090
There was this one case where the criminal

609
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,757
used syringe containing overdosed drug, injected into the victim's body,

610
00:46:57,983 --> 00:46:58,984
hoping to cover up a crime.

611
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,400
It could be how Bam died.

612
00:47:07,281 --> 00:47:08,282
We're in big trouble.

613
00:47:10,557 --> 00:47:12,720
This is a picture of suspects in shooting case,

614
00:47:12,823 --> 00:47:15,560
took place in Prachuap Khiri Khan.

615
00:47:15,763 --> 00:47:18,360
The suspects are on loose.

616
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:21,120
If anyone sees them, they can give tips

617
00:47:21,191 --> 00:47:23,360
to the police officers.

618
00:47:33,157 --> 00:47:35,440
I tried but I was too slow.

619
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:38,480
We're both too slow to save Bam.

620
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,283
I know that you think of him more than friend.

621
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,520
You can tell him that you like him, it's not that hard.

622
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,560
You need to think really hard about your murderers

623
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,400
otherwise we're all in big trouble, you hear me?

624
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,640
I remember now. / Bam's murderers have silver lighter.

625
00:47:53,097 --> 00:47:56,240
You need to help me catch them all, okay?

626
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,640
And they will need to pay, hard.

627
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,100
Damn it!
