1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,020
It's okay, he's my friend. / Huh?

2
00:00:08,157 --> 00:00:11,480
You fell off this high. If I could bet, my money would be on your death.

3
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:13,300
Damn it! She's gone. / What?

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,320
Sek, you need to hide her body so that no one can find her.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,120
But I'm not sure if you would get your girl back dead or alive.

6
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:21,278
I know everything

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,057
I know that you both used to live in the same orphanage.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,680
This is drug! / What?

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,120
Don't mess with my drugs.

10
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:30,800
Hand me five million.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,880
You all need to drop your guns. This is an order.

12
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,360
Dung? / A monk.

13
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:40,360
How about Mr.Bomb?

14
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:44,000
How did you know about this place?

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,723
I often delivered drugs at this place.

16
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:47,600
I love you.

17
00:00:51,423 --> 00:00:53,400
Wang?

18
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:13,538
Wang?

19
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:26,760
You're up?

20
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:32,024
Bam? Is that you?

21
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:35,940
Your hair is even now, I can't call you by your nickname anymore.

22
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,064
It really is you.

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,201
You know what?

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,840
I've been looking for you everywhere since I left the orphanage.

25
00:01:56,237 --> 00:01:58,560
I wanted you to see that I can be a police officer like I wish.

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,560
I'll protect you like you did when we we were young.

27
00:02:13,603 --> 00:02:15,520
At the end, I became the same kid,

28
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,880
a loser who can't save anyone.

29
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,080
I was too late and you are…

30
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:31,280
Don't blame yourself.

31
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:40,560
I'm glad

32
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,520
that you become an officer like you dreamed of.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,120
I'm sure that you will be an excellent one.

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,520
But you need to go now.

35
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:53,984
Nope.

36
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:55,638
I'm not going.

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,520
Where do you want me to go? I will stay here with you.

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,241
Of course, you need to leave.

39
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:03,360
There're so many people waiting for you to protect them.

40
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,091
Just go.

41
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,880
I have one more thing to tell you.

42
00:03:14,857 --> 00:03:15,858
I….

43
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,750
I love you.

44
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:29,720
What did you say?

45
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,138
Wang?

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,801
Wang?

47
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,543
I love you,

48
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:54,499
Bam.

49
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:10,440
I love you,

50
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,471
Bam.

51
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,880
Hey, it's you.

52
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,880
Did I just fall asleep?

53
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:40,563
Since when?

54
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,161
When you're done helping with Ah.

55
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,120
You told everyone to get some rest.

56
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:50,303
I walked over here and saw you fell asleep.

57
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,050
I dreamed about Bam.

58
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,751
That's why

59
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,120
you said that word.

60
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:23,958
What word?

61
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:30,317
Nothing.

62
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,480
You said this and that.

63
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:39,680
Why did you carry Bam's whistle around your neck?

64
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,970
What happened, Miss?

65
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,840
Bam ran away.

66
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,280
She left this for you.

67
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,240
I'm sorry for running away without telling you first.

68
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,480
I don't want to be kept captive in this cage anymore.

69
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,881
You should keep this whistle.

70
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,120
If somebody tries to hurt you,

71
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,440
you can blow it to get some help.

72
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,000
Your friend always, Bam.

73
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:43,084
That's the story, shortly after that

74
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:44,960
a family adopted me.

75
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
They raised me well.

76
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,927
They sent me to school.

77
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,520
I changed my identity gradually from Wang

78
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:56,560
to become Dan.

79
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,800
I thought that everything would turn out well like my life.

80
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,680
Why's that?

81
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,100
I tried so hard but I was still too late.

82
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,240
If you talked about Bam, we both were too late.

83
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,050
Can I ask you something?

84
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,961
What's that?

85
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,200
You still loved Bam, didn't you?

86
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:36,779
What if it's you?

87
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:40,720
Can you forget your first love?

88
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:49,518
Of course not.

89
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,480
Who could forget their first love?

90
00:08:57,943 --> 00:08:59,440
Wait.

91
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:01,724
What?

92
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,200
You had a crush on someone? You?

93
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,491
Who's that?

94
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:09,158
Who?

95
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:12,158
Who's that?

96
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,160
I'll be right back. / Wait.

97
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,361
Where're you going?

98
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,240
I'll find Dung. He could help you identify Bam's cause of death.

99
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,280
He's a doctor.

100
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,080
If he helps you look at Bam's body with you,

101
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,360
perhaps we could find out how she died.

102
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:48,000
If we find out how she died,

103
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,760
it could lead to her killer.

104
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:52,218
Right?

105
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:55,100
You're right.

106
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,311
I'll be back.

107
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,800
Mr.Deputy? Can we ask you a few questions? / Mr. Deputy?

108
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,320
What's the cause of shooting in the hotel?

109
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:14,960
We saw that it was related to homicide case earlier,

110
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:18,560
including drug dealer and 5 million baht got stolen by Ping,

111
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,360
from Mr. Charn's foundation.

112
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,561
Is it true?

113
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,280
An officer has involved with the crime and he ran away with the criminals.

114
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:29,080
What's your opinion?

115
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:36,800
I shouldn't have brought it to you. Fine, I'll drink them all.

116
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,051
Hey!

117
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,320
You're that thirsty.

118
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,280
You like him that much?

119
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:56,544
What?

120
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,081
Of course, you do.

121
00:10:59,597 --> 00:11:01,800
I shouldn't have asked. / What the hell are you talking about?

122
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:02,964
Officer Dan.

123
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,720
I know that you think of him more than just friend.

124
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,680
How I feel about him

125
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,560
is none of your business.

126
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,300
You normally are so brave.

127
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:21,760
Why aren't you brave about this stuff?

128
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,400
You can just tell him that you like him.

129
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,800
It's not that hard.

130
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,791
It must be easy for you

131
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:38,800
to tell them that you like them. / That's right.

132
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,720
I'm about to do it now.

133
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,400
I like you.

134
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,560
Nonsense. It's not the time. / Not joking.

135
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm being serious.

136
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,320
Since hectic situation has happened and we ended up here,

137
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,200
I can't help but wonder if we will survive until the next day.

138
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,840
I just want you to know about it

139
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,600
when I still have a chance to say it.

140
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,520
Now I feel better when I let you know.

141
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,480
You should seize the moment.

142
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,960
If you love someone, just tell him.

143
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:43,518
I shouldn't have drunk too much water. I'm sorry.

144
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,960
Who put her body in the trunk when it was so chaos at the hotel?

145
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,191
It's me.

146
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:06,450
I couldn't leave her behind

147
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:09,400
if I still can't figure out her cause of death and who did it.

148
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,331
Hey,

149
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:13,240
let's look at her body.

150
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:20,070
There's no wounds.

151
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,700
Dear viewers, did you hear that?

152
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,360
The officer said that there're no wounds.

153
00:13:26,477 --> 00:13:30,880
I just saw a couple of small bruises.

154
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:31,984
Hear that?

155
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,520
He also said that there were only small bruises, people.

156
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,520
I don't think these bruises could cause her to die. / See?

157
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,480
Small bruises can't bring her to death.

158
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,200
This is plot….. / Twist.

159
00:13:48,357 --> 00:13:50,920
Twist / You hit me so hard.

160
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:53,120
Stop playing around. They're serious about this.

161
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,250
I know that you're all working.

162
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,680
I don't want it to be so tense.

163
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,700
Don't you think

164
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,000
that this content is kinda cool?

165
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,480
Get out of here. Give it to me.

166
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:11,040
I'll keep it. You can't play with it.

167
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,960
Go! This is not the time and place. / Fine.

168
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,481
Watch your head!

169
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,680
Now I hit my head thanks to you.

170
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,120
Hey, look at this.

171
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:36,360
What? / You saw that too?

172
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,600
I see nothing. / Come on.

173
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,600
You said it like you saw it. / Too dark.

174
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,041
Here, take it.

175
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,081
Wrong side.

176
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,240
That's why it's too bright.

177
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:55,818
See?

178
00:14:58,603 --> 00:14:59,960
Something pointy injected her.

179
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,360
And it's inflamed around the area.

180
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,400
My guess is syringe.

181
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:07,343
Syringe?

182
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,760
So someone injected something to her?

183
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,720
No idea. / What?

184
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:17,330
Why're you so surprised? I'm an OB/GYN.

185
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,640
If you want to know the cause of her death, send her to forensic team.

186
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,320
What's on your mind?

187
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,851
We're in the middle of nowhere. It's hard enough to get out without

188
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,200
getting caught by officers.

189
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:27,918
Wait.

190
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,801
I remember it now.

191
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,100
There was this one case where the criminal

192
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:37,930
used syringe containing overdosed drug, injected into the victim's body,

193
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,031
hoping to cover up a crime.

194
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:44,440
It could be how Bam died.

195
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,131
We're in big trouble.

196
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,800
This is a picture of suspects in shooting case,

197
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,600
took place in Prachuap Khiri Khan.

198
00:15:57,783 --> 00:16:00,440
The suspects are on loose.

199
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,280
We don't know exactly what happened.

200
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:07,720
Considering from officers' footage,

201
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:11,160
we can recognize three out of eight suspects.

202
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,011
One of them is the medium named Ping or Panrika.

203
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,840
She's a notorious medium

204
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,100
because she stole money

205
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,240
from Mr. Charn's foundation.

206
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:25,240
Another one is Phee or Kittiwat.

207
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,641
He's a son of a steel businessman.

208
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,120
He's also a celeb and well-known.

209
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:37,880
The last one is Ter or Sarunkorn.

210
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,001
Let's go back to scandal a year ago,

211
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:43,000
he involved in drunk and drive case.

212
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:45,010
He hit a family with his car

213
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:49,350
they were all dead and the court sentenced him to jail.

214
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:52,160
We still have no idea why these people

215
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:56,200
involved with shooting case. They're suspected to be involved with drug dealer

216
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,120
or stealing money. Any viewers who got leads

217
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,160
can report to the police immediately.

218
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,761
Apart from that, they also abducted a monk

219
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:09,400
and a dog. Poor things.

220
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,360
We have no idea how they could do such thing.

221
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,280
This is so messed up and super fake.

222
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:18,360
I didn't go to jail, I was on suspension.

223
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,920
It's not just fake but it's so wrong.

224
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,971
We didn't abduct a monk. He's here on his own.

225
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,120
That's right. I wanted to come.

226
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:31,357
What's wrong? You're worried to be arrested?

227
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,050
Not about being arrested but I'm scared of my mom.

228
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,440
What's wrong? It's not my fault that I'm scared of Mom.

229
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,000
If she sees that news, then I'm a dead man.

230
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,120
Wait. / What?

231
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,960
They said that we also abducted a dog.

232
00:17:53,943 --> 00:17:54,944
What dog?

233
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,240
You mean this dog?

234
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,200
When did he follow us?

235
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,370
It's not over yet.

236
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,258
What is it now?

237
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,200
You all should know about it by now.

238
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,370
These people are dangerous, they're drug dealers.

239
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,360
They stole money and they owned weapons.

240
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,520
Also, they killed Bam or Kamolrapee Ampanwit.

241
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,651
Don't you worry.

242
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,100
We will find them and arrest them.

243
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:31,760
This has gone too far, damn it!

244
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,680
Am I a murderer now?

245
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,700
So long my bright future.

246
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,040
This is why we need to find Bam's killer.

247
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:43,080
So we can prove it to the police.

248
00:18:43,543 --> 00:18:44,600
How could we find them?

249
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:49,244
What? / Ping

250
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,441
Bam.

251
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:54,418
Where are you?

252
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,031
Bam.

253
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,777
Come out here, I need to talk to you. / Ping.

254
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,000
You called me out here and you're scared of me again.

255
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:04,720
Sorry. I'm not used to it.

256
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,080
You need to figure out what happened

257
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,050
before you died and how you ended up in the back of this car.

258
00:19:17,163 --> 00:19:20,360
Tried to thing of something or we all will be in big grouble, okay?

259
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,418
And?

260
00:19:24,843 --> 00:19:26,800
This thing on your neck,

261
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:28,850
can I help you think of something?

262
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,480
Try to think.

263
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,480
I can think of something.

264
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,760
I got injected

265
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,400
and then I saw silver lighter.

266
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:48,900
Bam said that her killer got a silver lighter.

267
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:01,958
Damn it!

268
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,720
Wang? Wang?

269
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:13,804
It's you!

270
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,600
Calm down. He has a silver lighter

271
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:19,920
but we knew that he wasn't a killer since we were on a rooftop.

272
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:22,120
He didn't kill her on the rooftop but he could do it somewhere else.

273
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,520
You didn't it, do you? Why did you kill her?

274
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,440
Calm down. Phee wouldn't do it.

275
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,300
Phee is a pure son of a bitch and he has done so many bad things but

276
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,400
he's not a killer. / Are you trying to help me?

277
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:39,680
Ter, please say something.

278
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,250
Say something, come on.

279
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,111
Ter?

280
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,160
Or Phee could be a killer and we didn't know about it?

281
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,210
Why did you say that?

282
00:20:50,743 --> 00:20:52,120
I tried not to think about it

283
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:54,760
but you see that Phee owns a silver lighter.

284
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,600
What happened on the rooftop is his own words,

285
00:20:58,837 --> 00:20:59,960
there's no evidence to support.

286
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,557
Unlike us, we have camera footage to prove, we got witnesses.

287
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,500
We believed what he said.

288
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,240
I don't know. I don't know if I can trust him.

289
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,000
But Bam confirmed that he didn't kill her.

290
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:16,504
That's right.

291
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:19,163
But your friend's memories can't be relied on.

292
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,401
Are you sure about that?

293
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:23,002
He's right. / What?

294
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:25,100
What is wrong with you?

295
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,161
Wait.

296
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,160
We assumed that the cause of Bam's death

297
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:32,920
is overdosed, isn't it?

298
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,101
Phee didn't use any drugs, how could be carry a syringe?

299
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,360
I'm not surprised if it's Dung. / That's true.

300
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:45,960
What? I have my medical kit but I don't have any syringe.

301
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,400
We talked about the lighter, how did it end up here?

302
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,001
What's going on?

303
00:22:26,037 --> 00:22:27,160
I forgot.

304
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,181
I quit smoking.

305
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,241
I don't think you called me here for a cigarette.

306
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,120
You told me that you can find them

307
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,000
along with Ah so easily.

308
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:41,844
What does that mean?

309
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:46,560
If I agree to tell you,

310
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,600
you're gonna offer me with a great deal, aren't you?

311
00:22:58,263 --> 00:22:59,264
Yep.

312
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,000
It's the best deal that will bring you a brighter smile.

313
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,160
But if you betrayed me,

314
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,640
you won't be able to smile for the rest of your life.

315
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:18,104
Okay?

316
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:31,280
I love my dog so much.

317
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,281
I don't want to lose him.

318
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,000
So I installed tracking device to his collar.

319
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:47,000
Now you know how easy it is to find them.

320
00:23:52,777 --> 00:23:54,440
Wait, I can think of something.

321
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,400
There's this one person who could own syringe

322
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,200
drugs and a silver lighter.

323
00:23:59,823 --> 00:24:00,480
Who?

324
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,961
He's Ah.

325
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,230
What the hell?

326
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:15,604
It's pee.

327
00:24:23,237 --> 00:24:24,760
What are you doing here?

328
00:24:30,283 --> 00:24:33,120
What? They healed my wound and tied me up?

329
00:24:33,423 --> 00:24:35,121
So they're mean or nice?

330
00:24:40,023 --> 00:24:41,024
You made a mistake.

331
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,601
This thing got nothing on me.

332
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,851
Here.

333
00:24:57,753 --> 00:24:58,754
Damn it, too hot.

334
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:02,160
What're you looking at? You think you're so smart?

335
00:25:02,497 --> 00:25:06,390
If you're so good, why don't you bring me a knife or something to cute the rope?

336
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:13,680
Well, you're good.

337
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:15,400
The genius dog.

338
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,000
Stick? Why did you bring me a stick? I need a knife.

339
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,030
Get me a knife.

340
00:25:29,243 --> 00:25:30,244
A ball?

341
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,400
I don't want a ball. It's not time to play.

342
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:35,724
Get me a knife.

343
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,800
Well done, a bone f or me to chew on? Stupid!

344
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,320
Why would I need a bone for? Get me a knife.

345
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,144
My gun?

346
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,071
To shoot you?

347
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,600
Are you a dog or a god of forest, look what you brought me!

348
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:08,000
You killed Bam and you played it cool?

349
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:14,160
What're you talking about? / You have a silver lighter.

350
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,960
You have drugs. You killed Bam.

351
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,960
She's my girl. Why would I kill her? / Jealousy.

352
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,000
I remembered that you told your guys to punch Ter because of jealousy.

353
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:28,040
That's right.

354
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,440
But I'm worried about her like she's my kid. I didn't kill her.

355
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,050
I loved her like my kid.

356
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,160
A bastard like you can say anything.

357
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,650
Good. You're not gonna believe me, are you?

358
00:26:37,783 --> 00:26:40,120
If you don't believe me, then just shoot me.

359
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,301
Shoot me. / Don't talk to me like that.

360
00:26:41,323 --> 00:26:43,480
Go on, shoot me.

361
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:45,520
Right, just shoot me.

362
00:26:58,677 --> 00:27:00,990
Calm down, don't shoot me.

363
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,000
You're weak. / I can swear anywhere

364
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,100
I really didn't kill her.

365
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,520
Good thing that you're here. Can you come up with anything?

366
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,200
Is he the one who killed you?

367
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,630
I'm not sure.

368
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,720
You need to think hard.

369
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,080
What? She can talk to Bam?

370
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,320
That's right. Ping can see Bam.

371
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,800
So they can communicate.

372
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,360
If you really can communicate with Bam,

373
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,661
why don't you ask….. / Already did.

374
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,520
She said she didn't remember.

375
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,000
Didn't remember my a--.

376
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,050
You killed her, didn't you? / I didn't kill Bam.

377
00:27:50,197 --> 00:27:52,720
You have a silver lighter, you have drugs, of course you do.

378
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,360
Right. I have a silver lighter and I have drugs.

379
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,360
But I didn't kill her.

380
00:27:57,503 --> 00:28:00,470
You're such a liar, right in our faces.

381
00:28:00,617 --> 00:28:02,520
Did you see that?

382
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:06,100
That's enough. / Just confess.

383
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,920
I didn't kill Bam.

384
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:17,844
Stop!

385
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,480
Listen to me. I can think of something.

386
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,640
People carry their phones all the time, right?

387
00:28:27,563 --> 00:28:31,120
I haven't seen her phone since I saw Bam.

388
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,921
If we can find her phone,

389
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,880
we could learn something more.

390
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,080
Perhaps we could find out who killed Bam.

391
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,360
Do you know where her phone is?

392
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:49,600
We found her body in the trunk, right?

393
00:28:57,043 --> 00:29:00,720
Dear viewers, if we find Bam's phone,

394
00:29:00,837 --> 00:29:03,120
then we'll know the killer.

395
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,640
And we all will be off the hook.

396
00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:10,200
Because there is only one truth.

397
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,760
Who kicked me? / It's me.

398
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,960
What? / Sorry.

399
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,361
I can't hold it any longer. / Hey!

400
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,800
next time just tell me first, I can set up a camera and film a content.

401
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:31,840
Oops. / Sorry.

402
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,091
Hey!

403
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:38,960
You really can see Bam and talk to her?

404
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,161
That's right.

405
00:29:43,057 --> 00:29:45,577
That's cool. / Cool what?

406
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,023
I don't want to see dead people.

407
00:29:48,317 --> 00:29:49,720
Especially, my best friend.

408
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,291
Think before you speak.

409
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,761
Found it.

410
00:29:57,957 --> 00:29:58,958
Yep.

411
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
That's her phone. I remember it.

412
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,181
Wait, is it? / What?

413
00:30:07,277 --> 00:30:08,280
Think carefully.

414
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,440
I found it under the carpet inside.

415
00:30:14,663 --> 00:30:17,000
That's why nobody found it before.

416
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:20,718
It's locked.

417
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,100
Ask Bam for the passcode. / That's right.

418
00:30:33,172 --> 00:30:35,080
What is your passcode? / Right.

419
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:37,445
I don't remember.

420
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,920
She said that she didn't remember.

421
00:30:43,857 --> 00:30:45,000
What a forgetful ghost!

422
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,680
Have you ever eaten anything to nourish your brain when you were alive?

423
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,640
Cod liver oil, vitamin B complex, Ginkgo extract, that kind of things?

424
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,961
You only drank liquor, it ruined your brain!

425
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,162
You're a monk. Can you preach a ghost like this?

426
00:30:58,197 --> 00:30:59,360
I wouldn't dare preach a human.

427
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,520
You're right. / Sorry, I forgot.

428
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,300
You bless. / Bless you.

429
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,160
But I used face scan.

430
00:31:21,503 --> 00:31:22,961
I got in!

431
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:27,320
It looked like there was a clip from last night.

432
00:31:31,637 --> 00:31:33,560
When someone discovered this clip,

433
00:31:34,323 --> 00:31:35,920
I would be dead already.

434
00:31:50,597 --> 00:31:52,560
Let me go. / I won't.

435
00:31:52,683 --> 00:31:53,840
Bam!

436
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,700
Are you okay? / I'm fine.

437
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:06,400
Come on, let me help you.

438
00:32:06,683 --> 00:32:09,300
It's okay. I can get up.

439
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,351
I'm ready.

440
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,151
Let's go back to our room.

441
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:57,760
I saw you walking around all night and I can't take it anymore.

442
00:33:00,303 --> 00:33:02,320
Are you gonna tell me where my drugs are?

443
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,731
Sek!

444
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,520
Listen to me.

445
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,021
I just want to know where the drugs are, just tell me.

446
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,050
And I'll split my profit with you.

447
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:22,353
You can live a freedom life like you wish.

448
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:24,200
Win-win situation, isn't it great?

449
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,291
Yeah?

450
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,560
You betrayed your boss for this, how can I be so sure that you won't betray me?

451
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
I'm not stupid enough to trust a son of a bitch like you.

452
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,040
No, Ah is a real son of a bitch.

453
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,141
If I continue to work for him, I would be his servant.

454
00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:46,480
This is my time to start something of my own.

455
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,040
Don't get in my way, where're my drugs?

456
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,040
Fine, I'll tell you.

457
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,400
I threw them away.

458
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,761
You can look for it in hell.

459
00:34:02,497 --> 00:34:03,440
Bitch! / Ouch!

460
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,880
You think you're so smart?

461
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,881
Shoot me so the whole place can hear you.

462
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,682
You think you have the better hand?

463
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,057
Let me go, what're you doing?

464
00:34:42,757 --> 00:34:44,000
If you told me where the drugs are,

465
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,000
I'll help you not to be overdosed.

466
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:52,074
Where are my drugs?

467
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,520
Is everything okay?

468
00:34:56,643 --> 00:34:58,000
Nothing, family stuff.

469
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,480
Where is she?

470
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:29,160
You think you can runaway from me?

471
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,320
Can you tell me where my drugs are?

472
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,801
Where are my drugs? Tell me!

473
00:35:37,057 --> 00:35:39,200
Tell me where they are!

474
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:44,104
What the hell?

475
00:35:51,603 --> 00:35:52,840
If you refuse to tell me,

476
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,440
then you're gonna die here, bitch!

477
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,960
You think you can win this fight?

478
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:12,720
I'll find the drugs that you're hiding.

479
00:36:13,183 --> 00:36:14,184
Drugs?

480
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,361
Drugs?

481
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:17,960
And you'll die here.

482
00:36:22,157 --> 00:36:23,160
Help!

483
00:36:23,743 --> 00:36:26,050
Please, help! Anybody.

484
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:27,984
Help!

485
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,880
When someone discovered this clip,

486
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:50,200
I would be dead already.

487
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,840
Sek killed me.

488
00:36:58,243 --> 00:37:01,040
He foreced me to betray on Ah

489
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,760
so that he would be a drug dealer himself.

490
00:37:07,223 --> 00:37:10,690
He worked with a police officer. I didn't know his real name.

491
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,880
But I heard him called

492
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:15,058
Mr.Deputy.

493
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,280
He said that he'd set me free

494
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,300
but I couldn't betray on Ah.

495
00:37:24,823 --> 00:37:28,280
And I don't believe that an asshole like Sek

496
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,560
will let me go easily.

497
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,800
I will be free soon, Ping.

498
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,040
Don't you worry about me.

499
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:49,100
Start off you new life well

500
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,000
with great happiness.

501
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,600
I love you,

502
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:04,064
Ping.

503
00:38:22,297 --> 00:38:23,640
Sek killed me.

504
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,120
He killed me.

505
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,200
How could he do this to me? I didn't want to die.

506
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,200
How could he?

507
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,543
Yahoo!

508
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:52,880
We finally found out who killed Bam. We're off the hook.

509
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:56,283
Stop! Stop!

510
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,843
It's not the time to be funny. Come on.

511
00:39:07,457 --> 00:39:08,870
What should we do next after hearing the truth?

512
00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:13,250
We will send this clip to the police, to tell them who killed Bam.

513
00:39:13,903 --> 00:39:15,640
And this is to confirm that we're innocent.

514
00:39:17,797 --> 00:39:18,800
And the asshole Sek

515
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,360
will be arrested and go to jail.

516
00:39:21,543 --> 00:39:23,883
Arrested what? He needed to die.

517
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,250
If I see him, I'll kill him with my own hands.

518
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,100
I won't let you do that.

519
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,010
There're rules and law to follow.

520
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:32,100
Law and police officers like you

521
00:39:32,397 --> 00:39:33,960
caused us to be in this situation,

522
00:39:36,377 --> 00:39:37,960
we became a thief,

523
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:40,218
drug dealer, monk and dog kidnappers.

524
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:42,219
People also accused us of killing Bam.

525
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,362
Didn't you hear what Bam said earlier?

526
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:47,680
Sek is working with horrible police officers.

527
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,520
It was all happened because of police officer like you.

528
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,441
Where can we find Sek, I think he could run away by now.

529
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,310
No need to search for him.

530
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:08,160
I have my way to make him come to us.

531
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,960
Why did he walk up there?

532
00:40:15,137 --> 00:40:17,083
Can you get him out of here? So annoying.

533
00:40:20,497 --> 00:40:21,520
What's your next move?

534
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:29,558
Can you tell us now?

535
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,221
Why? He asked and you mumbled something.

536
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,040
The glue to your dentures is about to come off?

537
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,120
Is this.

538
00:40:40,763 --> 00:40:42,482
Where is Ah?

539
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,321
I have no idea where he is. I need to wait for him to reach me back.

540
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,320
But you can still deliver the drugs as we discussed.

541
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:54,440
Sure, if I can make it,

542
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,841
you will forgive me about the drugs that I caused a mistake, will you?

543
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,760
Of course, then you can come and work for me.

544
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,880
Okay, Mr.Deputy.

545
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:07,118
Deal!

546
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:19,800
Believe me that everything is according to our plan.

547
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:23,480
We can start our new drug dealer business.

548
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:48,863
Where have you been?

549
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,100
I thought you left me already.

550
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,120
I was on the phone. / With who?

551
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,720
Thank you. I'm starving.

552
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,920
What? Fried rice?

553
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,160
A western guy like me wants some spaghetti.

554
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:15,050
Just kidding, you're so mean.

555
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:28,491
Right.

556
00:42:29,497 --> 00:42:31,880
Thank you for saving my life.

557
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,120
Otherwise, I would end up in jail

558
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,840
or simply die.

559
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:53,931
Hello, Boss.

560
00:42:56,563 --> 00:42:57,564
Sek?

561
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,200
You're safe, right?

562
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,201
I'm safe.

563
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,560
Pao and I ran away.

564
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,500
We're hiding away in a safe house.

565
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,700
Where are you?

566
00:43:09,677 --> 00:43:11,570
I saw you got in the car and fled with them.

567
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,480
What was that?

568
00:43:13,817 --> 00:43:17,120
I didn't have a choice. They brought me along.

569
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,640
Can you come and pick me up tomorrow?

570
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,361
Where to?

571
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,960
You remember a place where we delivered drugs to Bang Mad?

572
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,161
I do.

573
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:28,524
Good.

574
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,680
I'll bring 5 million and drugs to wait for you there.

575
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,361
Got it.

576
00:43:38,123 --> 00:43:40,323
Sek? Boss is still alive, isn't he?

577
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:41,731
Yup.

578
00:43:42,943 --> 00:43:45,200
We're gonna go and see him? / Sure.

579
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,721
It's revenge time.

580
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,463
We're gonna get them back so good.

581
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,100
Monday, 16 at 07:50 AM.

582
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,480
You need to stop acting like this.

583
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,760
We're done with our part. Why're you still involving in their part?

584
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,200
Let the police handle it.

585
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,360
I want to help her. / Help?

586
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,440
Help with what? Look at us!

587
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,956
How could we help anyone? We barely made it out alive.

588
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,320
We're so lucky to be alive.

589
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,040
It's time for us to pack up and go.

590
00:44:30,123 --> 00:44:31,360
Let's deal with our own things.

591
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,761
I need to clear thing out about working abroad.

592
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,120
Dung needs to talk to his Mom.

593
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,560
And you need to talk to your family and your Dad.

594
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,720
And Jok. / Yeah?

595
00:44:43,317 --> 00:44:44,320
You need to deal with what?

596
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,480
You made me feel small again, with my debts.

597
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,000
That's right.

598
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,910
See? This is real life.

599
00:44:54,957 --> 00:44:56,640
This is what…. / I totally get it.

600
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,100
I understand.

601
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,000
But you don't get me. / Why don't I get you?

602
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:04,040
You're attracted to her. You want to show her how tough you are.

603
00:45:06,657 --> 00:45:09,263
What's with that medium woman anyway? / Fine, I admit it.

604
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,721
I like her.

605
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,000
I like her since I first met her.

606
00:45:15,117 --> 00:45:17,440
I like her like I've never liked anyone before.

607
00:45:17,597 --> 00:45:19,480
But it's not the main reason.

608
00:45:19,623 --> 00:45:21,480
It's not about all that love nonsense.

609
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,920
It's about my life.

610
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,000
Your life? How? / You told me that I'm such a loser.

611
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,600
I've never done anything good in my life.

612
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:32,160
I've always caused you some troubles, as well as my family.

613
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,250
I wanted to help her

614
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,440
because I think this is a chance.

615
00:45:37,077 --> 00:45:38,078
A chance?

616
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,680
For me to prove myself, to do the right thing.

617
00:46:01,263 --> 00:46:03,880
You need to hide in the bush,

618
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,720
behind the hill. And I'll wait for them here.

619
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:11,000
When I give you signal, you can come out and ambush him.

620
00:46:11,483 --> 00:46:12,484
Okay?

621
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,801
Okay.

622
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,641
Give me the gun.

623
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,000
What gun? / Your gun that you took from me last night.

624
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,801
Give it to me.

625
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:26,120
Damn it!

626
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:35,084
I agreed with your plan because I want to arrest Sek alive.

627
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:38,500
We got the clips, evidence and him.

628
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,280
He will spend his time in jail for sure.

629
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,160
You're so sure about this?

630
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:46,770
Go! Go back there and hide.

631
00:47:12,883 --> 00:47:13,884
Hey!

632
00:47:15,323 --> 00:47:16,520
Don't forget our deal.

633
00:47:17,937 --> 00:47:20,520
You need to help me arrest all of them.

634
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:23,050
And then you will get your dog back.

635
00:47:23,417 --> 00:47:25,800
I'll talk to my guys about having you as witnesses.

636
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,121
Okay?

637
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:31,911
Hey!

638
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,320
They're moving.

639
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,440
My dog is with them.

640
00:47:37,603 --> 00:47:38,640
Moving?

641
00:47:40,717 --> 00:47:41,800
To where?

642
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:46,320
Damn it! It's so far.

643
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:47,720
Why didn't you drive to this place?

644
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:48,880
Stop whining already.

645
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,761
You know what?

646
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,280
When I was here to deliver drugs with Boss,

647
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:55,810
let me tell you,

648
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:59,130
it gave me thriller movie vibe. / Yeah?

649
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:02,000
Where is he hiding?

650
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,841
How could I know? I'm here with you. Let's look for him.

651
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,721
Boss?

652
00:48:09,457 --> 00:48:10,458
Boss?

653
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:14,040
He's not a rooster, is this a joke?

654
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,200
You hit me right in the head and at my wound.

655
00:48:16,881 --> 00:48:17,960
I just got shot.

656
00:48:19,817 --> 00:48:20,818
Boss?

657
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,920
Boss? I'm here.

658
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,640
Thank you for risking your life to pick me up.

659
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,440
Where're money and drugs?

660
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,120
Come on, where are they?

661
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:45,563
Why're you here with nothing in your hands?

662
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,561
You care only for money and drugs? You don't care about me?

663
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,840
Did you make another deal with someone else?

664
00:48:58,863 --> 00:49:01,550
You have another supporter, haven't you?

665
00:49:02,703 --> 00:49:06,250
You don't want to hang out with me, instead, you're siding with that police officer.

666
00:49:07,963 --> 00:49:09,200
What're you talking about?

667
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,440
I don't get it.

668
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,521
Let me make it easy for you to understand.

669
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,761
I didn't bring drugs and money.

670
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,280
And I know who killed Bam.

671
00:49:37,863 --> 00:49:39,200
You need to stop.

672
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,840
What is it?

673
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,523
I just want to know why we need to bring the dog.

674
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,840
How did he get here?

675
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,880
You're sitting with him and you didn't know? Stupid you!

676
00:49:53,521 --> 00:49:56,200
What should we do? Should we bring him back?

677
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,160
You know his owner?

678
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,160
Where to return?

679
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,680
You want to live with me, Lucky?

680
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:07,960
You named him?

681
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,520
You love him that much? Moron?

682
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,560
You're not talking to me, right?

683
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,561
What're you talking about?

684
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:16,843
Who would dare to scold you?

685
00:50:18,592 --> 00:50:19,880
I'm sorry.

686
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,241
Sek.

687
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,720
You killed Bam, didn't you?

688
00:50:37,058 --> 00:50:38,059
Wait.

689
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,320
Sek? Killed Bam?

690
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,200
Tell me, damn it!

691
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,601
That's right.

692
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:55,040
I killed Bam and I'm about to kill you.

693
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,440
What the hell? / Get out of the way.

694
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,281
I trusted you

695
00:51:03,481 --> 00:51:05,082
and this is how you pay me?

696
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,960
How could you do this to me?

697
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,280
Tell me.

698
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,000
Why did you betray me, you stupid son?

699
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,880
You didn't call me son quite often.

700
00:51:25,563 --> 00:51:29,720
Do you want to know why I did all of these?

701
00:51:33,063 --> 00:51:34,300
It's because of you.

702
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,201
You've never seen me.

703
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,560
Since you've met Bam,

704
00:51:44,177 --> 00:51:46,050
you loved her, you adored her.

705
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,840
He's your favorite girl.

706
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:55,363
I'm your real son, Dad. / Don't blame me.

707
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,320
It's because of you.

708
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,250
How many times have you let me down?

709
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,561
I've let you down?

710
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,080
You've disappointed in me since Mom carried me, haven't you? / That's right.

711
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,881
Your Mom is a whore.

712
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,680
She betrayed me and had an affair.

713
00:52:19,797 --> 00:52:22,880
You can't talk about her like that. / Why can't I?

714
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,001
To make it worse,

715
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,480
she got pregnant with that guy and I needed to raise the kid.

716
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,800
I've raised you until now

717
00:52:33,423 --> 00:52:34,560
and you should thank me.

718
00:52:35,343 --> 00:52:37,180
Son of a bitch!

719
00:52:47,237 --> 00:52:48,238
Damn it!

720
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,400
No bullets for you.

721
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,000
You think that

722
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,480
I'd be stupid enough to let you shoot me?

723
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:15,671
Boss?

724
00:53:17,217 --> 00:53:18,218
Damn it!

725
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:20,520
Wait for me.

726
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,520
Did you hear that too?

727
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,050
This one is for talking trash about my Mom.

728
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,800
This one

729
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,920
is for talking trash about me, Dad.

730
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,640
And the last one

731
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,050
is for you, you've never loved me.

732
00:54:06,023 --> 00:54:07,024
Sek!

733
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,601
Sek! What the hell did you do? / None of your business.

734
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:14,640
Drop the gun.

735
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:16,531
Watch out!

736
00:54:38,163 --> 00:54:39,560
Look at me, don't fall asleep.

737
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:40,771
Don't fall asleep.

738
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:43,640
Pao? / How could you do that? How could you kill him?

739
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:46,200
Oh my! Phee's heart stops beating.

740
00:54:47,223 --> 00:54:48,957
Hello, my bro. / Son of a bitch.

741
00:54:49,124 --> 00:54:50,600
I think you should drop your gun.

742
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,920
You won't win no matter how matter times you've tried.

743
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:55,351
Are you sure about that?

744
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:03,120
I'll use you one last time, then I'll kill you.
