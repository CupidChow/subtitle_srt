1
00:00:06,597 --> 00:00:07,498
Don't do it!

2
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:09,840
Stay still. / Stay away from my drugs!

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,200
Hand me that 5 million. Now!

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,840
Give me back my drugs.

5
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:28,470
I think everyone should calm down.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,560
Lower your guns and just talk.

7
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:32,624
I won't do it! / Hey!

8
00:00:32,724 --> 00:00:33,725
I won't either! / Hey!

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,520
I won't lower my gun! / I know!

10
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:38,960
Nobody listens to me!

11
00:00:39,697 --> 00:00:42,080
This is officer speaking, are you gonna lower your guns?

12
00:00:48,663 --> 00:00:50,080
You all are under arrest.

13
00:00:50,703 --> 00:00:53,120
Drop your guns. This is an order.

14
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:55,664
Drop them!

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,040
Do you think we could have a better chance

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,560
at dead or alive under this situation?

17
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:15,240
How did I end up in this crazy and messy situation?

18
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:18,200
It was all started two days ago.

19
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,480
Friday, 13 at 2:00 PM.

20
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:26,960
Amen.

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,200
Let me go. Let me go!

22
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,321
I told you to let me go!

23
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,201
Let me go!

24
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:42,120
Grandma, grandpa, please help my husband.

25
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:44,040
I don't know what's wrong with him.

26
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:49,320
I know it. I see it.

27
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:52,200
He misbehaved.

28
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,760
He peed all over Tani's spirit house

29
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,120
so he was possessed.

30
00:03:00,783 --> 00:03:04,720
Who do you think you are, taking over a human's body like this?

31
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:07,650
It's sinful thing to do.

32
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,360
I'll eat his body and I'll take him with me.

33
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:14,300
No. No!

34
00:03:15,923 --> 00:03:17,360
Are you gonna leave or not?

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,880
Why does she sound like this?

36
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,520
There're two people staying in her body right now.

37
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,960
Grandma Kala and Grandpa Kalee, the ghost's guardians.

38
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,880
This is Grandma. You should leave.

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,601
I'm not leaving.

40
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:38,160
Are you gonna leave or not, you asshole! I'm gonna kick you out!

41
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,680
We should be civil about this.

42
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:44,720
It's no use of being nice to this low-life scumbag.

43
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:45,880
He needs to be healed by my feet.

44
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:47,240
Your feet!

45
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,170
That's right, you old hag! / It's none of your business, you stupid!

46
00:03:50,217 --> 00:03:52,200
You called me stupid!

47
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,880
How long are you two gonna fight?

48
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:55,984
Back off!

49
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,200
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:02,680
Stay away from this. / Mind your own damn business!

51
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:04,080
You gonna leave or not?

52
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:27,920
Honey, honey.

53
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,191
Riam!

54
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,121
What happened?

55
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,120
Grandma, grandpa, thank you for saving my husband.

56
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,720
I'd like to offer you something.

57
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,200
I have something to offer.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,320
I'll give it all to you.

59
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,121
Amen.

60
00:04:55,323 --> 00:04:56,324
Amen.

61
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,401
Amen.

62
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,881
Amen.

63
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:03,844
Amen.

64
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:05,924
Amen.

65
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:33,360
We earned THB240,000 today, sir.

66
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,840
Good acting.

67
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,800
Thank you so much.

68
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,120
Thank you. / Thank you.

69
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,120
You know that you can't speak of

70
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,520
this kind of thing.

71
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,250
Or you could be lying down under the ground.

72
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,960
I know.

73
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:13,840
The value of superstitious belief is endless.

74
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,481
We can just provide

75
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,080
a good-acting skill medium

76
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,800
with great magic trick to fool people flawlessly,

77
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:28,363
and stooges to play along.

78
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:31,840
Grandma, grandpa, thank you for saving my husband.

79
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,080
I'd like to offer you something.

80
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,080
I have something to offer.

81
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,680
Amen.

82
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,320
And money will keep on flowing.

83
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,920
That's right. / Okay.

84
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,280
Sir, something bad happened.

85
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,640
It's Ping! She…

86
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:37,258
Ping!

87
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,800
Damn it!

88
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:14,280
What the hell are you doing?

89
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,565
Can't I just try to be cool for a minute?

90
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,600
And you're late. You left me standing in the rain.

91
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,480
Where are we going today?

92
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,520
To arrest a medium. / What?

93
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,080
You're saying that your closest medium

94
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,280
stole 5 million baht from your safety deposit box?

95
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,121
Yeah.

96
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:53,280
You need to arrest her now.

97
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,560
Do you have any evidence that pointed out to her?

98
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
Are you saying that we're framing her?

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,250
Why did you keep asking so many questions?

100
00:09:06,257 --> 00:09:09,080
I told you to arrest her and you should do so.

101
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,560
Sir, but it is…. / Are you really an officer?

102
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,640
What kind of officer are you, honestly?

103
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,840
This is my kind of officer.

104
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,760
You got a problem with that?

105
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,320
This is too close, I'm sorry.

106
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,160
I happened to like to talk to people so closely like this.

107
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:45,000
I can find out if people are good or bad easily.

108
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,281
I'm sorry on behalf of him for treating you that way.

109
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,160
But I can confirm that the medium

110
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,400
really took my money.

111
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:09,520
If you don't believe me, you can check CCTV's footage in this room.

112
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:13,920
The medium

113
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:17,077
is like my own daughter.

114
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:18,680
I'd be fine if she took

115
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,200
5 million baht from my own pocket.

116
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,440
But she stole money from donations

117
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,841
that people contributed.

118
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,240
If anyone finds out about this, it will ruin the foundation's reputation.

119
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,960
I need to ask you

120
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,120
to get Ping and the money back.

121
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
How about this?

122
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,840
We will keep searching for her

123
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,800
and we will find out

124
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,160
where that medium is.

125
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:45,744
Well,

126
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:48,138
I need to ask

127
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,681
you

128
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,321
a big favor.

129
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,080
Is that the medium named Ping?

130
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:05,984
That's right.

131
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,801
Ping?

132
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:13,504
Dan?

133
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,800
Do you have something else to say to me?

134
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,160
Nothing more, please go.

135
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,204
Bye.

136
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:26,600
He pushed his face so close to me like that.

137
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,080
Is he an officer or a star from BL series?

138
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,240
What did you just say? / Nothing, I just said that

139
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,800
we should go out and have wine together.

140
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,880
I have various types of wine, kept from years ago.

141
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:38,320
I also have jelly snack to offer, many colors as well.

142
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,920
You must like the one in purple.

143
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,760
Am I right? Call me okay?

144
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,840
You think you're funny, huh?

145
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,921
Let's go.

146
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,031
Hello?

147
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,800
I'm checking that medium's place,

148
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,240
according to the latest info.

149
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,300
Keep me posted if you've got anything.

150
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,051
Damn it!

151
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,291
Oh! Sorry.

152
00:17:34,543 --> 00:17:35,544
Hey!

153
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,920
Damn it, you stupid horse!

154
00:17:58,057 --> 00:17:59,080
Damn it!

155
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:54,524
What's up, Phee?

156
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,720
I'm so happy that you agreed to join us, Ter. / Oh yeah?

157
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,731
Right.

158
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:11,840
Hey, it's fake.

159
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:15,520
You're the same, my old buddy. / Right.

160
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,801
Where is Jok?

161
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:22,724
Fuck!

162
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:32,920
Damn it!

163
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:38,118
So fresh.

164
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:43,480
Where did you learn to drive, Dr.Dung?

165
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,263
I tried to review a product and you scared me.

166
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:50,280
I'm sorry, I just learned to hit someone. / Learned to drive.

167
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:52,518
What the hell are you doing?

168
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,200
Let's get going. It's hard to get you all together.

169
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:57,897
Wait! Hey!

170
00:19:57,983 --> 00:19:59,760
Wait for me! Hey!

171
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:02,120
I need to pack up my things. / If you're late, then you get there by yourself.

172
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,640
Walk there, okay? / Wait, where's my t-shirt?

173
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:04,863
Over there. / Where?

174
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,920
I fooled you, stupid you! / Hey!

175
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,680
Hello, my lovely followers.

176
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,500
You're here with your favorite guy, Jok.

177
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,200
You must be confused of where I'm taking you

178
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:40,320
and who am I with. Please allow me to speak

179
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:42,680
in central dialect today.

180
00:20:42,777 --> 00:20:44,880
So everyone can understand me easily.

181
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:50,480
Today is a special day because

182
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:53,400
my long long friends have finally

183
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,480
reunited again.

184
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,280
Let me tell you that GOT7 and BUS members

185
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:03,360
got nothing on us, they can't compete with us.

186
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,721
On our hotness?

187
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:07,760
On our next level of stupidity.

188
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,320
This is my beloved friend named Ter.

189
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,640
He is the reason that we all get together today

190
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:17,920
after years of being apart.

191
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:19,440
Because he will travel abroad to work in...

192
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:21,704
Germany.

193
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:24,504
You happy now?

194
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,401
And this guy, let me tell you that

195
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,880
he is a super rich, super mega billionaire, he has more money

196
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,080
that high mountains. / Not just regular mountains

197
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:39,200
but a mountain full of sh...... / That's enough.

198
00:21:39,557 --> 00:21:42,720
You're ruining my reputation. / Hey!

199
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,761
Hello, I'm Phee.

200
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:47,960
His first name is Ph-cking, last name is Bullsh--.

201
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,560
Dung, I think your car is super cool.

202
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,880
Can I borrow it to shoot for my content?

203
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,231
No you can't.

204
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,240
You know how hard it was for me to pursuade my Mom to buy this car?

205
00:21:59,283 --> 00:22:00,640
She cursed me up and down, saying that it didn't suit my professional.

206
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:03,840
I asked her to drive this car to hang out with friends.

207
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,800
And she told me off big time.

208
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,601
If you drove it and scratched it, she'd kill me for sure.

209
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:10,880
When will you stop being scared of your Godzilla Mom?

210
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:13,700
You son of a bitch! Her name is Kannika, not Godzilla.

211
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,084
Right.

212
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,040
If you're so scared of your Mom, why did you bring this car?

213
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,120
Why are you asking me? You should ask him, he forced me to bring it.

214
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,480
Rich man, you need to stop forcing people already.

215
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,730
You're forcing me to come here and I'm about to fly soon.

216
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:31,320
You told me to go on a trip with you, we didn't even have a place to stay.

217
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:33,240
Where should we eat? I'm so confused. / Oh, come on.

218
00:22:33,338 --> 00:22:35,760
Why're you complaining like an old man?

219
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,640
We're gonna stay up til next morning, and we'll leave tomorrow.

220
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:42,640
I have a plan. We're going to Paradise Seven

221
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,320
and we need to get there with gorgeous car so we could catch attention.

222
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,600
Ladies will be looking at us and we will get a chance to….

223
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,320
Bang! Bang! Bang!

224
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:54,760
What?

225
00:22:55,137 --> 00:22:57,280
Why're you slowing down?

226
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,000
Hey!

227
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:02,898
My car broke down.

228
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,920
Damn it! / Go have a look.

229
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:06,520
Damn it! What's going on?

230
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:18,843
So fresh, super refreshing.

231
00:23:18,943 --> 00:23:21,700
Just a sip and you will be recharged.

232
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,480
Do you want one of these?

233
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,000
You want many of these?

234
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,960
Wow! Perfect!

235
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:30,917
This is so good, wait a minute.

236
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,200
Hey, Mr.Jok.

237
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,760
Can you help us take a look here? Stop being a content creator for a minute.

238
00:23:35,877 --> 00:23:38,250
Stop interrupting me already.

239
00:23:38,703 --> 00:23:40,160
I'm a new influencer

240
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,250
but I got a lot of tie-in product offers. / Yeah?

241
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:47,480
I was just done with juice and my next product is…

242
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:55,480
special alcohol made from fermented fruit.

243
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:58,600
Smiling Dog brand? Is it even legal?

244
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,600
You could lose your sight and hearing after drinking it.

245
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,720
Stop saying bad thing about my client already.

246
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:05,680
Why can't I? / Hello, Mommy?

247
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:07,400
Your car broke down again?

248
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,440
Yes, Mommy. But I'm fine, I'm with my friends.

249
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,200
We can fix it. It's nothing.

250
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,080
I told you to buy a new car.

251
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,440
But you insisted on buying your classic car. You see what happened?

252
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,800
This is how classic car operated, you get me right? / No, I don't.

253
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,040
Did you fix its trunk?

254
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:27,240
You mean the one in the back? It popped up out of nowhere?

255
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,361
I got it fixed but it still popped.

256
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:33,360
Dr.Dung, have you ever listened to a word I said?

257
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,400
Mom, calm down. / You're too stubborn!

258
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,571
I can keep going. / I'm with my friends, this is embarrassing.

259
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,960
He's so scared of his Mom.

260
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,880
Alright, I'll hurry back home.

261
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,640
I'll buy you some noodles okay?

262
00:24:46,957 --> 00:24:48,880
Hey! Why did you kick my car?

263
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:50,120
It's yours so I can kick it.

264
00:24:50,203 --> 00:24:51,657
If it's mine, I wouldn't dare to kick it. / What?

265
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,080
You son of a bitch!

266
00:24:55,297 --> 00:24:56,298
What? How did it happen?

267
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:58,680
You started the car!

268
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,680
What the hell are you waiting for? Let's go.

269
00:25:01,037 --> 00:25:02,360
Honestly, my beloved viewers,

270
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,250
Jok! Watch out! / Jok!

271
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,960
You need to try it. / Jok!

272
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:11,040
You almost got hit!

273
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,440
Stop being an influencer for a minute!

274
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,120
Hey! Watch where you're going!

275
00:25:19,283 --> 00:25:21,520
You almost hit me!

276
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,641
Why are you standing in the middle of the street like this. / Yep.

277
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,840
What did you do? Why didn't you warn me? / What?

278
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,240
If I hit you, you're not the only one to get hurt,

279
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,160
I'd get hurt too. / That's right.

280
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,840
If she got hurt, who'd be responsible for that? You fools!

281
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,760
You're piece of crap, you're brainless.

282
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
Hold these! / What?

283
00:26:06,837 --> 00:26:07,880
Are you okay?

284
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,040
Don't touch me if you don't know me.

285
00:26:18,823 --> 00:26:20,500
Help me!

286
00:26:22,523 --> 00:26:23,524
Calm down, please.

287
00:26:23,763 --> 00:26:25,764
I'm sorry on behalf of him for standing in the middle of the road like that.

288
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,520
But you're riding too fast, are you escaping anyone?

289
00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:34,840
Stop! Hey!

290
00:26:50,657 --> 00:26:51,880
Did you all see that?

291
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,691
Yes, I did.

292
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,240
What kind of a person would carry that much money?

293
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,640
A fascinating kind.

294
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,361
Saturday, 14th at 9:00 PM.

295
00:27:36,457 --> 00:27:38,960
Yes! Yes! Yes!

296
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,840
We'll get a lot of approvals tonight.

297
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,120
Hello. / Excuse me.

298
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,960
Have you seen or known a woman in this picture?

299
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,321
Her name is Bam.

300
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,400
I've never seen her nor known her.

301
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,640
There're so many people at Paradise Seven tonight.

302
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,480
Well, can I get a room please?

303
00:28:04,703 --> 00:28:06,704
One sec okay?

304
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,800
I'm sorry. We're fully booked.

305
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,400
Fully booked? / That's right.

306
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,050
It's fine. / Sorry.

307
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,761
Hello.

308
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,080
My friends and I would like a room please.

309
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,000
We're fully booked, I'm so sorry.

310
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,880
Fully booked? / That's right.

311
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,800
That's too bad. I saw some reviews and they said that

312
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,081
they have gorgeous views here.

313
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,520
And I started to believe it

314
00:28:43,317 --> 00:28:44,318
that it's so gorgeous.

315
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:46,538
That's crazy.

316
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:50,480
Actually, there's one room left.

317
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,520
It's a penthouse suite, library theme.

318
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,200
It's for VIP guests, are you fine with that?

319
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,680
Sure. / No!

320
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,250
Hey, you! Nice to see you again.

321
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:09,040
I'm not okay. You just said that you're fully booked.

322
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,341
Well, you're here by yourself and it's a penthouse suite.

323
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,080
It's for people with company. / Why does it matter?

324
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,400
I'm here by myself and I can book a penthouse suite.

325
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,881
One more thing,

326
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,100
I was here before him.

327
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,081
You're here first.

328
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,600
But I got the room first.

329
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:36,040
Nice to meet you.

330
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,081
I'm Phee.

331
00:29:41,857 --> 00:29:44,320
It's late and you can't find a place to stay tonight.

332
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,600
You're carrying big load of money and it's not safe.

333
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,201
What about this?

334
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,440
You can share a room with me tonight.

335
00:29:57,717 --> 00:29:58,760
Share a room with you?

336
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:03,120
It's quite tempting.

337
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:15,964
So cute.

338
00:30:16,437 --> 00:30:17,438
Thank you.

339
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,480
I was talking about her.

340
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:33,880
Hello.

341
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,921
Oh my goodness!

342
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:42,758
Hello.

343
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,480
Hi there, young man.

344
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,760
What the hell? / What's this?

345
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:54,600
You scared me. Where were you?

346
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:57,160
I got a room for you, you and you.

347
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:59,200
See? Believe me now?

348
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,400
I only invited you to the top-tier party.

349
00:31:02,623 --> 00:31:04,240
Fine, I believe you now.

350
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,400
Good, my old pal. / This is so awesome.

351
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:10,440
Guys! Look!

352
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:21,640
Damn it! High sex appeal.

353
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,931
Wow!

354
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,961
Oh my goodness!

355
00:32:08,503 --> 00:32:09,504
Are you looking for this?

356
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:14,698
Thank you.

357
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,343
You should try champagne for celebration.

358
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,970
On what occasion?

359
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,520
For us to meet in this special night.

360
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:32,840
I bet that you're On The Rock type of girl.

361
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,880
So many choices, I couldn't choose.

362
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,520
If you can't choose,

363
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:41,720
get out of my way, Big Guy,

364
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:44,480
you can choose your favorite.

365
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,490
If you still can't find it,

366
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,560
you can stand here and do it. / Shake it.

367
00:32:53,817 --> 00:32:54,840
Are you trying to hit on a girl or being a bartender?

368
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:56,720
Stop hitting me in front of her. So embarrassing.

369
00:32:57,617 --> 00:32:58,618
My skull is dented already.

370
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,400
You guys are funny.

371
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,120
I'm Bam. Nice to meet you.

372
00:33:05,143 --> 00:33:05,880
Hey! / Hey!

373
00:33:05,963 --> 00:33:08,300
Can I say it first? / I'm here first.

374
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:09,378
You should ask her.

375
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,663
PM 2.5 destroyed your lungs.

376
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,000
Bad smell cigarette.

377
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:40,784
Talk to him.

378
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,720
Are you a Parkinson?

379
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,280
Nope, I'm just Calories Blah Blah.

380
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:53,138
Shoot him with a joke, maybe he likes it.

381
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:56,139
What's wrong with you, old man?

382
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,841
Do you know who I am? / What?

383
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,920
Don't you think this is an ancient line already?

384
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,521
You don't even know who you are, how are we supposed to know about you?

385
00:34:10,063 --> 00:34:11,190
Hey!

386
00:34:11,423 --> 00:34:12,560
What? / Calm down, son.

387
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:15,160
Don't get in trouble with him, just let him go. / Right.

388
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,560
Why can't I? He started it.

389
00:34:18,697 --> 00:34:19,698
Hey, old guy.

390
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,160
Go to sleep if you're not feeling well.

391
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,481
Sek!

392
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,731
From Loso band?

393
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,400
Face or stomach?

394
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,051
Damn it!

395
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,080
You think you can take me down from one punch?

396
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,271
Then you're right.

397
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:49,920
Ter! / Damn it!

398
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,121
Let's go.

399
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,431
Hey!

400
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,560
Don't try to be cool

401
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
or you'll leave the world too soon.

402
00:35:09,563 --> 00:35:10,640
Ter! / Ter!

403
00:35:11,963 --> 00:35:12,964
Are you okay?

404
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,881
Where is this place?

405
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,600
Let me go already.

406
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,240
You know that I don't like to see you being with someone else.

407
00:35:21,377 --> 00:35:22,441
Why didn't you listen to me?

408
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:26,200
I'm not being with them. They're talking to me first.

409
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,271
Don't lie to me.

410
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,720
It's the truth.

411
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,241
Please? Let me go.

412
00:35:34,163 --> 00:35:35,164
You're hurting me.

413
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,801
Please?

414
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:39,278
Please?

415
00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:44,600
You hid the drug already, right?

416
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,601
All done.

417
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:10,458
Good.

418
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,640
Roadzing Gang will come by and get this stuff tomorrow.

419
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,000
If this drug makes good sales,

420
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,160
I can guarantee you that we will be super rich, Bam.

421
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,800
Where is she?

422
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,000
She's gone since you turned around.

423
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:28,960
Such a spoiled brat.

424
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,200
If I didn't love her so much,

425
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,160
I would have told you to kill her already.

426
00:36:36,303 --> 00:36:37,304
Where are you all?

427
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,240
I can't turn my back to any one of my guys?

428
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:48,364
Bam.

429
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,400
Wait.

430
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:57,100
Stop walking away from me.

431
00:36:57,157 --> 00:36:58,560
You should stop coming for me already.

432
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,120
I told you that I had nothing to talk to you.

433
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,360
But I'm ready to take you away from here.

434
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,000
It's too late, don't you think?

435
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:10,400
I don't want to run away with you, I've chosen this life.

436
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:15,240
You will have a chance to start your life over,

437
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,760
how long are you gonna work like  this?

438
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,100
Can I ask for an ice pack?

439
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,010
What's wrong with my line of work?

440
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,481
Being a hostess is totally

441
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:27,401
below from being a medium, fooling people for money, isn't it?

442
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,040
We're both doing shitty work.

443
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:32,280
Because it's shitty

444
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,320
that's why I want to take you away from this.

445
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,800
I want to keep my promise.

446
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,280
You still talk about a promise?

447
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,600
Do you have any idea how long I had clung on to that promise?

448
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,120
Since we were at the orphanage until we grew up,

449
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:54,840
you've kept feeding me to believe your promises.

450
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,960
You said that you'd come and get me in five years,

451
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
then it was added for three more years.

452
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,400
You said you were sorry but you wanted two more years.

453
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,880
Stop telling me about your promises already, you lying bitch!

454
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:10,678
Bam!

455
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,800
You slapped me? / Damn right.

456
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:27,280
Calm down.

457
00:38:27,863 --> 00:38:28,864
Fine.

458
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,600
I know that I broke our promises.

459
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,040
But I've tried my best.

460
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:36,960
You have no idea what I have to face.

461
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,300
That's right, I don't know.

462
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,960
And I don't want to.

463
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,400
You left me and you ignored me.

464
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,960
I don't care how you live your life anymore.

465
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,121
But we're friends. / Friends?

466
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,360
My one and only friend died years ago.

467
00:38:56,157 --> 00:38:57,440
Bam! Bam!

468
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,291
Ping!

469
00:39:48,963 --> 00:39:50,480
You're leaving me?

470
00:39:53,883 --> 00:39:56,440
Wait for me, I've never left you.

471
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,920
I'll come back to get you.

472
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:08,931
I promise.

473
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:05,518
Ping!

474
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,681
Honestly,

475
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,840
the party was fun with lots of girls, what did we do wrong?

476
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,000
On the bright side,

477
00:41:50,431 --> 00:41:53,720
at least we can drink in our room,

478
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:57,391
we won't be too drunk and we could wake up early to sent Ter off.

479
00:41:57,491 --> 00:41:58,640
Brilliant.

480
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,920
I want to send him off

481
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,040
but can't I get it with the ladies first?

482
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,520
Stop thinking about ladies already.

483
00:42:07,683 --> 00:42:10,560
I'm hurt so much.

484
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:12,960
That son of a bitch hit me so hard.

485
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,960
Why didn't he punch you?

486
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,600
What? / What's wrong?

487
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,671
Nothing. I'm fine.

488
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,880
You're acting weird. What's on your mind?

489
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,241
What're you looking at?

490
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,480
Nice to see you again.

491
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,121
What?

492
00:42:34,563 --> 00:42:36,160
I saw you once and it's enough.

493
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,880
I got punched one time and I almost broke my nose.

494
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,360
If I got hit again, my nose would fall out.

495
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,641
I'm sorry.

496
00:42:43,983 --> 00:42:46,120
I didn't mean for you to get hurt.

497
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,320
But Ah and his guys were rude like that.

498
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,360
Don't you worry.

499
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,600
He is busy and won't be messing with you anymore.

500
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,040
Damn it! Bad hand.

501
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,080
Why did he laugh like that for?

502
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,500
What're you laughing at? Never seen a man with bad cards?

503
00:43:23,057 --> 00:43:24,120
What about this?

504
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:27,360
Pleae let me buy you drinks to say I'm sorry.

505
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,520
Good. / What?

506
00:43:34,143 --> 00:43:35,480
Are you sure?

507
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,760
That you won't join my private party?

508
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:41,518
I want to.

509
00:43:42,937 --> 00:43:44,880
Let's go. / What?

510
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,541
What? If you're not going, then I'll go.

511
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,071
You want to?

512
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:54,924
Super handsome.

513
00:43:57,077 --> 00:43:58,480
I thought you were Leonardo.

514
00:44:02,297 --> 00:44:03,560
I wanted to be funny to impress her.

515
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,640
What about the rest of you? Would you like to go?

516
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:12,320
I'll start licking since I see a doorknob.

517
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,000
Please take care of the kids, I need to work.

518
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,241
I don't think I can be home for a few days.

519
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,921
I miss you and the kids so much.

520
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:32,920
Hey! Were you fed with rudeness instead of milk growing up?

521
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,081
It didn't bother you at all?

522
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,040
We've closed so many cases

523
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,250
and we still haven't had a chance to deal with big cases.

524
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,320
We got stuck with finding a medium or something.

525
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,920
Look at the nepobabies

526
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,840
they got big cases and they got promoted.

527
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,880
You and I were still noname officers like this.

528
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,241
My coffee.

529
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,240
Now it's yours.

530
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,161
Let me tell you something.

531
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,000
You need to see it in a brighter side.

532
00:45:20,363 --> 00:45:21,480
Working on a medium case

533
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,760
is still better than catching pythons at people's houses.

534
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,250
Did you get anything?

535
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,160
They only sent me the medium's record

536
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,400
when she grew up.

537
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,881
I still don't know about her background or how she was raised.

538
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,560
Is that the best they can do?

539
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,480
About that horse face thief.

540
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,000
I think he's trying to steal her 5 million.

541
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,440
It just got on news but he knew about it first.

542
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,920
Maybe he's someone from the foundation

543
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,520
but who is he?

544
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:58,600
Don't be too aggressive.

545
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,520
I have something good to show you.

546
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,921
What is it?

547
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:12,400
It's a footage from a store at a gas station, along Phetchaburi to Prachuap.

548
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,880
I asked the team to check on CCTV.

549
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,361
Can you guess

550
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,800
where did she head to?

551
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:25,560
Paradise Seven.

552
00:46:26,343 --> 00:46:27,344
How did you know?

553
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,361
I can't help it that I'm too bright.

554
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,271
Are you telling me that I'm stupid?

555
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:39,600
You're leaving?

556
00:46:43,863 --> 00:46:45,120
Are you a human or a rocket?

557
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,901
Friday, 14th at 11:59 PM.

558
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:59,800
Take it off! / Take it off!

559
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,903
Take it off! / Take it off!

560
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:08,920
Why did you let yourself go like this? You didn't take care of your body.

561
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,320
I can teach you how to eat right.

562
00:47:10,517 --> 00:47:13,040
Take care of your health, okay? / Right.

563
00:47:14,523 --> 00:47:16,160
Is she just simply good or cheating?

564
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,520
We played for 10 rounds and I still haven't seen her skin.

565
00:47:19,237 --> 00:47:20,440
She beats us every single time.

566
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:21,920
Honestly?

567
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,440
I planned to see her naked,

568
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:28,400
instead, I saw you naked.

569
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,681
You know what is worse?

570
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,842
Look at me!

571
00:47:32,897 --> 00:47:34,360
Disgusting.

572
00:47:34,623 --> 00:47:37,100
Who came up with this stupid game?

573
00:47:38,137 --> 00:47:39,138
Come here, come a little bit closer.

574
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,880
What's up? / It's you!

575
00:47:45,677 --> 00:47:47,440
Stop it, you ruined my reputation.

576
00:47:49,197 --> 00:47:50,840
I don't want to play anymore.

577
00:47:51,297 --> 00:47:52,400
I need to pee.

578
00:47:52,877 --> 00:47:53,678
Take it.

579
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,600
Right. / Don't wet your bed.

580
00:47:57,203 --> 00:47:58,204
We ran out of liquor.

581
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,720
Call room service.

582
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,000
Already did. It's this one.

583
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,200
The last one.

584
00:48:05,003 --> 00:48:07,360
You and you..

585
00:48:08,223 --> 00:48:09,280
need to go to a store.

586
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,640
Stupid you! The store is 8 km away from here. Are you crazy?

587
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,720
Stop fighting, children. Look at an adult, like me.

588
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,400
Come here, have a look.

589
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,360
We got fermented liquor from Jok.

590
00:48:30,917 --> 00:48:33,360
Take it! / Let's try.

591
00:48:39,063 --> 00:48:42,400
Stop! I need to review it first.

592
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,423
We're trying to give you a review. / Bottoms up!

593
00:48:45,531 --> 00:48:48,680
Cheers! / Cheers!

594
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,921
It's not good?

595
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,801
It's super good! / So nice!

596
00:49:06,601 --> 00:49:08,520
Let's try! / Bring me a glass!

597
00:49:09,897 --> 00:49:10,898
Hurry up!

598
00:49:14,837 --> 00:49:15,838
Let's go.

599
00:49:16,283 --> 00:49:17,200
Bottoms up!

600
00:49:17,317 --> 00:49:18,578
Cheers! / Cheers!

601
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,880
Ping, help me.

602
00:49:45,063 --> 00:49:47,440
Ping, help me.

603
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:51,391
Bam!

604
00:49:54,197 --> 00:49:59,120
This is a face of a medium who stole from Mr.Charn.

605
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:01,520
If you see her anywhere

606
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,520
you can tell officers to arrest her.

607
00:50:07,943 --> 00:50:08,944
Damn it!

608
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,921
Sunday, 15th at 9:45 AM.

609
00:50:55,237 --> 00:50:56,280
Fuck!

610
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:00,417
Damn it! Ter! Wake up!

611
00:51:01,377 --> 00:51:03,717
Dung, up! Go take a shower.

612
00:51:03,817 --> 00:51:05,680
Mom! / Not your mom, it’s me.

613
00:51:06,517 --> 00:51:08,320
Jok! Come on!

614
00:51:08,897 --> 00:51:09,898
Jok!

615
00:51:10,983 --> 00:51:13,484
Damn it! / Jok!

616
00:51:16,457 --> 00:51:18,920
Jok! Jok!

617
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,720
What the fuck are you wearing?

618
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,051
Shit!

619
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,480
Please help me find her.

620
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,720
I've been searching around the hotel, I've asked everyone.

621
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,280
This lady?

622
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,640
I saw her went to a party with the clients from penthouse suite over there.

623
00:51:47,957 --> 00:51:50,280
I'm not sure if she's still around.

624
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,151
Thank you.

625
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,620
Stop pushing me. / Hurry up.

626
00:51:56,203 --> 00:51:57,800
You woke up late and you blamed the others.

627
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,640
Damn it! I'm gonna miss my flight for sure.

628
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,920
You have a flight in the afternoon, we're gonna make it.

629
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,100
If you can't make it, then just don't go.

630
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,400
It's easy for you to say, it's my future.

631
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,161
It's not that easy to get a job abroad.

632
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,481
You're right.

633
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,840
Why do my butts hurt?

634
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,160
What did I do last night?

635
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,120
That's right. After I finished Jok's liquor,

636
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,320
I didn't remember anything after that.

637
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,800
Me neither. Why did I recall anything from last night. / Right.

638
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,560
Did you see Bam?

639
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,640
She went with that uncle I think. You'll remember it when you're sober.

640
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,960
Why didn't you start the car?

641
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,120
That's right.

642
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:48,651
Why didn't I?

643
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:52,600
You're the driver. / You need to drive.

644
00:52:52,943 --> 00:52:54,570
Go! / Get up.

645
00:52:54,683 --> 00:52:56,360
I thought the steering wheel was on the right.

646
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,881
I can't go.

647
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,440
What's going on? / Where's the steering wheel?

648
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,430
Right here. / I see.

649
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,920
That's why I didn't see it. / Stupid you!

650
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:06,880
Kid, move. You could get hit.

651
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,520
Stop joking around already. / Don't stress out.

652
00:53:09,637 --> 00:53:12,000
If he can't make it, you'll pay for his ticket.

653
00:53:21,537 --> 00:53:23,520
You think Ping'd be here for real?

654
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,640
We just need to look around first.

655
00:53:26,361 --> 00:53:27,840
It's quite ashamed.

656
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,160
If that officer hadn't shown up,

657
00:53:31,457 --> 00:53:33,480
we both would have been rich already.

658
00:53:35,043 --> 00:53:36,044
Whatever.

659
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:38,920
We're gonna be rich sooner or later.

660
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:41,800
It's up to us to find Ping before that stupid officer.

661
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,600
But the hotel is so damn huge. You think we're gonna find her that easy.

662
00:53:58,297 --> 00:53:59,298
Shit! / Shit!

663
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,120
Stop running, bitch! / Come here.

664
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,800
I can't get out. / Your seatbelt is on.

665
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,391
The door isn't working properly.

666
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:12,160
Move, out of the way. / What's going on?

667
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,160
What is it? / What kind of car is this?

668
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:23,680
You?

669
00:54:24,423 --> 00:54:25,520
Why're you running in front of a car?

670
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,560
Stop running away from me!

671
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,131
Hey!

672
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,841
Hop on!

673
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,480
Come on. / What is this?

674
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:38,671
Stop!

675
00:54:40,337 --> 00:54:42,960
Mee! Let's go. / Follow them!

676
00:54:43,963 --> 00:54:46,320
I can't open it. / It broke.

677
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:50,160
What kind of shitty car are you driving? Why didn't you drive a good one?

678
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:58,400
What should we do?

679
00:54:58,410 --> 00:54:59,760
They're following us?

680
00:54:59,877 --> 00:55:02,280
Don't be scared. They can't do anything but follow.

681
00:55:03,517 --> 00:55:04,518
Hey!

682
00:55:05,857 --> 00:55:07,880
You said they wouldn't do anything, they're trying to shoot us.

683
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:09,520
How could I know? / What should we do?

684
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,560
Guys, my Mom asked me to buy her some fruits the other day.

685
00:55:12,841 --> 00:55:14,142
Just throw some at them.

686
00:55:14,183 --> 00:55:17,440
What the hell? You wanted me to throw them some fruits?

687
00:55:17,577 --> 00:55:19,600
Just look at the fruits. / Wait.

688
00:55:19,923 --> 00:55:22,080
Searching. / Hurry up.

689
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,641
Throw some at them.

690
00:55:28,503 --> 00:55:29,504
Shit! Watermelon!

691
00:55:31,343 --> 00:55:32,160
Damn it!

692
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,751
Shit!

693
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:40,000
Ouch!

694
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,001
Hey!

695
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,921
No more watermelon left.

696
00:55:44,577 --> 00:55:46,700
Look again, there's another kind of fruit. / Wait!

697
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,920
Hurry up!

698
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:50,720
You want a piece of me?

699
00:55:52,283 --> 00:55:54,400
When did you buy it?

700
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:57,478
Stop asking and throwing it already. Now!

701
00:55:57,623 --> 00:55:59,200
I know!

702
00:56:03,483 --> 00:56:04,484
Durian!

703
00:56:05,443 --> 00:56:07,400
Damn it!

704
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,920
I told you to throw at them, not at me.

705
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,560
I'm sorry. It slipped off my hands.

706
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,797
Do it again, and hit them hard. / Come on, hurry up.

707
00:56:18,117 --> 00:56:19,118
Hey!

708
00:56:20,423 --> 00:56:21,840
Don't!

709
00:56:22,537 --> 00:56:23,538
Don't!

710
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,560
What did you do? Why're they hunting you down like this?

711
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,320
What? What did you do, honestly?

712
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,280
It has something to do with this money?

713
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,157
Hey!

714
00:57:10,841 --> 00:57:11,842
Where are they?

715
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,251
Damn it!

716
00:57:17,683 --> 00:57:18,880
Let's have a look.

717
00:57:39,557 --> 00:57:41,680
We got shot, that's why the tire looks like this.

718
00:57:42,343 --> 00:57:45,000
They shot us? So cruel.

719
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,171
Damn it! My ears will be burning from my Mom.

720
00:57:49,423 --> 00:57:50,743
You need to stop being scared of your Mom already.

721
00:57:50,837 --> 00:57:53,000
You should be worried about me missing my flight.

722
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,361
Look what you've done, Phee.

723
00:57:57,077 --> 00:57:59,640
I told you that I didn't want to come and you made me.

724
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:00,720
We're all in big trouble.

725
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:03,160
Why're you blaming me? Did I make you to come?

726
00:58:03,217 --> 00:58:04,320
How could I know that

727
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:07,480
this would happen? / How could I know what's gonna happen?

728
00:58:08,377 --> 00:58:10,280
You two need to stop fighting.

729
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,977
Change the tire and we can go.

730
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,480
I think you should have a spare tire in the trunk.

731
00:58:15,597 --> 00:58:17,070
Pop your trunk.

732
00:58:17,163 --> 00:58:19,071
Come on.  / You think they have it?

733
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,640
Stop blaming me already. / I told you to go last week.

734
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,280
You kept on blaming me since we were little.

735
00:58:24,897 --> 00:58:25,898
What?

736
00:58:28,883 --> 00:58:30,400
What did you say? I didn't catch it.

737
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:32,720
Hurry up! / Come on!

738
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,040
Damn it!

739
00:58:43,577 --> 00:58:44,578
Corpse.

740
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,200
What happened to her? Why is she here?

741
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,080
How did she get into Dung's trunk?

742
00:59:46,157 --> 00:59:48,560
We were too drunk to remember anything?

743
00:59:48,663 --> 00:59:51,720
And we accidentally killed her? / Are you crazy? We can't kill anyone.

744
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,921
What's wrong with your car?

745
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,400
If this place can launder money from casino,

746
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:58,320
we will see each other every month.

747
00:59:58,443 --> 01:00:00,760
Or you could be the one killing your friend?

748
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,480
I won't kill my friend for sure.

749
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,840
Right, Bam? / Yeah.

750
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:09,040
Think, Bam. Think! Who killed you?
