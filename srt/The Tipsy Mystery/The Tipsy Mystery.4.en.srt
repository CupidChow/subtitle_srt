1
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,800
Plot twist, Bam didn't die in the pool.

2
00:00:08,963 --> 00:00:10,880
Dung didn't kill her either.

3
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,400
I didn't want to be rotten in the car.

4
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:14,090
All hotels and bars will have big freezer.

5
00:00:14,117 --> 00:00:15,520
I walked into a bar behind the pool accidentally

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,617
I think it's out of service.

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,080
It looks like nobody has used it for years.

8
00:00:18,237 --> 00:00:19,320
Especially this one.

9
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,960
Who did she slap? / No idea.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,160
One of the murderers

11
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:25,120
could be among the three of you. / Four of us.

12
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,640
Don't forget to include yourself.

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,438
I'll go back to watch CCTV footage with Ping.

14
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,600
You two need to find Dung.

15
00:00:30,743 --> 00:00:32,440
Wait, or you think he's going home to his mom?

16
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:34,320
What should we do? We have police issue

17
00:00:34,363 --> 00:00:36,250
and we don't know where Loanzing gang is.

18
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,280
It's really you, Ping.

19
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:40,080
Where's the money?

20
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,624
Fuck!

21
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,520
When did I get a tattoo?

22
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:45,040
Why do you have to tattoo the word Murderer?

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,760
Bam got it for you. So that she'd tell everyone

24
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:49,040
that you killed her.

25
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:53,438
Or…

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,121
you were the one who wanted to

27
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,280
but Bam wanted you to.

28
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:00,480
So that she'd tell everyone

29
00:01:01,423 --> 00:01:02,720
that you killed her.

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,040
Are you serious? What kind of logic is behind this?

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,241
Watched too many movies?

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,040
If it had nothing to do with this,

33
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,880
how can you explain your tattoo?

34
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,880
Anything that is not about me killing Bam.

35
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:29,280
Or am I?

36
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,560
Why are you looking at me like that?

37
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:46,320
I'm your friend.

38
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,281
Honestly, since what happened

39
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,040
I started to doubt on all of you

40
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:54,920
if you're still my friends.

41
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:04,360
Stop that, just looking back and forth doesn't help with anything.

42
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:06,018
Ter,

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,120
this is fresh tattoo so the tatttoo parlor must be around the hotel.

44
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,800
You two need to find out more from that place.

45
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:14,320
And I'll be looking for Ping. I don't know where she is.

46
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:16,054
That's the plan.

47
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,080
Okay. / Fine.

48
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,680
Did you rat us out about stealing?

49
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:30,200
Hey! Stop!

50
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:34,160
You're here to save Wang again?

51
00:03:34,557 --> 00:03:36,560
You want some of these? / Go ahead.

52
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:38,360
You can fight and so can I.

53
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:46,904
No more left, huh?

54
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,880
You're a dead meat!

55
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:58,360
Come on, your dad is here. Let's go.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,440
You're safe now.

57
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,640
Wang? What is it?

58
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,920
Here.

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,241
For you.

60
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,360
So pretty. Thanks.

61
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:39,624
You wanna try it on?

62
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:48,878
What?

63
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:53,480
What're you doing? It's from Bam.

64
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:58,120
Why didn't I get one? I saved you as well.

65
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,720
A strong girl like you

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,361
wouldn't like flowers.

67
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,680
You think you know it all?

68
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,920
Here, it suits you more.

69
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,781
I don't look cute wearing it, no one'd like me.

70
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,240
And you have lived up to your name.

71
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,440
They cut your hair in asymmetrically. Why didn't you fight them back?

72
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,600
I won't, they're gonna hurt me anyway.

73
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,881
Just you wait, I'll be a policeman when I grow up

74
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,121
so I don't have to run away any longer.

75
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,040
And I can protect others

76
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,360
including you and Bam.

77
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:43,040
You can't help it but praise me

78
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,840
that I'm the best.

79
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:47,600
Ewwww, such a brag.

80
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,191
Don't run away from me.

81
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:51,604
Come back here.

82
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,281
It really is you, Ping.

83
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,077
Hello, Ms.Criminal.

84
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:27,224
Damn it!

85
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,360
Hello, young lady.

86
00:06:31,543 --> 00:06:32,560
We meet at last.

87
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:43,560
Damn it!

88
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,160
Damn it!

89
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,801
What's wrong?

90
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,600
I met that medium girl.

91
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,160
What? You met her?

92
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,720
Yeah, but she ran away.

93
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,640
Damn it!

94
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:11,100
Why is it so hard to catch this woman?

95
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,250
Such a bummer.

96
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,880
I wonder if my eyes got wounded.

97
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,004
What's wrong with your eyes?

98
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:21,518
None of your business.

99
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,200
What should we do next?

100
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,920
We should split and search for her.

101
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,280
I'll call the local police

102
00:07:30,977 --> 00:07:32,480
to see if they got any CCTV footage.

103
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,081
Okay.

104
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,040
Where have you been?

105
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:44,278
Let's get going.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,080
You took my money, didn't you? Give it back to me. / What's going on?

107
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,560
Give me back my money.

108
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,911
You want your money?

109
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,080
Right. / Let me go and we can talk.

110
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,281
You're so weird

111
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,880
you keep pushing men to go down.

112
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm kidding. I'm sorry.

113
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,520
Stop acting already. You took my money, didn't you?

114
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,840
Give it back to me. / No, I won't.

115
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:24,480
Give it back! / You suspected that one of us was a killer

116
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,160
then I can suspect you as a killer as well.

117
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll keep your money as a collateral.

118
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,120
If you said that you didn't steal the money and it should belong to you,

119
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,880
then you need to tell me the whole story.

120
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,480
It started when I didn't want to trick anyone anymore.

121
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,320
I can't take it anymore.

122
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:53,760
I don't want to do it.

123
00:08:56,477 --> 00:08:59,240
I want to stop and live my own life.

124
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,400
Your life belongs to me.

125
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:03,682
Remember that.

126
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,480
You're my money maker.

127
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,440
Don't you dare running away from me.

128
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,841
Is this what you want?

129
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,760
Please take care of the money and make it legal.

130
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:52,338
Sure I can.

131
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,721
I will make it

132
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:56,160
all clean.

133
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,841
What did you do?

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,001
Think you're gonna blackmail me?

135
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,200
You can choose to

136
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,960
give me one million baht like I ask

137
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,081
or let people find out that

138
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,400
your foundation is used for money laundering.

139
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:31,560
Give me the money

140
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:34,480
and I'll disappear as well as the clip.

141
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,280
You think that

142
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,000
you are the one with the clip to threaten people?

143
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,281
Bam?

144
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,331
Bam!

145
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:55,898
It's Bam.

146
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:59,040
She was you best friend when you were in the orphanage.

147
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,800
You thought you'd run away with her.

148
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,240
Stay away from her. / Are you willing to trade? With Bam's life?

149
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,121
She has nothing to do with this.

150
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:14,640
You can't order me.

151
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,320
But I can order Mee and Yong to take care of Bam.

152
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,291
I told you, didn't I?

153
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,600
You can't run away from me no matter what.

154
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,200
Go back to be a medium tomorrow, okay?

155
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,921
Amen

156
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,001
Amen

157
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,121
Amen

158
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:18,122
Amen

159
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:33,160
Now you know the story.

160
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,320
You still think that I'm a thief?

161
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,201
I am still wondering.

162
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,640
What caused you and Bam to fight?

163
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,680
This place is weird.

164
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,520
After the party,

165
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:59,240
there's no people in the hotel and on the beach.

166
00:12:59,603 --> 00:13:01,280
So quiet.

167
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,881
Stop talking already.

168
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,080
I should have been at the airport.

169
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:09,520
I should have been waiting for the plane to Germany happily.

170
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,721
Why do I have to be stuck in this crazy mess?

171
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,240
And my butts looked like this.

172
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,280
Calm down.

173
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,440
You'll find out what happened

174
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,880
once you see the tattoo parlor.

175
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:29,044
That the place!

176
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,600
Let's go! Let's go!

177
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:33,960
Why did you hit me? It hurts.

178
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,920
Stop whining already.

179
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:38,800
It's just a tattoo, how hurt could it be?

180
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,760
See? How do you feel?

181
00:13:42,077 --> 00:13:43,880
You think it's hurt? / I was electrocuted.

182
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:45,464
Well I got a tattoo.

183
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:47,520
Let's go. Keep on walking, faster.

184
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:56,600
Are you sure this is the place?

185
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,000
Did you see any other places on the way?

186
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,481
I think this is the place.

187
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:07,250
Stop whining already.

188
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,160
What kind of this place? The lights look so weird.

189
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:25,920
What kind of people get tattoo from this place?

190
00:14:31,157 --> 00:14:32,903
Hey bro!

191
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:37,680
I think this is the place for sure.

192
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,960
Hello. / Don't say a word.

193
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,560
And wait for me here.

194
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,178
Wait for what?

195
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:49,224
For him.

196
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:51,920
He said wait for me here.

197
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:54,400
It's not the time.

198
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:01,400
How dare you come to this place?!?!

199
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,481
Go to hell!

200
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:05,960
Why did you bring a rifle? Who're you gonna shoot?

201
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:09,440
Shoot you? / Which one? There're two of us.

202
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,481
It's you! Don't run away from me!

203
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:15,560
You're too fast! Where're you going? I can't aim straight.

204
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,720
Wait, don't shoot. Please just talk.

205
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,880
I won't talk, I want to shoot.

206
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,320
What? / Wait.

207
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,500
Wait.

208
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:28,000
Before you shoot,

209
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,760
can you tell me what I did wrong?

210
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:32,960
No! I'll shoot first and I'll tell you later.

211
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:37,840
Let's go! Don't shoot!

212
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,840
Wait. / Where is the other one?

213
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,440
Right here.

214
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,791
What should we do next?

215
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,331
What should we do next?

216
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,800
You need to stop walking away from me. / Then you need to stop following me.

217
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,480
I told you that I have nothing to talk to you.

218
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,881
But I'm ready to take you away with me.

219
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,360
It's too late, don't you think?

220
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,800
I don't want to run away with you. I've chosen my own life.

221
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,800
This is how the story went.

222
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,960
So you stole the money

223
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,640
because you wanted to run away with Bam as you promised?

224
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,971
You know what?

225
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:43,560
Actually, I had so many chances to run away with her.

226
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,201
But I refused to do so.

227
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,521
I thought that I should save up more.

228
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:56,560
I needed to do things that I didn't want to.

229
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:01,160
In the end, Mr.Charn fooled me.

230
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:03,360
Just like I fooled everyone else.

231
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,680
So I needed to steal the money,

232
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:12,480
and became a thief.

233
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,600
I met you last night,

234
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,240
I had a chance to do as I promised to you.

235
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,200
I shouldn't have walked away from you too soon.

236
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,521
I shouldn't have let the time pass by.

237
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,440
If I had come sooner

238
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:56,080
and wouldn't leave you in the first place,

239
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,680
you wouldn't have turned out this way.

240
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,791
I won't make any promised.

241
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,000
But you gotta believe me that

242
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,840
I'll find a person who made you become this way.

243
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,960
Hey! Someone is about to open a freezer.

244
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,960
What did you say? / You need to go and have a look.

245
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,760
If someone sees my body, you all will be in trouble.

246
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,071
Hey!

247
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:59,637
How did you know where the freezer was? / I know

248
00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:02,440
How did you? / Cause I'm smart.

249
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,360
Fine, I'm the stupid one.

250
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,171
They worked for a man who fought us last night.

251
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,322
What are they doing with the freezer?

252
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,400
I have no idea but

253
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,160
no one can touch the freezer.

254
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:22,424
What should we do?

255
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:30,758
Hey,

256
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,320
I saw a swimming suit shop on the way here.

257
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,151
And?

258
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,840
Excuse me!

259
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:45,964
Who are you talking to?

260
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,280
Hurry up! What are we waiting for?

261
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,960
You need to help me look instead of just talk.

262
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,760
Just open it, what're you waiting for?

263
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:09,440
I know, sir!

264
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:13,000
Excuse me!

265
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:30,650
I need some help.

266
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,880
You need to untie me.

267
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,360
If I do that, you'll shoot me.

268
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,120
You deserved it. / Why did you want to shoot us?

269
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:44,840
Just tell me what he did last night.

270
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,400
That's right. I really don't remember what happened last night.

271
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,120
What did I do to you? / I'm not telling you.

272
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:51,600
Come on, please tell me.

273
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,360
Just tell us. / Nope, I won't.

274
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,411
Not gonna tell you.

275
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:56,364
Fine.

276
00:20:58,143 --> 00:20:59,144
Are you gonna tell us now?

277
00:21:00,483 --> 00:21:02,200
I am!

278
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:04,384
That's it.

279
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:06,963
Last night,

280
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,800
you were here with a woman.

281
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,041
See?

282
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,391
What did she look like?

283
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,520
What did she look like?

284
00:21:20,257 --> 00:21:21,158
What?

285
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,000
My phone, it's on this side.

286
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,880
This one? / Yep. I took some photos of her.

287
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,440
Hurry up, just look at them. / You tied me so tight.

288
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,891
Fuck!

289
00:21:35,937 --> 00:21:36,938
Sure. / Sure.

290
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:42,040
What did she say? / She's asking for help.

291
00:21:43,497 --> 00:21:44,840
Yes.

292
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:48,600
Now you're just acting to be cool.

293
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,600
How can I help you?

294
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,560
Where is the swimming pool?

295
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:01,920
Where is the swimming pool?

296
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,480
Right, you want some papaya salad?

297
00:22:04,717 --> 00:22:06,680
I'm good at this. / Stupid you!

298
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,800
She's asking about the swimming pool.

299
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,160
Go that way.

300
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,100
You understand?

301
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,640
Could you take me there please?

302
00:22:19,257 --> 00:22:20,800
Please / Sure.

303
00:22:21,643 --> 00:22:22,644
Hey!

304
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,270
It's not the time. Don't you forget what we're doing here for?

305
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,723
You forgot about that?

306
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,160
Females are more important than work, always.

307
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,720
Welcome to Thailand my friend. / Thank you, let's go.

308
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,560
Damn it! Hey!

309
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,231
What should I do?

310
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:27,340
I'm super drunk. Where is everyone?

311
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,040
Where's the keyhole?

312
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,000
Jok?

313
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,200
What is he doing with Dung's car?

314
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:44,884
Ready! Let's go!

315
00:23:56,377 --> 00:23:58,078
Fuck!

316
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,823
It's you, Jok.

317
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,703
You almost hit me earlier. Are you okay?

318
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,084
I'm fine.

319
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,800
But Dung's car! If he finds out that I crashed his car like this,

320
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,600
his Godzilla mom and he will rip off my head for sure.

321
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,480
What should I do?

322
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:35,404
Well,

323
00:24:36,697 --> 00:24:37,960
you're not gonna tell Dung, are you?

324
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:39,698
Tell!

325
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,441
I'm kidding. I'm not gonna tell him.

326
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,360
You need to go. / Thanks.

327
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,720
Bam, wait.

328
00:25:00,097 --> 00:25:01,098
Bam.

329
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,040
Hi, Ter. It's you!

330
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,280
What are you doing here?

331
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,640
I was worried about you.

332
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,320
We were apart for a second and Jok almost hit you with the car.

333
00:25:14,523 --> 00:25:15,660
So scary.

334
00:25:16,377 --> 00:25:19,560
I brought this.

335
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,960
We should find a quiet and romantic spot

336
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,011
to drink and mingle.

337
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:33,720
And then we can do this and that.

338
00:25:35,277 --> 00:25:36,278
What?

339
00:25:37,323 --> 00:25:38,524
She didn't listen to me?

340
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,360
Wait for me.

341
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,491
Bam!

342
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,760
Wait, Bam!

343
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,080
Wait for me.

344
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,401
Wait.

345
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,080
Where are you heading to? / Just walking around.

346
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,800
But it's too far from the hotel.

347
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,160
You can't go back if you don't want to come with me.

348
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,000
You're gonna leave me like that?

349
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,761
Look! A tattoo parlor! Looks like fun.

350
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,241
We should get tattoos.

351
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:11,884
Huh? / Let's go.

352
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,360
Come on. / What?

353
00:26:15,077 --> 00:26:16,880
Wait for me.

354
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:25,840
This place is oddly pretty.

355
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,041
So pretty.

356
00:26:29,141 --> 00:26:30,142
Sunday, 15th at 02:05 AM.

357
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,123
Do you want to get tattoos? Welcome.

358
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,600
He is getting one. / What?

359
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,560
When did I say that? / Why are you making that face?

360
00:26:42,497 --> 00:26:44,040
You're scared of needles?

361
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,280
Nope. I'm not. Just not a big fan.

362
00:26:49,637 --> 00:26:50,920
But if you want to get a tattoo,

363
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:53,440
go ahead I can wait.

364
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,120
But I want you to get one.

365
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,600
Please? / Nope.

366
00:26:59,857 --> 00:27:02,840
Please, just get one. / No, I don't think so.

367
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:08,400
If you agree to get a tattoo, I'll let you touch my boobs.

368
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:10,680
I'll let you touch my boobs.

369
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,098
Okay?

370
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:20,290
Go ahead, I'll get one.

371
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,840
I've never wanted a tattoo this much in my life.

372
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,171
You changed your mind so fast.

373
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:28,898
Bam.

374
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,800
You sure about this tattoo on me?

375
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:36,400
Why can't I get it somewhere else? Why on my butts?

376
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,560
The other places are not as remarkable as this one.

377
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,923
Don't forget what I said.

378
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,200
Touch my boobs.

379
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,280
Bro, do it. / Sure.

380
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,120
Cover all over my butts.

381
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,271
Haven't started yet.

382
00:27:58,082 --> 00:28:01,520
Just practice my scream. / You screamed so loud.

383
00:28:05,903 --> 00:28:09,400
Another practice? / This one is for real.

384
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,080
Can I not do that? / Nope.

385
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:16,250
I won't touch your boobs, I can touch mine instead.

386
00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:20,320
Why are you so scared of pain?

387
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,640
Just drink your liquor.

388
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:24,920
And it will be so numb.

389
00:28:28,177 --> 00:28:29,178
Alright.

390
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:37,650
Okay? / Go on.

391
00:28:38,423 --> 00:28:39,600
You're so easy to talk to.

392
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:46,650
Touch my boobs.

393
00:28:53,783 --> 00:28:56,560
Touch my boobs.

394
00:29:01,303 --> 00:29:02,304
Ter?

395
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,891
Hey,

396
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,080
is he drunk or just tired?

397
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,520
I think both, go on.

398
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,600
It's just a tattoo, you wanted to kill me over that?

399
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,760
I wish it was just a tattoo, but horrible things that you did

400
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,200
happened after that.

401
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,720
Horrible things that I did?

402
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,720
What did I do?

403
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,811
Ow!

404
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,280
You're done?

405
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,491
Wow!

406
00:30:06,303 --> 00:30:08,240
I've been waiting to give you what I promised for so long.

407
00:30:08,903 --> 00:30:09,904
Come on.

408
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:11,724
Touch boobs

409
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:13,480
as promised.

410
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,040
There you go! / What the hell?

411
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,680
I'm touching your boobs like you promised me, Bam.

412
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,800
Who's Bam? Who promised you?

413
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,120
You told me that if I'm done with the tattoo,

414
00:30:29,357 --> 00:30:32,000
you'd let me touch your boobs. I got tattooted all over my butts.

415
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,880
What're you doing? I didn't make any promises. Stop!

416
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,171
Stop!

417
00:30:38,597 --> 00:30:40,520
Don't touch me. You'll going too far.

418
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,840
You like it? / Don't leave me. What?

419
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:46,600
Get out. / I'm not leaving.

420
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,880
I told you to leave.

421
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,760
Now you're touching my head? Go!

422
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:53,560
Why're you so strong? Let me go.

423
00:30:56,577 --> 00:30:57,800
I touch your chest?

424
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,000
Not only did you touch mine,

425
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:05,000
you also sucked on them.

426
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:11,163
Take your rifle

427
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,480
and shoot me to death.

428
00:31:14,177 --> 00:31:17,360
But please I beg you, don't tell anyone about this.

429
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,241
This is how the story goes,

430
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,401
my people.

431
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,120
You son of a bitch!

432
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,720
This one will haunt me for life.

433
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,480
You think it will only haunt you?

434
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,080
It will haunt me too.

435
00:31:35,637 --> 00:31:37,437
Stop arguing already.

436
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,080
If he sucked on yours,

437
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,360
you can suck on his back, and call it even.

438
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,711
Nope. / Nope.

439
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,698
Wait.

440
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,203
If you were with him last night,

441
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,440
then when did Bam leave?

442
00:31:55,137 --> 00:31:57,441
You mean a woman?

443
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,880
I saw a young man came in to take her.

444
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,441
A young man? / That's right.

445
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,920
He wore white tank top.

446
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,120
Phee?

447
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,391
Where should I put her?

448
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,651
Damn it!

449
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,051
Wait for me.

450
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,800
Fuck!

451
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,320
Hey, wait for me.

452
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,880
I'm coming ,wait for me.

453
00:33:09,163 --> 00:33:10,880
I push the bottom but it won't open.

454
00:33:41,677 --> 00:33:43,257
Excuse me / Yeah?

455
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,440
Have you ever seen this woman?

456
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:52,720
Never. Never ever.

457
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,281
I have never seen her.

458
00:34:11,963 --> 00:34:13,720
What? / The clothes are falling.

459
00:34:23,003 --> 00:34:24,004
Hello?

460
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:26,643
Hello, I'm Somchai, a hotel manager.

461
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,560
I got footage of the medium's accomplice.

462
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,240
You got picture of her accomplice? / Really?

463
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,680
Really? I forgot some clothes downstairs?

464
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:39,044
Damn it!

465
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:42,500
Send me the pics now.

466
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,251
Thank you.

467
00:35:30,657 --> 00:35:32,280
Come here, follow me.

468
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,210
The pool is right over there, short walk.

469
00:35:39,983 --> 00:35:40,880
Where is she?

470
00:35:42,377 --> 00:35:44,880
I knew it. She's so pretty

471
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,640
there's no way that she's human.

472
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,480
Just you wait, I'll make her appear.

473
00:35:49,877 --> 00:35:51,400
Namas….

474
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,020
She's a foreigner, not a ghost. What's with the chant?

475
00:35:54,161 --> 00:35:55,920
Let's go, out stuff.

476
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,520
I don't get it, where is she?

477
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,200
It's you!

478
00:36:24,477 --> 00:36:25,650
Hey! Stop!

479
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,718
Damn it, I'm sorry.

480
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,360
Where is he? Damn it!

481
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,400
What're you doing? / Hey! Wait!

482
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:36,320
Where are you rushing to? / Let me go.

483
00:37:36,437 --> 00:37:38,120
Let me go. / We need to talk.

484
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,871
What to talk about, sir?

485
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,960
What? You really don't remember me?

486
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,520
Of course, I do. You're an officer.

487
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:56,003
That's right, I am one.

488
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,250
But I'm also your friend.

489
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,921
Are you insane? I don't have an officer friend.

490
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,880
Wait. / What?

491
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,920
Look at me, closely.

492
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,480
I'm your friend. I am…. / Hey!

493
00:38:14,597 --> 00:38:16,480
Damn it!

494
00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:18,750
What're you doing? Tried to hit me?

495
00:38:19,543 --> 00:38:20,544
Yes, sir.

496
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,670
But you know what? / What?

497
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,440
I got bottles. / What?

498
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,480
Oh my ! / Ouch!

499
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,237
What the hell did you do?

500
00:38:29,337 --> 00:38:31,800
Let's go. / Why did you hit him? We were talking.

501
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,720
No need to talk. He's an officer, why're you talking to him?

502
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:37,040
I didn't know what he tried to say. / No need to talk to him, just go.

503
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,400
Give me your bottle.

504
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,124
Why did you hit me? Have I done something to you? Tell me!

505
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,920
I'm an officer, tell me!

506
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:51,724
What did I do to you? / Just stop.

507
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,283
Tell me! I told you to tell me! / Come here.

508
00:38:56,577 --> 00:38:59,160
Let him go!

509
00:39:00,937 --> 00:39:03,680
You're pulling my ear despite the fact that I'm an officer? / You didn't listen to me.

510
00:39:03,783 --> 00:39:04,960
He hit me first.

511
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,520
So you were about to tell me who you are?

512
00:39:11,603 --> 00:39:12,604
I'm Wang.

513
00:39:14,063 --> 00:39:14,864
What Wang?

514
00:39:15,903 --> 00:39:18,040
I used to have uneven hair trim. I'm Wang.

515
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,790
I'm Wang.

516
00:39:24,117 --> 00:39:25,118
Here.

517
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,601
Remember me now?

518
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,721
It really is you!

519
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,480
How long are you gonna hug me for?

520
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:03,640
I can't believe it that

521
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,280
you'd grow up to be a police.

522
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,720
I can't believe that you'd grow up to be a criminal either.

523
00:40:09,603 --> 00:40:10,604
Come on.

524
00:40:11,604 --> 00:40:13,840
Explain to me what really happened.

525
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,037
You need to tell me all of it, okay?

526
00:40:17,223 --> 00:40:19,100
Who was the woman you had a fight with last night?

527
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,801
Was it Bam?

528
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,500
Where is she?

529
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,551
That's right.

530
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,720
Where did you take her?

531
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,320
Damn it! She tricked me to go to the swimming pool

532
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:39,960
and now she left me. That's just sad.

533
00:40:40,323 --> 00:40:43,280
You're sad? It's all because of you.

534
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,960
Hurry up! We need to bring him drugs.

535
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:48,440
You didn't hesitate to hit me?

536
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:53,158
Fuck!

537
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,051
What is it?

538
00:40:55,357 --> 00:40:56,358
Look!

539
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:03,520
Damn it!

540
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:07,960
Where are you? / I'm heading to the lobby,

541
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,437
I need to use a bathroom real quick.

542
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:12,440
What the fuck is wrong with this hotel? I can't find any bathroom.

543
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,520
We got a problem.

544
00:41:15,597 --> 00:41:18,640
I can't find drugs in the place where Bam said she hid them.

545
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,250
No drugs? What do you mean?

546
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,690
They went missing?

547
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,960
Bam texted me last night, she said that the drugs were in the freezer.

548
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,200
Of course, they're in there.

549
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,721
But they aren't.

550
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,360
Bam went missing as well as the drugs.

551
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,000
I think she betrayed you for sure.

552
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,440
Well you need to find Bam.

553
00:41:40,637 --> 00:41:43,600
When I'm done using the bathroom, I need my drugs, okay?

554
00:41:45,397 --> 00:41:46,398
Got it.

555
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,240
Where's the bathroom?

556
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,240
It's right over there, just take two turns on the left, then two turns on the right.

557
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,240
You'll see the roundabout, then take two flights of stairs.

558
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,320
To the bathroom or to Khao Khitchakut mountains?

559
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:03,920
Pass the roundabout then take the stairs.

560
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,690
What kind of a bathroom is that?

561
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,960
I hid her in men's bathroom.

562
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,531
Huh?

563
00:42:57,863 --> 00:42:59,560
Who put a sign up here?

564
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,160
Pass the roundabout then take the stairs.

565
00:43:07,957 --> 00:43:09,920
What kind of a bathroom is that?

566
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,320
I think it's the safest place and no one will get in there easily.

567
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,160
Jackpot!

568
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,640
Double jackpot!

569
00:43:58,343 --> 00:43:59,344
Hey!

570
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,080
Can you pass me some tissue papers?

571
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:11,841
Hey!

572
00:44:13,883 --> 00:44:14,884
What the hell?

573
00:44:16,183 --> 00:44:17,877
I saw someone used that room earlier.

574
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,431
Woman's feet?

575
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,170
I got in the wrong bathroom?

576
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,481
Where are her feet?

577
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,743
Wait a minute.

578
00:45:12,823 --> 00:45:13,824
What is he talking about?

579
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,561
Why did you hide her in the bathroom?

580
00:45:17,361 --> 00:45:18,363
What happened to her?

581
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,757
You're here.

582
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,731
Hey, I know who killed Bam.

583
00:45:26,797 --> 00:45:28,217
What did you just say?

584
00:45:36,837 --> 00:45:38,117
Damn it!

585
00:45:38,517 --> 00:45:39,518
What did you say earlier?

586
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,640
Bam was murdered?

587
00:45:45,637 --> 00:45:46,238
Ping?

588
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,440
Ping? / Huh?

589
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,720
Why didn't you tell me that she got murdered?

590
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,680
What happened to her? Who did that to her?

591
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,880
Tell me! What's wrong with Bam? / Argh!

592
00:45:58,561 --> 00:45:59,720
How could I tell you?

593
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,640
I don't even know what happened to her.

594
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,680
I don't know who killed her.

595
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:12,040
Ter, you said that you know her killer,

596
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,000
who killed her?

597
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,321
Just tell us already.

598
00:46:20,321 --> 00:46:22,880
Say it! / Just say it, what're you waiting for?

599
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,720
I can't. / What the fuck do you mean by that?

600
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,320
Who killed her? / It's you, Phee.

601
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:29,611
You killed Bam.

602
00:46:52,463 --> 00:46:54,343
It's getting cold, we should go back to the room.

603
00:46:56,943 --> 00:47:00,720
Bam is dead because of you. / You killed her and hid her body, right? Say it!

604
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:04,550
When I'm done with the drugs,

605
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,281
I'll take care of those who made Bam to be this way.

606
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,363
If your Dad finds out, I don’t think he will help you out this time.

607
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:15,320
It's a drug carton. / What?

608
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:17,440
Stop messing with my drugs.

609
00:47:17,577 --> 00:47:21,220
You really took my drugs. / Give me five million, now!

610
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:24,250
You all need to drop your guns. This is an order!

611
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,441
Now!
