1
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:08,560
Bam! / How did she get into Dung's trunk?

2
00:00:08,603 --> 00:00:11,440
We were too drunk to remember and we accidentally killed her?

3
00:00:11,497 --> 00:00:13,560
Are you crazy? Someone like us can't kill anyone.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,400
Well, it's nothing. / I told you so.

5
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:19,450
I saw you two fought so hard, you even slapped her.

6
00:00:19,657 --> 00:00:21,280
It's not a surprise to find out if you actually killed her.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,560
No way. / Right, Bam?

8
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:24,004
Yes.

9
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:27,440
I really don't remember what happened last night.

10
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:29,920
I don’t remember who killed me.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,200
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:32,760
It's your cut,

13
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:34,520
if I can get money back to you.

14
00:00:34,857 --> 00:00:37,160
What did you do to the manager? Why did he let us in?

15
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:39,280
When we talked, I noticed that he kept looking at my boobs.

16
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:41,160
I let him touch mine once. / What?

17
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:43,443
Let's play a game. / What game?

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,840
Holding breath underwater.

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,960
Bam!

20
00:00:57,643 --> 00:00:58,644
Oh! Yes!

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,960
Oh! Yes!

22
00:01:01,343 --> 00:01:02,320
Continue please.

23
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:05,560
You're mad? Why did you stop?

24
00:01:08,617 --> 00:01:09,600
Can you please continue?

25
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:13,237
Bam?

26
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:15,920
Where are you? Don't stop.

27
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,240
Bam!

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,040
Where are you?

29
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,200
Damn it! Bam!

30
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:25,480
It's not funny!

31
00:01:25,997 --> 00:01:27,160
Bam!

32
00:01:28,457 --> 00:01:29,760
Bam!

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,601
Bam!

34
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,851
Come on! Wake up!

35
00:01:35,157 --> 00:01:36,158
Damn it!

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,160
I killed Bam?

37
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,840
I killed people? It can't be true.

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,680
If my Mom finds out that I'm a killer, she will kill me for sure. I didn't kill anyone.

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,800
It's true! Help me!

40
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,640
No one can save you!

41
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:56,800
Go to hell!

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,760
I killed Bam?

43
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,241
Go to hell!

44
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,371
Come back here!

45
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,720
Calm down, don't strangle his neck. / Sure.

46
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,211
You should have let her do it!

47
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,240
Don't stangle him. He could die!

48
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,418
Fine.

49
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:25,423
You son of a bitch!

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,200
Let her do it. / Just do it.

51
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,480
You'll die for a hundred times, you fat ass!

52
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,071
Dung!

53
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,961
Dung!

54
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,057
Calm down!

55
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:45,277
I told you to calm down. Don't kill him!

56
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:51,480
Stop running away from me. Come back here. / Calm down.

57
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:52,878
Hey!

58
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,920
You're gonna help your friend? / You need to calm down.

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,040
He can't run away for too far.

60
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,320
There's more to watch, we haven't finished the clip yet.

61
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,500
If Dung ended up killing Bam,

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,440
I will be the one to catch him.

63
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,081
Okay?

64
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,320
We will show you a picture of a lady

65
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,521
who stole 5 million baht from Mr.Charn's foundation one more time.

66
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,520
5 million?

67
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:33,280
This is a face of a medium turned criminal.

68
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,281
Are you a manager?

69
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,321
That's right.

70
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,360
I'm Dan and this is Chat, we're police officers.

71
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,680
Can we watch CCTV's footage?

72
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:52,464
Is everything okay?

73
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,840
A criminal stealing money fled to this place.

74
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,161
Have you ever seen this woman?

75
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:03,378
I see.

76
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,960
Let me put my glasses on.

77
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,680
I can't see without them.

78
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,680
Please be okay, Bam!

79
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,321
Damn it! Bam!

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,720
You're turning pale?

81
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,600
This is not funny, you scared me.

82
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:38,840
It's funny.

83
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:42,080
You don't like it, I should go.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,001
Where are you going?

85
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,480
To find something fun to do. / Let me join you.

86
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,561
Stop following me, I'm tired of you.

87
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,811
Bam?

88
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,080
I need to use my hands again.

89
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:05,178
What the hell?

90
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,760
Plot twist, Bam didn't die in the pool.

91
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,360
Dung didn't kill her either.

92
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,204
What?

93
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,520
Are you gonna believe

94
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,801
that Dung didn't do it.

95
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,920
If he didn't do it, then how did she die?

96
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:34,784
I know!

97
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,557
Know who killed Bam?

98
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:39,320
I just realized that I forgot my GoPro in the room. / Come on!

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,001
What?

100
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:42,682
It took me so long to realize what I have forgotten.

101
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:44,040
It's expensive.

102
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,760
And there are so many clips with the ladies. / Can you be serious for once?

103
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,400
Help me look where Bam went after the pool

104
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,680
and find out what happened. It's not the time to joke around.

105
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:54,884
Save some for me.

106
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,841
Manager? What is it?

107
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,000
This woman and her friends

108
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,601
just asked me to see CCTV footage.

109
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,320
Her friends? Who?

110
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,160
This way, officers.

111
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,240
They are in here.

112
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:19,318
What's that noise?

113
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,800
You're closest to the door, go have a look.

114
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,680
Me? / Hurry up.

115
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,521
Why me again?

116
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:31,764
You're closest to the door.

117
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,171
What?

118
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,960
I didn't lock it before I left.

119
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,481
You have a key?

120
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,640
Yes. / Then use it.

121
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:00,280
Here.

122
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:03,760
Cute keychain, contrast to your look.

123
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:06,160
It's my daughter's.

124
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,071
You got the wrong key?

125
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,151
I don't think so.

126
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:21,640
It is this one, I remember.

127
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,844
Maybe there's something wrong with the key.

128
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,360
Damn it! Police officers are here.

129
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,800
What are they doing here?

130
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:48,760
Or they found out about Bam already?

131
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:53,560
Damn it! What should we do?

132
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,451
How much is this door cost?

133
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,000
Not that expensive.

134
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:02,200
Damn it! What should we do?

135
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,080
Where should we run to? Think!

136
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:08,080
I think we should go this way. / Hurry up.

137
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:18,280
What is wrong with him?

138
00:09:18,963 --> 00:09:21,080
It's his style, have you ever heard of this?

139
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,277
Strong and Fast.

140
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:28,720
You sound like a spokesperson.

141
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,160
Hurry up! / Let's go.

142
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,720
Quick! / Hurry up!

143
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,391
What is it?

144
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,521
It's nothing.

145
00:10:06,077 --> 00:10:07,078
Where are they?

146
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,200
I guess they left before us.f

147
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:14,520
Let's look at the CCTV

148
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,920
we could see where they are going.

149
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,040
That was so close! I was worried we're gonna get caught.

150
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,191
So exhausted.

151
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:32,478
Shit!

152
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,240
Why did the trunk pop like that?

153
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,680
Or Bam gets hot so she wants some air?

154
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,720
That's right. It's quite hot lately.

155
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,840
Shut up! She's dead, she can't pop the trunk.

156
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,120
Let's go. / Let's have a look.

157
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,520
Where is she?

158
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,800
What is she doing here?

159
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:10,400
Let's go back.

160
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,971
Go back?

161
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,280
Wait! Stop! Go to camera no. 5.

162
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,760
Camera no.5?

163
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:24,520
You slapped me Bam?

164
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:37,560
They fought like in the drama.

165
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,400
Who did she slap?

166
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,244
I don't know.

167
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,141
Pause! / Pause.

168
00:12:03,157 --> 00:12:04,617
Officers?

169
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,161
That's right.

170
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,120
Damn it!

171
00:12:08,783 --> 00:12:12,080
You think they know that we're here for drugs?

172
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,480
I didn't hear it loud and clear

173
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,640
but it looked like they're looking for someone.

174
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,151
It has nothing to do with us.

175
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,200
How could you say that?

176
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,080
The officers are right here and I'm worried.

177
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:27,458
Or…

178
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,161
should we

179
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,920
wake him up to talk about this?

180
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,480
Sure, if you dare.

181
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:41,000
Who would dare?

182
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,000
I saw him shoot a person who woke him up right before my eyes.

183
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,200
But he is sleeping for such a long time.

184
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,640
It's super late and he still hasn't waken up.

185
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,080
You think he's dead?

186
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:16,280
Whoa! Weird reflex. / Deep sleep, I guess.

187
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,081
What should we do? We have police issue

188
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,240
and we don't know where Loanzing gang is.

189
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,703
And our boss is still sleeping.

190
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,321
What's going on?

191
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:45,044
I think we should stop.

192
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,680
It keeps getting worse and worse.

193
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,241
I'm out.

194
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,040
Where are you going, Jok?

195
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:53,044
Where are you going, Jok?

196
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:54,898
I think that's enough.

197
00:13:55,023 --> 00:13:57,400
I'm gonna tell police about this, they're here.

198
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,440
We talked about this and no police involved.

199
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,997
But it's gone out of hand.

200
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:03,520
Let's just tell them so it will be over.

201
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,801
Over in what way?

202
00:14:06,437 --> 00:14:08,280
You don't even know who killed her.

203
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,521
That's the reason why we need to tell the police.

204
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,080
Why're you so overthinking?

205
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:15,760
Of course we are. We're the ones who will be in big troubles.

206
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,120
What the fuck are you talking about?

207
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,640
Think about this, if we got arrested,

208
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,440
you think Ter can go abroad after that?

209
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:33,280
Don't you remember what he said ?

210
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:35,480
He said that working abroad could change him for a better life.

211
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,960
You want him to let go of this chance

212
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,360
just because you really want to tell police? / You need to stop.

213
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,640
Stop saying like you're the good guy.

214
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,481
You're the most selfish one.

215
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,400
You don't think I don't know what you're afraid of?

216
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,560
You're worried that if you got arrested

217
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,160
you will be cut off from your billion inheritance, aren't you?

218
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:54,284
That's right.

219
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,960
I've got nothing to lose.

220
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,640
I work odd jobs and I'm so deep in gambling debts

221
00:15:00,737 --> 00:15:02,600
that I need to beg for your help.

222
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,640
Being grateful, right? It's because of this

223
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:08,680
I have to listen to you. / You need to calm down.

224
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,360
It's not what I meant. / You didn't mean it but you think about it.

225
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,640
You think about it, don't you? And you too.

226
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,241
If Dung was here, he'd think about it too.

227
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,240
Remember that a loser like me

228
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,560
will walk to the police and tell them that I kill Bam.

229
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,120
And you all can continue with your fabulous lives.

230
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,521
Son of a bitch! You need to stop acting like a moron. / I'm not a moron.

231
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,681
I'll tell the police. / Tell them fucking what?

232
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,320
Let me go. / Hey!

233
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:31,445
Jok!

234
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,080
Keep it together!

235
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,800
My friend is dead. If someone feel horrible or

236
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,840
needs to tell the police, then it should be me.

237
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,640
But I won't let them arrest me

238
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,280
and assume that I kill a friend.

239
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,680
We need to do like we agreed on, we need to find out

240
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,881
how Bam died and who killed her, you hear me?

241
00:15:58,603 --> 00:15:59,604
So fierce!

242
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,681
Got it.

243
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,271
Got it.

244
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,560
Got it.

245
00:16:06,737 --> 00:16:08,080
I feel like I'm rotten.

246
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:09,524
What?

247
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,040
I told you so many times not to pop up like this.

248
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,551
You scared me.

249
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:17,064
Is it Bam?

250
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,881
What did you say?

251
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,400
I can't control when or how you're gonna see me.

252
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,960
I said that

253
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,520
I didn't want to be rotten in the car.

254
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,720
What did she say?

255
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,400
I think we should get her out of that hot space.

256
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:44,058
She didn't want to be rotten.

257
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:46,044
Any place cold enough?

258
00:16:47,393 --> 00:16:48,640
I was a co-owner at the bar and I know that

259
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:50,480
all hotels and bars will have big freezer.

260
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:53,320
Frisbee? / You really want to play it now?

261
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,280
A freezer? Frisbee my ass.

262
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,880
What if we keep her in there?

263
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,520
Last night, when I went out to pee,

264
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,880
I walked into a bar behind the pool accidentally

265
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:09,400
I think it's out of service.

266
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,200
There should be a big freezer in there.

267
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,841
Wait,

268
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,200
but we need to walk through

269
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,520
the lobby to get

270
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:24,120
Bam into the freezer.

271
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,840
How can we get there without raising suspicious?

272
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,641
Why did you snap your fingers?

273
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,561
You'll see.

274
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:45,040
Hurry up.

275
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,471
Hang over, you know?

276
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:55,968
Hurry up. / I know.

277
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,520
Wait,

278
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,160
is she okay?

279
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,240
Well, just hang over.

280
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,880
I think she partied too hard last night.

281
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:16,537
But she looks so pale.

282
00:18:16,778 --> 00:18:19,400
Should we take her to the sick bay to check up?

283
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,281
What?

284
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,881
You need to go to sleep?

285
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,360
She doesn't want to trouble anyone. / Right.

286
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:33,200
It's okay. The nurse is coming right there.

287
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,711
Is everything okay?

288
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,160
I think she's sick.

289
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,561
Can you have a look?

290
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,400
Sure, let me have a look.

291
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:46,018
What's that?

292
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,400
Right, you don't want to see a nurse?

293
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,600
Well, she has a fuse with a nurse.

294
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:54,280
A nurse stole her boyfriend.

295
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:55,760
So she hates the nurses so much.

296
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,360
What? You want to sleep now? Okay, let's go.

297
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:04,290
Excuse us. / Wait.

298
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:05,640
Are you sure?

299
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:08,720
It's fine. / She's fine.

300
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,880
This is how she is, hung over like usual.

301
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:11,958
That's right.

302
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,280
Are you sure that she's okay? What's wrong with her eyes?

303
00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:29,520
Help me! Help!

304
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,480
Help me! Help!

305
00:19:33,017 --> 00:19:35,520
Help me! Help!

306
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:38,484
Hurry up.

307
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,520
Help me! Help!

308
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,120
What's going on?

309
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:44,480
My husband has epilepsy.

310
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:46,840
Baby, just breathe.

311
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:48,320
Please just breathe.

312
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:50,160
He's having a heart attack. What should we do?

313
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:52,720
Don't worry, we have an AED machine.

314
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,231
Nida? / I'm coming.

315
00:19:58,077 --> 00:19:59,320
We have to do that.

316
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,640
Heart attack is not a joke.

317
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,841
Let's go.

318
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:05,480
1..2…3…. / Stop.

319
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:16,920
I think we should take him to the hospital.

320
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,130
Stop messing with my balls.

321
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,800
I'm not a squid, stop grilling me.

322
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:25,044
I'm fine.

323
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,921
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,561
Baby, wait for me.

325
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,883
That's weird. / I know.

326
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,960
Did you smell something?

327
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,297
Burning balls?

328
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,841
All done.

329
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,121
It looks like nobody has used it for years.

330
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,800
She will be safe here.

331
00:20:58,697 --> 00:20:59,698
Let me help you.

332
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:04,998
What should we do next?

333
00:21:05,787 --> 00:21:07,720
About the killer? / About my balls.

334
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:09,760
I can still feel something. / Oh come on!

335
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,201
Stop worrying about your balls for a sec and focus on this.

336
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:14,840
How can I not? My balls got electrocuted.

337
00:21:15,277 --> 00:21:16,600
You still have one left.

338
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,240
Both of them got electrocuted.

339
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,200
You keep talking about your balls, she can't stand it.

340
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:28,484
I'm hurt.

341
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,681
I know!

342
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,400
Damn it!

343
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,400
Good boy!

344
00:21:47,243 --> 00:21:48,244
Good boy!

345
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,297
No one from Loanzing gang picked up the phone.

346
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,160
Bam texted me last night

347
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:03,720
saying that the drugs are in freezer at the bar and no one used it.

348
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,320
You two need to go there to get it, watch out for the police.

349
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:09,320
They're not looking for us,

350
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:11,320
but if they find out about drugs trade, then they will be after us.

351
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:12,718
Let's go.

352
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,000
Got it.

353
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,640
Where are you, Bam?

354
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:27,120
I'll go back to watch CCTV footage with Ping.

355
00:22:27,217 --> 00:22:29,480
You two need to find Dung.

356
00:22:29,717 --> 00:22:30,718
Right.

357
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:34,040
Where is she anyway?

358
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,680
To pee. / What?

359
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,360
She can still pee under this situation?

360
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,721
You never wanted to pee?

361
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,680
Stupid question.

362
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,840
I got scolded at for being goofy and serious,

363
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:47,240
I don't know how to act now.

364
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,631
Jok,

365
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,720
you don't have to do anything.

366
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,000
You've been a moron for such a long time.

367
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,400
What? You're not even gonna take my side?

368
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:00,840
Wait for me.

369
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:02,224
Dung!

370
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,760
Where are you? / Dung!

371
00:23:09,703 --> 00:23:11,080
Where is he going?

372
00:23:11,577 --> 00:23:12,280
Dung!

373
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:22,560
Are you in there?

374
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:25,218
Yeah?

375
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,521
I'm sorry.

376
00:23:30,121 --> 00:23:31,160
I got the wrong room.

377
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:43,280
Wait, hey!

378
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:45,360
Have you seen my friend? He went missing.

379
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:47,280
Never.

380
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,040
What? You're from the south? / From Nakhon

381
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:52,920
Nakhon Si Thammarat? / Nakhon Sawan.

382
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:57,880
You called that south?

383
00:23:58,197 --> 00:23:59,320
South of Chiang Mai.

384
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,240
Who hired him?

385
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:08,044
This way, please.

386
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,560
I'll look into the footage one more time

387
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,600
to see where the medium went to.

388
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:21,000
Can I ask you something?

389
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,360
I'd like to know if that medium

390
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,760
really stole 5 million baht.

391
00:24:31,457 --> 00:24:32,520
That's true. 5 million.

392
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,640
What? / Your elbow touched my boobs.

393
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,621
Well your boobs touched my elbow.

394
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:48,400
You need to be careful when you see her.

395
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:01,400
What is it?

396
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,721
It's nothing.

397
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,584
Ter!

398
00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:09,760
Come on, wait for me.

399
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,520
Why did you walk like that? Still hurt?

400
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,590
Why don't you get your balls electrocuted like me?

401
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:16,880
Where the hell is Dung?

402
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,400
I can't reach him. I was gonna ask him to look at my balls.

403
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,520
It looks like his phone is turned off.

404
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,320
If no one sees him here,

405
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,360
perhaps he isn't here anymore.

406
00:25:32,603 --> 00:25:34,910
Wait, or…

407
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,200
you think he's going home to his mom?

408
00:25:38,223 --> 00:25:39,997
It could be.

409
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:42,360
He's a mama boy, he loves his Godzilla mom so much.

410
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,560
But he didn't drive his car back? His Mom could kill him.

411
00:25:48,643 --> 00:25:49,644
You're right.

412
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,920
I saw a temple at the entrance.

413
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,760
He could stay at the temple.

414
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,730
Ah, I see.

415
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:02,840
You're gonna say that he's so stressed out

416
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,920
and he couldn't control himself because of his guilt? / Right.

417
00:26:05,977 --> 00:26:07,880
And he went right into monkhood? / Yep.

418
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,880
Amen / You asshole.

419
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,560
How could you say such nonsense? Are you crazy?

420
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:17,400
I think we should go back to our room.

421
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,040
It's not the check-out time yet, we could still get in.

422
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,760
Hurry up. / I can't hurry.

423
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:25,464
Let's go, quickly.

424
00:26:27,563 --> 00:26:28,564
Dung.

425
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,520
Where the hell are you?

426
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,218
Dung!

427
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,760
Where the hell is he?

428
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,360
Why can't I remember anything?

429
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,770
You're here.

430
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:47,520
What? You found Dung?

431
00:26:47,963 --> 00:26:49,400
My GoPro.

432
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,080
I found it, it's right here.

433
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,720
You're back to me. / Stop being an influencer for a sec.

434
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,431
It's expensive.

435
00:27:01,983 --> 00:27:03,600
Did you film all the time last night?

436
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,861
Sure I did.

437
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,320
Even when we ate. / I did.

438
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,391
We slept? / I did.

439
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,120
You went to the bathroom? / I did. What?

440
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,600
Why're you asking so many question?

441
00:27:10,657 --> 00:27:13,320
If you filmed all the time, we could look into it.

442
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,640
And we could see what happened last night.

443
00:27:15,771 --> 00:27:18,320
You're a genius.

444
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:20,520
How to turn it on?

445
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:23,560
You don't know how, then why did you snatch it from me?

446
00:27:27,797 --> 00:27:29,840
Damn it! / What is it?

447
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,120
No more batteries. / Come on!

448
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:36,000
You need to charge it. Now.

449
00:27:36,477 --> 00:27:37,520
Find the charger.

450
00:27:38,243 --> 00:27:40,120
Where is the charger?

451
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:43,564
Hurry up.

452
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,360
Now it's just the two of us.

453
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,600
Can I ask you now?

454
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,201
About what?

455
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,081
You carried a lot of money and you acted weird when you saw the police,

456
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:08,882
is it true

457
00:28:09,603 --> 00:28:10,920
that you stole this money?

458
00:28:12,697 --> 00:28:15,760
I didn't steal it from anyone, it's mine.

459
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:18,120
But the officers said otherwise.

460
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,491
Where're you going?

461
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,640
Come on,

462
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,401
why do you care about me?

463
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,800
We should find out who killed Bam.

464
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,200
Dung didn't do it,

465
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,040
but I still don't trust you.

466
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:39,598
One of the murderers

467
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,121
could be among the three of you. / Four of us.

468
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,360
Don't forget to include yourself.

469
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,480
What? / I saw that you fought with Bam last night.

470
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:50,280
From what I saw,

471
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,520
you slapped her so it's not a surprise if you'd kill her.

472
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,320
If you stole the money,

473
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,800
then killing your friend wasn't a big deal.

474
00:29:02,217 --> 00:29:04,880
You slapped my face? Watched too much dramas?

475
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,071
Enough.

476
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,600
I believe that it's not about watching dramas.

477
00:29:14,117 --> 00:29:16,920
Even if I was a criminal or killed anyone,

478
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,000
but I wouldn't kill Bam for sure.

479
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,760
Stop saying stupid thing like this.

480
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,920
Did you see the charger? It's taking too long.

481
00:29:57,383 --> 00:30:00,223
I got it, I can turn it on.

482
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,920
Let me tell you something.

483
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,010
The more Dung is so fond of his car,

484
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,171
the more it annoys me. / Sunday, 15th at 01:20 AM.

485
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,240
But I have a mission to steal his key

486
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,100
and drive his car to show you all.

487
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,440
It's quite ashamed that

488
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,400
Dung is out with a woman

489
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:26,440
named Bam.

490
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,640
I don't know where he keeps his key.

491
00:30:33,077 --> 00:30:34,078
What're you talking about ?

492
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,640
I wanted some shaved ice.

493
00:30:38,943 --> 00:30:41,040
Why're you back to fast?

494
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,880
Don't tell me that

495
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:51,400
you finished already. / Finished what?

496
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,320
If I did, I wouldn't have been so pissed.

497
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,081
Super pissed.

498
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,920
I should sleep, so tired.

499
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,320
What is it?

500
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,920
Where is Bam? / I don't know, I'm mad at her.

501
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,081
What is wrong with him?

502
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,671
Everyone,

503
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,960
I can tell you that

504
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,300
today is very special day.

505
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,320
I got his key already, look.

506
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,881
Don't push my head.

507
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,800
You're drunk and you stole Dung's car?

508
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,881
Hi again, everyone.

509
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,880
I'm here with you again.

510
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,920
I got the car and the key.

511
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,560
It's gonna be a fun night.

512
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,160
I don't get it why Dung is so possessed of his car.

513
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,430
But I'll drive his car

514
00:32:24,591 --> 00:32:27,950
and I'll go full throttle.

515
00:32:53,403 --> 00:32:54,920
Did I kill Bam?

516
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,000
What's wrong with you?

517
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,361
Nothing.

518
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,360
I think we should split to look for that medium.

519
00:33:14,423 --> 00:33:15,424
You go over there.

520
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,720
Who would kill a friend?

521
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,801
My bag?

522
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,800
Damn it! Where's my bag?

523
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,281
Hey!

524
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:46,560
Where're you going to?

525
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,240
Your pants are thin, right?

526
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,251
Why's that?

527
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,200
I'll wear thicker pants next time.

528
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:13,698
Hey!

529
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,000
Out of service

530
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:31,864
Where're you going?

531
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,281
Let me go.

532
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:35,000
I won't. / Let me go.

533
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,200
Where are you going? Come back here.

534
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,480
Ping, this way. / You scared me.

535
00:35:15,457 --> 00:35:16,480
F--k my life.

536
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,241
You drew it?

537
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,760
When we grow up, we should get a tattoo of this one.

538
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,721
I'll get it here.

539
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,201
What about you?

540
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,920
I don't know. You think it's hurt?

541
00:36:24,323 --> 00:36:25,324
I don't think so.

542
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,840
If you can't choose, I'll choose one for you.

543
00:36:32,037 --> 00:36:33,930
Where?

544
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,800
This one? Or this one?

545
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,280
This one?

546
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,240
This one?

547
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,840
Someone wanted to see you?

548
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm happy for you. You're gonna be out soon.

549
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,080
Hello? Personal record department? / That's right.

550
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,320
Can I get a background check of the medium?

551
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,120
I'm working on it.

552
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,080
You haven't looked it up? When will I get it?

553
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,840
Do I need to drag a person to work? And watch them work?

554
00:37:36,777 --> 00:37:38,840
I'm sorry. I'll get right to it now.

555
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,040
Send me info if you have it.

556
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:56,040
It's you.

557
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,517
You scared me? / Why? Who are you running away from?

558
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,320
The police. I almost got caught.

559
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,640
That's crazy. / We should meet up with my friends at the room.

560
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:10,600
Don't need to hold my hand. / Stop fidgeting.

561
00:38:11,197 --> 00:38:12,198
Let's go.

562
00:38:16,257 --> 00:38:17,600
Did I kill Bam?

563
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:19,704
Damn it!

564
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,811
This is huge!

565
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,120
Give it to me. I'll delete it all.

566
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,001
You can't do that.

567
00:38:29,117 --> 00:38:30,640
Stop it. / I'm gonna delete it.

568
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,841
I won't let you do it.

569
00:38:33,983 --> 00:38:35,600
I know your move, you can't get me.

570
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,281
I know this one too.

571
00:38:40,057 --> 00:38:41,058
Give it to me.

572
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,400
You hit me at the weakest spot.

573
00:38:44,057 --> 00:38:45,360
Why did my butts hurt so bad?

574
00:38:47,097 --> 00:38:49,360
Give it to me. I won't let you have it.

575
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:51,320
Give it to me. I'll delete it all. / No, I won't.

576
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:53,280
Damn it. I'll delete it. / I won't let you do that.

577
00:39:02,957 --> 00:39:04,120
What the hell is going on?

578
00:39:05,563 --> 00:39:07,440
You need to watch the clip

579
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:09,663
and you will find out who killed Bam.

580
00:39:24,643 --> 00:39:27,500
It's that bad, isn't it? / Disgusting behavior.

581
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,191
What is it?

582
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,281
What is this?

583
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,300
It's the wrong one. You need to watch this one.

584
00:39:42,403 --> 00:39:43,950
The next one. / Why didn't you say something?

585
00:40:25,163 --> 00:40:26,240
It's you.

586
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,200
You almost hit me earlier.

587
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,600
Are you okay? / I'm fine.

588
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:40,437
I didn't kill her.

589
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:46,680
I didn't kill Bam.

590
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,280
Why're you so happy? My butts hurt so bad.

591
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,271
Why're you smiling?

592
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,250
It means that Jok is not a killer.

593
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,840
Now you can stop suspecting one of my friends.

594
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,131
Good for him.

595
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,121
But you're not off the hook.

596
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,280
And Ter too.

597
00:41:14,257 --> 00:41:15,258
Don't forget that.

598
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,921
Where're you going?

599
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,280
To get something, don't follow me.

600
00:41:23,143 --> 00:41:25,000
I didn't kill Bam.

601
00:41:28,177 --> 00:41:29,560
I didn't kill Bam.

602
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:33,680
I didn't kill Bam.

603
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,280
It hurts so bad.

604
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,163
I wonder what's wrong with my butts since the morning.

605
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,800
Why does it hurt so much?

606
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,050
I need to have a look.

607
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,441
Let me see.

608
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,520
Fuck! / What?

609
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,880
What the hell? / What is it?

610
00:41:53,983 --> 00:41:56,120
Let's go. Ter! / Ter!

611
00:42:04,143 --> 00:42:06,240
Damn it! Where's my money?

612
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,951
Fuck!

613
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,360
Look, what happened to my butts?

614
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,800
When did I get a tattoo?

615
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:27,040
But you're so cool, man.

616
00:42:27,817 --> 00:42:30,280
Tha'ts right. How bad was it?

617
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,040
Stop touching it, it hurts.

618
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,640
That's why my butts hurt since the morning.

619
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,391
Damn it!

620
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:40,920
Why do you have to tattoo the word Murderer?

621
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,320
How could I know?

622
00:43:19,743 --> 00:43:21,050
It's really you, Ping.

623
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,131
Damn it!

624
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,801
I've never thought that I would get a tattoo.

625
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,960
When did I get one?

626
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,240
And why did I get one?

627
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,801
Or…

628
00:43:56,377 --> 00:43:57,400
you were the one who wanted to

629
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,640
but Bam wanted you to.

630
00:44:00,483 --> 00:44:01,800
So that she'd tell everyone

631
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,920
that you killed her.

632
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,440
I'll find a person who did this to you.

633
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,840
Someone is about to open the freezer.

634
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,640
If someone sees my body, you'll be in trouble.

635
00:44:34,217 --> 00:44:35,320
It's you!

636
00:44:39,867 --> 00:44:41,400
Wait, where are you going? / Let me go.

637
00:44:41,527 --> 00:44:42,560
Where is Bam, Ping?

638
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,680
See? Tattoo parlor

639
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,840
You came here with a lady.

640
00:44:50,943 --> 00:44:51,944
Fuck!
