1
00:00:06,187 --> 00:00:07,720
I love you.

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,451
Bam.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,920
You still loved Bam, didn't you?

4
00:00:11,197 --> 00:00:12,198
What if it's you?

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,081
Can you forget your first love?

6
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:15,400
I like you.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,280
I just want you to know about it

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,720
Of course I fixed my trunk but it still poped up out of nowhere.

9
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:21,550
What the fuck?

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,800
Sek killed me.

11
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,324
Let me go.

12
00:00:24,383 --> 00:00:25,670
How could he do this to me?

13
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:27,880
And you'll die here.

14
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:29,320
I didn't want to die.

15
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,960
You told me that you can find them

16
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:33,640
along with Ah so easily.

17
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:35,440
What does that mean? / If I agree to tell you,

18
00:00:35,663 --> 00:00:37,400
you're gonna offer me with a great deal, aren't you?

19
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:40,640
I wanted to help her because I think this is a chance.

20
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:43,320
For me to prove myself, to do the right thing.

21
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:45,570
Sek. You killed Bam, didn't you?

22
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:48,400
I killed Bam and I'm about to kill you.

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,840
Sek! / Sek! Drop your gun.

24
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:53,244
Watch out!

25
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:03,538
Boss?

26
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:16,443
I'm glad that we got to meet again.

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,030
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,771
About what?

29
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,360
For causing troubles.

30
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,120
And sorry for causing you to face this situation.

31
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,560
This is how my grey gangster life would be.

32
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:41,000
If anyone in my position thought that they'd end up beautifully,

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,721
then they're fools.

34
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:45,642
You know what?

35
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,840
Most women came to me and wanted something from me,

36
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:52,680
except you.

37
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:58,800
Thank you.

38
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,480
Thank you

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,680
for making me believe that this world wasn't such a cruel place when you were around.

40
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,320
You hungry? Let's eat.

41
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:26,040
Let's go. But can you dance with me first?

42
00:02:27,337 --> 00:02:28,720
Sure.

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,520
But I'm not a good dancer.

44
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,800
Not this kind of dance.

45
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,211
Come here.

46
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,244
Hey!

47
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,560
Hey! / Hey!

48
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:40,600
You heard that too right?

49
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,491
Loud and clear.

50
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,920
Who lit up firecrackers to pray?

51
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,080
I was just kidding, you don't have to look at me like that.

52
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,178
Gunshot for real. / Right.

53
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,044
Who did that?

54
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,590
Could it be them?

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,561
I don't know who did it. We need to go now.

56
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:04,880
Go where? Don't you ever think ? / About what?

57
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,840
What if it was Phee who got shot?

58
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:11,360
(Chant) / Come on

59
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,080
He's still alive. Stop chanting for his funeral already!

60
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,191
Go help him. / You're right. Let's go.

61
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,763
What the hell? They're driving back to the same spot.

62
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,200
What is wrong with them? Just follow them.

63
00:05:39,377 --> 00:05:41,930
I will put pressure on his wound to stop bleeding.

64
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,360
You need to talk to him, don't let him fall asleep.

65
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:46,600
Hey! Look at me and don't close your eyes.

66
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:49,560
Don't fall asleep. / Sure.

67
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:51,640
I really want to stay with you.

68
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,800
I just found out that it was

69
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
so painful when I got shot.

70
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,840
Hey! Hey!

71
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,840
Look at me, don't fall asleep.

72
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,077
He is starting to shock, we need a doctor now.

73
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,040
Where's the doctor? We're in the middle of nowhere.

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,700
Phee! / Hey!

75
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,880
He got shot? What happened? / Stop asking.

76
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:19,880
Monk? Can you check on him? He's starting to shock.

77
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:22,050
Everyone move. I need some space.

78
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:26,500
Where's Sek? If we can't catch him,

79
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,050
we are in big trouble. / Fine, wait here.

80
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:37,498
Hey!

81
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,400
You should follow him, we'll take it from here.

82
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:42,400
But… / It's fine. You can go.

83
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,840
You can't really help him here. You should go.

84
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,811
Take care of him.

85
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,680
Phee! / Hey!

86
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,000
Phee! / Come on, buddy.

87
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,080
Pao! / Yup, it's me.

88
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,440
A person that you were about to kill earlier. How could you?

89
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
How could you kill Boss?

90
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,320
Listen to me, you need to calm down.

91
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,640
You know that being with him won't improve our lives.

92
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:21,170
If you come with me, your future will be brighter.

93
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,160
You expected me to believe someone like you?

94
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:24,480
You can even

95
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,600
betray your Dad, you son of a bitch! / You know that he never saw me as his son.

96
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,360
And I never saw him as my father.

97
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,250
You didn't but I did!

98
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,850
Go to hell, you ungrateful asshole!

99
00:07:46,977 --> 00:07:48,650
Mr. Deputy sent me to pick you up! Come on!

100
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,560
Oh my! / What's wrong?

101
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,200
His heart stops beating. / What?

102
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,943
Why the hell did you stop?

103
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,360
You're tired? Let me take over.

104
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,800
Go on. / I don't think it's necessary.

105
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
Why's that? Phee hasn't woken up. / Yeah.

106
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,800
I don't think he would.

107
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,241
He's dead.

108
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:53,300
(Chanting)

109
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,080
Freedom is happiness.

110
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,400
What're you mumbling about?

111
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,280
I'm not. You need to get over this fact.

112
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,300
Get over my ass. Get out of the way.

113
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,600
Go away. / Ter!

114
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:07,880
What the hell are you doing?

115
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,100
Cycling? I'm bringing him back to life.

116
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,960
But he said that Phee's dead.

117
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,120
I won't let him die. He's my friend.

118
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,720
I'll do it until he's back.

119
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:23,520
Phee!

120
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,120
Come on, wake up.

121
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,100
Wake up, Phee!

122
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:35,050
I think you should stop.

123
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,960
He's gone for good. / Don't tell me what to do!

124
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:40,520
But he said…. / Well, he's not my father.

125
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,360
Shut up! You're a gambler, aren't you?

126
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,560
Why don’t you bet on your friend's life?

127
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:50,004
Phee?

128
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,320
Wake up, Phee!

129
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,560
You told me that you would prove yourself.

130
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,720
You're gonna give up this easily?

131
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:09,560
Wake up!

132
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,320
I told you to wake up!

133
00:10:15,337 --> 00:10:16,840
Phee! / He's up!

134
00:10:16,943 --> 00:10:18,960
He's coming back! / He's back!

135
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:21,040
Phee!

136
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,000
He's up! He's coming back!

137
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
I'm not a fortune sticks, stop shaking me already.

138
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:29,040
He's up! / Phee!

139
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:31,004
Phee! / Phee!

140
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:36,320
What? / Stop hitting my face.

141
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:40,120
Dung! Let's heal him now.

142
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,121
Hurry! / I forgot.

143
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:44,200
Jok, can you get my medical kit in my car?

144
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
We need to get the bullet out.

145
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,230
Damn it! He ran away.

146
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,520
I think that Mr.Deputy's guys came and saved him.

147
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,040
Wait, you know this Mr.Deputy guy?

148
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,681
He's a vile police officer.

149
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,583
Don't call him a police officer.

150
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:01,800
He's just a bad guy, wearing our uniform and making money.

151
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,761
People from the inside knows his story.

152
00:11:06,257 --> 00:11:07,600
And nobody can do anything?

153
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:11,960
You asked me like you didn't know what this country is.

154
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:18,324
All done.

155
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,440
You're lucky that the bullet didn't hit your vitals.

156
00:11:23,443 --> 00:11:24,917
Why did the heart stop beating earlier?

157
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:28,080
When our body is in extreme excitement stage,

158
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,200
it could automatically shut down.

159
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:34,080
How're you feeling?

160
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:36,818
Better.

161
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:43,421
So the three of you really came back to save me?

162
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,160
Well, we didn't come back to get you to the party?

163
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:47,640
Of course, we came back to help you.

164
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you so much my friends.

165
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:00,170
You need to stop talking.

166
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,040
Stay still or you'll hurt your wound.

167
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:03,684
Right.

168
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,800
After this, you need to go back with us.

169
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,720
Don't go anywhere else. / Fine, I know.

170
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:10,200
You're whining like a dad.

171
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,243
See? I told you so.

172
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:17,618
Where's Ping?

173
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,840
Is this a jungle or a shopping mall? Too many cars are coming.

174
00:12:29,443 --> 00:12:30,445
Who's that?

175
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:37,123
What? / Fuck!

176
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,151
What're you doing?

177
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,250
At least we have Bam's phone.

178
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,441
This could be an evidence to get us off the hook

179
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,300
and expose these horrible people.

180
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,161
I really hope so.

181
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,560
Hello, my dear brother.

182
00:12:54,283 --> 00:12:55,284
Damn it!

183
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,800
You're working with the drug dealer now?

184
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:12,480
We have a little deal.

185
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:15,680
Calm down.

186
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,470
We got Bam's killer.

187
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:21,320
And we have evidence.

188
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,840
He won't do like you wish him would.

189
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:28,400
He's no longer a police officer.

190
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,400
He's a dog, working for Mr.Charn.

191
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:35,560
Which insult should hurt me more? I'm not a police

192
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,860
or I'm a dog working for Mr.Charn?

193
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,360
You're working as a team?

194
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,680
Who are you working with? Mr.Charn?

195
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:47,320
Drug dealer? Who else?

196
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,400
Right, that damn Mr.Deputy.

197
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:51,840
I think you should drop your gun.

198
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,920
I taught you how to fight, no matter how many time you've fought me,

199
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,320
you won't win.

200
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,791
Drop it.

201
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,521
You sure about that?

202
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,840
I'll challenge you

203
00:14:17,697 --> 00:14:19,000
in a duel.

204
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,320
If I lose,

205
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,800
you can take that fuckers to hell anywhere, I don't care.

206
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,100
But if I win,

207
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,250
you'll let us go.

208
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:32,058
You dare?

209
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,520
What? They'll fight in a duel like a movie? You'd accept that?

210
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,600
Sure thing. / What?

211
00:14:58,637 --> 00:15:01,240
They're so cool, Jok.

212
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:04,440
Hey! / What the hell are you doing?

213
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,320
I saw they took off their shirt and it was so cool. I wanna do that.

214
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,680
They're not you. Put it back on, so disgusting.

215
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,100
Can't I be cool? / Hurry up, I'm hurt.

216
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,517
Before they start the fight,

217
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,640
the beard guy will shout. / Shout what?

218
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,640
SPARTAN!

219
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:29,924
Oh, come on!

220
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,598
Well, he looks like one.

221
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,460
Hooray! / Yay!

222
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,664
Damn it!

223
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,520
I don't think so.

224
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,760
You too, drop it.

225
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,800
What the hell is wrong with you?

226
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,000
You're like my older brother.

227
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,960
You were a better officer than this.

228
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,100
What the hell is wrong with you?

229
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,080
How much did they pay you?

230
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,520
You only think about money.

231
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,000
What money?

232
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,400
I didn't do it for money, but it's for my son.

233
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,051
Your son?

234
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,961
What is for your son?

235
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,880
Tell me, what is it?

236
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,640
My son is about to die, you hear me?

237
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,400
My son is dying.

238
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,240
Your son is dying?

239
00:18:03,537 --> 00:18:04,538
That's right.

240
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:06,480
You heard it right.

241
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,920
My son that you drove his mom to the delivery room.

242
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,501
He is sick and he's about to die,

243
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,000
if I don't have a million for his surgery.

244
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,600
No matter how good of a police officer you are, society doesn't care about you.

245
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:32,880
There're medical fee, doctor fee, surgery fee,

246
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,441
nobody cares about

247
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:39,440
how good of a person you are.

248
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,161
Money.

249
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,700
You need to have money.

250
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:55,840
You're such an asshole.

251
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,520
Go ahead.

252
00:19:03,437 --> 00:19:04,560
You won.

253
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,761
If I don't have money for my son, then he's going to die.

254
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,120
Go ahead, kill me.

255
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:16,640
Damn it!

256
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:19,983
Mr.Charn offered money to help your son, didn't he?

257
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,760
You think that he won't betray you?

258
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,920
After you finished your job, he's ready to bite you back.

259
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,920
If you don’t believe me, just look what he's done to me.

260
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:40,678
What she said.

261
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,031
No matter how much trust you have on Mr.Charn,

262
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,600
you can't do that.

263
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,920
You know? / Of course, I know.

264
00:19:49,937 --> 00:19:50,938
I know.

265
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,720
But I have no choice.

266
00:19:57,523 --> 00:19:59,280
That's why I have to do it for my son.

267
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:05,044
You don't get it.

268
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,720
Stop playing with lighter already.

269
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,560
I need to think and it's annoying.

270
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,251
What're you thinking?

271
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,040
To find the way out for us.

272
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm not sure who we are fighting against.

273
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:46,722
And I'm not sure if we can fight them.

274
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:51,160
Mr.Charn must have someone like Chat to help him with.

275
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,600
Even if we got evidence from Bam's phone,

276
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:56,400
I'm not sure if we can bring them down with that.

277
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:01,120
If we can't,

278
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,040
I don't know how long we have to run and hide.

279
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,841
Damn it!

280
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:09,480
Calm down.

281
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,303
Have you ever heard of this?

282
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,300
There are solutions to every problem.

283
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,520
If you can't find your way out,

284
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,750
just look at the way you get in.

285
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,120
It's not the time to be funny.

286
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:33,918
Wait.

287
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,120
You said

288
00:21:36,657 --> 00:21:39,137
to look at the way to get in?

289
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:45,158
I can think of something.

290
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,320
You're a dead man. Bang! Bang!

291
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,000
You can't kill me, I'm the Great Tiger Chat.

292
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,701
I'm not afraid of you, I'm a police.

293
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:08,120
I'll bring you down. Bang! Bang!

294
00:22:11,703 --> 00:22:12,704
Are you okay?

295
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,863
Let's just rest, my little policeman.

296
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,720
If I have a surgery, will I get better?

297
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,560
I want to get better, I want to be a good policeman like you.

298
00:22:30,577 --> 00:22:31,720
Don't be like me.

299
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,440
You have to be a better policeman than me.

300
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,131
Don't worry, son.

301
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,400
I'll do anything to get you better.

302
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,200
And we can go home.

303
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,791
Okay?

304
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,671
Okay?

305
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,160
Fist bump.

306
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:52,963
My little policeman.

307
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,463
You can think of

308
00:23:08,577 --> 00:23:09,920
how to deal with us?

309
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,681
What're you doing?

310
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,320
I have a plan but I need to ask you first.

311
00:23:29,337 --> 00:23:33,000
If this plan accomplished and you have money to heal your son,

312
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,141
then you will be a good cop and arrest them all,

313
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,721
will you do it?

314
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,041
To end all of this, I need to get caught and get back there.

315
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,361
Thank you for following our plan.

316
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,521
I can do anything for my dog.

317
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,121
What about you?

318
00:24:16,143 --> 00:24:18,240
You're gonna follow that medium's plan?

319
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,158
Yup.

320
00:24:20,897 --> 00:24:23,280
I can do anything for my son too.

321
00:24:26,963 --> 00:24:28,500
Are you sure that you'll come with me?

322
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,160
You got shot like this, I can't leave you.

323
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:34,747
Of course, I'm going with you.

324
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,320
But it won't be just me who could get shot this time.

325
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,000
Then I leave. / Hey!

326
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,401
Just kidding.

327
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,440
If we die this time,

328
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,881
we have a monk to send us off.

329
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,082
How can you be so sure?

330
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,100
Perhaps the monk could go before us.

331
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:55,680
I'll be the frontliner to shield bullets for you. What?

332
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,640
Stop saying that.

333
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,720
I don't think they would dare to mess with a someone in an orange rope.

334
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,320
But don't let them strip me off, they'll shoot me for sure.

335
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,840
I'll ask you one last time.

336
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,561
Are you all really going with me?

337
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,121
Of course, we are.

338
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,160
Bring it in, come on!

339
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:29,640
We need to fight. / Hey!

340
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:31,280
My short arm. / Come on.

341
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,840
Yes! Yes! Yes! Woo!

342
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,560
It covers you. / What's wrong with you?

343
00:25:38,657 --> 00:25:39,640
That's why it's getting dark.

344
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,250
Monday 16th at noon.

345
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,680
You said that you can think of something.

346
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,480
A plan, right? What is it?

347
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,921
The more we run away,

348
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,041
the more Mr.Charn is trying to chase us.

349
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,080
We can reverse it

350
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,960
and end all of this mess.

351
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,381
They want me back

352
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,280
because there is a big even planning ahead.

353
00:26:21,223 --> 00:26:23,524
They need me as a puppet to cover up

354
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,320
their network of big money laundering.

355
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,840
We'll use this opportunity to expose them

356
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,720
and people using their service to launder money.

357
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,760
You're good

358
00:26:43,523 --> 00:26:46,400
to get your guy out of jail this fast.

359
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,911
This is Thailand

360
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,940
and this is normal.

361
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,000
You're good too.

362
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,101
In the end,

363
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,210
you finally caught my breadwinner.

364
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,080
This is 5 million baht.

365
00:27:16,877 --> 00:27:17,878
What's with the pose?

366
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,960
How can I be so sure that this is all 5 million baht

367
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:28,680
and you're not snatching 2.5 million out of it?

368
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,920
It's 5 million baht, all of it.

369
00:27:33,561 --> 00:27:34,840
I'm the man of my word.

370
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:38,440
What about you?

371
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,800
You remember it right?

372
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,640
About our deal.

373
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,041
How could I play tricks on you

374
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,520
when you're not using any tricks on me?

375
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,061
Why don't you

376
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:55,662
let me check the money first?

377
00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:59,663
Afther the ceremony, I can guarantee you that

378
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:03,600
you will get your cut, all of it.

379
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:12,700
I have an idea

380
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:17,075
to hide a camera in money bag.

381
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,520
We can secretly film Mr.Charn and his guys

382
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,440
so that we can catch them in action.

383
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,201
You

384
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,480
caused so much troubles.

385
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,320
Where's the freedom that you're so long for?

386
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,971
Where is it?

387
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,720
I'll give it to you

388
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,520
I'll use you one last time

389
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:49,840
then I will kill you.

390
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,760
So you can be free as you wish.

391
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,040
I won't be a medium for you to fool anyone for their money any longer.

392
00:28:57,123 --> 00:29:01,160
You, the senators, officers and those disgusting elite class

393
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,280
can't use me for money laundering any longer.

394
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,200
Such a smart mouth.

395
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:10,420
Can't you see what I am capable of?

396
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:14,250
How can we trust her?

397
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,321
What if she pulls something during the ceremony

398
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,800
and bites us again? What're we gonna do?

399
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,521
I have my way to tame her.

400
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,611
Sit down!

401
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,880
Wait, I don't think you have to really punch me?

402
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:45,320
Of course, I do. To make it real.

403
00:29:48,477 --> 00:29:49,960
More bruises, I think. / Hey!

404
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,040
If we have him as a hostage,

405
00:29:56,303 --> 00:29:59,321
this bitch will agree to do anything.

406
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,291
Bravo!

407
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,360
You're so cool.

408
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:13,160
You need to clean up real good.

409
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:17,000
Get yourself clean, the ceremony will start soon.

410
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:19,560
You want me to help her shower?

411
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,440
I'll clean her real good.

412
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:27,563
If we can follow the plan discreetly,

413
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:30,640
I believe that they will fall into our trap for sure.

414
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,280
This is a significant day for Charn Perd Fah Foundation.

415
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,200
The foundation is organizing the event

416
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,240
to raise fund for earthquake victims.

417
00:30:49,363 --> 00:30:53,800
The event is filled with celebs, stars, socialites,

418
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,440
politicians and devotees.

419
00:30:57,483 --> 00:31:00,000
There is something we have been wanting to see

420
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,920
and that is the medium named Ping.

421
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,520
She was in a scandal earlier, accusing her to be a thief

422
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:11,320
and a suspect in drug and homicidal case.

423
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,960
Mr.Charn talked about this scandal

424
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,700
that it was a misunderstanding. / Monday 16th at 4:00 P.M.

425
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:19,800
I can confirm that

426
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,720
it's just a misunderstanding.

427
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,361
Ping has nothing to do with shooting in the hotel or

428
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:28,962
drug dealing case.

429
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,361
The deceased has nothing to do with her.

430
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,160
She will help me out in the event today as well.

431
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,120
She will join the ceremony and be a bridge to this great donation.

432
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,531
Amen.

433
00:31:51,003 --> 00:31:52,004
Where're you, Ter?

434
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,801
Wait a minute. What's going on?

435
00:31:56,977 --> 00:31:58,440
I'm carrying a cooking gas tank.

436
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Damn it! I shouldn't have disguised as a chef.

437
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,600
And I chose it myself, so damn heavy. / Where is Jok?

438
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,281
He's there, by the food stand.

439
00:32:15,117 --> 00:32:16,118
Can I get this one?

440
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,300
Jok!

441
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,480
What I wanted to eat or drink is none of your business.

442
00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:33,043
I'm not talking to you.

443
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,580
I'm trying to blend in as much as I can. Don't you get it?

444
00:32:38,437 --> 00:32:39,363
What about Dung?

445
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,640
He's there, he's coming.

446
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:48,600
Dung? He's blended in so well.

447
00:32:49,623 --> 00:32:51,300
How could he do that? He looks like he's a part of them.

448
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,720
When the ceremony started, see you at the meeting spot, okay?

449
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:02,640
How're you feeling wearing cuffs?

450
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,960
What do you think?

451
00:33:09,763 --> 00:33:11,600
First I thought I should feed you,

452
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,000
then I thought about it again, you'll be dead after the ceremony.

453
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,121
So I won't feed you, such a waste.

454
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,960
I like your sweet face.

455
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,700
You're all quiet, this is no fun.

456
00:33:29,817 --> 00:33:32,240
Before you die, can you be quiet like this?

457
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,750
After the medium is done with the ceremony,

458
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:51,360
I'll ask all of you to make donations.

459
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,961
So you all will be shown in news.

460
00:33:55,677 --> 00:33:58,360
After that, your money

461
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,040
will be laundering so fresh and ready to use.

462
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,360
More importantly and this is our selling point,

463
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,840
we will have the certificate of donation to everyone.

464
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,481
You can use it for tax deduction. / That's crazy.

465
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,760
We're helping the nation and we get our money back?

466
00:34:21,003 --> 00:34:23,480
Where is Mr.Deputy? Why is he late?

467
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,481
He just told me that

468
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,720
he needed to talk to his boss and he'll be here.

469
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,920
Is everything okay?

470
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,480
I want to talk to him about new lot of drugs.

471
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,360
We're about to partner in this business.

472
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:51,640
All right everyone,

473
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,050
please attend the ceremony.

474
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,231
Hello, Boss.

475
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:27,880
Hi, I'm glad you can join me

476
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,840
and work for me.

477
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,100
You don't need to be so polite, just be good at your job.

478
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,250
Grandma Kala and Grandpa Kalee are here.

479
00:35:45,037 --> 00:35:46,038
Amen.

480
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,121
Amen.

481
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,881
Amen.

482
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,241
After I start the ceremony,

483
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,720
you all need to follow the plan.

484
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:17,160
Are you okay? Actually, you don't have to come.

485
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,120
Of course, I can do it. I won't miss this chance.

486
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,360
What about you? Are you okay? / About what?

487
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,640
Why are you carrying the gas tank?

488
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,743
Be quiet. / Why did I carry it?

489
00:36:32,443 --> 00:36:34,257
Where's Jok?

490
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,500
For free? / For free.

491
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,300
Can I get one please? / Sure.

492
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:51,080
Thank you. / You're welcome.

493
00:36:53,703 --> 00:36:54,704
There!

494
00:36:59,357 --> 00:37:02,240
He's still eating?

495
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,231
Hurry up.

496
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,100
Come on, Jok.

497
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,000
Where's Dung?

498
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,840
That's right. / Where's Dung?

499
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:20,920
Are you stupid or just pretending to be?

500
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,440
He's a monk, he needs to breathe in when he takes the first step.

501
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,041
and breathe out when he takes the second step.

502
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,960
He needs to be focused of his steps. That's why he's late. / Right.

503
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:32,303
He needs to walk slowly. / I see.

504
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,680
I won't wait for him anymore. He could ruin the plan, let's go.

505
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:38,960
So mean. / Come on.

506
00:37:41,223 --> 00:37:42,760
Hurry up.

507
00:37:43,014 --> 00:37:45,600
Faster. / It hurts.

508
00:37:49,323 --> 00:37:52,320
Please help me, a ghost is possessing my daughter.

509
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,331
Who's that?

510
00:39:23,943 --> 00:39:26,960
This is not what we discussed. / I'm sorry.

511
00:39:30,023 --> 00:39:31,280
One more time, okay?

512
00:39:33,743 --> 00:39:34,760
What's wrong with you?

513
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:38,617
Are you trying to hit me? / Catch him good.

514
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,000
I caught him tight. Come on. / My hand.

515
00:39:45,643 --> 00:39:46,777
Hey! Sir?

516
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,400
I'm not sure if

517
00:39:50,737 --> 00:39:53,121
the clip is enough to catch him good.

518
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,961
If we could find their money laundering documents,

519
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,000
the evidence will be more solid.

520
00:40:28,517 --> 00:40:29,960
Who're you? Why're you so good?

521
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:31,240
I used to be a boxer.

522
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,720
Why didn't you say so? / You didn't ask.

523
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,520
I'm sorry, wrong room. / You got it right.

524
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:39,840
Dung, help me first!

525
00:40:40,923 --> 00:40:42,640
Bless you. / He will…

526
00:40:43,497 --> 00:40:44,498
fall.

527
00:40:46,323 --> 00:40:47,324
(Chanting)

528
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,400
How're you?

529
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:53,720
What took you so long? Where have you been?

530
00:40:53,837 --> 00:40:56,200
I went to have lunch. / What?

531
00:40:56,763 --> 00:40:59,360
It's not the time. / Of course it is, I can't have anything after lunch.

532
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,160
Is it wrong that I get hungry? / Let's continue.

533
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:04,570
Hurry up. / Fine.

534
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm healed, Mommy. / Thank you for curing my girl.

535
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,391
Amen.

536
00:41:16,483 --> 00:41:17,484
Amen.

537
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:19,485
Amen.

538
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,200
Why did you call me here? You're not gonna join the ceremony?

539
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,881
You know what?

540
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,960
I'm so sick of this stupid ceremony.

541
00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:36,320
I'm not the only person who got sick of it.

542
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,360
That senator and all the socialites hated it too.

543
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,760
How could they come up with that? Using a medium as a cover for money laundering.

544
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:49,320
That medium bitch ruined everything.

545
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,840
We won't tolerate this kind of ceremony anymore.

546
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:57,664
Sek.

547
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,360
You know what to do with that cripple on wheels

548
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:06,160
after the ceremony is done, don't you?

549
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,891
Got it.

550
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,250
I won't make a mistake like I did with drugs.

551
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,271
Good.

552
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,560
Next, please welcome our generous donors on stage

553
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,080
for earthquake victims' donation

554
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:27,240
and take pictures with Mr.Charn.

555
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,360
What happened? Grandma Kala and Grandpa Kalee are still there?

556
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,120
I'm not them.

557
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,121
My name is Bam.

558
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:53,880
Bam?

559
00:43:01,223 --> 00:43:04,720
I was murdered. I was tortured.

560
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,760
I need justice.

561
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,440
Look at the screen and you'll get it.

562
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,440
Turn on Bam's clip now.

563
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,331
Okay.

564
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,440
What's that? / Who's chanting?

565
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,800
It's my Guanyin prayer.

566
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,160
I saved it there. / Come on!

567
00:43:42,983 --> 00:43:44,000
When did you save it?

568
00:43:44,617 --> 00:43:47,500
When you didn't pay attention. / Start looking for the clip, hurry up.

569
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:52,480
When someone discovered this clip,

570
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,881
I would be dead already.

571
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,000
Sek killed me.

572
00:44:00,683 --> 00:44:03,760
He foreced me to betray on Ah

573
00:44:04,084 --> 00:44:07,840
so that he would be a drug dealer himself.

574
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,040
He worked with a police officer.

575
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,160
I didn't know his real name.

576
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,960
He said that he'd set me free

577
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,120
but I couldn't betray on Boss Ah.

578
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,240
And I don't believe that an asshole like Sek

579
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,520
will let me go easily.

580
00:44:37,623 --> 00:44:39,760
I will be free soon, Ping.

581
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,560
Don't you worry about me.

582
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,400
Start off you new life well

583
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,481
with great happiness.

584
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,280
I love you,

585
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,824
Ping.

586
00:45:17,523 --> 00:45:19,360
What kind of joke is that?

587
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,840
Why're you acting out of the script? / I'm not.

588
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,520
The next script is on all of you.

589
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,840
When it reaches this point, you and your team can attack to end the game.

590
00:45:47,803 --> 00:45:49,120
If this plan succeeded,

591
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,800
you can get your 2.5 million to cure your son.

592
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,600
And I promise you that I won't tell anyone about this.

593
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,920
It means that you help me doing the wrong thing.

594
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,841
Aren't you the one who taught me

595
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,920
that this world isn't so pretty and we aren't in the ideal world?

596
00:46:07,463 --> 00:46:09,480
At least we both still get to be police officers.

597
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,560
Let's bring down those fuckers.

598
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:23,360
Tell your team not to do anything until I give an order, okay?

599
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:30,283
That clip is just an appetizer.

600
00:46:30,543 --> 00:46:32,560
This one is your main dish.

601
00:46:35,783 --> 00:46:39,000
I want to talk to him about new drugs

602
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,080
that we're about to partner.

603
00:46:42,323 --> 00:46:44,324
Oops! What did I just say?

604
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:47,520
This is unlikely a well-respected senator.

605
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,800
What's going on, Mr.Charn?

606
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,520
What're you look at?

607
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,440
To check if there's any CCTV in the area.

608
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,281
Why's that?

609
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,001
What's going on?

610
00:47:08,457 --> 00:47:09,880
Please join the ceremony.

611
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:21,520
Hello, Ping.

612
00:47:30,603 --> 00:47:32,960
Is this what you want?

613
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:35,678
What?

614
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,760
You knew?

615
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,960
I thought I would handle you the easy way.

616
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,560
But you wanted to be so dramatic

617
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,877
so I played along.

618
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,800
What is it? I'm so confused.

619
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:57,024
You're confused?

620
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,400
This is to kill a big flock of stupid birds

621
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,480
with just one stone.

622
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:09,691
What the hell?

623
00:48:10,778 --> 00:48:11,779
You're in shock?

624
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,841
I just followed order of someone who's more powerful than you.

625
00:48:16,403 --> 00:48:17,404
Stupid you!

626
00:48:18,377 --> 00:48:20,720
Who is more powerful than me?

627
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,440
Do you know Chief Aod?

628
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,121
Chief Aod?

629
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:42,800
Hello, nice to see you again Mr.BL actor.

630
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,300
Can you stop messing around?

631
00:48:54,003 --> 00:48:55,080
Who are you?

632
00:49:18,643 --> 00:49:21,800
You really think that Mr.Charn would trust that snake

633
00:49:21,883 --> 00:49:22,920
to work for him again?

634
00:49:23,037 --> 00:49:25,640
Any last words before you go? / How much did he pay you?

635
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,920
I can pay you more, okay?

636
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,040
Who should I kill first?

637
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,561
You're just like that senator.

638
00:49:37,717 --> 00:49:39,210
You think you can bring me down easily?

639
00:49:39,317 --> 00:49:43,040
I'm a winner and nobody can save you now
