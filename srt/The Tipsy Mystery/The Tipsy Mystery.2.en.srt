1
00:00:06,097 --> 00:00:07,600
You're saying that your closest medium

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,720
stole 5 million baht from your safety deposit box?

3
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:10,898
Ping!

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,841
Please bring Ping and money back to me.

5
00:00:14,197 --> 00:00:14,928
Ping?

6
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:18,200
Can you guess where did she head to?

7
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:19,463
Paradise Seven.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,080
See? Believe me now?

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,640
I only invited you to the top-tier party.

10
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:25,644
I'm Bam. Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,760
You hid the drug already, right?

12
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,040
All done.

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,040
What kind of a person would carry that much money?

14
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,360
A fascinating kind.

15
00:00:35,277 --> 00:00:36,840
How long are you gonna work like  this?

16
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:37,640
Being a hostess is totally

17
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:40,360
below from being a medium, fooling people for money, isn't it?

18
00:00:40,603 --> 00:00:42,120
We're both doing shitty work.

19
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,600
After I finished Jok's liquor,

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,040
I didn't remember anything after that.

21
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,111
Me too.

22
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,561
Fuck!

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,880
Friday, 13th at 4:00 PM. / I can't take it any longer.

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,280
I don't want to do it anymore.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,480
Don't want to do what?

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,400
I don't want to fool people like this.

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,680
I don't have any magic power. I haven't even

28
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:20,800
seen a real ghost before. / What are you planning to say?

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,880
You're gonna say that you're a con artist?

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,720
That you're acting for me?

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,600
Is that what you are planning to say?

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,320
What's got into you? Yelling something nonsense like this?

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,001
I want to stop.

34
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,720
I want to live my own life.

35
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,040
You want to live your own life?

36
00:01:43,697 --> 00:01:45,000
Your life belongs to me.

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,201
Remember that!

38
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,040
I brought you here from the orphanage, I raised you.

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,600
I sent you to acting school, I created all kinds of situations

40
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,080
so that you could be famous like this. So be grateful.

41
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:04,640
You need to earn money for me.

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,600
Don't you ever think of running away from me.

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,101
Sunday, 15th at 10:50 AM.

44
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:52,250
Fuck!

45
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:00,560
Corpse!

46
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,771
Dung!

47
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,590
Bam!

48
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,360
What happened?

49
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:14,778
Bam!

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,720
What happened to you?

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,520
Tell me, who hurt you?

52
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:20,971
Bam!

53
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:32,044
Is the kid sleeping?

54
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,320
You saw a doctor yet?

55
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't forget to eat.

56
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,760
I miss both of you.

57
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:49,720
People who don't know you wouldn't have thought that

58
00:04:49,817 --> 00:04:51,818
you are a family man.

59
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:53,800
And you call your family several times a day.

60
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,080
Listen to me, bro.

61
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:58,200
I was born before you

62
00:04:58,342 --> 00:04:59,920
and I cleaned that part before you.

63
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,720
There are three rules you can't do,

64
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,440
and you will live a happy life.

65
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,731
One,

66
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,445
don't get married.

67
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,081
Two,

68
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,482
don't have kids.

69
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,050
And the last one,

70
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,600
don't be a police officer.

71
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:28,720
Wow!

72
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:32,080
I can do the last one.

73
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,721
I get what you said.

74
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,120
But the first two are arguable.

75
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,360
You didn't say this when your kid was about to born.

76
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,720
Hurry up! / Alright, I'm here.

77
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,484
Let's go.

78
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:48,280
Help! My wife's water broke!

79
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,184
Easy there.

80
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,931
Hang in there.

81
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,800
Are you Ms.Chadaphorn's husband? / That's right.

82
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,760
How are my wife and the baby?

83
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,597
We faced with a little complications.

84
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:08,360
But your son and your wife are safe now.

85
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,761
A son?

86
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,360
I have a son? Really?

87
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:13,000
That's right. / Thank you so much!

88
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:19,440
Dan! I have a son! Oh my goodness!

89
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,280
It's easier to fight the criminal than bringing your wife to the hospital.

90
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,280
So overwhelming.

91
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,960
But it turned out well, your son is safe.

92
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,551
Hey!

93
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,081
Are you okay?

94
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,121
I'm okay.

95
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,680
Let me ask you something.

96
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:49,880
Why are you becoming a police officer?

97
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,441
You really want to know?

98
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,700
Don't laugh, okay?

99
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,440
I haven't started.

100
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,843
I'm not telling you.

101
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,920
I'm kidding, okay?

102
00:07:09,657 --> 00:07:11,320
Don't pout like a girl, come on.

103
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:14,100
I'm listening.

104
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,480
When I was a kid, I was so weak.

105
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,280
I kept on running from people who bullied me.

106
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,081
I thought that when I grew up and was strong enough,

107
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,920
I'd become a police officer.

108
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,440
I'll attack them all.

109
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,800
At least, I could make this world a better place.

110
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,241
One more thing,

111
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:46,040
so that I could protect…

112
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:53,698
Protect who?

113
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,681
Hey!

114
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,921
Protect who?

115
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,320
Can you mind your own business for once?

116
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,400
What? I was asking nicely.

117
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,160
You want to make this world a better place?

118
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,000
You're so innocent and naïve.

119
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,880
You should listen to a song called Mature.

120
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,040
From who? / A band called Big Ass.

121
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,311
Right.

122
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:31,760
That uncool singer? / Well, he's cool and his name is Jeng.

123
00:08:31,957 --> 00:08:34,120
You heard of him? Jeng Big Ass?

124
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:44,278
Bam! What happened to you?

125
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,960
What happened to you?

126
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,250
What's going on? Why did she look like this?

127
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,160
How did she get into Dung's trunk? / Or

128
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,720
we were too drunk to remember

129
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,840
and we accidentally killed her?

130
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:01,010
Are you crazy? Someone like us can't kill anyone.

131
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,880
You think so? What do you call that? / I know that this is a corpse.

132
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,360
But we didn't kill her.

133
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:07,960
If we didn't, then who did?

134
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,520
How did she die?

135
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,600
I don't know. I don't remember anything either.

136
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:15,317
If anyone is to blame for her death,

137
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,681
then it's you, Jok.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,720
You gave us your fermented liquor.

139
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:27,080
That's right. It's mine.

140
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:29,720
But I need to review the product and I stopped you from drinking it.

141
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:31,800
Why did you open the bottle? / I didn't

142
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,400
Ter opened the bottle.

143
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,721
Let's drink it.

144
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:38,960
Let's try it. / I found a drink for you and I'm wrong?

145
00:09:39,023 --> 00:09:40,024
What?

146
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,601
If Dung hadn't handed me the liquor,

147
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,840
if you all hadn't finished them all, I wouldn't have had to open it.

148
00:09:48,883 --> 00:09:49,884
How could you say that?

149
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,040
If you hadn't opened it, no one would have had it.

150
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,321
You're guilty, Ter.

151
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,501
You killed Bam, didn't you? What did you feed her? / Wait.

152
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,280
Why did she look like this? Talk to me, son of a bitch!

153
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,320
Talk to me. / Calm down, please calm down.

154
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:06,738
Fuck!

155
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,491
What is it?

156
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:12,880
What's going on?

157
00:10:14,503 --> 00:10:15,504
What is this?

158
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,800
Where is he? / He's asleep up there.

159
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:28,040
You know it that when he lost at card games

160
00:10:28,343 --> 00:10:29,344
he would drink so much.

161
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,280
He would wake up when that Loanzing guy comes.

162
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:35,118
Did you see Bam?

163
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,640
I don't get it.

164
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:42,880
I know that Ah asked Bam to keep his stuff.

165
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,160
It's safer than storing his stuff by himself.

166
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,441
But look at her. She's a slut and a whore.

167
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,360
If she were my girlfriend, I'd slap the shit out of her.

168
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,600
Don't you worry about that.

169
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
You won't be able to slap her.

170
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,044
She won't agree to be your girl for sure.

171
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,760
Maybe next life.

172
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:08,800
You don't normally talk much.

173
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:11,378
But when you do, you sound very rude.

174
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,011
Why're you screaming?

175
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,520
When did my car get hit? My front grille was dented.

176
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,841
Mom will kill me for sure. / Damn it!

177
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:23,120
Stop worrying about your car and pay attention to the corpse.

178
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,520
Did you know the cause of her death?

179
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,320
I'm an OB/GYN, not a forensic pathologist.

180
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,481
From what I saw

181
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,300
I didn't see any large wound that could kill her.

182
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,730
But I still don't know why she's dead.

183
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,000
I think we should call a cop.

184
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:41,882
You can't do that.

185
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:43,497
Why can't I?

186
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:46,320
What if they came and thought that we killed her?

187
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,920
Didn't you say that

188
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,000
someone like us couldn't kill people?

189
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,161
I bet that when officers come

190
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,040
they will believe us. / What if they don't?

191
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:58,800
Then we need to persuade them to believe us. There're so many of us.

192
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,880
We need to make them believe us. Right, Ter?

193
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,120
I think so. / Think of what?

194
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,561
Like him or like me?

195
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,520
I don't want any problems, Jok. I'll go overseas soon.

196
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,800
If I eneded up in a case, my life is over.

197
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,400
But the corpse is in our trunk.

198
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,500
They will believe that we have something to do with that for sure.

199
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,240
Our words alone can't persuade them to believe that we didn't do it.

200
00:12:24,397 --> 00:12:26,300
Right. / We can't tell the police.

201
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,950
What the hell is wrong with all of you?

202
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,637
She's dead, right here.

203
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:32,720
What is your suggestion then? / I don't know.

204
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,120
But my life can't be over because of this shit.

205
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:38,010
Give me the phone. I'll call the cop. / Nope.

206
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,720
Give it to me. / I said no.

207
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:41,360
I said no fucking officers involved, damn it.

208
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:43,800
Why can't I fucking do it?

209
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,160
You raised your tone at me?

210
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,091
When you have problems, who listens to you?

211
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:50,880
Now you don't listen to me? I told you to let go of it.

212
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,440
You don't listen to me anymore?

213
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:56,124
Why's that? / Damn it!

214
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,320
Phee, I think you should walk away.

215
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:03,644
What is it?

216
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,040
So scared of everything. / Jok

217
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,241
Listen to me.

218
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:10,800
You really want to end up in jail that fast?

219
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,200
If you want to tell the cop, you need to think it through.

220
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:15,500
Think about it carefully.

221
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:18,640
We don't even remember anything.

222
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:20,520
When the officers come, let alone the officers,

223
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:22,440
anyone comes, and sees us with the corpse,

224
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,480
they will assume that we kill her.

225
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,080
What would you say to them?

226
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,161
Think about it.

227
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,641
What's wrong with your car?

228
00:13:45,543 --> 00:13:47,440
Why did he throw a durian at me?

229
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:48,960
Right in my face.

230
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:51,838
Damn it!

231
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,840
I think we need to drag it to the garage.

232
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,161
What should we do next?

233
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,600
She could escape so far by now.

234
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:05,400
Damn it! Mr.Charn calls.

235
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,240
Pick up the phone.

236
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,921
Come on.

237
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,561
Is Yong there with you? Where are the two of you at?

238
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,830
We're searching for Ping.

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,240
we still don't know where she is, sir.

240
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,080
The officers just gave me new info, she's at Prachaup.

241
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,640
Why the two of you did things that I didn't ask you to?

242
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,480
I feel bad about it.

243
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:34,120
For letting her steal your money.

244
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,960
So we want to make it up to you.

245
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,521
Fine.

246
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,840
Get to work then. Do you know where the party is?

247
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,520
At Paradise Seven hotel.

248
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:46,080
Ping is there, you need to hurry up.

249
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,411
Yes, sir.

250
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:50,400
Get the money and Pink back.

251
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,401
It's better to be there before the police.

252
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,680
You hear me. / Got it, sir.

253
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:00,680
What the fuck is this?

254
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:03,560
We just followed her out of there.

255
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,520
But the police called and told him at Ping's at the hotel.

256
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,840
Why would she go back there?

257
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,560
Wait.

258
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:35,744
Your car broke down?

259
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,281
Why're you running away?

260
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:40,360
I…I mean…

261
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:43,684
Whose car is this?

262
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,091
Come here.

263
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,520
Come here, you need to stand here.

264
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:58,840
What's wrong with your car?

265
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,521
It…it is….

266
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:04,440
It…it is….

267
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,160
Why're you talking like that? Are you stuttering?

268
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,360
I'm not but

269
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:11,920
it's just the way I talk.

270
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,080
You're sweating a lot.

271
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,200
I am….

272
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:21,480
I talk like this and I sweat a lot. / Why are you lips trembling?

273
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,721
I talk like this, I sweat a lot

274
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,600
and it's cold at the same time.

275
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:29,840
You look suspicious.

276
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,131
Hey!

277
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:36,480
Who're you? Why're you asking so many questions?

278
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:39,720
Help! / Shut up.

279
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:48,720
Let me go. / Be quiet.

280
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,360
Don't push! / You, come here.

281
00:16:56,837 --> 00:16:58,760
I shouldn't have said that. / Come here.

282
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,680
Come here, standing right here.

283
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,351
You need to go. / Me?

284
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,800
That's right. Come here.

285
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:11,680
I'm sorry for asking too many questions.

286
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:15,880
It's just that we're police officers.

287
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:23,720
Police officers. / That's right.

288
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:27,680
I… / I….

289
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,800
It's nothing.

290
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,760
We're just….

291
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,840
We just stopped here to take some photos.

292
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:37,520
For our Instagram, like glamorous lives.

293
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,920
Giving Gen Z vibe, you know?

294
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,200
Taking photos here?

295
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:43,880
It's nothing to see here.

296
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,200
That's the point.

297
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:49,463
It's simple and it's nature.

298
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,080
It's giving fascinating simplicity.

299
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:01,532
What's wrong with your trunk?

300
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:04,920
Nothing.

301
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,331
Can I see it?

302
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,660
I don't think so. I mean..

303
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:33,360
Hello? What's up?

304
00:18:42,777 --> 00:18:45,040
If you can't decide, then I'll let them know. / About what?

305
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,640
I don't want to do this. / Dung, you're a doctor.

306
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,440
You need to come up with something. / You're a doctor.

307
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:54,200
What's going on? / The local officers called

308
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:56,720
they saw that medium's bike in the hotel.

309
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,801
I see.

310
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,640
Wait.

311
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,280
Let me take a look.

312
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,531
Be my guest.

313
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:18,704
Well, it's nothing.

314
00:19:19,343 --> 00:19:20,640
I told you so. / Yup.

315
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,920
There're some wrenches if you'd like to borrow,

316
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:24,944
in case your car broke down.

317
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,440
Let's get going.

318
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:31,184
Okay.

319
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,840
Why did you act so suspicious?

320
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:38,484
Let's go.

321
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,640
Best of luch. Don't drive when you have a drink.

322
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,441
What're you talking about? / In case they forget.

323
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,120
What's in there? / Nothing.

324
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,991
About time.

325
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,151
They called?

326
00:19:57,403 --> 00:19:59,000
Hey, you two!

327
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:00,960
You need to help me here, hurry up.

328
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,571
Right.

329
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,331
Why're you smiling?

330
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,320
You look cute when you're hugging a dead body.

331
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,760
We got the right chemistry, you know?

332
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,798
Yup. / Shut up!

333
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,261
What's so funny?

334
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,760
I hid her body from the officers and you didn't even thank me.

335
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,520
Come on, I don't want to hurt her.

336
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,240
Hurry up. / You're so fast.

337
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:29,120
I couldn't believe that you're this fast.

338
00:20:34,737 --> 00:20:37,250
Why are you keep pushing me like this? / Just let me go.

339
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,240
You're dragging me out here like this, are you planning to kill me too?

340
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,880
Are you out of your mind? I just didn't want you to tell anyone about the body.

341
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,200
What about you?

342
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,240
Why were you so surprised when they said they were officers?

343
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,040
Or is it you…. / What?

344
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,720
who killed your friend? / Are you crazy?

345
00:20:54,197 --> 00:20:56,440
So crazy. What're you talking about? Me? Killing my friend?

346
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,641
That's right. I saw you two fought so hard, you even slapped her.

347
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,120
It's not a surprise to find out if you actually killed her. / No way.

348
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,200
Someone like me will not kill a friend.

349
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,600
Isn't it right, Bam? / Yup.

350
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,400
What? / Bam!

351
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,441
Did you see that?

352
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,040
Did I see what?

353
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,640
See what? I didn't see anything.

354
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:18,200
It's Bam. / Where is she?

355
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:19,840
Bam is in the trunk.

356
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,080
Where is she? See?

357
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:29,500
Where has she gone? / I'm right here.

358
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,080
What? / She's standing right here.

359
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:36,120
Don't tickle me.

360
00:21:36,223 --> 00:21:37,680
I'm ticklish. Stop tickling me.

361
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,160
What the hell?

362
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,320
What's wrong?

363
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,320
The dog peed on me.

364
00:21:57,097 --> 00:21:58,098
What's going on?

365
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,640
How could you pee on my girlfriend?

366
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,360
I could shoot you, whose dog is this?

367
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,281
He's mine.

368
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,280
I'm sorry for him.

369
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,481
Or you could blame me for being unable to teach him.

370
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:37,360
It's okay. I need to sorry for my girlfriend

371
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,080
for making your dog wanted to pee on.

372
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,600
What's wrong with the way you stood? His dog wanted to pee on you.

373
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,320
Say sorry to the dog.

374
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:48,984
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:57,184
Let's get going.

376
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,440
I don't want to hear Ah complain when we're late.

377
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,200
I really don't remember what happened last night. / Argh!

378
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:08,480
Can you keep your tongue inside?

379
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:09,920
I don't understand what you're saying.

380
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,200
I really don't remember what happened last night.

381
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:21,840
I don’t remember who killed me.

382
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,520
Next thing I know was that I was dead already.

383
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,321
You think that she really can see the ghosts.

384
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,281
I think she can.

385
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,921
Look at this.

386
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,121
The hottest medium of the era.

387
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,840
A medium?

388
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,881
I talked to her.

389
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:53,640
What did she say?

390
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,441
She said that

391
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,681
she didn't remember what happened last night.

392
00:23:57,763 --> 00:23:58,764
What?

393
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:01,400
Jok,

394
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,720
your fermented liquor is the real deal.

395
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,400
We haven't recalled anything and so has the ghost. Bravo!

396
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,800
Bam died because of your liquor? / Calm down.

397
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,761
Please calm down.

398
00:24:17,397 --> 00:24:18,840
Stop telling me to calm down.

399
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,880
You were the last persons to be with Bam.

400
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:25,280
If it wasn't the liquor owner, then it must be one of you.

401
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,320
Think, Bam. Who killed you?

402
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,840
I told you that I didn't remember.

403
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,840
How could you not remember? This is your life.

404
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:44,322
Come on! Think fast.

405
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,120
There she is, raising her voice to the ghost. / Shut up!

406
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,240
Hurry up.

407
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,520
Point to your murderer. Now!

408
00:25:07,103 --> 00:25:09,480
Is she a medium or a koala bear? She keeps on clinging to us.

409
00:25:10,303 --> 00:25:12,720
I get it why she did that, but I don't understand you.

410
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,891
Why're you hugging me?

411
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,560
The medium got scared, and you think that I wouldn't?

412
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,801
Bam's gone.

413
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:29,440
What kind of ghost is she? She keeps on disappearing.

414
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,120
So confusing. / Hey!

415
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,280
I heard it that

416
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,520
New ghosts would have low energy.

417
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,450
They can show themselves for short period of time.

418
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:42,720
If they have been dead for longer time, they'd gain more energy and stay longer.

419
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,200
I can't believe it

420
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,840
that I'd hear something like this out of an OB/GYN like you.

421
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,920
What's wrong with that? I can be a doctor and interested in ghosts at the same time.

422
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,080
You need to think of our next move.

423
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,680
I… / Stop saying to go to the police.

424
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,441
The longer we wait, the worse it could happen.

425
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,560
Your friend is dead, sure you want to call a police.

426
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,521
I…

427
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,200
Not really.

428
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,760
What the hell is wrong with all of you?

429
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,400
I really want to know.

430
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:20,320
Please, I beg you.

431
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,300
Forget about telling the police for a sec, okay?

432
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,320
What should we do next?

433
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,120
I don't know. I can't think of anything.

434
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,601
Let me think for a sec.

435
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
Don't take too long to think.

436
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,162
If you're taking too long, and I'm home late.

437
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,240
Mom will look into the camera and she'll yell at me if she doesn't see me.

438
00:26:44,743 --> 00:26:46,680
Can you please stop being scared of your Godzilla mom?

439
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,400
What did you just say? / Yelled at?

440
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,121
The other one.

441
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,681
Camera?

442
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:57,682
Camera.

443
00:26:58,123 --> 00:27:00,280
I know what we should do.

444
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,880
The medium left her bike here.

445
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,321
But there's no CCTV in the area.

446
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,250
I think we need to look at the other corners of the hotel.

447
00:27:32,803 --> 00:27:33,804
Right.

448
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,040
I need to ask the local officers to check CCTV of the roads in the area.

449
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:38,518
If you got anything,

450
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,520
please let us know.

451
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,960
We'll take care of looking around the hotel ourselves.

452
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,441
Please follow up on the CCTV outside.

453
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,320
Sure, excuse me.

454
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,511
Hey,

455
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,440
why don't you let the local officers to look around the hotel? It'd be easier.

456
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,840
It's flexible to work just the two of us.

457
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,521
I don't want her to know our moves.

458
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,881
We need to talk to the manager first.

459
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:07,664
Let's go.

460
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,140
What? What's wrong with you?

461
00:28:13,721 --> 00:28:15,400
Did you just take a hard-working pill?

462
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,360
Normally, you'd be more relaxed than this.

463
00:28:18,483 --> 00:28:21,080
Isn't it great to close the case fast?

464
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,760
Our boss will see us

465
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,841
and our shoulders

466
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,642
will be decorated with more stars.

467
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:31,843
What do you think? / I know.

468
00:28:35,243 --> 00:28:36,244
What?

469
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,440
I think you act strange lately.

470
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,361
Strange what?

471
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,840
Did you fall for her charm already?

472
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,920
You keep asking questions after questions.

473
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,960
Are you crazy? No!

474
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,920
I was just… / What?

475
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,360
I just want to close the case. / Hey!

476
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,040
I was just joking with you.

477
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,961
Let's go.

478
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,560
I think you should look over there.

479
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:10,851
Okay.

480
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,881
Hello?

481
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,200
What? How much is the surgery for the kid?

482
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,751
Why do you want to look at the CCTV's footage?

483
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,570
I… / I mean…

484
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,880
Our friend went missing last night. / Right.

485
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:45,800
I heard that before she disappeared

486
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,280
she went to this place. / Right.

487
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,520
So we'd like to have a look at the footage.

488
00:29:51,977 --> 00:29:55,240
So we can find out where she was. / Right.

489
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,000
I feel bad for you.

490
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:00,560
But I really can't let you watch it.

491
00:30:00,697 --> 00:30:01,698
What?

492
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,641
It's a hotel policy, if you wish to have a look,

493
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,181
you need to report the police first.

494
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,440
But we can't tell the police because Bam is d…

495
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,720
Ouch!

496
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,560
Why did you hit my butts? My butts are hurt.

497
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:14,758
What did you just say? D… what?

498
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:16,960
D…. / Doing her hair here.

499
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,720
She went to the hotel to do her hair and she's gone.

500
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:24,640
That's right. / My other friend went to the police already,

501
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,081
but we couldn't wait so we wanted to look around.

502
00:30:28,937 --> 00:30:31,480
Please, let us have a look.

503
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,681
You don't have to beg because I can't.

504
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,000
It's a hotel policy.

505
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,400
What about this?

506
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,421
You guys should wait for me here.

507
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,240
I need to talk to the manager alone.

508
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,761
No need to.

509
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,161
I don't want to talk to you and there's nothing to talk.

510
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,401
Please? Just one sec.

511
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,971
I don't think so.

512
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:11,561
Please? I need to talk for a sec.

513
00:31:18,237 --> 00:31:19,238
Please?

514
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,681
Please?

515
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,401
Fine, we can talk.

516
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,840
Thank you Mrs. Rattana Rakchartyingyuad, the senator,

517
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:37,200
for donating one million baht

518
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:40,132
for helping out flood victims in the south.

519
00:31:43,623 --> 00:31:44,640
Thank you so much

520
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,880
for using our service.

521
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,481
With my pleasure.

522
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,240
If this place can launder money from

523
00:31:53,337 --> 00:31:56,840
my husband's casino so clean like people said,

524
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,840
then we will meet every month.

525
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:15,704
2.5 million.

526
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,160
What are you talking about?

527
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:20,320
It's your cut,

528
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,680
if I can get money back to you.

529
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,200
Your foundation

530
00:32:25,257 --> 00:32:27,560
has earned so much money each month

531
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,121
from various sources.

532
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,720
We all know that someone like you wouldn't get your hands dirty.

533
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,400
My job is risky.

534
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,160
If I made a mistake, got caught

535
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,841
and I slipped

536
00:32:40,443 --> 00:32:43,044
about our deal.

537
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,640
What's gonna happen to your foundation?

538
00:32:45,877 --> 00:32:47,250
You will be in big trouble.

539
00:32:48,197 --> 00:32:49,198
Fine.

540
00:32:57,597 --> 00:32:59,960
What do you think she would talk to that manager?

541
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,041
Or she could rat us out?

542
00:33:04,737 --> 00:33:06,100
That we killed Bam?

543
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,161
Are you crazy? We didn't kill her.

544
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,401
Or…

545
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,281
we did it. / Come on.

546
00:33:15,623 --> 00:33:18,624
Can you just calm down? It's none of those things.

547
00:33:18,883 --> 00:33:19,884
She could just

548
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,141
beg that manager I guess.

549
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,761
Beg how?

550
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:25,520
Didn't you see his face?

551
00:33:25,617 --> 00:33:27,480
He has that cruel look, he wouldn't let us take a look.

552
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,721
Of course, I let you have a look.

553
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,080
Why're you so scared of?

554
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,680
I'll give the lady and all of you ten minutes to look.

555
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,800
You need to finish it up by then.

556
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:39,920
Why're you standing right here and blocking my way?

557
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,200
The lady?

558
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:45,000
Have a look?

559
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,201
You've done the looking I guess.

560
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,311
What did you do to the manager? Why did he let us in?

561
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,040
Stupid question.

562
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:02,450
She's a medium. Of course, she has a magic trick to persuade people.

563
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,681
She can cast her spell and he'd believe her.

564
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,361
Are you out of your mind?

565
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,600
I'm a medium, not a magician.

566
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,121
What did you do?

567
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:14,760
When we talked, I noticed that he kept looking at my boobs.

568
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,441
And?

569
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,440
I let him touch mine once. / What?

570
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:25,080
Why're you so surprised? Just touching.

571
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,360
And it's my boobs.

572
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:29,560
It's not the time to care about these things.

573
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,200
Bam's dead is more important.

574
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,401
Oh! Wow!

575
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:35,442
Genius.

576
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,440
Calm down. It's not the time. / What?

577
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,131
We need to look for Bam.

578
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,360
Here!

579
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:50,440
What did she do at the pool?

580
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,721
We had fun drinking

581
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,120
why did she show up at the pool?

582
00:34:58,543 --> 00:34:59,680
Someone followed her.

583
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:00,958
Move.

584
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:16,840
Damn it!

585
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,021
Friday, 15th at 12:35 AM.

586
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:07,080
Wow!

587
00:36:13,683 --> 00:36:15,880
I've spent so much time on this popsicle and I still feel hot.

588
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:17,884
I'll lower the temperature.

589
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,441
Hurry up.

590
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,761
To minus 17.

591
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,720
If you still feel hot,

592
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,841
you can take off your shirt.

593
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,560
That's right. I need to take it off.

594
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:45,640
I don't think so.

595
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,441
I think I need to swim.

596
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,921
Bye.

597
00:36:57,343 --> 00:36:58,344
Swim.

598
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,601
What're you waiting for?

599
00:37:01,257 --> 00:37:02,258
Wait!

600
00:37:03,243 --> 00:37:04,244
What?

601
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,441
Please let me have her. / What?

602
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,960
Why do I let you?

603
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,720
I'll fly off tomorrow and this is my send-off party.

604
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,800
So I got dibs. / Your dibs?

605
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,201
Maybe she likes me and she wants to try mine.

606
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,160
Not true. / Wait.

607
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,720
Don't forget that I'm right here. / Stop talking, you'd let me win anyway.

608
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,162
You're right.

609
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,561
But Bam

610
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,080
maybe not… / No way.

611
00:37:31,357 --> 00:37:34,400
I'll leave tomorrow. I got dibs. / She looked at me.

612
00:37:36,483 --> 00:37:37,244
Stop! / What?

613
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,081
I want my first time to happen with her. / What?

614
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,720
She's my love at first sight.

615
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,300
Please?

616
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,700
You don't say anything so it's a yes. Thank you.

617
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,991
Thank you so much.

618
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:19,760
Oh my goodness, that's close.

619
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,671
Bam?

620
00:38:32,823 --> 00:38:33,824
Bam? Baby?

621
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,480
I'm sorry.

622
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,320
I have good intention but wrong person.

623
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:42,040
I'm sorry.

624
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:20,120
Dung? What're you doing?

625
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:24,084
I feel cold.

626
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,160
I need something warm.

627
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:30,800
Well, but I'm hot. I need to swim.

628
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,631
Dung?

629
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:51,000
Are you joining me?

630
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,480
I've never wanted to swim this bad in my entire life.

631
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,480
I don't care if I'd drown or die.

632
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,800
Bam, I'm here.

633
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,280
Well done.

634
00:40:14,863 --> 00:40:17,440
Thank you. You want to see it again, I can do it.

635
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,691
It's fine.

636
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,840
Let's play game.

637
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,920
Game? What game?

638
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,760
Holding breath underwater.

639
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,920
Have you ever done it?

640
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:37,800
I have, during Loy Kratong Festival.

641
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,250
I needed to collect coin in flower bowls.

642
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,880
How long can you stay?

643
00:40:42,361 --> 00:40:44,720
I collected so much money from that.

644
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,360
I got them all.

645
00:40:47,217 --> 00:40:49,920
Good, we're gonna find out soon enough.

646
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,400
What're you doing? Bam?

647
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,960
What? What're you doing?

648
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,960
Holding breath underwater.

649
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,480
But it….

650
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:09,504
Dung!

651
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,520
If I had known that you've gone this far, I wouldn't have let you go last night.

652
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:17,120
If Dung and Bam went to the swimming pool last night,

653
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,920
how did she

654
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,800
end up in the trunk of our car?

655
00:41:33,003 --> 00:41:34,440
Bam? I'm sorry.

656
00:41:35,197 --> 00:41:36,198
I'm sorry.

657
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,800
It's okay. That's exciting.

658
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,481
But you shouldn't have done that, I could have died.

659
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,320
I thought you'd like it, I could return the favor.

660
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,720
If you don't like it then it's fine.

661
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,821
I don't want to force you.

662
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:53,240
Oh no!

663
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,121
Please force me, I'll try my best.

664
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,680
It's your turn.

665
00:42:03,683 --> 00:42:05,600
You need to push my head like this.

666
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,960
Don't let me up too fast.

667
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,920
I'll push you so hard.

668
00:42:15,057 --> 00:42:16,058
Oh! Yes!

669
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,320
Oh! Yes!

670
00:42:18,884 --> 00:42:20,640
Ouch! Bam!

671
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,360
Too much teeth! Ouch!

672
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:26,920
Don't stop, I'm not done.

673
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,440
You're mad? Why did you stop?

674
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,511
Can you please continue?

675
00:42:36,737 --> 00:42:38,137
Bam?

676
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,880
Where are you? Don't stop.

677
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,080
Bam!

678
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,960
Where are you?

679
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,161
Damn it! Bam!

680
00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:50,520
It's not funny!

681
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,960
Bam!

682
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,841
Bam!

683
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,400
Come on! Wake up!

684
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,081
Damn it!

685
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:00,951
Bam!

686
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,080
I killed Bam? / Go to hell!

687
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,600
Can we check CCTV's footage?

688
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,718
A criminal stealing money and hiding here.

689
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,400
Officers're here. / What?

690
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,240
I saw you had a fight with Bam last night. It's no surprise that you'd kill her.

691
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,760
Who did she slap? / I don't know.

692
00:43:24,003 --> 00:43:26,960
I don't want to be rotten in the car. / There're large storage coolers in hotels and liquor shops.

693
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,520
I went to the bar at the swimming pool. I think it's out of service.

694
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,320
But don't we need to pass the lobby if we want toget there?

695
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,880
Wait.
