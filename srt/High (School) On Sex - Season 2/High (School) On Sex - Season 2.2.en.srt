00:00:30,343 --> 00:00:32,208
AMBRO: Hi.

2
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,748
B.CUM: Hey. Masc4Masc

3
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:39,294
Sorry, I'm not into femmes.

4
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:43,060
AMBRO: Got a place?

5
00:00:46,718 --> 00:00:49,343
B.CUM: Nope. Do you
mind doing it in the bushes?

6
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:51,437
Joke.

7
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:53,655
Car fun?

8
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:57,421
AMBRO: G.

9
00:00:57,446 --> 00:01:02,028
Top? Bott? Versa?

10
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:07,088
B.CUM: Pure top.

11
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:13,443
AMBRO: Good. Bott here.

12
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,659
B.CUM: You rim?

13
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:20,059
AMBRO: Depends. Make me.

14
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:43,552
B.CUM: Feast your eyes on this.

15
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,130
AMBRO: Holy shit. Fuck yes.

16
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:55,052
B.CUM: Your turn.

17
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:10,055
B.CUM: Fuck, I'll hit that hard.

18
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:13,888
Let me load you up. Unli cum.

19
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,561
AMBRO: How big is it?

20
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:22,271
B.CUM: Say please and I'll show you.

21
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:02,130
AMBRO: Fuck. Cum on my face.

22
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:06,963
B.CUM: Video call before we meet?

23
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,442
How 'bout it, bro?
Can this fit in your mouth?

24
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:19,702
I'll milk you so hard. Whatever you want.

25
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:24,061
You won't be able to walk for three days.

26
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:30,146
You're a fucking barbie.

27
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:46,606
B.CUM: You fucking scammer. I don't
like femmes. You said you're masc for masc.

28
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:50,254
AMBRO: You asked. I never answered.

29
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:54,129
B.CUM: You're disgusting.

30
00:03:55,396 --> 00:04:01,062
AMBRO: No, you're disgusting.
You shame the movement.

31
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:09,338
B.CUM: Sorry, but nobody's gonna wanna
fuck you. I have a TG. Subscribe there.

32
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,004
Fantasize all you want.

33
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,685
Did you finish our math assignment?

34
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,842
Not yet, you?

35
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:32,829
- Nope.
- Why didn't you do it?

36
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,700
- I went pussy hunting.
- Yuck!

37
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,017
What's this? Hey!

38
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:43,661
Why are you--

39
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,548
Who is this person?

40
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:47,521
What are you wearing?
Why do you look like that?

41
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,437
The hell are you wearing?

42
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:52,896
Do not judge or you, too, will be judged.

43
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:55,838
Matthew 7 verse 1.

44
00:05:57,802 --> 00:05:59,593
Sister Erica?

45
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:02,406
What's it to you?

46
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:04,473
Can't I change it up?

47
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,622
Change it up?

48
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:07,204
You wanna 'change it up'?

49
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:08,646
Then shave your head!

50
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:09,724
Hey!

51
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:12,335
What's your problem?

52
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:14,729
It looks familiar.

53
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:16,513
Pretty sure I recognize this look.

54
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:17,955
Who has this vibe?

55
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,441
- Who?
- With the clip--

56
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,937
There is someone. I've seen
this look before. Lemme think.

57
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:24,287
- It looks good on me, though, right?
- I'll think about it.

58
00:06:24,312 --> 00:06:25,427
There she is.

59
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:27,787
- It's Joanna.
- Joanna, is that you?

60
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:30,062
- Oh my God! Very Joanna!
- Joanna, is that you?

61
00:06:30,062 --> 00:06:31,513
Joanna this, Joanna that.

62
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:34,330
Can't I be demure just like her?

63
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:37,317
Is it wrong to change my branding?

64
00:06:37,342 --> 00:06:40,592
You want Paco to like you, too!

65
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,247
What? No!

66
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:44,230
You know, if you really
want Paco to like you,

67
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:48,089
the goal is for him to
like you for who you are.

68
00:06:48,114 --> 00:06:50,310
Why don't you ask him straight up?

69
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:51,813
What do you mean?

70
00:06:51,838 --> 00:06:53,630
Ask him on a date!

71
00:06:53,662 --> 00:06:56,921
- Much better.
- I could. But it depends.

72
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:58,828
You're driving me crazy.

73
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:01,145
I like the way you walked, how is it?

74
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,836
Let's go.

75
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:03,911
Pose.

76
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,041
Principal Corny!

77
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:07,629
Good morning!

78
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:09,254
Mrs. Ricafort!

79
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,946
Good morning. Have a seat!

80
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:15,082
You look good!

81
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,075
So do you! You're very handsome today!

82
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,434
Now, Mrs. Holly.
Please do not objectify me.

83
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:26,834
I'm not a piece of meat,
a hotdog on a stick!

84
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:30,421
I, too, have a heart that breaks.

85
00:07:31,724 --> 00:07:32,771
Huh?

86
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:38,880
Ah, I just forgot. I was in a hurry.

87
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:41,879
What's the objective of this meeting?

88
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:45,070
Nothing in particular, just… checking in?

89
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:48,938
I just want to know how the
students of Vanguard High

90
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:51,491
are responding to our new counselor.

91
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:55,189
Ah, yes.

92
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,577
Who's a good boy?

93
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:03,058
Me, Mrs. Holly.

94
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:19,001
What I'm interested in is…

95
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:23,849
Are the students opening up to you?

96
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,169
Oh, yes!

97
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:28,569
They are very open.

98
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:29,864
Really?

99
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:36,317
Yes! In fact, the great thing is I'm
building a connection with them, too.

100
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:41,046
And as it happens,
I'm opening up to them as well.

101
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:46,088
I don't get it

102
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:55,379
I'm going in, Mrs. Holly. Are you ready?

103
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,446
Say please.

104
00:08:57,782 --> 00:08:59,116
Please.

105
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,646
How is our Vanguard High TikTak king,

106
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:22,294
Mr. Paco Barrera?

107
00:09:22,702 --> 00:09:26,243
I know he has plenty of followers. He's
famous on social media, but get what I mean?

108
00:09:26,268 --> 00:09:30,852
In our school, we are promoting equality.

109
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:33,752
Doesn't matter if you're a celebrity
or the child of a celebrity,

110
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:36,754
we set those things aside.

111
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:41,004
Yes! He is very cooperative.

112
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,254
Ah! That's good, but I want to know is…

113
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:52,911
can he control his sexual urges now?

114
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:55,046
Ah!

115
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:57,713
We are working on it.

116
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:00,754
That's a relief.

117
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,165
What's up with you?

118
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:11,258
I’m almost there, Mrs. Holly.

119
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:13,638
Not so fast, I'm not even close.

120
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,128
I don't think I can
keep it in much longer.

121
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:18,622
You need to consider your partner.

122
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:23,638
You should always try
that both of you climax.

123
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,343
Barely a drop.

124
00:10:39,398 --> 00:10:41,148
I think you've pumped me dry, Mrs. Holly.

125
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:43,114
Don't overuse it.

126
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:45,374
Okay, let me finish.

127
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,312
Yes, mister.

128
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:30,988
I understand.

129
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:34,169
But can you delay the delivery?

130
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:37,325
Get your list done and
come around back for me.

131
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,856
I still have delivery.
I'll just leave it at the gate.

132
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:46,067
- Oh, no! Don't leave it at the gate! I'm dead!
- Im sorry ma'am. I need to go. Thank you.

133
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:48,088
Hello? Hello!

134
00:11:48,962 --> 00:11:50,712
OMG.

135
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:53,046
Mama might see it.

136
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:55,605
What's the matter?

137
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:59,089
Sorry, Paco! I need to
get home this instant!

138
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:01,756
Right now? Classes aren't even over.

139
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:04,513
I'm gonna go get a
pass from the principal.

140
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,195
Sorry! Later!

141
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:16,452
MRS. HOLLY: Are you coming
for counseling after class, Paco?

142
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:20,288
Sorry. See you tomorrow.

143
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:25,933
PACO: Sorry, Mrs. Holly. I'm trying to ask
Joanna out on a date.

144
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:30,136
MRS. HOLLY: Oh, don't forget what
I said, okay. Make sure she finishes.

145
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:54,349
Sweetie. Sorry, did you wait long?

146
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,682
I was finishing something.

147
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,014
What's this?

148
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,581
It's nothing. Something's
wrong with the photocopier.

149
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,326
Just throw it in the trash.

150
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:16,057
Ma! Why do you have a
used condom in the bin?

151
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:24,386
Brian, you know I'm
teaching sex education, right?

152
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:30,050
Especially to first timers with anxiety.

153
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,886
And sex is fun, isn't it?
I wanna show them that.

154
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:37,004
You talking about Paco?

155
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:40,192
Brian.

156
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:46,254
I just noticed my friend's
been coming in here more often.

157
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:51,597
You're my son, okay?

158
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:58,921
But you know all conversations
in this clinic are confidential.

159
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:02,754
Okay, but I’m sure it's Paco.

160
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,754
Poor boy knows nothing about sex.

161
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:15,409
MRS. HOLLY: Be discreet.
Brian's suspecting.

162
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:18,171
Who's that? New girl?

163
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:20,534
You giving up on Joanna?

164
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:23,004
No way. My heart belongs to Joanna.

165
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:31,379
Who's gonna benefit from everything
my mom's teaching you, then?

166
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:32,876
What?

167
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:34,713
Didn't she teach you how to use a condom?

168
00:14:35,946 --> 00:14:36,946
Me?

169
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:38,137
That wasn't me, bro!

170
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:39,954
You don't have to cover up for each other.

171
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,046
Okay, fine, dude. If you say so.

172
00:14:44,243 --> 00:14:47,243
I love you, Paco!

173
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,110
I can use this to throw Brian off,
if I go on a date with Erica--

174
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,115
There's your guinea
pig for Mama's lessons.

175
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,290
All right, Imma bounce, man.

176
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:19,675
Paco, I know you're the one and only
TikTak prince and I'm just a fan, but…

177
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:26,319
I know that I'd rather you
hear me out and be rejected.

178
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,972
I gotta try!

179
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:31,636
I gotta try.

180
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:33,954
What's the next line?

181
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:36,588
Paco, will you go on a date with me?

182
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:40,548
Yes.

183
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,118
Oh my god!

184
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:51,618
Congratulations! You won!
You're the winner!

185
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,167
Bullet.

186
00:15:58,397 --> 00:16:00,064
What did you have for breakfast?

187
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:03,651
Why do you ask, sir?
Are you gonna treat me?

188
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:05,426
Yeah, sure.

189
00:16:05,907 --> 00:16:08,782
I bet it's eggs. Same as your grade.

190
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:11,807
You failed the test. Jeez.

191
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:20,296
If you fail one more exam,
I'll have to call your parents.

192
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:23,004
So they know what their son is up to.

193
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:29,546
Not even one point.
That's called a hotdog.

194
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:32,504
You're so smug, sir.

195
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,213
You thirsting for a hotdog, is that it?

196
00:16:37,854 --> 00:16:39,521
I know I am.

197
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:41,344
What was that, Gee?

198
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:43,427
Nothing, sir!

199
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:45,572
Sorry, sir.

200
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,048
That's okay.

201
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:51,862
Because you're the highest. You deserve it!

202
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:54,409
Thanks.

203
00:16:54,434 --> 00:16:55,754
Thank you, sir.

204
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,713
Very good.

205
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:11,113
ALLAINE: Erica? I thought
he said 'Joanna forever'?

206
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:13,055
ALLAINE: Since when?

207
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:17,404
GEE: I don't give a shit.

208
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:34,214
Gee! Hey, Gee!

209
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,604
Did I do something wrong?

210
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,175
You know what, you're so unfair.

211
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,201
Huh?

212
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,526
What did I do now?

213
00:17:41,313 --> 00:17:43,521
The reason why I let you go--

214
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:44,838
Wow, big word.

215
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,338
Can you just listen?

216
00:17:48,006 --> 00:17:49,796
I thought you wanted Joanna.

217
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,254
That you love her.

218
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:52,704
I do.

219
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:56,638
Then why'd you say yes to Erica?
It hasn't even been a week.

220
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:04,182
Maybe you think I'm ugly
that's why I have no chance?

221
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,659
Hey, don't say that.

222
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:08,154
It's hard to explain, Gee.

223
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,506
Hey, Gee.

224
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,426
What're you doing here? Do you have a cock?

225
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:35,378
You do. And I want it.

226
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,432
For real, what d'ya need from me?

227
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:41,088
You know what I need.

228
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:44,133
Do you know what you need?

229
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:46,096
What?

230
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:47,808
You need me.

231
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:53,042
Need you? I don't even
need my mom and dad.

232
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:54,192
What do I need you for?

233
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:57,509
You'll need your parents if
you don't pass your next exam.

234
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,463
Hold on, you're making me dizzy.

235
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:01,379
Need this, need that.

236
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:03,161
What do you want?

237
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:06,629
I'll help you with every
subject you're failing.

238
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:12,300
Which is all of them. Tutorial.

239
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:13,854
In exchange for what?

240
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:14,879
You know.

241
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:22,862
If you think you can win me over
with tutorial lessons, you're dead wrong.

242
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,243
I'm not a prostitute.

243
00:19:24,386 --> 00:19:27,243
"Sex worker" is the
politically correct term.

244
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:29,213
Whatever it's called,

245
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:32,326
I. Don't. Want. To.

246
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:35,046
Okay, fine. You don't have to do anything.

247
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:39,171
I'm numb, anyway.
I'll help you. Let's be friends.

248
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:42,713
Deal?

249
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,546
Did you wash your hands?

250
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:47,213
No.

251
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:48,546
Good.

252
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:57,992
Milk tea.

253
00:19:59,503 --> 00:20:00,576
Happiness?

254
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:03,909
I love everything with tea.

255
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:10,253
There's Brian.

256
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:15,245
You got a problem? What are you looking at?
Like what you see, huh?

257
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,368
- What the fuck?
- COMMENTS: Hater!

258
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:25,926
- He's gay but he's homophobic? Make it make sense.
- Keep shaming on your sisters!

259
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:28,076
Fuck you, Ambro, whoever you are.

260
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:34,612
The fuck is wrong with you?

261
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:40,409
You're so disappointing.
I can't believe I lusted over you.

262
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:42,743
You're just a hater!

263
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:45,378
The fuck did you say? Huh?

264
00:20:53,103 --> 00:20:54,394
Ms. Mallari.

265
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,587
Convince me why I
should allow you to go home

266
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:00,671
in the middle of the day.

267
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:04,464
Sir, today they're delivering their baby--

268
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:05,542
Who?

269
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:07,451
My dog.

270
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:10,225
It's just your dog.

271
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:12,334
- "Just"?
- Mm.

272
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:15,025
Spiky's not just a dog!

273
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,713
She's been our pet for 20 years.

274
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:24,226
Brownie's practically family to us.

275
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:27,182
Spiky? Brownie?

276
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:30,532
What's its real name?

277
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:34,909
Besides, 1 dog year is
equivalent to 15 human years.

278
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:38,284
That dog shouldn't be alive anymore!

279
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:46,782
You just don't understand.

280
00:21:48,618 --> 00:21:52,925
You haven't felt what
it's like to be alone!

281
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:55,542
In this world!

282
00:21:55,567 --> 00:22:01,042
I can't imagine Poochie
suffering on her own.

283
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:06,290
Here.

284
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,909
Go be with your dog Whitey.

285
00:22:12,003 --> 00:22:13,795
It's Spiky, sir.

286
00:22:14,307 --> 00:22:16,474
Whatever!

287
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:17,582
Thank you, sir.

288
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:24,979
These students!

289
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,267
Sup, bro?

290
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:36,565
You don't look too happy.

291
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:39,420
Can't choose between your hookups?

292
00:22:40,257 --> 00:22:42,018
Have you seen my followers, man?

293
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:44,284
I lost almost a quarter.

294
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:46,671
Why are you angry with them anyway?

295
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:51,823
I'm not angry at femmes. He scammed me.

296
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:55,765
He said he's masc for masc
but he's softer than jelly.

297
00:22:56,253 --> 00:22:57,588
Don't you like jelly?

298
00:22:57,912 --> 00:22:59,338
It's a matter of preference.

299
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,424
Gotcha, man.

300
00:23:02,103 --> 00:23:04,144
You can tell your followers,

301
00:23:04,314 --> 00:23:07,105
that if they really love you,

302
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,880
they should respect your preferences.

303
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:11,546
I don't know, man.

304
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:16,688
If it was you, what would
you do in this situation?

305
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:18,201
Me?

306
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:22,613
I'll join the pride club in school

307
00:23:22,638 --> 00:23:26,472
then let my followers know that
I'm not a hater. Something like that.

308
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:42,439
Paco.

309
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:43,456
Yes?

310
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:46,341
Thank you for helping Brian out.

311
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:48,487
Brian's my friend.

312
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:51,429
And it'll distract him from us.

313
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:58,099
I just wanna say thank you.

314
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:04,470
Thank you for keeping this a secret.

315
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,429
- Oh! What was that?
- ERICA: See you later.

316
00:25:17,454 --> 00:25:19,284
- PACO: See you.
- Sorry! Sorry!

317
00:25:19,743 --> 00:25:21,368
I forgot I need to do something!

318
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:23,409
- What?
- Let's just reschedule.

319
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:25,424
Reschedule?

320
00:25:25,854 --> 00:25:28,379
You think my flower's a dental appointment?

321
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:30,057
Sorry.

322
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:36,227
Is this really more important than me?

323
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:40,396
I promised Erica, I'll take her out.

324
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:43,579
I thought maybe it'll help
make Brian less suspicious.

325
00:25:44,755 --> 00:25:48,547
Is that why? Okay,
let's just do this next time.

326
00:25:48,572 --> 00:25:49,613
Next time.

327
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:54,879
I gotta go.

328
00:25:57,409 --> 00:25:58,409
Bye.

329
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,076
Good afternoon, bros.

330
00:26:05,076 --> 00:26:08,432
Today, we're dropping by
Vanguard's pride organization.

331
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:09,999
To see what they're up to.

332
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:15,342
We might learn something new, right?

333
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:22,279
Okay, bros. See you later.

334
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:24,323
Are you lost?

335
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:26,723
No, I want to learn from you guys.

336
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:28,560
Right, Amber?

337
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:31,596
Ah! He said Amber.

338
00:26:32,475 --> 00:26:34,392
Empress Amber.

339
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:38,950
And I am Empress
Dowager of this pride org.

340
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:40,392
What does that mean?

341
00:26:41,071 --> 00:26:43,338
Means I'm president, but fancier.

342
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:47,834
You're the one who came
knocking so don't complain.

343
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:49,368
- Am I right?
- Correct.

344
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:51,760
Okay, Empress Dowager.

345
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:53,619
"Dowager", he says.

346
00:26:53,784 --> 00:26:55,784
It's Dowager!

347
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:58,451
Empress Dowager!

348
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,088
Sorry, I knew that.

349
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:05,884
I swear to God, Empress. You'd
better not accept him. He's a hater.

350
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:07,284
Correct.

351
00:27:07,284 --> 00:27:08,838
He'll just use us for clout.

352
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:13,571
No! I genuinely want
to learn from your org.

353
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:16,254
Can you please give me a chance?

354
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:20,876
Fine!

355
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,588
Attend our event tonight.

356
00:27:24,524 --> 00:27:26,649
What's this? Basketball?

357
00:27:26,674 --> 00:27:27,987
Yes!

358
00:27:28,012 --> 00:27:30,679
Basketball!

359
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,956
You're teammates with Chariz and Aiza.

360
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:34,565
I'm game! Count me in!

361
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,254
Let's do this. Game!

362
00:27:36,814 --> 00:27:38,379
Be there at 7.

363
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:49,409
Oh, shit, mommy's home.

364
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,057
It's closed.

365
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:20,772
Why didn't you tell
me you were unlocked!

366
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:32,732
Samuel, chapter 6.

367
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:37,004
Wrap me in the miracle of your love.

368
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:43,354
Let me bask in your ephemeral light.

369
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:47,626
Thank you, Lord. You are so good to me.

370
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:48,901
I owe you big time.

371
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:51,051
Do you understand
what the scripture says?

372
00:28:52,618 --> 00:28:54,659
Do not be selfish.

373
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:56,990
Be generous.

374
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:01,713
Accept his grace with an open heart.

375
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:04,290
Keep Him in your heart.

376
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:10,378
Wrap me in the miracle of your love.

377
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,774
How good is the Lord.

378
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:17,326
Amen?

379
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:18,511
Amen!

380
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,821
Hang on. Your hair's in my fucking mouth.

381
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:38,721
- Tie it up!
- Sorry.

382
00:29:38,746 --> 00:29:41,003
How 'bout me? Am I doing a good job?

383
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,948
Acceptable. Continue.

384
00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:56,354
You're taking my spot.

385
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:58,745
Take turns. We can share each other.

386
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,745
Isn't that what a community is all about?

387
00:30:18,245 --> 00:30:19,714
Do you have room for one more?

388
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:20,759
No.

389
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:22,096
Then get out of there.

390
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:23,823
Allaine!

391
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:46,401
Wait, this is my house.

392
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:51,003
Hey! Let me in! Open the door.

393
00:30:51,028 --> 00:30:52,611
I wanna join!

394
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:54,037
Did you miss me?

395
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:55,145
A little.

396
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:57,243
Good. Don't get attached, okay?

397
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:58,409
Like Buddha says,

398
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:00,096
attachment is the root of all suffering.

399
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,618
I didn't know Buddha spoke.

400
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:05,284
Language is just a key to --

401
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:44,798
Greetings of peace, frenny.

402
00:31:44,915 --> 00:31:46,165
Where you at?

403
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,022
Can you come to the library?

404
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,943
I'm tutoring Bullet today.

405
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:52,893
What am I supposed to do there?

406
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:55,918
If Bullet stabs me with an ice pick,
you'll lose your bestfriend.

407
00:31:56,068 --> 00:31:57,276
You know what,

408
00:31:57,571 --> 00:32:00,029
just from the vibes
I'm getting off of Bullet,

409
00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:03,720
I think he agreed to be
tutored because he likes you.

410
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,287
You think so?

411
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:07,542
Sure!

412
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,555
You're just pulling my leg.

413
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,004
I'm not. You know me,
I only value truth and good vibes.

414
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:21,024
Ouch, don't bite my clits!

415
00:32:21,323 --> 00:32:22,490
Who was that?

416
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:25,401
And did you say don't bite
your clits? Where are you?

417
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:26,868
In Nirvana.

418
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,826
Well, good luck with that.

419
00:32:29,204 --> 00:32:30,954
I'm doing my best.

420
00:32:31,058 --> 00:32:32,979
Yeah, you're the best.

421
00:32:33,221 --> 00:32:34,323
All right, bye.

422
00:32:35,326 --> 00:32:36,909
Bye. Weirdo.

423
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:42,729
Who's a weirdo?

424
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:44,618
No one.

425
00:32:45,216 --> 00:32:47,424
Come on, let's start.

426
00:32:54,131 --> 00:32:55,173
Hey.

427
00:32:57,487 --> 00:32:58,587
Let's continue.

428
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:04,706
It's easy, isn't it.

429
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:36,609
Hello, bros.

430
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:40,385
We're on our way to the basketball game
organized by the pride club.

431
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,503
I didn't know they played basketball.

432
00:34:42,528 --> 00:34:44,159
Actually, my sport is volleyball.

433
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,065
But I don't wanna miss out on
this opportunity with my community.

434
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,214
So don't forget to follow my page.

435

Hit that follow button, guys.

436
00:34:57,451 --> 00:34:58,576
COMMENTS: I think those are the wrong balls, idol.
- You're dealing with a different kind of ball, my man.

437
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:01,118
- Yas queen! Purr!
- It does look like I'm in the wrong court.

438
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:02,975
Hey! Where are you going?

439
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:04,870

00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,026

Just flex your muscles!

Flex them! Let's see you!

458
00:37:13,903 --> 00:37:16,444
Is that it? It's kinda lame.

459
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,914
Who you calling lame?

460
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:24,588
Holy shit!

461
00:37:28,596 --> 00:37:30,122
Who you calling lame?

462
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,354
Let's go!

463
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:40,368
This is my show!

464
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:49,251
And the winner is…

465
00:37:49,276 --> 00:37:52,360
Mr. Brian Ricafort!

00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,701
Welcome to the org!

468
00:38:11,909 --> 00:38:13,214
Thank you!

469
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:39,589
Finally! I've been waiting for you!

470
00:39:12,493 --> 00:39:13,698
Sister!

471
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:30,633
Allaine?

472
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:43,870
Gee?

473
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:57,709
Erica?

474
00:40:17,204 --> 00:40:18,284
Kate?
