1
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,974
Seriously? You're really
fucking like dogs on the stairs?

2
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:16,974
Believe me, principal.

3
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:20,766
I am all for sex positivity!

4
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:24,641
but of course, as president of PTA,

5
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:28,057
videos like this worry me deeply.

6
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,578
Look, they're still in their uniforms.

7
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:33,373
- Actually,
- My god!

8
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:36,513
if you zoom in, it's not that obvious.

9
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:42,866
My point is, is this what we
want Vanguard to be known for?

10
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:44,182
Of course not.

11
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:45,973
Exactly.

12
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:47,845
So I think,

13
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:51,057
I think we need to guide our students.

14
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:55,966
That it's okay to have sex. And it's fun!

15
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:59,841
But it should be safe, and
done in the right time and place.

16
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:04,408
Believe me, we are on the
same page, Mrs. Ricafort.

17
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:07,682
Mrs. Holly.

18
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:12,002
Okay, Mrs. Holly. Wait a second.

19
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,682
Aren't you a registered counselor?

20
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:17,989
Ah, yeah, yeah.

21
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:25,474
What do you think about sharing your
expertise to the students of Vanguard High?

22
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:30,872
Good idea. Actually,
I can conduct a seminar!

23
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:33,307
No, I'm not looking at just a seminar.

24
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:36,307
I'm looking at something
a little bit more long term.

25
00:01:36,703 --> 00:01:40,536
Why don't you join us
as part-time counselor?

26
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,805
Ah.

27
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:53,919
Wah, so cute!

28
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:56,078
But no.

29
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:02,319
Shit! I can't believe you!

30
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,766
He's really slurping it up!

31
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,557
Shit! Paco, my love!

32
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,599
Paco, shit!

33
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,721
Fuck, you're so hot!

34
00:03:20,057 --> 00:03:23,766
Oh my god. Shit, Paco.

35
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:27,016
My love! My everything!

36
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:35,307
Paco? What are you doing here?

37
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:36,773
You called for me, right?

38
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:37,974
You wanna fuck?

39
00:03:37,974 --> 00:03:39,211
Yes, idol!

40
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,318
Girl, are you okay?

41
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:23,849
I'm okay.

42
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:26,779
- Where is it?
- Hey!

43
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:30,724
Our sources were right, besties!

44
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:32,807
Where were you?
Why didn't you say anything?

45
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:35,016
You drive me crazy. And why are soaked?

46
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:37,557
Did you come from the feast of St. John?

47
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:40,802
- It's none of your business, you two.
- Somebody hosed her down.

48
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:41,857
Oh!

49
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:45,856
Hi, sir!

50
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:47,088
Why are you wet?

51
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:50,266
It's the bidet. It's broken.

52
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:52,235
Ahh…

53
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:59,075
Ah, no, sir. It's okay. It's fine.

54
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:02,766
I have a scarf.

55
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,354
- Thank you sir.
- Ah… Okay.

56
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:08,855
Just report the broken
bidet to student affairs, okay?

57
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,932
Okay.

58
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:13,177
Wait. That means me.

59
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:16,254
I'll take care of it.

60
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:19,057
Bye, sir!

61
00:05:19,082 --> 00:05:20,115
Bye.

62
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:21,349
Oh my god!

63
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:23,182
- What?
- Is sir into you?

64
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:25,349
Come on, he's our teacher!

65
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:26,766
I was just asking!

66
00:05:27,224 --> 00:05:29,224
Shh! Be quiet!

67
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:31,682
Focus on our TikTak prince!

68
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:35,841
We should the most organized
chapter here at Vanguard.

69
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:39,166
We should welcome him with grace.

70
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:40,891
- Are you ready?
- I'm into that!

71
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:42,904
I love when you said grace.

72
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:44,862
That’s my kind of grace.

73
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:46,141
Hi, Paco!

74
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:47,896
Hey! Hello!

75
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:50,580
- What's up?
- Hi, Paco! We're good.

76
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:51,935
Mmm… smells so good!

77
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,766
Oh, uh, we're your
Coinies here at Vanguard.

78
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:56,841
Oh, wow!

79
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:58,599
Yes! We're your number one fans on campus.

80
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:00,099
- Nice.
- And this is our president.

81
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:01,849
- Yes.
- Ah, Hello.

82
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:04,991
- How's it going?
- Hey! President!

83
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:06,099
Hi, Paco!

84
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,049
Damn, step on me!

85
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:09,574
Step on you?

86
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,091
Why? I don't wanna hurt you.

87
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,658
You can totally ride me.

88
00:06:12,683 --> 00:06:15,432
He said "hurt you", not "ride you."

89
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:17,224
I meant ride as in--

90
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:20,682
Get on board our antics as
your number 1 fans, Paco.

91
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:25,707
And we know the line's long,
but we really want to date you!

92
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:28,224
Sorry, but this is taken.

93
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:29,404
Oh!

94
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:32,616
Aw, that makes me sad.

95
00:06:35,864 --> 00:06:37,114
Joanna, wait.

96
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:46,932
Sorry I didn't notice you there, Paco.

97
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:48,457
- Is that her?
- Is that her?

98
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:51,366
Are Paco's dances dedicated to her?

99
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,141
Possibly!

100
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:55,807
She must be the girl he's gyrating for.

101
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:58,474
You think they've done it?

102
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,099
Let me see.

103
00:07:00,557 --> 00:07:02,057
Well, from what I see…

104
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:04,294
I think they're just friends.

105
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,266
I mean, just look at them.

106
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:10,016
If it's not IJ official, it's not legal.

107
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,082
- Fierce!
- Right?

108
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,516
Based on my research,
she and Paco are childhood friends.

109
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:17,057
She's the pastor's daughter.

110
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:20,435
They say she's memorized the bible from...

111
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,583
- cover to cover.
- She's been doing that for hours now, pastor.

112
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,400
- Really?
- Yes, ma'am.

113
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:25,932
What's happening to my daughter?

114
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:27,099
Really now?

115
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:28,849
Sweetie.

116
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,432
She just looks like she's twerking, Ma.

117
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:32,849
Twerk? What's that?

118
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:33,766
It's a dance, Ma.

119
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:35,516
Joanna's the quiet type,

120
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:37,782
- but she has lots of secrets.
- It's not dancing.

121
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:40,307
It looks more like a call of the flesh.

122
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:42,349
Something carnal! Something
wants to come out of her!

123
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:44,781
She's clearly possessed.

124
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:45,919
Pastor.

125
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:47,427
Pastor.

126
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:53,766
Begone, wicked spirit! Leave
this young woman's body!

127
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,099
It's not working. Hand me that.

128
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,997
Sweetie, what's happening to you?

129
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,852
Spank me, mommy!

130
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:10,674
Spank me, mommy!

131
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,117
Begone, demon!

132
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:16,433
Demon begone!

133
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:45,117
She's like a virgin.
Like a secret you want to keep.

134
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:47,820
No wonder Paco's losing his mind.

135
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:51,148
Hey!

136
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,500
Hey!

137
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,181
Come back here, darling.

138
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,328
Sweetie! Stop it! What's happening to you?

139
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,432
She won't stop.

140
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:05,766
Let's pray. Let's hold hands.

141
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,320
Lord!

142
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,537
Repeat after me.

143
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:12,349
- Lord!
- Lord!

144
00:09:12,349 --> 00:09:15,016
Joanna, can we hang out after class?

145
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:18,932
While we don't have assignments yet.

146
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:20,349
Mm…

147
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,099
Or I could walk you home.

148
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:25,724
I'm going house to house with mommy.

149
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:26,849
Prayer meeting.

150
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:28,016
Ahh… I see.

151
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:30,555
Lunch break or recess?

152
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:34,141
Bathroom break or water break?

153
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:36,072
Don't say sembreak?

154
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,806
Classes just started.

155
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:40,474
Fine. Water break.

156
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:44,599
Perfect. I'm getting so thirsty

157
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,099
just talking here with you.

158
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:51,849
I can't wait to be with you.
Just us, where it's quiet.

159
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:54,599
Just the right atmosphere, you know?

160
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,224
Paco!

161
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,307
Hi, Gee!

162
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:03,562
Hi. Small world, huh?

163
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:06,040
Out of all the schools in this city,

164
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:08,023
we had to go to the same one.

165
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:11,682
Isn't that good? At least
we have friends here now.

166
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,736
Who?

167
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:17,059
Did you mean us?

168
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,747
You and your jokes.

169
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:23,078
Bitch, I'll choke you.

170
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,041
Pacs, can we talk?

171
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:31,185
Just us, one on one.

172
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,907
Sure.
Just stop calling me 'Pacs'.

173
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,266
It sounds weird.

174
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:36,891
So, see you later?

175
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:39,682
I gotta talk to her.
She's so needy sometimes.

176
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:40,732
Okay!

177
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:42,216
- Later
- Bye, Gee!

178
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:47,224
Okay, game.

179
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,057
I'll get to the point, okay?

180
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:52,474
Wow, serious?

181
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:53,599
Stop playing, dickhead.

182
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,099
Listen up.

183
00:10:56,807 --> 00:11:00,099
Because it's the first day today,
I want to start with a clean slate.

184
00:11:00,099 --> 00:11:03,099
Since you chose to break my heart,

185
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:09,057
I'm returning all these to you.

186
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:13,182
Return of the things if you
don't return my feelings.

187
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:16,932
What's wrong with you?
We've known each other since nursery.

188
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:18,516
You're really cutting me off?

189
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:20,849
Here's the thing.

190
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:24,557
You may not be my girl,
but you will always be my…

191
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:25,891
Friend?

192
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:28,307
I know. That's all I'll ever be.

193
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:32,266
I know nerds like me aren't your type.

194
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:35,724
Sorry, Paco, but I have to do this.

195
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:43,099
Paco, maybe someday, I'll accept
that we can never be more than friends.

196
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:56,641
I know that whimper! It went viral.

197
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:58,224
Hi, guys!

198
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:02,141
I just enrolled in my new school.

199
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,474
But why am I crying?

200
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:09,724
I just remembered

201
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:14,141
when I told him, "I love you…"

202
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:18,516
all he said was, "Thank you."

203
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:25,682
After all the sacrifices.

204
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:28,641
I made all his homework for him.

205
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:31,682
I cooked all his lunch.

206
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:33,849
I even played all his phone games.

207
00:12:35,182 --> 00:12:37,724
I'm exhausted, you guys!

208
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,833
b- NOKENDO: He lapped her up!
- I know right. He took everything for me.

209
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:45,099
MISTEKTAGALOG: She's going on top of him.

210
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:46,453
On top?

211
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:50,682
Yeah, things are really piling up.

212
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:53,849
You think maybe I shouldn't have confessed?

213
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:56,849
BARDAMORT: You're brave, girl!

214
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:58,891
I know, right?

215
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,182
I'm a strong and independent woman.

216
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:05,849
But I need some love,
guys. Show me some love.

217
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:07,807
Give me some love.

218
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:17,932
I said love, why are you sending hats?

219
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:22,724
MISTEKTAGALOG: Look
behind you, there are cowboys.

220
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:25,099
What are you guys talking about?

221
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:28,599
Seriously? You're really
fucking like dogs on the stairs?

222
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:32,224
Alright, here.
I'll keep these for now.

223
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:34,891
Then I'll give them back
when things cool down.

224
00:13:35,057 --> 00:13:38,782
Okay? Because for me,
we're friends forever.

225
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:39,833
Okay?

226
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:43,016
I'm off.

227
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,599
Hi, Paco!

228
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:51,101
Ugh, Paco is so cute.

229
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:03,138
Friend.

230
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:04,866
What's with your face?

231
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:07,682
Strong bad vibes are emanating from you.

232
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:10,932
It's gonna get worse if
you don't let me through.

233
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:16,932
Hep, chill! Spread love and
peace and higher vibrations!

234
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:21,057
Vibrations? Do you see me shaking?

235
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:23,849
Every guy I like keeps friend zoning me.

236
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:27,974
I just want to be loved and get laid.

237
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:30,557
Is that so hard?

238
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:33,432
Want me to read your tarot spread?

239
00:14:34,682 --> 00:14:37,057
I don't need my cards spread.

240
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:38,411
I want my legs spread.

241
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:41,481
I'm tired of being a virgin.

242
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,682
Yeah, right. Just look around you.

243
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:49,932
And appreciate everything and everyone.

244
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,288
Okay?

245
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:53,182
Let's go!

246
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:02,057
- Psst.
- Hey!

247
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:04,807
Hey, you. Look here.

248
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:06,057
You were gawking!

249
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:07,974
- The heck?
- What's wrong with looking?

250
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:08,991
Guard!

251
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:10,016
Guard!

252
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:12,266
Guard! Janitor!

253
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:14,016
Could you please come clean this mess up?

254
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:15,016
It's forming a puddle.

255
00:15:15,016 --> 00:15:16,182
It's a freaking bucket!

256
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,021
Hey, you know Paco's the
only one in my Coinies heart.

257
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:20,132
Oh, please!

258
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:21,432
Oh, come on!

259
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:24,766
But I can still share my
brussel sprouts with Allaine.

260
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:26,349
What brussel sprouts?

261
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:27,568
You mean cabbage.

262
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,176
I don't blame her though.

263
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:33,907
Did you see what Allaine
did at last week's party?

264
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,099
- Show her!
- Girl, why have I never heard of this!

265
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:37,891
Oh my god. You should see this.

266
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:38,942
Let me see!

267
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:40,836
Here's your refill.

268
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,182
One more for fun?

269
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:45,391
I got here first.

270
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:46,641
Ladies first.

271
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:48,641
Gender equality. I was here first.

272
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,766
Wait, chill. What'd you bring me?

273
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,738
Sex on the beach. Later, sex on my bed.

274
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:56,766
Screwdriver. I'll drive you to my place.

275
00:15:56,974 --> 00:16:00,349
Then we can screw each other.

276
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:01,842
Take my drink.

277
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:05,169
No, no, this tastes better, Allaine.

278
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,489
- Sorry! Sorry!
- Sorry!

279
00:16:09,212 --> 00:16:10,241
Sorry.

280
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:11,349
That’s okay.

281
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:28,239
I can take you both at the same time.

282
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:40,349
Look at Allaine, she looks like a DJ!

283
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,172
That's Bryan!

284
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:44,622
He's the one with an alter account, right?

285
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:46,557
Isn't he bi?

286
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:50,641
I don't care if he's paprika
or cinnamon powder.

287
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,541
It's my dream to be carried in his arms!

288
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:56,565
I want him to push me against the wall.

289
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,724
He rules my fantasies,

290
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:00,349
my saved videos,

291
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:01,641
my hard drive.

292
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:04,241
- Oh, my Bryan!
- Yeah, we get it! He's looking!

293
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:05,974
Slam me against your pecs!

294
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:08,099
Bros, work out with me!

295
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,807
We focused on our upper body today, guys.

296
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,182
Tomorrow we'll do the lower body.

297
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:43,974
She's touching his arm!

298
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:45,224
Look, she's feeling him up.

299
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:47,099
I thought he was bi!

300
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,557
You're so judgmental.

301
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:54,307
That is Mrs. Holly, our new
guidance counselor. Okay?

302
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,557
There's too many rascals on campus.

303
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:57,641
Speak for yourself.

304
00:17:57,641 --> 00:17:59,849
- Whoa. Wow.
- Look who's talking.

305
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:01,266
- Have you looked in the mirror?
- Hey!

306
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:02,366
Look who's talking.

307
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:03,932
You're defending her?

308
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:06,307
- Come on. Let's go.
- Of course, why shouldn't he?

309
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:07,349
I guess.

310
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:09,474
Good morning, students of Vanguard.

311
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:13,624
General orientation for all senior
high students is about to begin.

312
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:16,224
Please proceed to the gym. Thank you.

313
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:28,932
This is off limits, man.

314
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:30,224
I don't play that.

315
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:32,516
I just thought you were
holding a banana roll.

316
00:18:32,516 --> 00:18:34,349
I wanted to ask where
you bought it. Sorry.

317
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:35,474
You're a kidder.

318
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,391
But it's cool, I'm not a hater.

319
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:41,266
Hang on, have we met?

320
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:43,974
My face is up here.

321
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:45,974
Paco Barrera?

322
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:48,141
Yeah, it was at the--

323
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:51,599
Content Creator Summit
last summer, remember?

324
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,807
I knew it.

325
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:55,307
But at the time, you were still straight.

326
00:18:55,307 --> 00:18:56,349
Are you gay?

327
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:59,307
You don’t hold back.

328
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:01,057
I'm discreet but ready for meat.

329
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,349
That's my branding.

330
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:06,057
Looks like you're not
doing so bad yourself.

331
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:07,724
You went viral pretty fast.

332
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,016
What's your secret?

333
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:13,557
Nothing special. When
a thought or feeling hits,

334
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:15,057
dancing is my outlet.

335
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:18,682
I didn't expect it would
resonate with my fans.

336
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:23,724
But wait, I don't see
much of you in school.

337
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:25,432
I'm a new transfer.

338
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,932
I just followed my crush here.

339
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:32,099
Man, you're really limiting your options.

340
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:36,141
Lots of girls would gladly
open their legs for you here.

341
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:40,307
Just say the word. Have
you seen all your fan arts?

342
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:42,766
Not really.

343
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,016
I'm still feeling things out.

344
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:47,182
Don't worry, bro. I got your back.

345
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:49,182
Let me be your buddy, bro.

346
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:52,775
Thank you.

347
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,766
Hey, don't sniff my balls.

348
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:57,474
Sorry, bro. Bad habit.

349
00:20:02,297 --> 00:20:03,333
Let's go.

350
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:04,430
Let's.

351
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:08,474
Good morning, Vanguard Senior High!

352
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,574
Yes!

353
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,682
You know, it's been another year for us.

354
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:21,599
And so, I pose you this question.

355
00:20:22,182 --> 00:20:27,557
Are you guys ready for this school year?

356
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:29,141
You're so cool, sir!

357
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:33,391
To welcome us all,

358
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:41,349
our interim principal,
nothing sure or final,

359
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:43,682
but as good as any.

360
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:46,932
Mr. Ragos, don't rub it in.

361
00:20:46,932 --> 00:20:48,391
They already know.

362
00:20:50,641 --> 00:20:57,557
Our interim principal,
Mr. Cornelio Gatmaitan.

363
00:21:02,932 --> 00:21:04,516
Thank you, Mr. Ragos.

364
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:13,333
Sorry, sir.

365
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:19,099
Good day, everyone.

366
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:26,849
I am Cornelio Gatmaitan and I'm
delighted to be the interim principal

367
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:31,141
of Vanguard Senior High.

368
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:40,474
Uh, I'm so excited to meet
all members of our community.

369
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:45,016
Please call me Principal Corny.

370
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,349
Especially the students.

371
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:56,599
My office is open to all your concerns.

372
00:21:57,432 --> 00:22:00,599
You may come in if you just wanna chill

373
00:22:01,057 --> 00:22:04,932
or spill the tea, as they say.

374
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:09,224
We can just relax together.

375
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:15,224
I'm willing to go broke being woke.

376
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:18,641
You can take my word for it. How's that?

377
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:29,224
Please follow me on my socials at pcornyg.

378
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:32,724
Again, it's at pcornyg. Thank you.

379
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:38,224
To start off the school
year, I prepared a cheer

380
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:42,307
that goes perfectly with
the Vanguard High motto!

381
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:46,724
Vincit Omnia Veritas

382
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:48,057
Very good!

383
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:58,432
Can somebody hold the mic for me, please?

384
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:01,016
Go, Mr. Ragos!

385
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:03,557
You're so hot, sir!

386
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:07,307
Ms. Reyes, please hold this for me.

387
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,641
Stand back, I might hit you.

388
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:26,724
Vanguard! Vanguard! Off to a great start!

389
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:30,349
Always true to our minds and hearts!

390
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:33,724
Vanguard! Vanguard! Truth conquers all!

391
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:37,182
Vanguard! Vanguard! Rawr, rawr, rawr!

392
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:41,391
Rarr!

393
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:50,474
Uh, students, let's
give him our full support!

394
00:23:50,474 --> 00:23:52,516
What was it, principal?

395
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:53,932
Let me do it again.

396
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,474
Okay, sure.

397
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,820
Vanguard! Vanguard! Off to a great start!

398
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:09,682
Always true to our minds and hearts!

399
00:24:11,807 --> 00:24:14,807
Vanguard! Vanguard! Truth conquers all!

400
00:24:18,307 --> 00:24:21,974
Vanguard! Vanguard! Rawr, rawr, rawr!

401
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:26,057
We want Mr. Ragos!

402
00:24:26,557 --> 00:24:28,307
- We want Mr. Ragos!
- Mr. Ragos, turn!

403
00:24:28,307 --> 00:24:29,891
- Me.
- Go, Mr. Ragos!

404
00:24:29,891 --> 00:24:30,938
Me.

405
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,391
Rawr, rawr, rawr!

406
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:35,266
Let's all try it! Everyone!

407
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,682
Let's go! Everybody!

408
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:43,974
One, two. One, two, three!

409
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:47,849
Vanguard! Vanguard! Off to a great start!

410
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:51,932
Always true to our minds and hearts!

411
00:24:52,266 --> 00:24:54,224
Vanguard! Vanguard!

412
00:25:00,807 --> 00:25:01,932
Calm down, fuck.

413
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:09,541
Paco!

414
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:12,391
Joanna! Why aren't you at the orientation?

415
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:16,682
Water break. Let's chat for a bit.

416
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:19,807
That's what you said earlier, right?

417
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,898
Can we do it another day?

418
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:29,224
Let's talk now!

419
00:25:29,516 --> 00:25:30,682
What's this about?

420
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:38,682
Jo, back then, you told me I'll have
a chance once we're in senior high.

421
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:40,976
I have a chance now.

422
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:47,474
I'm not in a rush or
anything, but please, Joanna?

423
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,872
But Paco, why me?

424
00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:54,891
I'm boring.

425
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:04,754
Hey!

426
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:08,688
You-- You inspire me, Joanna.

427
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:11,641
Shit. Lord, it's mad as hell.

428
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:13,599
What's mad as hell?

429
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,891
Ah, I meant I'm mad for you.

430
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:17,224
I wish we were dating, you know?

431
00:26:17,724 --> 00:26:19,141
Ahh.

432
00:26:20,557 --> 00:26:24,391
I'm actually still
waiting for a sign, Paco.

433
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:27,432
Something special.

434
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:29,849
Something ex--

435
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:33,682
Extra hard!

436
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,782
Paco!

437
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,182
Can I have a fan sign?

438
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:43,974
Please!

439
00:26:43,974 --> 00:26:45,005
Fine, fine.

440
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,364
There.

441
00:26:50,891 --> 00:26:52,106
What the hell.

442
00:26:54,641 --> 00:26:56,067
Excuse me.

443
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,682
Reynes. Mallari.

444
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:01,849
My dick.

445
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:05,432
What? Especially you, Barrera.

446
00:27:05,432 --> 00:27:07,349
You didn't finish the orientation?

447
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,057
These children.

448
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:14,641
I will see all three of you in my office.

449
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:16,349
Okay?

450
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:19,141
Erica!

451
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:26,599
Paco, look at me.

452
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:28,349
I'm so disappointed.

453
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:30,516
You and Joanna are practically siblings.

454
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,474
Ma, it's not Paco's fault.

455
00:27:35,474 --> 00:27:36,557
You're defending him?

456
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:38,391
It was an accident.

457
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:39,682
Ahh!

458
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:43,016
Besides, we enjoyed ourselves.

459
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:45,432
- What?
- Ah, I didn't enjoy it!

460
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:48,474
I meant me. I enjoyed it.

461
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:55,807
Mr. Cornelio Gatmaitan comma Principal.

462
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:59,766
It seems the students
of Vanguard are lost.

463
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:04,307
They let their emotions get the better
of them, and giving in to temptation!

464
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,599
First of all, pastor,

465
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:12,349
I want to apologize in behalf
of the students of Vanguard High.

466
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,641
We take your concerns very seriously

467
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:19,307
that's why we instated a new counselor.

468
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:20,974
Sir, you asked for me?

469
00:28:20,974 --> 00:28:22,099
Yes!

470
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:26,807
Mrs. Holly, Pastor Teresa Mallari.

471
00:28:27,182 --> 00:28:29,224
Pastor, this is Mrs. Holly.

472
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:31,391
Hello, pastor.

473
00:28:35,057 --> 00:28:36,057
And you?

474
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:40,891
How do you intend on
dealing with these kids

475
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:43,766
who get carried away by their whims

476
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:45,349
and temptations?

477
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:50,557
Pastor, their minds and body
are undergoing rapid changes.

478
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:54,539
I believe Mr. Barrera didn't mean to

479
00:28:54,564 --> 00:28:56,606
you know, do that in public.
To uh--

480
00:28:57,309 --> 00:28:58,559
Get his pet angry?

481
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:00,349
Blow his load?

482
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:02,599
Survey says…

483
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,807
Ejaculate.

484
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:05,560
Let's be scientific.

485
00:29:06,724 --> 00:29:08,141
Scientific?

486
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:11,391
We don't need to be scientific.

487
00:29:11,391 --> 00:29:13,432
What we need is to pray over these three.

488
00:29:13,432 --> 00:29:15,474
Pray over the youth of Vanguard

489
00:29:15,474 --> 00:29:20,891
to expel the demon living in their souls!

490
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:22,057
Amen!

491
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:25,536
Or I could counsel them!

492
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:26,605
- Absolutely!
- Right?

493
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,516
Yes! Especially Mr. Barrera!

494
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:32,057
Who couldn't help but--

495
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:34,345
- Ejaculate.
- Ejaculate.

496
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:38,016
Paco, come to my office.

497
00:29:38,016 --> 00:29:39,016
Cum?

498
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:41,307
Go to my office.

499
00:29:45,322 --> 00:29:46,352
Sorry.

500
00:29:51,315 --> 00:29:55,857
You know what, finding
you a guy would be easy.

501
00:29:56,391 --> 00:29:57,599
Then go ahead.

502
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:00,266
Problem is,

503
00:30:01,057 --> 00:30:04,474
from Paco to who?

504
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:06,266
It's a big shoe to fill.

505
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,682
Paco's old news.

506
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,766
I’m entering my main character era.

507
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:14,057
Should I pick someone for you?

508
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:15,349
Try me.

509
00:30:17,224 --> 00:30:18,307
Let's do this.

510
00:30:18,974 --> 00:30:20,266
Hmm, who's our man?

511
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:23,891
What about that one?

512
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,474
A midget? Can we go for the cuties?

513
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:30,557
What about him?

514
00:30:31,724 --> 00:30:33,099
Too hairy.

515
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:37,516
See? How am I supposed to help you?

516
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:42,599
How about you pick
and I'll work him for you.

517
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:45,329
Choose.

518
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:50,099
The one with earpods?

519
00:30:54,182 --> 00:30:57,182
Ew, no. That one's got bad breath.

520
00:31:01,641 --> 00:31:02,682
Someone else.

521
00:31:06,016 --> 00:31:07,016
That guy.

522
00:31:09,724 --> 00:31:12,182
He's got a history of chlamydia.

523
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:14,932
Then he's cured. It's history.

524
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:21,807
History repeats itself.
Let's go with a safe bet.

525
00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:30,349
Here he comes. Jesus.

526
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,641
It's a prank!

527
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:40,766
Move!

528
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:42,182
That's my seat.

529
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:47,682
Allaine.

530
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,932
What about him?

531
00:31:54,557 --> 00:31:57,516
Bullet? Are you crazy?

532
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,766
I just heard this.

533
00:32:07,766 --> 00:32:13,141
They say Bullet will
do anything for money.

534
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,474
Remember the exam leakage?

535
00:32:17,474 --> 00:32:19,349
He's the prime suspect.

536
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:22,599
But he's a professional.
He never gets caught.

537
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:25,599
Innocent until proven guilty.

538
00:32:26,557 --> 00:32:28,974
There were rumors going around, too.

539
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:33,141
That he tied up a student when they
didn't surrender their monthly allowance.

540
00:32:33,141 --> 00:32:34,432
Tied up?

541
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:03,932
Somebody also filed a report against it

542
00:33:03,932 --> 00:33:06,182
because he stabbed someone with a pen.

543
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:09,641
I’m surprised he's not in jail.

544
00:33:09,641 --> 00:33:11,182
He's too brutal.

545
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:13,307
Too violent.

546
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:17,454
Hey. You, okay?

547
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:24,385
I want him!

548
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,349
- Huh!
- Yes!

549
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:28,016
Okay.

550
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:29,726
But I'm not gonna bail you out, got it?

551
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:33,143
Don't blame me if you lose
a kidney on your way home.

552
00:33:33,957 --> 00:33:36,274
He can have my fallopian tubes, too.

553
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:39,141
You should get checked
by the new counselor.

554
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:42,641
That doesn't sound healthy.

555
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:49,182
Where you going?

556
00:33:49,182 --> 00:33:52,557
Guidance office. I need counseling
for what happened this morning.

557
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:55,182
You just need to get laid for real.

558
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:57,849
So you don't gotta hold in your urges.

559
00:33:57,849 --> 00:33:59,766
You sound so sure.

560
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:02,599
You know I get a lot of practice.

561
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:05,932
Good for you, bro. But I
don't wanna betray Joanna.

562
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:07,724
Not like it's cheating.

563
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:11,932
It's training. So, when it's her turn,
you'll know what you're doing.

564
00:34:12,307 --> 00:34:13,682
Are you good in bed?

565
00:34:13,974 --> 00:34:14,974
Probably.

566
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:16,275
See?

567
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,837
I've been training. A lot.

568
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,641
I gotta go.

569
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,057
- Cool.
- If you need anything,

570
00:34:23,057 --> 00:34:25,082
- I'm your man.
- Thank you.

571
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:28,016
Expedite the process.

572
00:34:28,016 --> 00:34:30,141
Take the blame because it's true!

573
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:32,474
You're psychologically incapable.

574
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:36,307
Do you think the judge will believe you?

575
00:34:37,682 --> 00:34:38,763
Huh?

576
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:41,599
C'mon, Jake. I'm a psychologist.

577
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:46,074
Besides, you're the one who
cheated but I'm the bad guy?

578
00:34:46,212 --> 00:34:50,170
Come on. I never in our
20 years cheated on you.

579
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:52,934
If you only knew about my sacrifices!

580
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:55,396
Jake! Hello?

581
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:04,057
Come here.

582
00:35:04,307 --> 00:35:05,557
Sit down.

583
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:11,449
Why are you here?

584
00:35:11,474 --> 00:35:12,891
No reason.

585
00:35:13,516 --> 00:35:15,682
I'm Gee, by the way.

586
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:19,182
Margiela Marie Basa .

587
00:35:19,391 --> 00:35:21,057
I mean Basa.

588
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:23,932
I heard you'll do anything
for the right price?

589
00:35:23,932 --> 00:35:25,141
Are you a cop?

590
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,016
No, no. Do I look like a cop?

591
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:28,599
Got an ex you need taken down?

592
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:30,099
Some prof you wanna beat up?

593
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:31,516
A lock you need fiddled with?

594
00:35:31,516 --> 00:35:33,807
Something I need fiddled with!
Yes. You got it.

595
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,266
But it's not a lock.

596
00:35:35,974 --> 00:35:37,807
Then what?

597
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:47,469
Are there numerous instances
where you repress yourself?

598
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:50,657
Holding off on things that make you happy?

599
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:54,141
Well, I guess I was
brought up to learn to wait.

600
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:58,974
That you have to work hard for something
before you can enjoy it.

601
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:01,016
You know? Because it's true.

602
00:36:01,016 --> 00:36:04,141
It's not worth it if you didn't earn it.

603
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:07,307
Papa said that's discipline.

604
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:10,432
Like, do you mean with a person, or?

605
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:16,849
I'm courting someone and I just need
a little more time to reel her in.

606
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:21,224
I don't even look at other girls
even though I have a raging hard-on.

607
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:23,182
- Okay.
- I've never touched myself.

608
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,972
I mean, not always.

609
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:32,101
Masturbation? Call it as it is.

610
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:35,141
There's nothing wrong
with our bodily functions.

611
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,974
So the instances where
you give in to your urges,

612
00:36:37,974 --> 00:36:40,099
how do you feel after?

613
00:36:40,794 --> 00:36:41,919
Uhm…

614
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:47,599
I'd feel guilty and try to make up for it

615
00:36:47,891 --> 00:36:50,266
by doing something or not doing something.

616
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:53,266
I think that evens out the karma.

617
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:56,665
Paco.

618
00:36:56,932 --> 00:37:00,766
What I see here is delayed gratification.

619
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:03,682
Or self-deprivation.

620
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:06,099
But it's all wrong.

621
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:11,307
We shouldn't feel ashamed of our emotions.

622
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:19,974
Because if we do, they'll just bubble up
inside you till you explode

623
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:27,724
emotionally, psychologically,
and in your case, physically.

624
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,978
Okay. Let me teach you some exercises

625
00:37:33,391 --> 00:37:38,849
on how to calm and
control your body and mind.

626
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:40,831
Okay?

627
00:37:51,766 --> 00:37:53,682
What's going on, Mrs. Holly?

628
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:57,724
We'll do a simple yoga.

629
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:03,766
Come here.

630
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:09,409
Here we go.

631
00:38:10,307 --> 00:38:11,724
Okay, bend over.

632
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,974
Bend over?

633
00:38:13,146 --> 00:38:15,396
We'll do a simple child's pose.

634
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:16,474
Come.

635
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:26,432
Bend over. Just like that.

636
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:29,391
Move your butt to the side.

637
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,891
Move it a bit more. Lower it.

638
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:35,641
Are your limbs feeling stiff.

639
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:36,641
Stiff as a log.

640
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:39,391
Okay, a bit more to the left.

641
00:38:39,932 --> 00:38:44,008
That's it. More. Lower.

642
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:45,074
We got it.

643
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:47,204
Okay, lie down.

644
00:38:48,432 --> 00:38:51,641
We'll do a Setu Bandha Sarvangasana.

645
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,297
Wait, I've never been molested.

646
00:38:55,307 --> 00:38:57,463
Just the name of the pose, okay?

647
00:38:58,016 --> 00:39:00,599
Move closer and lay your back down.

648
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:11,016
All right.

649
00:39:13,577 --> 00:39:15,243
Lift your butt.

650
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:22,513
That’s it. Lift. Higher.
Higher, not longer.

651
00:39:23,016 --> 00:39:24,931
My God.

652
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,474
Another. And one more.

653
00:39:28,474 --> 00:39:29,724
I can't do it, Mrs. Holly.

654
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:33,057
You can do it.

655
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:39,682
You, okay?

656
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:47,891
Try one more.

657
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,307
See, you can do it.

658
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,016
Okay, get up.

659
00:39:56,724 --> 00:39:57,849
Are you okay?

660
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,266
What are you doing?

661
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:06,985
Sorry, isn't that part of the
Sana Sana whatchamacallit?

662
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:25,683
What did I do?

663
00:41:27,246 --> 00:41:28,548
What's the big deal, Ms. Holly?

664
00:41:30,391 --> 00:41:31,671
Just call me Holly.

665
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:36,016
At least when we're in this
room, okay? Just call me Holly.

666
00:41:36,516 --> 00:41:40,057
But fuck, what have I done?

667
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:46,182
It's not even a week yet
and I already had sex with a student.

668
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:51,724
How old are you again?

669
00:41:51,955 --> 00:41:53,016
Eighteen.

670
00:41:53,695 --> 00:41:54,723
Good.

671
00:41:55,016 --> 00:41:57,557
I mean not good. Fuck.

672
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,974
I'm supposed to be a person of authority.

673
00:42:03,057 --> 00:42:07,182
Why are you so worried when
Bryan and I are the same age.

674
00:42:08,964 --> 00:42:09,997
And?

675
00:42:10,307 --> 00:42:14,432
I mean, if you're hitting that, why not me?

676
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:19,474
What? You think I'm doing this with Bryan?

677
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:22,432
Bryan is my son!

678
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,629
Fuck!

679
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,170
Where did you meet Bryan?

680
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:32,599
Are you close?
