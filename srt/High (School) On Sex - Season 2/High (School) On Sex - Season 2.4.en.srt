1
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:13,819
- What's that, San Andres?
- Brian Ricafort sells porn!

2
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:16,664
Hello, gorgeous!

3
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:17,909
Fuck you!

4
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:20,784
Brian! Stop it!

5
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:36,763
Paco? Why are you going
to the Guidance office?

6
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:37,994
Hello?

7
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:39,739
Excuse me?

8
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:43,376
Oh, Erica. Do you need me?

9
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:47,334
I was just looking for Paco.
I think he's in your office.

10
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:49,288
Ahh, I see.

11
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:52,180
It's probably an anxiety attack.

12
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:55,084
Did he tell you anything about me?

13
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:58,194
I'm worried I'm being too clingy with him.

14
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:00,254
I can't say anything, sorry.

15
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:05,626
But I think it might be the
pressure from the parade?

16
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:08,543
Maybe he doesn’t like my samgyupsal idea?

17
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:10,268
You know what,

18
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:11,709
let me check on him.

19
00:01:13,788 --> 00:01:16,278
Paco: I miss you, Mrs. H. Quickie
before the parade, please.

20
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:19,668
Mr. Ragos, Mrs. Holly, please come
to the grounds. Brian started a fist fight.

21
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:25,523
Erica, attend to Paco first, okay?

22
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:27,121
There's some commotion at the parade.

23
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:28,438
Commotion?

24
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,617
Brian's caught in a fist fight.

25
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:31,668
I have to go.

26
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:32,793
Okay Mrs. Holly!

27
00:01:38,742 --> 00:01:39,825
Erica!

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,084
What are you doing here?

29
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:43,084
Paco? Are you okay?

30
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:45,418
Why are you getting naked?

31
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:49,626
Are you sick? This isn't the clinic.

32
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:51,020
Ah, uhm…

33
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:52,209
It's just so hot!

34
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:54,001
Are you having an anxiety attack?

35
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:55,459
Mrs. Holly said--

36
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:56,543
Yes! Yes! Yes!

37
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:58,459
Is it because of me, Paco?

38
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:01,126
- Sorry, Paco…
- No! No, it's because of the…

39
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:02,501
- ….universe!
- Huh?

40
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:03,876
Because of all the wars.

41
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:05,334
Wars?

42
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:07,086
Yes.

43
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:10,105
What's up with all that,
you know, world peace?

44
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:13,751
We're busy with this
parade like everything's fine

45
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:15,418
while there are wars out there.

46
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:17,907
I have no idea what the
hell you're talking about

47
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:21,101
sometimes but since I like you…

48
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:23,543
Yes! Yes to world peace.

49
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,543
Amen!

50
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:28,091
Sorry for walking out
on you like that before.

51
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,434
- It's nothing! Come on, it's okay.
- Let's get back to the parade.

52
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:35,688
No, we can stay.
It's cancelled 'cause Brian

53
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,128
punched somebody.

54
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,032
Oh, shit.

55
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:45,638
Is there kimchi on my face?

56
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:51,743
What was that for?

57
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:54,555
Uhm, sorry for leaving you.

58
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,921
I hope that makes up for it.

59
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:13,898
Wow, since when?

60
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:16,582
What do you mean 'since when'?

61
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:19,706
I mean, what are you?

62
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:24,918
Lesbian? Bisexual?
Bicurious? Gender-fluid?

63
00:05:26,547 --> 00:05:28,195
I don't know.

64
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:30,588
I just follow what I like?

65
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,296
Am I your first?

66
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,602
Oh, shit!

67
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,794
Why?

68
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,171
I've never heard that one before.

69
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:42,863
Interesting!

70
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:44,263
Thanks, I guess.

71
00:05:44,293 --> 00:05:46,070
I didn't know you were into these things.

72
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,761
I just got carried away by
the moment and costumes.

73
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:56,851
Uhm, but can we keep
this a secret for now?

74
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:02,668
Sure. I don't kiss and tell.

75
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:06,115
Okay. Deal.

76
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:12,601
Tell him!

77
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:14,459
What do you want me to tell him?

78
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:17,459
Confess to what you did! You fucker!

79
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,484
Mr. Ricafort,

80
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:23,143
watch your language.

81
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,668
- That's right!
- Sorry, sir.

82
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:29,296
I'm the one who leaked your videos.

83
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,855
Besides, sir, I'm an
advocate of the pride org.

84
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:37,282
I support all gay men.

85
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:41,184
Especially the bisexual haters like you.

86
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,543
What did you say?

87
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:44,143
Sir!

88
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:45,834
Get away from her.
Get away.

89
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:49,501
Do you see how violent he can get, sir?

90
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:50,586
Okay, okay.

91
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:56,512
You know what, this is a case
of a 'she said, he said' situation.

92
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,876
Amber claims to be innocent.

93
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:05,004
And you, Ricafort, why do
you keep pinning this on her?

94
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,633
Because he's the only one
who's got a beef with me!

95
00:07:08,824 --> 00:07:14,199
Wow! With that attitude? I'm pretty
sure you've pissed off quite a few people.

96
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:17,046
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,167
I'll give both of you…

98
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,605
disciplinary action!

99
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,421
You'll provide community service.

100
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:29,709
Sir, why do I have to do it?

101
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:32,543
I'm the one who got
punched! It freaking hurts!

102
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:35,209
Sir, aren't I the victim here?
Those were my nudes that got leaked.

103
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:37,168
I mean I look good but still!

104
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:39,703
Whoa! "I look good."

105
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:41,054
You're not gonna quit?

106
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:45,862
My decision is final.

107
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:47,262
That was a quick decision, sir!

108
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:49,584
Naturally! I am the principal.

109
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:52,751
Besides, you should
be jerking each other off!

110
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:53,376
- Huh?
- Huh?

111
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:58,668
I meant you should support each other
because you belong to the same community.

112
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:00,084
Ah, wait, sir.

113
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:01,531
- I'm gay.
- I know!

114
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:03,932
But I don't wanna associate with them!

115
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:05,665
I don't like those kinds of gays!

116
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:08,584
You think we like you? Hello!

117
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:10,501
We just didn't have a choice.

118
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:11,543
Hold your horses.

119
00:08:11,543 --> 00:08:14,055
I'm not referring to the rainbow community.

120
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,455
I'm referring to the Vanguard community.

121
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:28,293
What you two should be doing, you
should love and respect each other.

122
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:31,231
You should try it once!

123
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:34,192
Love and respect each other.

124
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:35,860
Try it!

125
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:42,891
Brian?

126
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:44,531
Brian!

127
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:45,644
Ma.

128
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:46,669
How are you?

129
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,500
Are you okay?

130
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:52,623
Is it true?
You're selling your nudes online?

131
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:55,129
Mom, please.

132
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:59,754
I mean, it's a job option for some people.

133
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:02,213
They're earning a pretty penny from that.

134
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:07,393
But son, I don't think I'm
ready to let you do that.

135
00:09:07,418 --> 00:09:09,338
Especially at your age.

136
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:12,171
Are you doing this for the volleyball camp?

137
00:09:13,164 --> 00:09:15,414
I just didn't wanna bother you or Dad.

138
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:19,504
You have your own problems.
I don't wanna add to your worries.

139
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,754
Stop this, Brian. Okay?

140
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:26,921
If you're really set on
joining that camp, then okay.

141
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:28,629
I'll figure something out.

142
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:33,879
I don't know how yet,
but I'll think of something, okay?

143
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:58,648
One more.

144
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,148
I don't want to.

145
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,750
I'm done!

146
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:09,156
I don't want to.

147
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,589
- No more!
- One more round, Bullet!

148
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:13,547
- No more!
- One more, Bullet!

149
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:17,876
Bullet, come on! Let's do it again!

150
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:20,084
Where the hell are you going?

151
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:26,945
Father God, according to
John 1 Chapter 1 Verse 9,

152
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:30,296
You are just and forgiving

153
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,171
as long as we admit to our sins, right?

154
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:39,989
Lord, here I am, confessing my sins.

155
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:42,698
I sinned, Father.

156
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:48,338
Father God, I gave in to temptation.

157
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,713
But Lord, is it really wrong?

158
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:59,296
because it feels so good!

159
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:02,988
Joanna, come back to us!

160
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:11,901
Lord Almighty!

161
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:14,258
Forgive me, Lord.

162
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:20,716
Honey, can you check
these flyers I made?

163
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:22,825
We're gonna give them out tomorrow.

164
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,724
Okay, Mom.

165
00:11:25,223 --> 00:11:27,015
Oh, wait, did I disturb you?

166
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:29,609
No, I was just praying.

167
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,051
Are you done then?

168
00:11:31,076 --> 00:11:32,111
Yes, I'm done.

169
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:33,331
All right then goodnight.

170
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:34,550
Good night, mom.

171
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,231
Mom, here's fine! You don't need to
take me to class, it's embarrassing!

172
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:52,597
Yeah, yeah, okay. Don't forget,
I'll only be gone two weeks.

173
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:56,414
It's just in Cebu.
Behave well at Granny's, okay?

174
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:57,459
Yes, mom.

175
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:58,793
Want me to bring home anything for you?

176
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:02,918
How about some rabbitfish?
They sell them fresh over there.

177
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:03,959
I don't want any.

178
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:06,668
I'm really sorry, honey.

179
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:10,376
What can we do, your
dad's as ugly as his manners.

180
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:12,459
It's supposed to be his
turn to look after you!

181
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:14,251
But he's got somewhere else to be!

182
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:15,783
Sorry!

183
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:18,877
It's okay, mom. Granny and I
will spend some quality time.

184
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:20,985
I have such a good girl.

185
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,251
Be a good girl, okay?

186
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:26,334
I love you! I love you so much!

187
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,709
It's just 2 weeks. Just 2 weeks.

188
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,626
I should go.
Don't wanna be late to my flight.

189
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:30,709
Bye! Bye.

190
00:12:31,605 --> 00:12:33,605
It should look nice.

191
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:37,168
Here are the flyers we
talked about last night.

192
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:39,793
You should be able to
invite at least one person!

193
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,543
One soul is enough!

194
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:42,721
- Got it?
- Yes, mom.

195
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:46,636
Wait, that reminds me of Paco…

196
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:48,398
Is he all better?

197
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:51,423
Can he control his disgusting urges now?

198
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:52,751
Is he still courting you?

199
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,043
Chasing you around?

200
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:57,153
We don't talk that much anymore, mom.

201
00:12:57,307 --> 00:12:58,793
He's busy with his classes.

202
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:00,584
So glad to hear it!

203
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:02,823
But we should still invite him, okay?

204
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:05,964
We have to pray over him.

205
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:07,168
- Okay, sure, mom.
- I'll be going then.

206
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:08,209
Be safe!

207
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:10,084
Okay, mom. Bye!

208
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:12,630
- I love you!
- I love you, Ma!

209
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,698
What happened to you?

210
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:18,042
Did you run away?

211
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:20,745
Mom's leaving for work.

212
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:23,691
So I have to stay at my granny's.

213
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:26,879
I was supposed to be
with dad but he left, too.

214
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,078
They're separated, you see.

215
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:33,297
Oh, sorry, I didn't know.

216
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:37,636
It's weird, actually.
They don't seem that bothered about it.

217
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:39,675
They're still friends.

218
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:43,768
As for me, I still can't accept it.

219
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:45,961
I don't think it's weird.

220
00:13:45,986 --> 00:13:49,611
What would be weird is if you feel nothing
about what happened.

221
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,053
You're not made of stone, are you?

222
00:13:54,773 --> 00:13:55,898
What's that?

223
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:58,213
Ah. Here, have one.

224
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:03,242
If you're not doing anything later,
come to our church's anniversary dinner.

225
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:04,981
There's free buffet.

226
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:06,862
Sweet!

227
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:09,330
Will you be served at the buffet?

228
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,214
- Let me help you with that.
- Okay! G!

229
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:17,338
- Take this one, it's heavier.

230
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,546
Hey, bestie, are you okay?

231
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,667
Fine, fine.

232
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:37,043
You don't look it.
You look like you have a worm up your ass.

233
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,709
Spit it out. What is it?

234
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,338
I know you've got tea.

235
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:45,004
More like a confession, actually.

236
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:48,073
About yesterday…

237
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:50,418
Hold it, Milo.

238
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:57,959
Hey! Where were you yesterday?
You missed all the gay action!

239
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,401
True that, bestie!

240
00:14:59,543 --> 00:15:01,251
Slugfest of the century.

241
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:02,918
Bisexual versus femme!

242
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:04,168
It was nuts!

243
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:07,534
Nah, I was busy with
something more important.

244
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:10,223
Like what?

245
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,953
Well, sorry, but I don't kiss and tell.

246
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,504
That's stupid.

247
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:19,626
So you admit there was kissing involved!

248
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:20,709
Yeah!

249
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:23,796
But I didn't say who, did I?

250
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:25,510
Who could it be?

251
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:27,443
Is it Paco?

252
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:33,418
I think with just a little more push,
he's gonna be mine!

253
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:34,729
Oh my God, hey!

254
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:37,671
Hey! Don't be delusional.

255
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:40,043
Babe, you know how famous people are!

256
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:41,126
Get a grip!

257
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:43,459
Kate, tell her. Back me up!

258
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,644
Since when did they become friends?

259
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:51,831
So what if they're friends? You jealous?

260
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:53,815
You're totally jealous.

261
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,925
Change topic.

262
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:57,524
What were you gonna tell us?

263
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:58,947
Nothing.

264
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,043
My ass!

265
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,501
Enough with the suspense.

266
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:04,043
Just spill it!

267
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,043
- Come on!
- Hurry up!

268
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,630
Fine!

269
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:12,668
But be quiet.

270
00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:14,751
I'm the one who leaked Brian's scandal.

271
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:16,043
I feel guilty.

272
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,043
- Yo!
- Huh?

273
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,584
Why did you do that?

274
00:16:18,584 --> 00:16:20,418
Because I was annoyed with him!

275
00:16:20,418 --> 00:16:22,376
He was acting all high and mighty!

276
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:25,221
But now, I feel bad.

277
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:26,413
You know what?

278
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:29,925
It'll eat at you until you own up to it!

279
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:35,493
Bestie, I can't confess to Brian!

280
00:16:35,518 --> 00:16:38,601
Did you see him punch Amber in the face?
Right, Kate?

281
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:39,979
I'm not ready for that!

282
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:41,543
Okay, hear me out.

283
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:46,043
What if you tell Mrs. Holly
and ask for her advice?

284
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:48,376
We can go with you if you like.

285
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:50,293
We're here for you. Aren't we, Kate?

286
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:51,921
I'm scared!

287
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,309
Don't be scared. We've got your back.

288
00:16:57,962 --> 00:16:59,851
- It's gonna be fine, bestie.
- You can do it.

289
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:01,168
We're here.

290
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:22,084
Hi, Paco.

291
00:17:22,646 --> 00:17:24,896
- How are you?
- Uhm, fine.

292
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:26,605
Are you done being angry with me?

293
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,046
Angry? For what?

294
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,214
Probably because I'm dating Erica now.

295
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,780
No! What do I care?

296
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:36,113
Wait. Something's different about you.

297
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:38,398
I can't put my finger on it.

298
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:41,006
Well, I'm just happy.

299
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:43,534
- I feel good.
- That's good.

300
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,892
I'm happy for you.

301
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,211
Thank you.

302
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:48,403
Sit down beside me. Tell me what's up.

303
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:26,240
I don't get it.

304
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:36,059
Psst, Allaine.

305
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:38,027
What's different about Gee?

306
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:39,612
What's up with her?

307
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:55,293
Madame Zeny! Good day!

308
00:18:55,293 --> 00:18:57,001
Good day, principal!

309
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,043
How have you been?

310
00:18:58,043 --> 00:18:59,334
I've been well.

311
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,359
This is for you.

312
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:01,251
Oh, thanks.

313
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:03,584
Ah, I've brought you another surprise.

314
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:06,395
This is Brian and Amber.

315
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:09,758
What kind of bullshit
did these two cook up?

316
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:12,120
He punched him.

317
00:19:12,168 --> 00:19:14,584
There was a parade at school,

318
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:17,084
and they had a disagreement.
You know how kids are.

319
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:20,126
The last pair you brought
here punched each other, too!

320
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:21,276
You remember?

321
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:24,509
Is it a school you're
running or a boxing gym?

322
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:26,105
A boxing gym.

323
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,704
No, I'm kidding.

324
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:30,758
Not that I'm complaining.

325
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:34,200
My house was built almost
solely with your students' help.

326
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:35,734
I noticed.

327
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:37,344
But that just means

328
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:40,369
your school's crawling with brutes!

329
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:42,893
They're just kids.
Let's give them a break.

330
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:46,501
Anyway, I've introduced them to you.

331
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:48,469
We'll be on our way.
Let me just repeat that:

332
00:19:48,494 --> 00:19:52,328
Brian, Amber. Amber, Brian.

333
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:55,480
Both of you behave. Please?

334
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:58,005
All you have to do is follow Madame.

335
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,113
That's it.

336
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,438
Okay?

337
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:01,459
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:02,751
I will see you in the office.

339
00:20:02,946 --> 00:20:04,422
- Let's go, Joyce.
- Behave.

340
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:09,292
I don't want any stress.

341
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:13,222
And I don't like softies and weaklings!

342
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:15,739
You're not gay, are you?

343
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:20,206
Why do you ask?

344
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,299
I don't like gays.

345
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:27,828
- Like we wanna be here?
- What was that?

346
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,395
Nothing, madame. Neither of us are gay.

347
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:34,771
I'm a dude.

348
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:37,896
I just like makeup. Hashtag vain!

349
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:40,422
What do you need us for?

350
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:43,105
Clean up the garden.

351
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,838
And paint the vases over there.

352
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,167
This is your fault!

353
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:53,368
Fuck you.

354
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,638
You'd better be doing that right.

355
00:20:58,663 --> 00:21:00,538
Can you mind your own business?

356
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:02,829
I'm just saying, I never wanna be stuck

357
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,484
doing community service
again because of you!

358
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:11,834
This isn't so hard.

359
00:21:12,184 --> 00:21:16,344
It's just up, down, top
to bottom, top to bottom.

360
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:18,453
That's all you gotta do.

361
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,418
Let me try that.

362
00:21:19,418 --> 00:21:22,251
Top to bottom, top to bottom!
Is that correct? Did I get it right?

363
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:23,418
Not like that! Like this!

364
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:27,084
Top to bottom, top to bottom,
top to bottom, top to bottom!

365
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:28,668
Mm, yes!

366
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:31,501
Is that it.

367
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:36,136
Hey! You fucking idiots!

368
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:42,043
He started it, not me!

369
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:44,284
- Mind your own business!
- That's enough!

370
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:47,364
You're just giving me more work to do!

371
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,888
Clean this mess up!

372
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:54,596
Good God, what have you done?

373
00:22:11,937 --> 00:22:15,187
That's how I imagined you
when I got on that videocall.

374
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:16,440
What?

375
00:22:17,594 --> 00:22:20,677
Imagine if you weren't wearing makeup
and acting like a girl.

376
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,106
I'd have boned you!

377
00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:24,528
We'd have been at it like rabbits.

378
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:25,948
Then what?

379
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,414
You're gonna collab with
me and sell my nudes, too?

380
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:31,856
Fuck you!

381
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,648
That's what's wrong with you, Brian.

382
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:38,695
I'm not going to change myself

383
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:41,651
just so you or anyone
else, finds me palatable!

384
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:44,469
I worked too hard to build myself up

385
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:47,003
to get to this level of
confidence and be out.

386
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,575
Blah, blah, blah. Shut up!

387
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:53,209
You don't wanna hear people out.

388
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,959
You're so full of yourself.

389
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:56,571
You can't even wrap
your head around the fact

390
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:59,471
that I wasn't the one
who leaked your nudes.

391
00:22:59,617 --> 00:23:00,617
Then who?

392
00:23:01,198 --> 00:23:03,156
How the hell should I know?

393
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:08,242
You know, I accepted you into the pride org

394
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:12,836
because I believe that
you're nice deep inside!

395
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:14,918
Besides, I have nothing against you

396
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:18,438
even if you ruined me and
stomped on my whole being.

397
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:20,091
I'm used to it!

398
00:23:20,116 --> 00:23:22,408
I don't hurt that easily!

399
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:31,265
Get changed.

400
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:33,505
Thank you, madame.

401
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:36,352
Why dresses?

402
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:39,484
Don't be fussy.
You're enough trouble as it is.

403
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:41,676
That's all I have, dusters.

404
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:44,586
They're pretty, actually. Floral.

405
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:48,812
I don't wear these things.

406
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,667
Wait, Bullet!

407
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:54,918
You wanna hang out?

408
00:23:54,918 --> 00:23:56,906
Maybe tomorrow. I gotta do something.

409
00:23:58,427 --> 00:24:00,052
After then?

410
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:01,609
Will it take long?

411
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:02,711
I can wait.

412
00:24:02,736 --> 00:24:05,736
You wanna go get milk tea or… you know.

413
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:08,213
Stop asking.

414
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:10,088
I said tomorrow.

415
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:12,235
Are you mad?

416
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:17,546
Listen, Gee. I've got shit to deal with
outside school, okay?

417
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,666
So stop being a pest.

418
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:28,656
The fuck, am I your grandma
or something? Want presents?

419
00:24:44,743 --> 00:24:45,743
Are we close?

420
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:47,021
Yeah, we're almost there.

421
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:48,834
- Your bag's kinda heavy, huh?
- I'm hungry.

422
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:49,867
Is there a lot of food?

423
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:51,933
This is our house.

424
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:56,226
- Isn't it nice?
- Can we go in?

425
00:24:56,749 --> 00:24:57,945
Where's you mom?

426
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,430
She's inside.

427
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:07,180
With love, the power of joy,

428
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,379
and the blessing of light,

429
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:15,667
we manifest that we will forever
have happiness in our hearts!

430
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,848
Now and then, amen!

431
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:19,373
Amen!

432
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,251
- Amen!
- Amen!

433
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:23,070
Let's give the Lord a round of applause!

434
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:28,145
Praise the Lord!

435
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:31,519
Forever!

436
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,676
Mom.

437
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:35,084
Thank you.

438
00:25:35,084 --> 00:25:36,117
Mom.

439
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,282
Please excuse me.

440
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:41,925
Good evening.

441
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,891
Mom, this is Allaine.

442
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:46,016
Allaine, my mom.

443
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:49,416
She's the pastor of our church.

444
00:25:49,773 --> 00:25:51,648
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello, Allaine.

445
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:55,641
I didn't know my daughter
had such a beautiful classmate.

446
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,166
Thank you, ma'am.

447
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:59,649
- Are you here to get baptized?
- Sorry?

448
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:02,043
Because the tub's ready.
We just need to fill it up.

449
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:03,070
Mom…

450
00:26:03,784 --> 00:26:06,218
I think I wanna
experience the service first.

451
00:26:07,863 --> 00:26:11,779
May you have the enlightenment
that you want in our service!

452
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,013
Take care of your guest, darling, okay?

453
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:15,293
- Okay, mom.
- I'm almost done here.

454
00:26:15,293 --> 00:26:17,516
Moving on, brothers and sisters.

455
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:22,557
- As it says in Jeremiah Chapter 17--
- Don't you wanna get baptized?

456
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,602
Why? You wanna see my hard
nipples through a wet blouse?

457
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:30,237
Maybe.

458
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:32,797
I just made you cry in my arms.

459
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:26,711
Hey, Allaine.

460
00:27:27,054 --> 00:27:29,570
I didn't know you were part of the church.

461
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:31,430
Joanna just invited me today.

462
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:33,007
You guys dating?

463
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:36,021
Don't tell me you brought
her to meet the parents?

464
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:38,532
Have you decided to get tied down, Joanna?

465
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,932
No, we're just friends.

466
00:27:40,957 --> 00:27:43,539
And I'm here for the Lord.

467
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:45,664
Lighting strike you.

468
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,156
Where's Brian? He's not here?

469
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:54,449
Why? Why did you let him get into trouble?

470
00:27:54,761 --> 00:27:58,552
I'm glad he's getting into brawls,
not into hair salons.

471
00:27:59,362 --> 00:28:01,653
This is your fault for
tolerating his homosexuality.

472
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:04,279
That's his decision.

473
00:28:04,304 --> 00:28:06,309
And I'm just here to support my son.

474
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:07,719
Let me take care of him.

475
00:28:08,007 --> 00:28:10,257
For one or two months.

476
00:28:10,282 --> 00:28:11,338
I'll make him straight.

477
00:28:11,872 --> 00:28:14,289
I've got cousins from
the military in Tacloban!

478
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:15,367
Huh?

479
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:16,921
That's never gonna happen!

480
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:18,872
Your role here

481
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,004
is to help him with his needs.

482
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:24,588
Like that volleyball camp in Thailand.

483
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:26,668
Why are you making it hard for him?

484
00:28:26,693 --> 00:28:28,625
You're the one who's
making things hard for him

485
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,344
making him think there's
a future in him being gay.

486
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:32,876
He's just gonna get laughed at.

487
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:35,352
Hello? It's 2023!

488
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:38,004
Where do you live? In the 1960s?

489
00:28:38,286 --> 00:28:39,786
My goodness!

490
00:28:39,957 --> 00:28:43,207
The LGBT movement has already
accomplished so much in the world

491
00:28:43,232 --> 00:28:45,796
without asking for help from anyone!

492
00:28:46,562 --> 00:28:48,062
Then let Brian figure it out!

493
00:28:48,087 --> 00:28:49,504
He doesn't need anyone's help anyway!

494
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:53,084
So you're fine with him
selling nudes on the internet?

495
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:55,213
Like you said, it's his decision!

496
00:28:56,912 --> 00:28:58,079
You're evil.

497
00:28:58,481 --> 00:29:00,838
Just leave, you useless piece of shit.

498
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:08,046
Madame, can I ask you a question?

499
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:13,382
I'm just curious.
Why are you angry at gay people?

500
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:16,797
Do you see my husband anywhere?

501
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:18,427
You have a husband?

502
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:23,419
He left me!
He ran off with his gay bestfriend!

503
00:29:24,315 --> 00:29:26,440
They'll both burn in hell!

504
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,326
Madame, I'm gay.

505
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:32,084
I know.

506
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:33,203
You know?

507
00:29:33,228 --> 00:29:34,561
It's obvious!

508
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:37,997
What about him?

509
00:29:38,022 --> 00:29:39,047
Hey!

510
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:41,501
Aren't you a couple?

511
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:44,862
Ew! No!

512
00:29:47,101 --> 00:29:48,187
You know,

513
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:54,956
not every gay person is like your husband.

514
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:59,660
Sure, there are assholes

515
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:01,820
but we're not all the same.

516
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,169
And isn't that for the better?

517
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:10,588
If you had known much later that your
husband's hiding something from you,

518
00:30:11,047 --> 00:30:13,255
that would hurt you more in the long run.

519
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,879
At least he was honest with you.

520
00:30:15,044 --> 00:30:16,419
So what?

521
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:17,944
He still left me.

522
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:20,338
I just wanna be angry, what's it to you?

523
00:30:21,331 --> 00:30:22,372
Okay!

524
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:24,163
I was just asking.

525
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:27,254
Okay.

526
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:30,183
Finish your plate.

527
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,501
After that, you can leave.

528
00:30:31,526 --> 00:30:33,046
I still have things to do outside.

529
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:36,782
Why did you have to pry about her husband?

530
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:40,630
I just wanted to know why
she's angry at gay people!

531
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,963
At least now, I got the answer I wanted.

532
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:46,171
A gay man betrayed her.

533
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:48,376
And I respect that! It's understandable!

534
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:49,959
She should sit with her
anger for as long as she likes!

535
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,126
At least now, we know.

536
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:54,641
That she's not angry just
for the sake of being angry.

537
00:30:55,258 --> 00:30:56,716
You mean like me?

538
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:58,344
I didn't say that.

539
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:02,129
Madame!

540
00:31:02,454 --> 00:31:04,254
Madame? Madame?

541
00:31:05,237 --> 00:31:07,463
Shit, did she fall asleep?

542
00:31:09,716 --> 00:31:11,841
Is she still breathing? Check her pulse!

543
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:14,713
Oh my God!

544
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,254
Madame?

545
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:24,421
Are you okay, Mrs. H?

546
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,788
Was that Brian's dad?

547
00:31:29,573 --> 00:31:30,754
What did he do?

548
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:33,680
Nothing. I'm fine.

549
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,338
He's just an asshole.

550
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:42,338
You can tell me anything, all right?

551
00:31:49,265 --> 00:31:51,254
Thanks for being here, Paco.

552
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:55,338
Somehow, I'm glad I
have someone to lean on.

553
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:51,027
Where's the money?

554
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,963
You'll have it next week!

555
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,588
That's what you told us last week.

556
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:59,356
You're fooling us every week.

557
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:03,659
You're losing sleep over 20k?

558
00:34:03,684 --> 00:34:05,921
You're cheaping out on 20k?

559
00:34:08,536 --> 00:34:10,213
I blew all the money playing odds.

560
00:34:11,143 --> 00:34:12,754
And I'm still waiting for my allowance.

561
00:34:12,995 --> 00:34:15,629
I'll give you the first 10k
by installment, I promise.

562
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:19,838
Installment? Fuck that.

563
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:24,503
Don't! Don't hurt Bullet!

564
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:26,819
Who's this? Your sugar mommy?

565
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,492
For fuck's sake, Gee.

566
00:34:31,563 --> 00:34:33,046
Stay out of this.

567
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:35,961
Wait, how much does he owe you?

568
00:34:36,586 --> 00:34:37,794
20,000.00

569
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:39,361
No big deal.

570
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:40,824
Here.

571
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:43,519
For the payment.

572
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:47,714
Make sure it's not fake.

573
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,903
This will do.

574
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:54,338
Next time, pay your debts on time.

575
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:04,629
What did I tell you? Just trust me.

576
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,394
I can't do this! I'm really
scared of Mrs. Holly!

577
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:17,763
I'm not ready to do this.

578
00:35:17,788 --> 00:35:20,205
I thought you felt guilty?

579
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,626
You should face your problems!

580
00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:24,126
Okay, here's what we'll do.

581
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:28,126
I'll check if Mrs. Holly is in.
If she's there, follow after me.

582
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,876
- Okay, stay here.
- Okay.

583
00:35:31,511 --> 00:35:33,184
Stay here. I'll be right back.

584
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:34,251
Okay.

585
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:44,994
Erica?

586
00:35:53,948 --> 00:35:54,977
Hey.

587
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:56,918
- Come on.
- She's not there?

588
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:59,004
She's not there. Come on!

589
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:03,626
How are you guys?

590
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:07,313
You know,

591
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,980
don't let it get to you too much.

592
00:36:12,454 --> 00:36:14,287
You had nothing to do with it.

593
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:19,808
And Madame's in her advanced age.

594
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:22,393
That's to be expected.

595
00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:28,276
For all you know, all those remaining
years she's had are just a bonus.

596
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:33,144
Besides, the school will
take care of all the expenses.

597
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:43,620
The wake, the burial, the wake.. Amber,
you're great at doing make-up, right?

598
00:36:45,253 --> 00:36:48,261
You can do Madame's makeup if you like.

599
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:50,003
She'd have loved that for sure.

600
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:54,544
And if you wanna send her flowers, yeah!

601
00:36:57,781 --> 00:36:59,073
Nice!

602
00:37:00,058 --> 00:37:01,979
Am I the first person you brought in here?

603
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:03,129
Of course.

604
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,159
What's wrong?

605
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,133
Nothing.

606
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,750
No, seriously.

607
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:28,109
I've had multiple sexual partners, Joanna.

608
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:31,232
One little wince and I
know something's off.

609
00:37:31,278 --> 00:37:32,403
Tell me.

610
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:34,800
Okay.

611
00:37:35,777 --> 00:37:38,902
You don't seem like the same person
I did it with in the restroom.

612
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:42,766
Like I don't feel the same way.

613
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:45,387
What do you mean?

614
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,347
I'm attracted to these things.
Anime characters and monsters.

615
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:57,153
So… should I just go home?

616
00:37:57,466 --> 00:37:59,338
No. Wait.

617
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:07,626
Wear this.

618
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:18,508
Okay…

619
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:21,546
You like this?

620
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:18,324
Are you okay?
