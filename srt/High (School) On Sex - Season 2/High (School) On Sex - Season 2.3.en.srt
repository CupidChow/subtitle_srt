1
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:50,354
Always a good time with you, Mrs. H.

2
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,536
Mrs. H?

3
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:54,604
Don’t you like it?

4
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:56,369
I think it sounds cooler.

5
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:58,147
Has a mysterious ring to it.

6
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:01,117
You find me mysterious, do you?

7
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:06,679
A little. Every time, there's
like a brand new experience.

8
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:10,514
Maybe you just don’t
have that much experience.

9
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:12,242
Is it obvious?

10
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:14,284
Sometimes.

11
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:17,701
Like when?

12
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:21,867
When you do this, you should do this…

13
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:25,951
Instead of this…

14
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,239
Like that.

15
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:31,156
All right next time, Mrs. H.

16
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,068
How did your date go with Erica?

17
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:35,655
Is she mysterious, too?

18
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,792
We didn't get to that part.

19
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:40,067
Why, your date didn't go well?

20
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,085
Well, it was fine.

21
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:45,826
It was fun at first.

22
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,409
But?

23
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,784
Something happened.

24
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,195
The moon's really pretty, huh?

25
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:55,617
Yeah, looks like a glowing ball.

26
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,802
You're right. It is a glowing ball.

27
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:07,867
So what's your favorite phase of the moon?

28
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:08,983
Huh?

29
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:13,909
Are you okay?

30
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:15,576
You look uncomfortable.

31
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:17,659
No, I'm not.

32
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:20,867
What's up with your outfit anyway?

33
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,374
I mean, it's nice, but…

34
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:25,201
it doesn't look like you.

35
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:28,379
Fine, I'll be honest.

36
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:30,463
I'm doing this for you.

37
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:31,982
For me?

38
00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:34,213
Do I look like I'm into turtles?

39
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,701
Isn't this your type?

40
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,478
Joanna, for example.

41
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:44,068
Erica, Joanna is Joanna.

42
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,343
You are you.

43
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:47,492
Just be yourself.

44
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:52,115
Phew, thank God.
I was just waiting for your cue.

45
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,046
I'm sweating in here.

46
00:03:58,617 --> 00:04:00,534
Whoa, what are you doing?

47
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,968
How can Joanna wear all
these layers in this heat?

48
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,492
Let's just go.

49
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:15,843
Here.

50
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,830
So, what's your favorite phase of the moon?

51
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,210
Are you seriously asking me that?

52
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:26,592
Well, I already know your zodiac sign.

53
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:27,638
Virgo.

54
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:31,676
And your birthday's on September 14th.

55
00:04:31,843 --> 00:04:36,242
And your favorite color is
green that's sort of phlegmy.

56
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,242
And your favorite tree is Molave.

57
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,742
You really like me, huh.

58
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:42,963
I really, really do.

59
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,867
Hey!

60
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:46,909
What happened?

61
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:51,081
I think I sprained my ankle.

62
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:54,905
Just relax. Just relax.

63
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,005
Come on, I'm walking you home.

64
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:01,411
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:02,478
It's okay.

66
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:06,091
Wait.

67
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:10,242
Come on.

68
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:13,819
This freaking pole--

69
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:17,224
I hate you!

70
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,242
How's Brian by the way, Mrs. H?

71
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:21,865
Well, he walked into something.

72
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,015
Walked into what?

73
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,713
He thought he was going to a
basketball game, but it was a ballroom.

74
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:31,129
He ended up have enjoying it, though.

75
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:33,126
Even brought home a trophy.

76
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:34,695
I'm surprised he took it well.

77
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,220
Well, Brian is navigating his sexuality.

78
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:40,188
It turns out,

79
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,363
figuring out your sexuality
doesn't end up with you coming out.

80
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:49,774
Sexuality has multiple facets
that one person has to figure out.

81
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:52,924
You know, if I pursued my PhD,

82
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,798
that would have been
my dissertation topic.

83
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:58,289
Good topic to study actually.

84
00:05:58,445 --> 00:05:59,803
Why don't you go back and do it?

85
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:03,762
Maybe when Brian's father
and I have settled things.

86
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:06,789
You know, he is very traditional.

87
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:08,355
What do you mean?

88
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,130
We'd always fight about my
work and higher education.

89
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:15,864
For him, I should be a
stay-at-home mother.

90
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:18,820
But that's not all I want.

91
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:21,367
I focused on my career.

92
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:24,854
But when things got shaky,

93
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,671
I stopped my doctorate

94
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,796
to try to fix it.

95
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,088
But I was too late.

96
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:39,065
He cheated on me and he could no longer
see me as a partner.

97
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:41,750
It's his loss, Mrs. H.

98
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,003
You're a bombshell, and smart, too.

99
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,653
Good sex?

100
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,371
Actually, I don't think about it anymore.

101
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:54,713
But sometimes, I regret not being there
while Brian was growing up.

102
00:06:57,732 --> 00:07:00,585
Probably why he doesn't
have a female role model.

103
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:03,171
And he's wary of femme gays.

104
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:08,296
Or maybe his father had
such a big impact on him.

105
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:13,104
for him, in order for
you to get what you want,

106
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:15,629
you have to be strong and masculine.

107
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:19,191
Brian can still change, Mrs. H.

108
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:21,685
I'll help him as his friend.

109
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,546
Thank you, Paco.

110
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:29,178
I hope it's not too late for me
to have an impact on Brian's life.

111
00:07:30,435 --> 00:07:34,477
I don't want him to become hateful
of things he doesn't understand.

112
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:52,078
What is it?

113
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:53,362
Hey! What's the matter?

114
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:54,563
What are you doing?

115
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,391
Bullet?

116
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:02,931
What's up?

117
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:09,066
How was your remedial exam with Sir Ragos?
Did it go well?

118
00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:11,838
But based on that look, I'm guessing not.

119
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:17,379
Look, I can ask him to
give you a second chance.

120
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:20,852
We'll do better on our next tutorial.

121
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:23,502
Just don't remove my appendix.

122
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:27,356
I mean, sure you can take it out,
it's useless anyway.

123
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,046
Just don't remove my pancreas.

124
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:34,506
Can you zip your mouth for a second?

125
00:08:34,922 --> 00:08:36,214
Okay, boss.

126
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,921
I said be quiet.

127
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,583
OMG! What's that?
A gun? Knife? Ice pick?

128
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:53,281
Please, if you're gonna kill me,

129
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:55,004
try not to ruin my face.

130
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:58,254
I don't want a blown up face.

131
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:03,091
You passed?

132
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:07,175
You passed? Does that
mean you're not gonna kill me?

133
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,258
No.

134
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,908
And thank you.

135
00:09:16,177 --> 00:09:17,177
Sorry.

136
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,198
Why did you bring me to the stock room?

137
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,966
What are you doing?

138
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:34,129
I'm agreeing to what you want.
I'm ready to devirginize you.

139
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:35,879
As a thank you.

140
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,980
Okay, game!

141
00:09:44,855 --> 00:09:47,027
- Is that real?
- Of course.

142
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,838
You've never seen a cock in your life?

143
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:53,004
That big? In person?

144
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,321
Yeah!

145
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,844
Did your mom crave for gourds
while you were in the womb?

146
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:02,702
Where would I put that?

147
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:08,421
Why did God make a gigantic
penis versus a shallow vagina?

148
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:13,104
You can take it. I'll cheer you on.

149
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,411
No, I can't!

150
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:29,565
Brian!

151
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:32,740
Yes, coach!

152
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,932
Are you ready for our good news?

153
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:37,207
Coach, with everything
that's been going on lately,

154
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:38,315
yes, please.

155
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,549
I really need some good news.

156
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:42,362
Sawadee ka.

157
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:44,212
Huh?

158
00:10:44,237 --> 00:10:45,445
That's the clue.

159
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:47,560
Sawadee ka.

160
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:49,820
Coach, can you just…?

161
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:53,921
You got accepted to the
volleyball camp in Thailand!

162
00:10:54,777 --> 00:10:55,818
Yes!

163
00:10:56,211 --> 00:10:57,281
Nice!

164
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:59,014
Sawadee ka.

165
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:00,504
But there's a problem.

166
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:01,983
What is it, coach?

167
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,046
You'll have to shoulder all the expenses.

168
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:06,079
Hang on, coach.

169
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:09,562
I thought the school was gonna sponsor
all expenses for Thailand?

170
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:11,657
That's what I thought, too.

171
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:15,828
But because the team hasn't won
a championship in four years,

172
00:11:17,006 --> 00:11:20,006
the volleyball camp isn't their priority.

173
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:23,250
Fuck that!

174
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,571
Are you still gonna go?

175
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,688
Of course, coach!

176
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,688
Okay, good. I'll confirm
with them now, all right?

177
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:34,927
No backing out. Good luck.

178
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:52,605
That's the thing, Mrs. Holly.

179
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:55,271
I think I'm falling in love with someone

180
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:58,063
who I think has no interest in me.

181
00:11:58,794 --> 00:12:02,003
What makes you say that?

182
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:05,230
She said so.
That I should never fall for her.

183
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,671
Have you tried distancing yourself?

184
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:17,230
Because as long as you keep seeing her,
you'll remember how much you like her.

185
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,188
But Mrs. Holly, what if…

186
00:12:21,855 --> 00:12:22,914
If what?

187
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:24,713
I can't get enough of her.

188
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:32,047
Well, you need to realize that libido
is different from love.

189
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:34,713
And if you manage to separate those two,

190
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,046
you can enjoy her company
without expecting love in return.

191
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:44,088
If I make an effort,
I still won't have a chance with her?

192
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:47,463
I'm sure you do.

193
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:50,921
But if she was clear about her boundaries,

194
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:55,129
it's like going to war
knowing you'll get shot.

195
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:58,338
And if she finds someone to love,

196
00:12:58,975 --> 00:13:01,379
you'll be devastated with thoughts like

197
00:13:01,976 --> 00:13:07,734
"Why didn't she pick me?",
"Why couldn't she love me instead?"

198
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:11,354
That's deep, Mrs. Holly.

199
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:14,456
But thanks, I'll think about that.

200
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:18,735
My room is always open.

201
00:13:19,336 --> 00:13:21,242
See? It's literally open.

202
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,023
- Sorry, I forgot to lock the door.
- That's okay, Mrs. Holly.

203
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:25,746
I'll get going.

204
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:26,859
Hi.

205
00:13:28,477 --> 00:13:30,905
What's the matter with you, Brian?
You know I was talking to Kate.

206
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,313
You could have knocked.

207
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:34,105
Sorry but this is urgent.

208
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,254
I have good news and bad news.

209
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:38,008
Sawadee ka?

210
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:39,698
How did you know?

211
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:44,063
Mr. Ragos told me
because the principal told him

212
00:13:44,094 --> 00:13:46,413
and coach told the principal.

213
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:49,938
Wow, news travels fast here at Vanguard.

214
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:51,688
So I'm the last one to know?

215
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:53,046
Look, Brian.

216
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,813
I know you really want this.

217
00:13:56,016 --> 00:13:58,088
And I want you to do this, too.

218
00:13:58,363 --> 00:13:59,613
But…

219
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,021
But we can't afford it.

220
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:06,129
Our assets are still on
hold awaiting court decision.

221
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:10,754
I'm also just relying on the allowance
the school provides me.

222
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:14,438
Don't worry, Ma. I understand.

223
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:19,463
Have you tried talking to your father?

224
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:23,133
Nevermind. I understand.

225
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:25,742
I'm off to class.

226
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:46,296
It took you forever to get here.

227
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:48,796
If I was in a real accident,

228
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:50,865
you'd have found me as a corpse.

229
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,159
Sorry, frenny. You know I
have lots of prior commitments.

230
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:56,526
Right.

231
00:14:56,551 --> 00:14:59,634
Prior commitments without commitment.

232
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,230
I'm surprised your fuck
buddies are fine with your set-up.

233
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:05,521
Fuck buddies?

234
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,660
The girls and boys you hook up with,
no strings attached.

235
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:15,855
They have names, you know.

236
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:20,325
I don't care about them!
Anyway, back to me.

237
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:23,980
Help me, frenny.

238
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:25,833
It's about Bullet.

239
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:27,355
What happened?

240
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:29,919
He agreed to have sex.

241
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,546
He brought me to the stock room to do it.

242
00:15:33,403 --> 00:15:34,737
Yikes! Dusty!

243
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,129
That's not the point.

244
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:41,018
The point is…

245
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:43,771
his cock is monstrous!

246
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:44,942
I'm scared!

247
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:47,188
Cock is so explicit!

248
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:51,794
Cock! Penis! Sausage!

249
00:15:52,022 --> 00:15:53,216
Whatever.

250
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:55,544
I don't think I'd fit it in.

251
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:57,687
Wait, how big are we talking?

252
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:00,671
Can you imagine?

253
00:16:01,188 --> 00:16:05,796
Like a bulldog squeezing into a mouse hole?

254
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,671
I want to experience sexual paradise.

255
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:12,230
But not that way!

256
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:13,985
I still wanna live!

257
00:16:14,856 --> 00:16:16,913
Okay, okay, okay. I gotchu.

258
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,800
You need some practice.

259
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:20,602
Start small.

260
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,580
Who do you recommend?
You know I'm very picky.

261
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:28,605
Not who, but…

262
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,146
What?

263
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:39,375
Here.

264
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:41,980
See how you feel.

265
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:44,508
Allaine, is that yours?

266
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:46,254
Did you wash it?

267
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:48,794
Save it. Of course I did.

268
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:50,046
Here, hold it.

269
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:52,088
What am I supposed to do with this?

270
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:54,035
Put it in!

271
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:55,646
Let me do it!

272
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,641
Move your leg.

273
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:00,688
Are you ready?

274
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:02,839
Okay.

275
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:05,096
Let me through.

276
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:07,156
Move your legs!

277
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,088
Make it wider.

278
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:13,641
Don't shove it!

279
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,438
I can't put it in. Can you stop moving?

280
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:28,129
That's it. See how it feels.

281
00:17:32,523 --> 00:17:34,213
You haven't even climaxed.

282
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:36,972
One more.

283
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:40,630
Want something more intense?

284
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:12,963
Ah, sir, sorry for being late.

285
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:17,117
No worries. Take your
seat. As I was saying…

286
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,313
Gee?

287
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:26,963
Would you like to stand up
and tell us what's so funny?

288
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:30,896
Sorry, sir. I just remembered something.

289
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:33,958
Okay.

290
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:36,688
So, can I continue?

291
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:41,021
The festival of arts is next week.

292
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,910
And you the most-awaited
part of the festival…

293
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:47,805
The grand parade!

294
00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:52,011
Kate. Kate!

295
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:54,161
You know what this is?

296
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:57,628
Remote for the projector?

297
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,813
This year, our theme will be…

298
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:02,129
I don't know what it does.

299
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:05,171
Parade of nations.

300
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:07,675
Give me that.

301
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,261
Good vibes, huh?

302
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:24,859
I will divide this class into pairs and
each pair will represent each country.

303
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,896
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir. Super!

304
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:30,046
So let's get on with the groupings.

305
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:33,885
I'll call on each row.
First row goes first.

306
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:35,730
You may come get your teams.

307
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,481
Go, girl!

308
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:47,271
Excuse me.

309
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:50,175
You wish!

310
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,075
You wish!

311
00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:11,154
Who did you get?

312
00:20:11,872 --> 00:20:13,278
Secret.

313
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:26,464
Japan?

314
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:30,433
We're partners.

315
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,249
I already have an idea for our costumes.

316
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:35,689
Listen, frenny. I love you,

317
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:37,963
but I wish I got Bullet.

318
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:39,912
You can't shut up about him.

319
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,504
USA.

320
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:47,963
I swear to God, why does
she keep stealing what I want.

321
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:51,451
You say you want him but you ran off.

322
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,938
Let me remind you, my coochie
isn't an open house party like yours.

323
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:01,171
Tajikistan.

324
00:21:06,355 --> 00:21:08,271
Sir? Sir?

325
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:11,591
Sir, can I choose a country
that's easier to spell?

326
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,028
Hays, this gay is so stupid.

327
00:21:15,823 --> 00:21:17,281
South Korea.

328
00:21:18,114 --> 00:21:19,198
Oh my God!

329
00:21:19,315 --> 00:21:21,273
I wanna exchange with her!

330
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:25,046
Who wants to change partners?

331
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:28,376
If you're jealous, close your eyes.

332
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:30,442
Hi, baby!

333
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:34,121
Last.

334
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,836
Netherlands!

335
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,646
- Sir, I don't have a partner?
- Sir! Sir, me!

336
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:43,313
Since only Brian's left
and Amber is absent,

337
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,330
- you'll be partners.
- Amber?

338
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:46,942
Coordinate with her, okay?

339
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:53,188
All right, since we're doing Japan,

340
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:55,338
let's just go for anime cosplay.

341
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:57,847
Sure. Sure, Allaine.

342
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,794
That's your forte.
You're good at those things.

343
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:02,831
I'm fine with anything, go.

344
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:06,646
Wow, dude. So much for team effort!

345
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:10,101
You know what we should focus on?

346
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:12,367
Bullet.

347
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,005
I swear you're obsessed with him.

348
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:18,433
If I don't get Bullet away from Joanna,

349
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,754
my resentment towards
her will just keep growing.

350
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,425
Even though she hasn't
done anything wrong.

351
00:22:25,063 --> 00:22:26,349
Sure, frenny.

352
00:22:26,688 --> 00:22:29,713
We'll resume your
coochie workshop tomorrow.

353
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,102
Come on.

354
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:35,413
- Paco!
- Yeah?

355
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:37,721
Wanna do an immersion for our country

356
00:22:37,746 --> 00:22:40,296
so we can feel its vibes more?

357
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:41,827
Immersion?

358
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:48,761
I mean, we could have samgyupsal
and discuss our plans for the parade there.

359
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:51,060
I don't think we have to do that, Erica.

360
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:52,800
Besides, doesn't your foot hurt?

361
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:54,940
- Huh?
- I mean…

362
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:58,480
No, no, it's fine now!

363
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,105
Did you get turned off after our date?

364
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,435
No, that's not it.

365
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:04,950
You were turned off, huh?

366
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:06,735
- Sorry, Paco.
- No, I wasn't.

367
00:23:06,735 --> 00:23:08,560
I'm really sorry about that.

368
00:23:08,585 --> 00:23:10,377
It didn't turn me off, promise.

369
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:14,226
So… you're willing to go on another date?

370
00:23:14,735 --> 00:23:17,610
Of course, just not this week.

371
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:19,301
Next week, then?

372
00:23:19,693 --> 00:23:20,693
Yeah, sure!

373
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:21,776
Yes!

374
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,224
- Thank you!
- I'll go ahead.

375
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:24,541
- Bye!
- Bye.

376
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:27,671
Bye.

377
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,688
There,

378
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:36,088
I gave you what you wanted.

379
00:23:36,813 --> 00:23:38,201
South Korea.

380
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:40,817
Paco.

381
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,463
Thanks, sir.

382
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:45,088
You're welcome.

383
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:04,711
Hey…

384
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:07,817
I have a costume as statue of liberty.

385
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:10,629
Okay.

386
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:14,805
What about you? What are you gonna wear?

387
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:18,279
I'll take care of it!

388
00:24:19,783 --> 00:24:21,033
Okay.

389
00:24:26,438 --> 00:24:30,629
Amber. Have you heard that
we'll be partners for the parade?

390
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:34,838
Mm-hm. And I already know what
we're gonna wear for Netherlands.

391
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:38,987
But I need your opinion on it first.

392
00:24:39,012 --> 00:24:40,345
And your input.

393
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,379
I don't want you to think I'm imposing.

394
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,360
Can we talk about it later?

395
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,338
There's just something
important I need to do.

396
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:48,356
Wow .

397
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:52,029
After you use the community for clout,

398
00:24:52,054 --> 00:24:53,943
you're back to being your old self.

399
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:55,435
A bit of user, aren't you?

400
00:24:55,642 --> 00:24:59,278
Amber, please. Can you not? Not right now.

401
00:24:59,357 --> 00:25:00,774
This is serious.

402
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:06,521
Okay. Just go to the org room
when you're ready to cooperate.

403
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:08,860
But remember, you'd
better have calmed down...

404
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,213
because I don't wanna deal with
someone with an attitude problem.

405
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:24,614
Hello, Dad? Did you get my text?

406
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:27,052
About the volleyball camp.

407
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:30,052
What are you gonna get out of playing that?

408
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,100
It's a sport for gays.
Play basketball instead!

409
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,692
But Dad, I'm gay. You know that!

410
00:25:36,717 --> 00:25:39,958
Shit. I don't want to hear it.

411
00:25:40,684 --> 00:25:41,941
Goddamit!

412
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:45,672
Besides, volleyball isn't just for gays.

413
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:51,576
Whatever, just quit it. I'll give
you the money but stop being gay.

414
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,372
You know what, nevermind.

415
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:56,935
If you don't wanna help me,
I'll raise the money myself.

416
00:26:04,318 --> 00:26:07,963

417
00:26:19,126 --> 00:26:20,213
There we go.

418
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,505
@OVALTINDERELLA: Give me some, papi.

419
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:26,482
After you, Ms. Joyce.

420
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,401
Good day, everyone.

421
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:31,360
Busy! I'll just get some hot water.

422
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Principal! Why are you
refilling your cup in here?

423
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,360
They haven't changed my water dispenser.

424
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:38,406
- Ah, okay.
- It takes forever to heat up.

425
00:26:39,513 --> 00:26:43,346
Sir, I heard the kids are
excited about the parade.

426
00:26:43,371 --> 00:26:45,278
Congrats on the new project!

427
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,345
Thank you, sir.

428
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,912
I'm just indulging the
students with what they want.

429
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:53,833
If it becomes a success, I'm sure
they'll make you principal.

430
00:26:53,858 --> 00:26:58,608
I don't know about that, sir.
I've got a long road ahead of me yet.

431
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:01,217
Isn't that right, principal Corny?

432
00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:03,492
Sort of!

433
00:27:03,606 --> 00:27:06,318
Listen, just follow my lead.

434
00:27:06,318 --> 00:27:09,489
Last year, I spearheaded the parade and

435
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,841
look where it got me.

436
00:27:13,122 --> 00:27:14,262
Yes, sir!

437
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:18,028
I'm just following in your footsteps

438
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:22,129
so I can avoid hiccups.

439
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,296
Just like last year.

440
00:27:24,371 --> 00:27:25,495
Yes.

441
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:28,263
Wait a minute.

442
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:34,294
What do you mean by "hiccups"?

443
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:40,758
Wasn’t there a fist fight last year?

444
00:27:40,783 --> 00:27:46,463
And when the police arrived, they caught
someone doing meth in the computer lab.

445
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:49,251
Huh. You are correct.

446
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:50,754
But not quite.

447
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:53,588
Actually, it wasn't meth.

448
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:56,547
Cocaine.

449
00:27:57,664 --> 00:28:01,330
Anyway, I will leave you to your business.

450
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:06,230
I will go back to my office.
If you need anything, just knock.

451
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,512
Yes.

452
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,693
So it was cocaine.

453
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:12,907
Cocaine? I didn't know.

454
00:28:12,932 --> 00:28:13,985
Frenny,

455
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,393
go over it again.

456
00:28:16,734 --> 00:28:19,463
My brain's bleeding
from all that information.

457
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:21,379
Come on, Gee.

458
00:28:21,946 --> 00:28:26,029
Do you want to impress Bullet
and blow his mind or what?

459
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:27,790
Of course!

460
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:29,977
Then focus.

461
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:34,589
Okay. First step, foreplay.

462
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:41,536
Tease him. Soft kisses on
his ear, cheeks, down his neck,

463
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:44,811
on the side of his lips,
but not on the lips.

464
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:47,378
Make your way down his chest, then

465
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:52,408
then first base. Kiss him
on the lips. Slow and deep.

466
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:54,807
Once you feel his hands caress you,

467
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:58,430
return the favor. Touch his tender parts.

468
00:28:58,455 --> 00:29:00,854
That's second base.

469
00:29:01,424 --> 00:29:03,252
If you wanna take things slow,

470
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:05,339
then go for third base.

471
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:09,041
But I suggest, covering first
and second base is enough.

472
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:10,846
You may proceed. Go all in.

473
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:14,511
If he's up for a cuddle, indulge him.

474
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:16,452
But don't attach any meaning to it.

475
00:29:16,477 --> 00:29:19,144
Some people just need a good hug.

476
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:22,091
I could teach you the different positions--

477
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:23,955
Like helicopter.

478
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:26,236
But let's save it for next time.

479
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:28,746
Helicopter?

480
00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:30,629
What about a fighter jet?

481
00:29:31,365 --> 00:29:32,466
You know what,

482
00:29:33,374 --> 00:29:36,521
just go with the flow and enjoy.

483
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,088
Don't overthink it.
Just follow the rabbit.

484
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:58,039
Oh, great.
You've finally decided to join me.

485
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:00,142
What can I offer you?

486
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:04,462
Water, coffee, tea, massage, or me?

487
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,196
Amber, can we just focus?

488
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:08,546
I'm not in a good mood.

489
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:09,796
You're so mean!

490
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:17,835
Look, I have a once in a lifetime chance
to join a volleyball camp in Thailand.

491
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:20,921
Sawadee ka to you then.

492
00:30:21,428 --> 00:30:22,553
Stop it!

493
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:28,050
If I manage to go, I could be scouted.

494
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:33,713
But nobody wants to support me.
Not this school, not my parents.

495
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,336
Okay, so what do you want me to do?

496
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:40,528
Want me to support you? Okay.

497
00:30:40,553 --> 00:30:43,171
I'll pray to St. Jude for you!

498
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:47,294
Can we just get this over with?

499
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,071
Okay, fine.

500
00:30:49,096 --> 00:30:50,713
So, this is what I want to wear.

501
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:52,746
This is our costume.

502
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:55,713
Wedding gown? What's that
got to do with Netherlands?

503
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:58,671
You know what, it's very obvious

504
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:05,529
that you have no idea about
your LGBTQIA++ history.

505
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:10,796
Netherlands is the first country
to legalize same sex marriage.

506
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:12,879
That's why we're doing this.

507
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:17,546
Marijuana's legal in the Netherlands, too.

508
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,667
Why don't we just put on weed costumes?

509
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:24,192
Or better yet, smoke weed at the parade.

510
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,526
Nice idea. You can do
that yourself, I don't care.

511
00:31:27,526 --> 00:31:30,588
Because I've decided.
This is what I'm gonna wear.

512
00:31:33,076 --> 00:31:35,243
I feel like you just
wanna get married to me.

513
00:31:36,273 --> 00:31:37,963
Wow. You're full of yourself.

514
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,171
Think you're hot shit?

515
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:41,364
Handsome.

516
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:42,921
You wish!

517
00:31:47,218 --> 00:31:49,051
Fine, fine. I'll think about it.

518
00:31:50,747 --> 00:31:54,004
Listen, all I'm doing is

519
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,440
looking out for you.

520
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:57,693
You and your followers.

521
00:31:57,693 --> 00:32:01,776
You wouldn't want them to think
you have internal homophobia.

522
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:06,898
And when that happens,
you'll lose followers.

523
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:08,824
- Your call.
- All right, all right.

524
00:32:08,912 --> 00:32:11,621
Fine, we're getting married.

525
00:32:12,483 --> 00:32:13,837
This is a freaking set-up.

526
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:15,655
No, this is not a set-up.

527
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:19,508
This is the universe speaking. Okay?

528
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:21,904
This is you.

529
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:28,780
There, you can see it clearly.
That's gonna be us.

530
00:32:30,397 --> 00:32:32,952
-Sis, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- Where?

531
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:35,215
Over there. Cleopatro.

532
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:40,860
Bullet looks like he's
going ballroom dancing.

533
00:32:40,885 --> 00:32:42,110
Are those tassels?

534
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,014
Where's that witch Erica?

535
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:45,610
- What's taking her so long?
- I've been waiting for her since this morning.

536
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,276
Speak of the devil!

537
00:32:47,276 --> 00:32:48,735
Don't tease me, you guys.

538
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:51,735
Go Korea! Go, go, Korea!

539
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,610
Go!

540
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,831
Wipe those smiles off your faces!

541
00:32:54,943 --> 00:32:57,367
You went all out with
the cart and everything!

542
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,801
You're really
going for the prize.

543
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:01,422
- That's true. Look at you.
- Of course!

544
00:33:03,602 --> 00:33:04,611
Yes!

545
00:33:04,636 --> 00:33:07,751
Can we have some snacks?
Do you have fish cakes?

546
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:09,985
Those are just props, silly goose!

547
00:33:09,985 --> 00:33:11,692
- Are those lettuce fresh?
- Hey.

548
00:33:11,717 --> 00:33:13,574
This one's fresh.

549
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:15,308
Hey, president, listen to me.

550
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:19,000
This. This whole thing seems
like a lot of effort for Paco.

551
00:33:19,025 --> 00:33:21,129
Remember, we're all Coinies here.

552
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:23,947
- Wow…
- We should be acting as a group!

553
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:27,224
- As one!
- Girl, could you let me have him?

554
00:33:27,324 --> 00:33:30,584
I'm sure you'll find
somebody else for you.

555
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:33,401
She's right, bestie.
We'll find someone else.

556
00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:36,593
Hey, you, Milo, are you
working on someone right now?

557
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:38,773
Actually, there's one guy.

558
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:41,798
I found him on alter.

559
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:43,864
Go for it! Go!

560
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:47,026
- Hey, quit that shit, you hear me?
- But yeah, I need to shell out for him.

561
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:50,193
Stay away from the ones that make you pay!
You're just getting yourself in trouble.

562
00:33:50,193 --> 00:33:51,955
- Am I right?
- You said it.

563
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,234
Okay, but I'm positive

564
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:56,467
he's a student here at Vanguard.

565
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:59,252
- Huh? Who's your guess?
- Yes! Come here.

566
00:34:02,031 --> 00:34:03,156
Huh? For real?

567
00:34:03,181 --> 00:34:05,165
Are you serious?

568
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:06,585
I'm not convinced.

569
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,651
I'm telling you!

570
00:34:07,651 --> 00:34:09,651
You gotta be kidding.

571
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:11,593
Where the heck is Paco?

572
00:34:13,247 --> 00:34:14,575
Wait. Just wait.

573
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:19,590
Sometimes I wonder
if we're really friends.

574
00:34:20,043 --> 00:34:24,126
Why do you get to be a
sexy penguin and I get lion?

575
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,340
Come on, you're a
powerful character in animes.

576
00:34:29,425 --> 00:34:32,395
I don't care if I'm a powerful character.

577
00:34:32,424 --> 00:34:34,036
I look like I belong in a zoo.

578
00:34:34,224 --> 00:34:36,390
That's what you get
for leaving it up to me.

579
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:41,976
Wait here. I gotta pee.

580
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,546
Good luck, Mr. Ragos.

581
00:35:02,864 --> 00:35:05,129
Where are all the participants?

582
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,754
Where's the rest of the class?

583
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,254
Go with your partners!

584
00:35:10,835 --> 00:35:13,168
We'll be starting any minute now.

585
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,079
Go!

586
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:28,522
I hope this parade is more
successful compared to last year.

587
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,088
What do you think?

588
00:35:34,647 --> 00:35:35,879
Looks good.

589
00:35:37,656 --> 00:35:38,713
Just good?

590
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:41,004
Come on, be honest.

591
00:35:41,621 --> 00:35:43,213
Better than I expected.

592
00:35:43,636 --> 00:35:46,261
You're so hard to please.

593
00:35:47,442 --> 00:35:49,546
Okay, fine. We look amazing.

594
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:52,338
Look, sorry for judging you.

595
00:35:52,808 --> 00:35:55,796
I was wrong and I should
have trusted you more.

596
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,796
Okay, thank you. I appreciate that.

597
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:01,171
Let's take a picture first.

598
00:36:24,204 --> 00:36:25,838
- See if you like it.
- Okay.

599
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:35,046
Let's go?

600
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,546
Let's go, Ambro.

601
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:41,332
You're that fucking scammer?

602
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,754
Do you know how many followers you cost me?

603
00:36:44,014 --> 00:36:46,389
Is it my fault you're an asshole?

604
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,662
Is it my fault you're a liar?

605
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:52,350
Why, will you ever hook
up with a femme like me?

606
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,357
You said nobody would ever go near me.

607
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:57,463
I had to hide myself so
people would notice me.

608
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,718
Why don't you respect my preference?

609
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:06,463
You know you liked me before
you found out I was femme.

610
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:09,504
I'm not in the mood for this.

611
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:12,129
I thought you were nice, you fucking bitch.

612
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:19,024
Let me do that for you.

613
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:20,174
Thank you.

614
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,713
I didn't know you liked cosplaying

615
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:36,796
Joanna? What are you doing?

616
00:37:43,412 --> 00:37:44,713
Can you hurry up?

617
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:50,818
Oh, it's Brian.
Brian!

618
00:38:50,818 --> 00:38:52,560
Brian, can I take a selfie?

619
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:54,835
- Get away from me!
- Hey!

620
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,610
You're disgusting! All of you!

621
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,547
What did you do to my friend, you asshole?

622
00:38:58,758 --> 00:38:59,925
It's okay.

623
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,694
- Are you hurt?
- Just stay away from me!

624
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:03,348
It's okay. I'm sorry.

625
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:06,282
What the hell!

626
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:47,601
One more!

627
00:40:22,568 --> 00:40:23,604
One more time!

628
00:41:07,794 --> 00:41:09,961
I think we can start the parade.

629
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:14,153
For those who's still missing
their partners, text them to catch up.

630
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:15,860
Brian Ricafort, porn peddler!

631
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,235
What's that, San Andres?

632
00:41:19,303 --> 00:41:21,136
Look at you, gorgeous!

633
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:23,336
- Fuck you!
- Brian!

634
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:24,568
Brian!

635
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:25,628
Stop it!

636
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,985
Sir, sir! Shouldn't we call security?

637
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:31,985
No, no, no! Let the kids sort it out.

638
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,959
You know what I mean?
It's not gonna kill them.

639
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:37,267
Are you okay? Oh my God!

640
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,083
That landed horribly!

641
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:42,523
Let me see.
