1
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:14,465
Brian.

2
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,865
Fuck you, Paco!

3
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:19,177
Did it really have to be my mom?

4
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:23,311
- You motherfucker!
- Brian!

5
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:24,878
Brian, I know what I did was wrong!

6
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:28,407
Didn't stop you from doing it, though!

7
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:29,574
Brian, calm down!

8
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,364
Come on! Cut it out!

9
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,674
- Stop it, Brian!
- How long has this been going on?

10
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:34,825
How many times?

11
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,177
You know what?

12
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,202
No, no, no! Brian!

13
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:38,394
Don't answer.

14
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,424
Brian. I'm older and
should know better.

15
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:44,074
I should have stayed away.

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,870
Mom, shut up!

17
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:49,909
I don't wanna talk to you right now!

18
00:00:51,144 --> 00:00:52,169
Bro,

19
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:55,653
you know about my worries.

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,782
Brian, calm down!

21
00:00:56,782 --> 00:00:59,199
My dad cheated on my mom!

22
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,610
Now you're doing the same thing to me?

23
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:04,183
And you're screwing my mom at that?

24
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,497
Sorry, Brian! I messed up!

25
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,469
Go on! Beat me up!

26
00:01:08,683 --> 00:01:09,933
I want you to feel good!

27
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:13,500
Brian! Brian!

28
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:37,616
I'll be on my way, Pastora.

29
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:38,692
Joanna.

30
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:43,972
I welcomed you into my
house wholeheartedly--

31
00:01:43,997 --> 00:01:47,074
Like you were my own
daughter, as Joanna's sister--

32
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:49,028
And this is how you repay my kindness?

33
00:01:49,704 --> 00:01:52,787
Why do you teenagers
always rush into things!

34
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,856
I'm sorry, ma'am.

35
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,750
Ma.

36
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:17,547
Can I explain?

37
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:19,887
Explain?

38
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:23,090
I can't even describe what I saw.

39
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:24,990
I don't understand how I feel.

40
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,924
What got into your head?

41
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:28,649
I know you're disappointed, Ma.

42
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:31,799
Disappointed? I am not
disappointed, Joanna.

43
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,675
I am mad! I am furious!

44
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,190
I am indifferent!

45
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:37,715
But Ma, that was me.

46
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,755
You? That was you?

47
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,192
You're a dyke!

48
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:45,574
- Dyke isn't politically correct, Ma.
- What do you want me to call you?

49
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,390
A lesbian?

50
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:48,974
I don't know, Ma!

51
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,782
All I know is I like Allaine.

52
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:54,407
Yes. That Allaine. She's the lesbian!

53
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:55,609
Gender fluid.

54
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:59,660
This fucking girl-- Lord, I'm sorry, Lord!

55
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:03,615
You see? You've put the devil in my mouth!

56
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,239
Lord, I am sorry!

57
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:10,632
Please grant me the serenity to
accept the things that I cannot change,

58
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,699
the courage to accept it and to do it.

59
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:19,574
Lord God, please knock on
my mother's big heart so that

60
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:24,597
she may understand and accept me as I am
as you do with all your children.

61
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:30,583
Go pray in your room! You're
encroaching on my time slot with God!

62
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:36,372
Lord, God in heaven, again,

63
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:39,091
forgive me.

64
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:42,091
And my daughter.

65
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:44,907
Lord, please.

66
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:47,449
Brian.

67
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:51,284
You still haven't listened to my side.

68
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,128
You said you would listen to my troubles.

69
00:04:58,224 --> 00:04:59,511
Seriously, mom?

70
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:07,058
After you hid and lied to me
about having sex with my friend?

71
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:13,240
I know that what I did was wrong, son.

72
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:16,240
And I'm not trying to justify my actions.

73
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:18,682
I only need you to
understand why I did it.

74
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,449
Where I'm coming from.

75
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:26,620
That's justifying it.

76
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:32,096
What I mean is,

77
00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:36,388
go ahead and be disgusted by me,

78
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:38,667
get angry with me--

79
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:43,449
But I want you to understand
how it happened that way.

80
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,990
When I first sat down with Paco,

81
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:49,964
I admit, I was tempted.

82
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:54,753
I was feeling so lonely--

83
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:59,081
Probably from my
separation with your father--

84
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,106
Or because I was
stressed over our finances…

85
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:10,669
Somehow, I was flattered
somebody looked at me that way.

86
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,940
But Ma, with a student?

87
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:20,440
Even if Paco's at a legal age,
that doesn't make it right.

88
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:24,425
That's why Paco and
I have decided to stop.

89
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:28,605
What you saw, that was our last session.

90
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,847
How convenient.

91
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,159
It's true.

92
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:38,016
What hurts me the most,

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,083
is knowing you don't trust me.

94
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,820
I wish--

95
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,836
I wish you had told me the
first time you were tempted.

96
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:57,734
Then I could have helped
take your mind off of it.

97
00:06:58,022 --> 00:07:00,522
I don't know how to answer that, son.

98
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,355
But it's over, okay?

99
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
It's done.

100
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:11,938
Please forgive me. I'm so sorry.

101
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:33,128
Hey, Ma. How are you?

102
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:35,772
I'm good. Where are you?

103
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,246
Out. Looking for a ride.

104
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:39,717
Are you home yet?

105
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:42,980
Yes, and can
you guess who's with me?

106
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:45,023
Hi, dearie!

107
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:48,071
Was that Dad? What's he doing there?

108
00:07:48,647 --> 00:07:52,397
Your mom and I got
back together! Isn't that good?

109
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:57,194
Are you serious? Do you
think relationships are a joke?

110
00:07:57,522 --> 00:07:59,040
You fight, you get back together,

111
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,406
all the yelling and separating,
what's the matter with you?

112
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:04,188
You're so selfish!

113
00:08:04,188 --> 00:08:06,313
And I'm the one who's
got to deal with all of it!

114
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:11,397
Allaine, come home.
Then we'll talk.

115
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,417
You should be my role models, Ma! Pa!

116
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:17,253
But why do you seem more immature than me?

117
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:26,980
Allaine, what's up?

118
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,335
Can I stay at your place?

119
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,735
Nope. Sorry.

120
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:33,063
Come on, please! It's just one night.

121
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:35,094
I have guests. Bye.

122
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,344
Okay! Question number 1.

123
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:54,438
What is the state of nature of
a man according to Hobbes?

124
00:08:54,852 --> 00:09:02,773
The state of nature is characterized by the
"war of every man against every man--"

125
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:03,987
Finish the sentence!

126
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,230
Solitary, poor… go on.

127
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:14,188
Nasty… brutish...

128
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:18,753
and short.

129
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:21,068
Okay. Correct.

130
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:25,945
Bubu, you're amazing!

131
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:29,397
For sure you'll get a
perfect score on the essay.

132
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,855
"Bubu"? Is that short for 'bobo' ?

133
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:35,647
No, silly.

134
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:37,813
It's short for 'Bullet'.

135
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:41,898
Don't you like it?

136
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,313
I do. Want another round?

137
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:49,053
Okay. Another set of questions.

138
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:53,897
What! Really?

139
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:05,297
What's the title of the book Marx wrote?

140
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:10,261
Daks Kapital!

141
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,484
Das, not Daks.

142
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:32,980
Erica! Erica!

143
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,755
Erica! I missed you!

144
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:37,690
I'm so happy you're back.

145
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,897
Paco, let's go somewhere private.

146
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:45,647
I hope you read my letter.

147
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:47,563
- Pac--
- Look, I'm really sorry.

148
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,855
Paco, please. I need you to listen to me.

149
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:51,958
Okay. Sorry, sorry.

150
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:54,980
S-someone harassed me.

151
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,059
Huh?

152
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:57,222
Who?

153
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:00,018
Mr. Ragos.

154
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:19,730
She's not in there.

155
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:21,813
Are you trying to score another basket?

156
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,500
Next time you'll be
showing up at our house.

157
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:27,022
Look, bro. I don't want any trouble.

158
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:30,397
You should've thought of that before
you decided my mom's fair game.

159
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,188
I already apologized, bro.
That's from the heart.

160
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:36,688
And if you can't accept my sorry,

161
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:38,338
I can't force you.

162
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,230
Then why are you here?

163
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:43,830
I need Holly's advice.

164
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:46,022
Or anyone who might be able to help me.

165
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:47,355
Try me.

166
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:48,871
What?

167
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:53,205
Try me. I'm the friend you should
have been talking to from the start.

168
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,480
Not my mom.

169
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:57,688
Okay. I trust you--

170
00:11:57,772 --> 00:11:59,563
You're my buddy.

171
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:01,008
Shoot.

172
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,240
Bro, Erica was harassed by a teacher.

173
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:07,959
And I want to help her but--

174
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:09,484
I don't know what to do.

175
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,522
We should talk to the principal.

176
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:14,105
It's the principal who did it.

177
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Fuck!

178
00:12:15,855 --> 00:12:18,230
Then let's talk to the other principal.

179
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:29,563
Why did you block me from the group chat?

180
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:31,607
I can't find our group chat anymore.

181
00:12:33,272 --> 00:12:36,147
We didn't block you.

182
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,813
We kicked you out.

183
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:38,938
Why?

184
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:41,605
A group decision.

185
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,563
Hey. What's up?

186
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:19,355
Can I stay at your place?

187
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:20,588
Nope. Sorry.

188
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,580
Come on.
Please! It's just one night.

189
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:24,488
I have guests. Bye.

190
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,951
Why don't we kick
Allaine off the group chat?

191
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:33,434
True. She thinks she's
the center of attention.

192
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,938
Sure. I agree.

193
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:38,870
You're our queen tonight.

194
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,151
Allaine's old news.

195
00:13:42,277 --> 00:13:44,069
She's not gonna like it.

196
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,622
How could you?

197
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:54,813
I created that group chat!

198
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:57,063
But you were gone for a while.

199
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:02,159
Ever since Joanna showed up in your life,

200
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:04,255
you just left us hanging.

201
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:08,747
Look, this is for your own good.

202
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,272
What makes you say that?

203
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:14,772
I know you're in love with Joanna--

204
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:17,070
But no matter how much you like her,

205
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,263
I know you won't take her seriously
as long as you have a fallback.

206
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,037
Fallback?

207
00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:24,461
What are you talking about?

208
00:14:25,162 --> 00:14:28,080
You won't put in the effort to work Joanna

209
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:30,397
because you know you'll always have us.

210
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:33,615
I want to believe you

211
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:36,063
but Joanna's not the problem.

212
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:39,938
It's her mom! She thinks
I'm Satan's little helper.

213
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:42,147
She'll never let me near Joanna again!

214
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:45,017
Oh come on, Allaine!

215
00:14:45,522 --> 00:14:46,522
See?

216
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:48,708
You've already given up on her.

217
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:50,480
Because you know you're attractive.

218
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:53,045
You'll find someone new easy.

219
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,397
Make an effort. If you want her,
do something about it.

220
00:15:06,954 --> 00:15:09,038
Justine Joanna Mallari!

221
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:11,730
I'll show you how much
you've made me so upset

222
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,730
because of what you did
until we reach your classroom!

223
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,154
Is that clear? Huh?

224
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:18,357
- This is so embarrassing.
- What's so embarrassing?

225
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:22,147
If you hadn't broken my trust, I'd be
enjoying a cup of coffee at home right now!

226
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:24,063
You don't have to do this, Ma.

227
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:25,647
What do you mean?

228
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:28,272
- What's that harlot's name?
- Allaine, Ma.

229
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:30,397
Allaine. You'd better
stay away from her, got it?

230
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,022
But Ma, we're classmates!

231
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:34,897
Then tomorrow you'll be in section C!
I'll have you transferred from section A!

232
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,171
Joanna!

233
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,334
I love you!

234
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:40,938
Faco!

235
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:42,897
Faco!

236
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:45,997
- It's Paco.
- Faco!

237
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:47,669
What brings you here, ma'am?

238
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:51,324
Have you got your semen under control?

239
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:53,313
Ma'am? What kind of question is that?

240
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,825
You know, dude!

241
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,997
I'll see you later, okay? Let's
have dinner. You, me, and Joanna.

242
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:03,272
I'll text you the details!

243
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:05,522
Shouldn't that be Joanna's decision?

244
00:16:05,522 --> 00:16:08,022
No way. She's been making
terrible decisions lately

245
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:09,813
so I'm taking control of everything.

246
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:12,480
So 6 p.m. tonight?

247
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:15,836
Yes?

248
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,076
Okay, ma'am.

249
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:19,647
God bless.

250
00:16:21,076 --> 00:16:23,784
Hide me, please!
I can't be seen by Pastora!

251
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,230
Don't tell me--

252
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,966
I'll tell you later.

253
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,342
Good morning class.

254
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,430
Good morning, sir.

255
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,263
I just want to say
goodbye to you formally--

256
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:40,022
Because this is my last
day as your professor.

257
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:44,605
Starting next week,

258
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,730
I will be your principal!

259
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:50,412
Congrats, sir!

260
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:57,344
Our principal is so hot!

261
00:16:58,522 --> 00:17:00,818
As your former student affairs admin,

262
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,188
I know all about your needs.

263
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,397
So if you have any concerns,
just let me know.

264
00:17:06,397 --> 00:17:08,037
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

265
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:14,456
Sir, what if my immediate concern
is to have a baby with you?

266
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:16,938
Calm down.

267
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:19,938
Hey.

268
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,522
Erica. Are you okay?

269
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:24,188
Yes, sir.

270
00:17:24,213 --> 00:17:25,688
You missed a lot of classes.

271
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:28,459
Please come to my office so we can

272
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:32,333
talk about your absences and see
what the school can do to help you.

273
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:33,412
Okay?

274
00:17:35,699 --> 00:17:37,282
Let's go. Come with me.

275
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:53,734
Excuse me. Is Amber here?

276
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,480
Nope.

277
00:17:56,438 --> 00:17:59,563
Okay, can you tell her I
dropped by? Thank you.

278
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:02,647
Wait, wait, wait. I'll cut to the chase.

279
00:18:02,938 --> 00:18:04,647
Can you stop bothering Amber?

280
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:07,980
My friend's pulling her hair
out when it comes to you.

281
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,147
Of course, Amber deserves better.

282
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:12,672
What are you saying?

283
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:14,188
Oh, come on.

284
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:16,397
We know you're just leading her on.

285
00:18:16,397 --> 00:18:19,730
You say you like her
but you can't own up to it

286
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,605
and you can't even accept
her completely as she is.

287
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:26,636
Look, I know I did a lot of things wrong
and I have more to learn--

288
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,583
But I do like Amber.

289
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,774
Believe me.

290
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:32,063
I want to make it up to her.

291
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:34,794
And if you can help me do that,

292
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:37,063
I will really appreciate it big time.

293
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:40,147
You look sincere.

294
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:42,147
- You're switching sides, girl?
- No, silly.

295
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:47,898
- Hmm, are you being serious right now?
- Yes! I'm serious about Amber!

296
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:52,201
There you go. Perfect.

297
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,980
Is this right? Is this really
what Amber expects me to do?

298
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:02,110
Of course. She wants you to stop
being insecure about your masculinity.

299
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:05,938
And that you can also
embrace your feminine side.

300
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,730
By being a drag queen?

301
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:08,887
Yes!

302
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:12,772
Because everyone loves drag queens!

303
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,987
You think Amber will
be thrilled to see this?

304
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:18,605
For sure!

305
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:22,858
Okay. Thank you.

306
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,211
You look good.

307
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:28,780
What's going on here?

308
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,388
May I present to you…

309
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:35,912
Miss Brigada Eskwela!

310
00:19:40,232 --> 00:19:43,232
Brian, what has gotten into you?

311
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:45,730
They said you'd like me like this.

312
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,355
It'll help you get to
know my feminine side.

313
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:51,641
You don't have to do that!

314
00:19:52,813 --> 00:19:54,188
What do you want, then?

315
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:56,147
I swear I don't get you!

316
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:59,022
Know yourself--

317
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:02,980
and be sensitive to
other people's feelings!

318
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,313
You don't have to do drag...

319
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:06,855
just for show!

320
00:20:09,397 --> 00:20:10,397
Oh my God.

321
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:13,266
That's okay, babe.

322
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,399
Brian, good effort.

323
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,397
- We love you.
- Thank you.

324
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:30,272
Mom? Dad?

325
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,647
What are you doing here?

326
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,522
Ah, dear. We wanted to talk to you.

327
00:20:34,522 --> 00:20:39,147
About last night. We really
took your words to heart.

328
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:43,162
It's true that we were acting immature.

329
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:48,022
We're sorry we've been leaving
you out of our major decisions.

330
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,955
We want you to be part of our lives so

331
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,480
from now on, we'll
decide things as a family.

332
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:59,355
You just realized this now, for real?

333
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:05,147
The sad truth, sweetie, is that not
all old people think like old people.

334
00:21:06,605 --> 00:21:08,355
Allaine, dear,

335
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,272
we want to do better.

336
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:13,147
I hope we can make it up to you.

337
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:23,209
Come to the restaurant.
Here's the address.

338
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:28,917
Wanna make it up to me?

339
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:31,688
I have an idea.

340
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:34,063
Do something for me.

341
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,709
I'll see you.

342
00:21:57,313 --> 00:21:58,313
Dad.

343
00:21:59,313 --> 00:22:00,688
What are you doing here?

344
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:03,772
And you? What have you done to yourself?

345
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:07,311
Why are you wearing that? Have you lost it?

346
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:10,902
Did you come here to insult me?

347
00:22:11,352 --> 00:22:13,144
I wanted to surprise you.

348
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:15,022
I just thought--

349
00:22:15,022 --> 00:22:18,522
that maybe the volleyball camp
in Thailand will do you some good.

350
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:20,980
Really, Dad?

351
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:24,760
But for fuck's sake, Brian!

352
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,053
You keep on disappointing me!

353
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:29,605
What is this gay shit?

354
00:22:32,313 --> 00:22:33,855
Dad! Dad, stop!

355
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,397
Just leave!

356
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:38,688
Leave!

357
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:40,561
I don't need you!

358
00:22:40,605 --> 00:22:41,897
What did you say?!

359
00:22:41,897 --> 00:22:46,730
I don't need you! You can
shove your money up your ass!

360
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,022
I don't need it!

361
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:49,397
How dare you talk to me like this!

362
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,742
I'm happy with what I’m doing.

363
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:54,063
I no longer need validation from you!

364
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:56,795
I'm over that phase!

365
00:22:57,257 --> 00:22:58,417
Just go!

366
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:19,555
So what are you busy with these days?

367
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,102
- Just school stuff.
- Really?

368
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:24,508
So you've got lots of time.

369
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:26,914
- Mm, some.
- Ahh...

370
00:23:27,563 --> 00:23:29,461
Then why did you stop
courting my daughter?

371
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:32,313
Ma'am? Didn't you tell me
to stay away from Joanna?

372
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:35,147
Stay away is different from stop courting.

373
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,480
You're so slow, dude. So slow.

374
00:23:37,688 --> 00:23:39,272
Ma, please stop
embarrassing yourself.

375
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:41,230
Is that what I'm doing?
Sorry.

376
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:45,170
What course are you
planning to take up in college?

377
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:46,605
I actually don't know yet.

378
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:47,772
Ah, I see.

379
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:50,913
Why don't you take up Engineering?
Engineering can give you a lot of perspective.

380
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:52,813
Opens up a lot of prospects in life.

381
00:23:52,813 --> 00:23:55,605
You can go abroad. And after that,

382
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:57,897
- get married--
- Ma! What the heck?

383
00:23:57,897 --> 00:23:59,022
Are you a pimp?

384
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,772
No, a matchmaker.

385
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,080
Ah, excuse me, Pastora.

386
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:07,563
My name is Carmen. I'm Allaine's mom.

387
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:09,772
- And this is Allister, her dad.
- Ah. Hi.

388
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:16,897
The reason we're here is just to clarify
what Allaine's intentions are with Joanna.

389
00:24:18,313 --> 00:24:19,313
Uh--

390
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:21,688
In that case, please join us.

391
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:25,272
It would be unchristian of me
to not invite you to the table.

392
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:26,522
Please have a seat.

393
00:24:26,522 --> 00:24:28,938
Thank you for coming. I'll bounce.

394
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,397
Huh? Faco?

395
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:33,257
It's Paco, ma'am.

396
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,217
Bye, bye.

397
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:48,397
Are you aware of what your
daughter did to my daughter?

398
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:52,922
I welcomed your daughter into my house.

399
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:57,563
But in exchange, she took
advantage of my daughter!

400
00:24:57,602 --> 00:25:00,022
Ma! I wanted it, too!

401
00:25:00,022 --> 00:25:01,147
Be quiet!

402
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:03,897
If I may squeeze a word in, Pastora.

403
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:07,188
Well, look at them.
They're young ladies now.

404
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,234
They know what they're doing.

405
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:14,105
You're sounding a bit homophobic.

406
00:25:14,105 --> 00:25:15,397
Me? Homophobic?

407
00:25:15,522 --> 00:25:16,522
So you're not?

408
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,799
No.

409
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,578
Are you a member of Aiza's parish?

410
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:25,313
I'm not. All that's clear to
me is what the bible says.

411
00:25:25,495 --> 00:25:29,620
According to the Corinthians,
man is made for a woman.

412
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,570
Ah, hold on a minute.

413
00:25:31,595 --> 00:25:34,230
What seems to be the problem here?

414
00:25:34,255 --> 00:25:36,389
First of all, they're both girls.

415
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:39,747
Two wombs don't make a baby.

416
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:42,272
That's right, and look
how careful they are.

417
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:45,230
They're not gonna get pregnant
because they use condoms.

418
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,105
Oh my God!

419
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:48,647
Yes! They use surgical gloves!

420
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,480
And they don't make a mess.

421
00:25:50,522 --> 00:25:53,063
These parents! These parents!

422
00:25:53,063 --> 00:25:54,980
What's important, ma'am,

423
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,522
is that Joanna and I are
happy together, right?

424
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:57,813
Yes, Ma!

425
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,313
What do you suggest?

426
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:07,022
My suggestion is to let them date.

427
00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:08,022
Date?

428
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
They'll start dating?

429
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:13,313
No!

430
00:26:13,313 --> 00:26:18,897
You can date but you may not have sex
until you've graduated high school!

431
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:20,147
There, you can have sex in college.

432
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:23,355
You can't have sex until
you've graduated from college!

433
00:26:23,355 --> 00:26:24,750
Then when you're working.

434
00:26:24,775 --> 00:26:28,663
You can't have sex until-- Until I--

435
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:31,355
Until I understand the meaning of all this!

436
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:32,355
What you are!

437
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:35,230
Ah. You will never ever have sex.

438
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,980
Hey. We can do it instead.

439
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,897
- Tough sell.
- You don't want this?

440
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:41,170
- Excuse me?
- What is that?

441
00:26:41,195 --> 00:26:42,230
It's my cock.

442
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,352
Excuse me. Excuse me.

443
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:50,934
Pastora, please calm down.

444
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:53,709
All right, here. To conciliate you,

445
00:26:54,235 --> 00:26:56,694
we have decided to join your church.

446
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:59,811
Yes, that's right. We will join your church
and at the same time,

447
00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:01,730
we'll be able to watch over our children--

448
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,313
Yes.

449
00:27:02,313 --> 00:27:07,063
and this will be part of healing
Carmen and I's relationship.

450
00:27:07,088 --> 00:27:08,288
No!

451
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,147
That I can accept and I can back up.

452
00:27:11,195 --> 00:27:12,813
When do you want to get baptized?

453
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:14,480
I'll need to order the water from France.

454
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,897
Oh no, we have a problem.
Let's delay the baptism.

455
00:27:16,897 --> 00:27:19,688
I'm scheduled for a circumcision tomorrow.

456
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,355
We'll have to reschedule the baptism.

457
00:27:21,355 --> 00:27:22,372
Yeah?

458
00:27:22,397 --> 00:27:25,147
Now you know why he
and I had to separate.

459
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:28,074
His foreskin stinks like hell.

460
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:31,261
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

461
00:27:31,553 --> 00:27:35,000
You said only sex is not allowed.

462
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,237
Where does sex start?

463
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:39,367
Where does it start?

464
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,844
With the letter 'S'.

465
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,468
What's bothering you?

466
00:27:52,678 --> 00:27:54,594
Is our plan gonna work?

467
00:27:55,397 --> 00:27:58,438
What if it doesn't?
Then we'll all get kicked out.

468
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:02,125
Don't worry about it, Erica.

469
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,313
Let's trust P. Corny.

470
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:24,397
Sir!

471
00:28:25,765 --> 00:28:28,073
Looks like you're lost.

472
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,725
This isn't your office anymore.

473
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,522
I don't think so.

474
00:28:38,688 --> 00:28:39,688
You know what,

475
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:43,980
I do miss this spot.

476
00:28:44,842 --> 00:28:49,133
You think I'll ever get it back?

477
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,897
Hmm..  You could, sir.

478
00:28:54,605 --> 00:28:57,855
But you're too old now.

479
00:28:57,855 --> 00:28:59,147
Ouchie.

480
00:28:59,147 --> 00:29:03,242
They're looking for a
principal who's fresh--

481
00:29:04,063 --> 00:29:05,063
Young.

482
00:29:06,147 --> 00:29:07,355
Innovative.

483
00:29:10,772 --> 00:29:12,563
And a pervert.

484
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:15,647
Excuse me?

485
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:17,781
Excuse me?

486
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:23,776
Come on!

487
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,980
I just wanted to get a
feel of your soft thighs.

488
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:32,234
Okay. Fine.

489
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:35,679
How about this?

490
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:40,078
Sir! Please don't, sir!
Don't touch my boobs!

491
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:42,355
You're way too fussy.

492
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:46,351
Okay, then.

493
00:29:50,628 --> 00:29:51,961
How about a kiss?

494
00:29:55,555 --> 00:29:58,609
Yuck. Is this really happening in Vanguard?

495
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,558
Sir Ragos is disgusting.
I can't believe I thought he was cute.

496
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:09,772
Guys.

497
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:13,562
This is a serious allegation.

498
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:20,315
Are you telling me that our
principal took advantage of you?

499
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,631
Our Mr. Ragos?

500
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:23,742
Yes, sir. It's true!

501
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:33,745
I'm not doubting you one bit, Ms. Reynes.

502
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:36,605
But we have to have proof--

503
00:30:38,022 --> 00:30:39,855
If we are to pin him down.

504
00:30:41,647 --> 00:30:43,313
Maybe we can set him up.

505
00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:45,605
Right?

506
00:30:46,274 --> 00:30:47,274
Yeah.

507
00:30:47,563 --> 00:30:49,930
He kept asking about you
when you weren't coming to class.

508
00:30:50,573 --> 00:30:54,156
It's possible he'll ask you to his office
when he finds out you're back.

509
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,162
You should record your conversation.

510
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Hold a second.

511
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,355
I don't think recording the conversation
will hold water in court.

512
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,730
But we can try and as long as--

513
00:31:10,355 --> 00:31:12,063
Erica agrees to it.

514
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:14,063
Yes, sir.

515
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,355
- I can do it.
- You sure?

516
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:21,647
So game?

517
00:31:22,772 --> 00:31:24,188
- Game.
- Game.

518
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:36,360
How are you? I haven't
been seeing you in class.

519
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,772
I was getting nervous.

520
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,274
I just wasn’t feeling well, s- sir.

521
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,874
You haven't told anybody, have you?

522
00:31:53,355 --> 00:31:54,355
N-no, sir.

523
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:05,105
Si-sir, please don't.
Don't do this, please.

524
00:32:05,105 --> 00:32:06,727
Oh, come on...

525
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:11,047
I just wanted to get a
feel of your soft thighs.

526
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:15,355
Okay. Fine.

527
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:20,430
How about this?

528
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:24,859
Sir! Please don't sir!
Don't touch my boobs!

529
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,359
You're way too fussy.

530
00:32:30,355 --> 00:32:31,355
Okay, then.

531
00:32:35,498 --> 00:32:36,703
How about a kiss?

532
00:32:52,605 --> 00:33:04,188
You were listening to the voice of the
newly elected principal of Vanguard High.

533
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,227
The good boy teacher who turns out to be

534
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:18,922
a predator! A pervert!
Some guy who likes to hit on fuzzies.

535
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,641
- Fuzzies?
- Fuzzies?

536
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:27,461
Fuzzies are hair that's just growing out!

537
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,106
Here he comes, sis!

538
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:44,672
Are you ready?

539
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:46,975
Is everybody ready?
Here he comes! Here he comes!

540
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,906
Pervert! Pervert!

541
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:52,772
Boo! Pervert!

542
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:57,430
Pervert! Pervert! Boo!

543
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:07,694
You will all receive disciplinary action!

544
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,897
In fact, I'll have you all suspended!

545
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:12,563
You have no right!

546
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:37,241
Sir, I'm sorry, sir!

547
00:34:37,266 --> 00:34:38,438
Sir! Sorry, sir!

548
00:34:38,438 --> 00:34:43,352
Sir Corny, we're sorry
for not trusting you.

549
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:47,397
Okay.

550
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:50,281
Apologies accepted.

551
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:53,509
Do you remember the saying--

552
00:34:53,534 --> 00:34:56,510
"Do not trust everything you see."

553
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,688
Salt also looks like sugar.

554
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,025
Just like Ragos.

555
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:06,706
We were blinded by his good looks.

556
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:08,792
Ouch.

557
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:11,938
That's even more hurtful, Ms. Joyce.

558
00:35:13,105 --> 00:35:14,647
Am I really not handsome?

559
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:19,480
Sir, you are a good man.

560
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:22,605
That's why we'd like to ask you again

561
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:25,959
if you're willing to remain
as principal of Vanguard.

562
00:35:27,188 --> 00:35:28,188
Hmm.

563
00:35:29,563 --> 00:35:30,730
You know what?

564
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:33,938
After everything that's happened,

565
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:42,869
I've thought of a better
position where I can serve.

566
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,022
And what is that?

567
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:53,737
They say, your friends in high
school will become your friends for life.

568
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:57,219
Those are the best years of our lives.

569
00:35:57,727 --> 00:36:00,894
We discover ourselves.

570
00:36:01,229 --> 00:36:05,855
We get to explore.
Experience new things.

571
00:36:07,503 --> 00:36:10,961
We learn what's right and wrong.

572
00:36:11,592 --> 00:36:15,425
We get to test what
our parents taught us.

573
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:22,480
But you'll also start to really think about:
what do you want to do with your life?

574
00:36:23,563 --> 00:36:27,272
And you'll only achieve
whatever it is if you try.

575
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:31,980
And if you don't, so
what? Just keep trying.

576
00:36:32,612 --> 00:36:35,372
Do not be discouraged if you
don't succeed on your first few tries.

577
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:38,396
Relax. Maybe it's not for you.

578
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:43,102
If it is, things will fall into
place. But never give up.

579
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:48,542
Some things you can only get
if you go after them aggressively.

580
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:52,719
But some require patience.

581
00:36:53,188 --> 00:37:01,914
Take it slow. Relax. High school will
fly by so fast. Enjoy it while it lasts.

582
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,272
I'm telling you these because
I've been through the same thing.

583
00:37:06,272 --> 00:37:09,105
I've been there.
In the stock rooms?

584
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,563
At the guidance office?

585
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,938
At the parking lot?

586
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:15,897
At the comfort room?

587
00:37:16,643 --> 00:37:18,224
At the library?

588
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:23,389
Oh, yes. I've been there. Can you imagine?

589
00:37:23,563 --> 00:37:30,063
That's why I'm here. To guide you. And to
make sure you enjoy your high school days.

590
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:34,193
Vanguard! Vanguard! Off to a great start!

591
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,748
Always true to our minds and hearts!

592
00:37:38,017 --> 00:37:39,392
Truth conquers all!

593
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:41,667
Rawr, rawr, rawr!

594
00:37:46,508 --> 00:37:50,467
I heard you helped Paco expose Mr. Ragos.

595
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:54,248
Help him? I thought up the whole plan.

596
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,772
Mm? I see.

597
00:37:56,936 --> 00:37:58,451
I'm so proud of you!

598
00:37:58,605 --> 00:38:01,381
You're so gutsy and manly!

599
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:04,123
But I'm gay.

600
00:38:04,188 --> 00:38:06,063
With a feminine side.

601
00:38:08,272 --> 00:38:09,730
Come here.

602
00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:13,685
Come here!

603
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:19,897
Can we start again?

604
00:38:20,558 --> 00:38:22,100
Promise, I'll take it slow.

605
00:38:22,855 --> 00:38:26,438
I know you're extra cautious
because of what Mr. Ragos did to you.

606
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,928
I will wait till you're ready.

607
00:38:31,538 --> 00:38:34,381
You don’t have to worry too much about me.

608
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:35,865
I'm okay.

609
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:37,795
I will be okay.

610
00:38:40,105 --> 00:38:42,188
Can I place my hand here?

611
00:38:43,202 --> 00:38:45,068
Or here.

612
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:06,615
Why don't all four of us hang out?

613
00:39:08,483 --> 00:39:10,525
I'm not into orgies anymore.

614
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,342
Pastora hates that stuff.

615
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,006
How about a… double date?

616
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:22,574
Game!

617
00:39:23,147 --> 00:39:25,170
Then let's go!
