1
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:14,607
Hey.

2
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:17,205
Wake up.

3
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:23,952
What time is it?

4
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:25,262
Seven.

5
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:38,326
In fairness, I slept like
a baby on your bed.

6
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:41,904
I could never sleep like that
at any of my granny's houses.

7
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:46,823
Good, 'cause your mom won't
be back for a few more days.

8
00:01:09,755 --> 00:01:11,171
I look stupid.

9
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,667
So, Allaine, how was your sleep?

10
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:21,725
Good?

11
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,500
I've never slept so well anywhere else.

12
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:28,488
You're welcome to stay here any day.

13
00:01:28,513 --> 00:01:33,537
And I'm so happy that my
daughter found a sister in you.

14
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,655
- How are your parents, by the way?
- Ma'am?

15
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:43,061
Joanna already told me that
your mom and dad have separated.

16
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:45,920
You think maybe they'd
want to join my church?

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,045
You know?

18
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:48,503
They're doing fine.

19
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:54,628
They don't have new relationships yet
but they've agreed to be friends.

20
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,420
Zero chance of getting back together.

21
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,128
You can never can tell.

22
00:01:58,128 --> 00:02:01,458
Nothing is impossible with Jesus.

23
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:06,341
I appreciate it, ma'am,
but I think they've moved on.

24
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:09,128
I'm the only one who hasn't yet.

25
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:14,003
Probably why I have problems
building serious relationships

26
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:16,630
because of my trust issues.

27
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,045
Don't put it all in, honey!

28
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:21,461
Drink water.

29
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:25,086
It's probably for the best, Allaine.

30
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:28,253
You don't need to get
into relationships for now.

31
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:32,904
You should be preserving
yourself for your future husband.

32
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:37,170
Is choking a thing these days?

33
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,404
Let me join in.

34
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:42,113
Okay?

35
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:43,255
Sorry, auntie.

36
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:48,504
Erica, please pick up.

37
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:55,038
Erica, please pick up your phone.

38
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:02,745
Kate!

39
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:06,041
Hey, Paco! What happened to Erica?

40
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:07,566
Why hasn't she been coming to class?

41
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:09,720
I was hoping you knew where she went.

42
00:04:09,745 --> 00:04:12,003
Aren't you the boyfriend?
Why don't you know?

43
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,003
Huh?

44
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:16,361
Erica's not my girlfriend!
We just hang out.

45
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,901
That's probably why
she's sulking somewhere.

46
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,843
- Did you dump her?
- Huh?

47
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,424
I didn't dump her. Where'd that come from?

48
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:27,614
Because everybody knows
Erica wants to get with you?

49
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:30,291
Stop giving her false hopes.

50
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:32,445
Don't even deny it.

51
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:35,611
Did she tell you anything about me?

52
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:37,064
Is there something to tell?

53
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Nothing.

54
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:40,830
If you say so.

55
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:51,211
So Erica didn't tell anyone.

56
00:04:58,503 --> 00:04:59,878
Mrs. Holly?

57
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:14,831
Mrs. Holly?

58
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:16,197
Hello?

59
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,086
Mrs. Holly, can we start?

60
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:24,461
Ah, yes. Go ahead.

61
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:30,836
I just need your advice, ma'am.

62
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:34,586
Do you-- Do you remember
what happened to Brian?

63
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,503
Yes.

64
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:43,086
The truth is, I was the
one who leaked his nudes.

65
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,057
Paco: Erica still hasn't showed up in
class. But looks like she hasn't told anyone.

66
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:51,586
- Ah, good.
- Sorry?

67
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:54,628
What's "good"?

68
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:02,003
Ah, what I mean is it's
good that you admitted it.

69
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:05,193
I just got really offended by what he did

70
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,799
that's why I retaliated.

71
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:09,461
Uhm, what should I do?

72
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:12,961
You know what?

73
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:16,878
Tell him everything.

74
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,003
And everything will be okay.

75
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:21,666
Okay?

76
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:23,920
Are we good, Milo?

77
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,115
- Huh?
- Are we done here?

78
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,170
So, uhm--

79
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,086
Because I don't feel so good.

80
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:32,545
- Don't you have words of wisdom for me, Mrs. Holly?
- I'm really sorry.

81
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,529
I think I might need a day-off.

82
00:06:35,971 --> 00:06:37,086
Okay. Thank you, Milo.

83
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:39,211
Okay-- Okay, ma'am.

84
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,213
What did she mean?

85
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:53,209
Can we keep it low key?

86
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:54,795
Low key what?

87
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,636
Uh, friends.

88
00:06:57,878 --> 00:06:59,461
Low key? Friends?

89
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,461
- But we already had sex!
- Hey! Not so loud!

90
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:05,913
All right, fine! Situationship.

91
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:08,561
What the eff is 'situationship'?
Is that even a word?

92
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:11,378
Did you just make up that term right now?

93
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,682
It's legit.

94
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:15,086
Google it.

95
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:17,378
So we're kind of together,
but kind of not.

96
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:18,586
Something like that!

97
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:20,883
I don't get you!

98
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:26,628
Just get with it! Don't go telling people!

99
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:28,719
Brian?

100
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:31,174
What is it?

101
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:33,557
Can we talk?

102
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:35,464
What is it?

103
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
It's about uhm…

104
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,253
I don't know how to tell you this, but

105
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,795
I spoke with Mrs. Holly

106
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:47,503
and she said to just talk to you directly.

107
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,753
Okay. Go on, then.

108
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:57,378
I was the one who leaked your nudes.

109
00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:59,836
What?!
Why would you do that?

110
00:08:00,336 --> 00:08:01,378
You bastard!

111
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:06,797
You already punched me for it.
Let Milo off the hook.

112
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:10,711
You can go.

113
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,552
Can you stay out of this?

114
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:20,045
And you should stop punching
gays whenever you feel like it!

115
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:22,977
You already punched me!

116
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,877
That's enough. Past is past.
Just drop the subject.

117
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:28,853
You should be angry with Milo.

118
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:31,378
Because you got disciplinary action

119
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,456
instead of him.

120
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,291
What's done is done, okay? Past is past.

121
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:38,670
Anyway, something good came off of it.

122
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:41,654
We got into a… situationship.

123
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:43,757
I guess.

124
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,665
Fuck, Gee. Why the library?

125
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:01,753
No reason. For a change.

126
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:04,740
It's the only spot we haven't done it in.

127
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:06,464
I hate your ideas.

128
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:51,367
Bullet?

129
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,490
Did you pass the essay we wrote yet?

130
00:09:58,419 --> 00:09:59,831
I forgot.

131
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:02,120
But I'll turn it in for sure.

132
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:05,908
Then it'll be late.

133
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,643
So what.

134
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:15,943
Bullet, I worked as fast as I could
so you could turn it in on time.

135
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:17,635
I said I'll turn it in.

136
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:19,619
Let's go.

137
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:42,461
Milo said you talked to him.

138
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,780
Ah, yeah.

139
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,211
I told him to just tell you directly.

140
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:50,545
I almost hit him if Amber
hadn't stopped me.

141
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:52,287
Amber?

142
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:54,961
Amber stopped you?

143
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:57,687
Are you friends now?

144
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:00,503
Civil.

145
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:03,584
Ah, I see.

146
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:05,765
That's good.

147
00:11:06,878 --> 00:11:09,670
By the way, mom. Why did you drive here?

148
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,878
I thought you were saving up on gas.

149
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:17,003
I'm thinking of pawning it, actually.

150
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,295
Should help with our budget.

151
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:24,336
I can just buy it back
once we're doing better.

152
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:26,385
Why would you pawn your car?

153
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:32,895
Like I said, we need the money.

154
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,211
And so you can go to Thailand also.

155
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:40,920
Mom, please don't do that for me.

156
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:43,532
If I'm meant to go to that camp,

157
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:45,432
I can always go next year.

158
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,670
Thank you.

159
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,336
Smile a little!

160
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,503
Something wrong, mom?

161
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,711
You know you can talk to me, right?

162
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,307
Of course.

163
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:07,503
We've only got each other.

164
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,420
No secrets, okay?

165
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:11,393
Okay.

166
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:14,003
Thank you.

167
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:16,580
- Paco.
- Sir!

168
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:18,253
Good!

169
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,107
Yes!

170
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:23,295
- Brian?
- Sir.

171
00:12:24,156 --> 00:12:25,906
- Good job.
- Nice!

172
00:12:27,128 --> 00:12:28,128
Gee.

173
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:30,999
Very good!

174
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:32,401
- Thank you, sir!
- As usual.

175
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,633
- Congrats!
- Thank you.

176
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:38,588
Bullet!

177
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:41,049
You're failing again?

178
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:44,378
I thought you were studying!

179
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:52,213
Erica?

180
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:55,878
Erica's still absent?

181
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:58,510
She hasn't been in class
for several days now.

182
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,682
Does anyone know
what's going on with her?

183
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:08,409
Bullet, what happened? We
covered that topic, didn't we?

184
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:09,807
How could you fail?

185
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:11,961
Kate. Milo.

186
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:15,003
As soon as Erica comes to school,
tell her to see me in my office.

187
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:16,401
Yes, sir.

188
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:20,020
- Bye, class.
- Bye, sir!

189
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:21,112
Bye!

190
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:24,026
Hey. I'm talking to you.

191
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,503
Don't worry about it.

192
00:13:26,758 --> 00:13:28,342
This is not good.

193
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:30,365
I'm just distracted.

194
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:34,286
Every time we have sex,
I forget all the lessons.

195
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:35,354
What?

196
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:42,073
When you're tutoring me, I can't
stop thinking about our session.

197
00:13:42,226 --> 00:13:43,851
But I'll catch up.

198
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:45,964
This is not okay.

199
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:47,586
You're gonna get piled on.

200
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:48,920
Should we stop it?

201
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,045
No. We can't!

202
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:52,336
Bullet, I don't like this.

203
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:54,903
Look, I'll still tutor you.

204
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,282
But we'll keep it clean from now on.

205
00:13:57,307 --> 00:13:58,698
No more sex after.

206
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:00,807
Gee, come on.

207
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,392
It's just one test.

208
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:08,425
What about that paper
you forgot to turn in?

209
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:11,431
You're slipping back to your old ways.

210
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:13,436
You're becoming irresponsible again.

211
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:14,461
Let's end this!

212
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:28,586
Let's see who the faculty voted

213
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:32,153
to be the next principal
of Vanguard Senior High!

214
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:33,865
Drumroll please!

215
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:37,916
Mr. Ragos.

216
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,711
No hard feelings. I know you did your best.

217
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:43,170
May the best man win.

218
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:45,128
Yes.

219
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:47,979
May the best man win.

220
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:49,253
Okay…

221
00:14:49,795 --> 00:14:54,651
Garnering 28 out of 30 votes…

222
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:56,211
Wow!

223
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,451
Majority!

224
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:01,628
Our new principal

225
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:04,045
- …is Mr. Raymond Ragos!
- Yes!

226
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,253
- Oh my God!
- Congratulations!

227
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:07,420
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much for your trust.

228
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,586
Thank you. Thank you.

229
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:10,336
- Wait, wait.
- Thank you.

230
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:12,545
Wait. Wait. Wait.

231
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,170
Who won?

232
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:17,065
- Mr. Raymond Ragos, sir.
- "No hard feelings."

233
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,025
I only got two votes?

234
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:27,628
Aside from me, who was the other
person kind enough to vote for me?

235
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:35,253
It was you?

236
00:15:39,086 --> 00:15:41,045
This election is a farce!

237
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:44,545
Wow! Very deserved to be a principal!

238
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:46,552
You flatter me. Thank you!
I'm very grateful!

239
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:48,961
Thanks again!

240
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,295
But I'm not that kind of a person.

241
00:15:52,295 --> 00:15:56,003
I know. And for that,
I'm really, really thankful.

242
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:59,384
You know, I just really
wanted to take a photo with him

243
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:02,253
at the parade but he pushed me away!

244
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,878
And he said that he hates femmes like me.

245
00:16:04,878 --> 00:16:07,961
Well, we gotta support each other.

246
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:09,878
I'm just curious, though.

247
00:16:10,062 --> 00:16:12,721
Like how come you guys
are close all of a sudden?

248
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:15,121
As in he actually listens to you, why?

249
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,107
- Well, 'cause-- It was because--
- Oh!

250
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:20,436
Because?

251
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:23,604
Because we did that community service
together that you were supposed to do!

252
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:24,670
Ahh…

253
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,920
Wait, wait, wait. You're like, close now?

254
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:28,696
Yes, but we're not, okay?

255
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,304
- How close?
- Acquaintance! Stop it!

256
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,023
We were not informed!

257
00:16:33,048 --> 00:16:34,257
It's none of your business.

258
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,511
You girls believe her?

259
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,115
It's a big no.

260
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,973
Spill the tea! Come on!

261
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:41,665
Fine.

262
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,273
We are in a 'situationship'.

263
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:45,924
Situationship?

264
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:47,026
Is that a thing?

265
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:50,326
Didn't you hear me? I just
said it was. Situationship!

266
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:54,461
- Really?
- I don't know, Empress Amber...

267
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:58,995
Did you really come out loud
and proud of being a femme

268
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:03,686
only to fall for a bisexual
femme-hater? Come on now!

269
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:08,136
Oh my gosh. You know what,
I realized he wasn't a hater.

270
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:10,273
Okay? He's not a hater.

271
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:12,461
He's just ignorant.

272
00:17:12,753 --> 00:17:15,128
But he's trying and he's learning.

273
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,310
Wow.

274
00:17:19,274 --> 00:17:21,591
- So you're in love?
- Watch your back, girl.

275
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,474
He already punched you once.

276
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,542
It can happen again.

277
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,916
True!

278
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:28,980
True!

279
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:32,503
There are loads of other options.

280
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:33,753
- Where?
- Right?

281
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:34,811
Bigger options!

282
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:35,836
Where?

283
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:37,961
Let's go. I'll show you.

284
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:39,461
No way! I'm faithful.

285
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:47,006
Who's this from?

286
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:52,295
Hey!

287
00:18:06,237 --> 00:18:10,695
Gee, I know we're not on the same level.

288
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,104
Academically.

289
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:14,776
You're smart.

290
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,628
I'm stupid.

291
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:21,796
But I really like you.

292
00:18:26,045 --> 00:18:27,628
Will you be my girlfriend?

293
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,218
Why are you making
things hard for me, Bullet?

294
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:54,878
I don't want to, but I need to let you go.

295
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:54,792
Come on. Please?

296
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,316
I wanna have sex with you.

297
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,745
I'm not gonna wear that! I don't want this!

298
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:02,382
You don't want this anymore?

299
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,163
What do you mean?

300
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:07,167
Look, I like you.

301
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:10,082
That's why I agreed once,
twice, three times.

302
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:11,550
But every time?

303
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:19,354
Allaine, do you really think weird?

304
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:20,379
No.

305
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:24,206
But I don't wanna wear a costume
every time we're gonna do it.

306
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,529
This is not working!

307
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:33,593
I knew I recognized that voice.

308
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:37,211
So… You're sleeping with the enemy.

309
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:39,385
Gee, come on!

310
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,893
Out of all the girls and boys in Vanguard,

311
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:45,800
did it have to be Joanna?

312
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,710
What did I ever do to you?

313
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:51,299
Nothing. Your face just annoys me.

314
00:21:52,503 --> 00:21:54,995
She thinks you've stolen
everything from her.

315
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:59,479
First, Paco, then you got partnered up
with Bullet for the parade.

316
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,401
Now my bestfriend, too.

317
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:03,761
I can't believe it.

318
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:05,681
Allaine!

319
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,143
Why did it have to be Joanna? Yuck!

320
00:22:19,807 --> 00:22:21,265
I'm sorry, Joanna.

321
00:22:23,237 --> 00:22:24,940
I can't do this anymore.

322
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:27,729
Allaine!

323
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:39,987
Yiii… Pretty girl!

324
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:41,589
What the hell!

325
00:22:42,451 --> 00:22:44,492
What's up with you? Why are you pissed?

326
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:47,088
I was gonna invite you
to hang out after class.

327
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:50,145
I still got some things to do at the org.

328
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,461
Should I fetch you later?

329
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:55,331
Forget it. People might see you with me.

330
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:58,729
Then we can separate when there
are other people. Why's that an issue?

331
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:04,420
Listen, if you're not
comfortable being seen with me,

332
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,729
I feel the same way!

333
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:07,796
So what do you want?

334
00:23:09,294 --> 00:23:11,636
Let's end this situationship!

335
00:23:12,378 --> 00:23:14,336
Can't you see I'm making an effort?

336
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:17,920
You wanna show me off
at your village so badly?

337
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,190
Whatever!

338
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Amber!

339
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:27,174
Gee, come on! I know you're
dramatic but this is next level!

340
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:29,354
Dramatic? Really?

341
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:32,604
Out of all the people in Vanguard,
you really had to choose Joanna?

342
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:34,170
You know how much I hate her.

343
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:36,869
I honestly don't know how to tell you.

344
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:39,311
Like how? I know you'll get mad!

345
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:40,545
So you do know.

346
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,045
And didn't you hear us?
We're already fighting!

347
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:44,920
There's no point to all this!

348
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:46,656
Tch.

349
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Gee!

350
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:55,920
Hey. You okay?

351
00:23:56,624 --> 00:23:58,674
Give me a hug, bro. No homo.

352
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:02,951
What happened to you?

353
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:06,920
There's someone that I like.

354
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:09,295
Yeah, I know. It's Amber.

355
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,853
Everybody knows.

356
00:24:10,878 --> 00:24:12,295
Everybody knows?

357
00:24:13,107 --> 00:24:14,482
So what?

358
00:24:14,878 --> 00:24:17,378
You like her but you don't
wanna be seen with her?

359
00:24:17,853 --> 00:24:19,086
Not cool, bro.

360
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:21,171
If it were me, I'd leave you, too.

361
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,461
Is that why Erica left you?

362
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,170
Hey, bro, sorry. Is that a foul?

363
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:31,086
But for real, where's Erica?

364
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:33,170
She's still not picking up.

365
00:24:34,378 --> 00:24:36,753
You know what, just go to her house.

366
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:39,296
You think?

367
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,670
For sure.

368
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:49,586
Paco?

369
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:51,878
What are you doing here?

370
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,255
How are you?

371
00:24:54,603 --> 00:24:55,921
Not good.

372
00:24:56,518 --> 00:24:58,768
Is it because of what you
saw at the guidance office?

373
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,380
Come in.

374
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:20,211
Why don't you tell
someone about what I did?

375
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,045
I'll accept the consequences.

376
00:25:23,878 --> 00:25:27,503
It's not my business and
you're not my boyfriend.

377
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:32,711
So technically, I shouldn't
care who you have sex with.

378
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:33,783
Erica…

379
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:36,651
No, it's fine.

380
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:39,852
But is that why you haven't
been coming to school?

381
00:25:40,576 --> 00:25:41,838
I feel sick.

382
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:47,081
And I might stop for now
and transfer next school year.

383
00:25:47,315 --> 00:25:48,315
Transfer?

384
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,586
Because of me?

385
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:55,211
Paco, my world doesn't
revolve around you, okay?

386
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,492
Then why?

387
00:25:58,132 --> 00:25:59,132
I can't say.

388
00:26:02,846 --> 00:26:06,638
Thanks for dropping by,
and for the flowers.

389
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:23,213
Are you okay?

390
00:26:24,224 --> 00:26:27,099
Sir! I'm sorry. I'm okay.

391
00:26:28,768 --> 00:26:32,101
Did somebody hurt you?

392
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:34,586
Where are you going?

393
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:36,878
I'm on my way home.

394
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,170
Come on, I'll drive you.

395
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:41,588
It's late. Let's go.

396
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,615
Where do you live again?

397
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,453
I'll be fine outside the gate.

398
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:18,281
I can grab a ride there.

399
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,057
You're already here.

400
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:22,757
Sir!

401
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,336
Sir!

402
00:27:24,336 --> 00:27:27,670
You're gonna enjoy this.
Just relax. Just relax!

403
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,170
- Sir! I wanna go out, sir!
- Wait. Stop moving.

404
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:32,211
Sorry. Sorry!

405
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,228
- It's not gonna happen again.
- Sir!

406
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,039
I thought you were game.

407
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,979
You're a fucking killjoy.

408
00:28:06,045 --> 00:28:08,805
Damn! I missed you.

409
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:11,869
You didn't show up for so long.

410
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:15,742
But I'm glad you're all mine now.

411
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:36,341
Hey. You wanna do this?

412
00:28:37,138 --> 00:28:39,513
Or should we go another day?

413
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:41,823
It's okay. Continue.

414
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,050
It's Joanna, huh?

415
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:55,041
Yup. I'm not denying it. I do like her.

416
00:28:55,507 --> 00:28:58,094
But we're not compatible sexually.

417
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:04,170
We're sexually compatible
but you don't like me.

418
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:08,530
Come on. You agreed to this setup, right?

419
00:29:10,161 --> 00:29:11,161
I did.

420
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:12,586
But…

421
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,586
I don't like this setup anymore.

422
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:18,211
It just breaks my heart.

423
00:29:19,464 --> 00:29:20,625
From what?

424
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:24,478
Seeing you loving a different person!

425
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:27,630
I just keep imagining
myself in that position.

426
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:29,944
And I know it's never gonna happen.

427
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:32,170
Kate, I'm sorry.

428
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:34,195
You're a good person but--

429
00:29:34,836 --> 00:29:36,753
Shh. Enough. I'm fine.

430
00:29:38,198 --> 00:29:40,008
I'm gonna stop now, okay.

431
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:44,420
Okay, but can we just chill here for a bit?

432
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,333
Sure.

433
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,341
Why'd you ask us to come here, Paco?

434
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:05,586
No reason. I just missed you girls.

435
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:09,228
I feel like so many things have happened
to us since we got into Vanguard, huh?

436
00:30:13,336 --> 00:30:14,711
We're good, right?

437
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:16,740
Yeah.

438
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:19,211
But not this one.

439
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:25,920
You know what, Gee?
I don't know what your problem is with me.

440
00:30:25,945 --> 00:30:28,820
Or what I did to make you angry.

441
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:32,670
I'm miserable as it is.

442
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,750
She doesn't even like me.

443
00:30:35,797 --> 00:30:38,381
Isn't that why you
started being mad at her?

444
00:30:38,432 --> 00:30:39,557
Yeah!

445
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:40,888
Fine, I'm sorry!

446
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:45,538
As for me, I think I've
fallen in love with Erica.

447
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:48,859
I can't imagine the school without her.

448
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:50,927
Have you told her?

449
00:30:51,537 --> 00:30:52,537
Not really.

450
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,675
Then how will she know?

451
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,378
Communication is the key.

452
00:30:56,378 --> 00:31:02,836
Yeah? I told Allaine that
I'm attracted to erotic animes

453
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,711
but she got turned off.

454
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:07,711
'Cause you're weird!

455
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:09,753
Hey! This is a safe space!

456
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:11,403
No kink-shaming here!

457
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:13,378
You probably need to compromise.

458
00:31:13,378 --> 00:31:14,420
Probably.

459
00:31:16,164 --> 00:31:18,831
Can we all promise to
work on our relationships?

460
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,253
Kind of like, do our best.

461
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,422
Because I just want
to see you both happy.

462
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:27,429
Okay.

463
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:02,320
Erica, I know you might not believe me
because of what you saw.

464
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:04,258
I can't blame you.

465
00:32:04,283 --> 00:32:06,352
But if you give me a chance,

466
00:32:06,813 --> 00:32:10,445
I want you to know you're important to me.

467
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:15,647
And one of my biggest regrets is

468
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:21,719
not giving you enough time,
value, and attention.

469
00:32:23,212 --> 00:32:25,570
I'll be crushed if you do leave Vanguard

470
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,929
but of course, whatever makes
you happy, I'll support you.

471
00:32:29,778 --> 00:32:33,153
If you're troubled and
have no one to talk to,

472
00:32:33,572 --> 00:32:35,905
know that I'm always here for you.

473
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,060
To listen and to lend a hand. Paco.

474
00:33:06,366 --> 00:33:10,227
Allaine, you don't have to leave.

475
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:13,901
It's okay. Mom's coming
home in a few days anyway.

476
00:33:14,832 --> 00:33:18,207
You can stay here while waiting for her.

477
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:21,259
I don't like awkward spaces, Joanna.

478
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:23,016
I only want good vibes.

479
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:26,791
Allaine, believe it or not,

480
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:30,102
I like you more than your costumes.

481
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,091
I just need more understanding!

482
00:33:34,338 --> 00:33:35,880
What are you saying?

483
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:37,850
Well,

484
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:46,109
all my life, I was fantasizing over
erotic animes and sexy monsters.

485
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:49,709
It's not that easy to
get it out of my system.

486
00:33:50,469 --> 00:33:52,844
But if you're willing to wait,

487
00:33:53,358 --> 00:33:55,524
I can work on it.

488
00:33:58,303 --> 00:33:59,625
I don't know…

489
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:04,092
I don't want you to
compromise the things you enjoy.

490
00:34:04,746 --> 00:34:07,079
Isn't that what relationships are?

491
00:34:07,693 --> 00:34:09,193
Compromise?

492
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:12,422
It's what happened to my parents.

493
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:15,859
They knew they weren't compatible,

494
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:19,703
but they still decided to
compromise on their values.

495
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:21,245
How did that work out for them?

496
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:22,714
They're separated.

497
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:28,882
Well, I can't promise that we
won't end up like your parents.

498
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:34,305
But if we don't try,
we'll never know, right?

499
00:34:36,797 --> 00:34:40,506
So… what's your proposal?

500
00:34:41,381 --> 00:34:47,125
Maybe on our next sex,
let's get rid of the tail.

501
00:34:47,826 --> 00:34:50,836
Then the ears can go next.

502
00:34:56,906 --> 00:34:59,906
What about now?
Do I still need to wear cat ears?

503
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:03,383
No, you're good.

504
00:36:46,727 --> 00:36:50,469
By the way, honey, that
thing I was telling you about--

505
00:36:56,274 --> 00:36:57,858
Oh my Lord.

506
00:36:58,822 --> 00:36:59,822
Mom?

507
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:17,886
Gee.

508
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:20,537
Can you talk to me, please?

509
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,016
Bullet, what do you want?

510
00:37:25,164 --> 00:37:26,500
Come back to me.

511
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:28,769
I'm not a good influence to you.

512
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:34,945
I think it's better that we go back to
strictly student and tutor relationship.

513
00:37:35,272 --> 00:37:37,789
Gee, you became my inspiration.

514
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:42,305
You're the reason why
I look forward to school.

515
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,844
You know what, Bullet?
You had such a big improvement.

516
00:37:46,256 --> 00:37:47,911
But when we started having sex,

517
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:49,344
you spiraled back down.

518
00:37:50,253 --> 00:37:52,813
Gee, I like you.

519
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:56,079
But I'm scared

520
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,350
that you'll reject me.

521
00:38:01,024 --> 00:38:02,463
I don't want to lose

522
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:04,838
my tutor…

523
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,951
lose my friend…

524
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:14,754
And lose my sex partner.

525
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:18,421
I'm scared of losing you.

526
00:38:22,612 --> 00:38:24,820
Okay, let's make a deal?

527
00:38:25,451 --> 00:38:26,451
Anything.

528
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:34,058
Promise me you'll study
hard and improve your grades.

529
00:38:34,498 --> 00:38:35,498
Promise?

530
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,820
Promise.

531
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:40,171
Lock, and swallow the key.

532
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:43,261
You're so corny.

533
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:30,463
I think this is our last session.

534
00:40:32,851 --> 00:40:34,463
We should have stopped long ago.

535
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,128
But thank you.

536
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:40,629
Thank you for everything.

537
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:45,296
Somehow, you made me feel less lonely

538
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:48,421
about my separation from Brian's dad.

539
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:52,699
And from thinking of the
problems Brian's been having.

540
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,615
I'm very grateful.

541
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:02,065
And thank you for allowing me to be there.

542
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:22,838
What the fuck?
