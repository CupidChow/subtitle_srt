00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
College Entrance Examination Center

2
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,458
Son, how was the exam?

3
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,250
Mom, I am so going to Seoul.

4
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,000
That's where I belong!

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,958
Meaning you did much better
on the exam this year?

6
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,417
Well, send me to Seoul!

7
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:55,167
Certainly. If you can be accepted to
a four-year-course college in Seoul.

8
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,000
A big fish must swim in deep waters.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,083
Does it have to be a four-year-course?

10
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,500
What are you saying?

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,625
Don't tell me you ruined the exam again.

12
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,750
I am not.

13
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,542
Mom, I have another call coming in.

14
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:06,583
Gonna hang out with friends tonight.

15
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:07,875
Don't stay up late waiting for me.

16
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,208
Who said you're allowed to sleep out?

17
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,167
Hey, buddy.

18
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:18,542
I don't think I can today. Sorry.

19
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:20,583
Why not? The exam is finished.
It's party time.

20
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:25,792
I know. That's why I ran home for mom
but she's out.

21
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,167
Why do you need your mom now?

22
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:28,625
How will I get money if she's not home..

23
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,500
What are you, a kid?
You don't have that money?

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,750
Anyways, I don't think I can today.
Let's make time tomorrow.

25
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,875
Man, we should have party today,
not tomorrow.

26
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,792
I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Are you not hurt?

27
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:58,917
I'm all right.

28
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:34,167
Where are you?
Let's meet up at downtown.

29
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,292
I'm finally headed for Seoul.

30
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,125
That so? You must have done
awfully well on the exam.

31
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,875
Not exactly... Just voicing my wishes.

32
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,125
How about you?

33
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,833
Don't ask. I fucked up again

34
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:59,625
and I'll be stuck
in this small town forever.

35
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,167
Wish I could go to a bigger city
like Busan.

36
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:05,083
There are tons of people like us.

37
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,917
Busan?

38
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:09,958
It's a lot better than this tiny town.

39
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,333
There are many nice gay bars in Busan

40
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,083
Think what that says about the gays
in Seoul.

41
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,625
Ah. I really want to go to Seoul!

42
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,333
Shall we go to Seoul tonight?

43
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:37,500
To Itaewon?

44
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,708
Yeah, let's hit the capital
of gay kingdom in Seoul.

45
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,167
How much cash do you have?

46
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,708
...30 bucks

47
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:50,750
Are you kidding?
We cannot even pay for the train tickets.

48
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,167
I know. I know.

49
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,292
Yea. Is this Sangsu?

50
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:02,917
Cheers!

51
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,292
I heard that a gay bar opened up
in downtown.

52
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,583
Shall we go there for the second round?

53
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:23,208
There? A gay bar?

54
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:24,500
You didn't know?

55
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,333
It's been ages
since it was posted on the 'gayworld.

56
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,333
com' that a new gay bar opened
in downtown!

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,375
Oh wow! Oh wow, wow!
Finally a gay bar in our town?

58
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:34,292
That place kicks?

59
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:35,417
So many pretty boys.

60
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:38,042
Second round is on me. Let's go.

61
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,583
Let's do it!

62
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,250
Darlings, Come on in.

63
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,000
These seats are empty.

64
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,583
They're the comfiest in the house.

65
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,000
Sit.

66
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,458
What's wrong with the water?

67
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,417
It reeks like sewage.

68
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,208
Wanna go home?

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,542
What! We come all the way here
and you wanna leave?

70
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,458
Yeah. Maybe we're just too early.
Let's drink!

71
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,708
Right, right. Hey!
Let's drink, let's drink!

72
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,792
Is this your first time at my bar?
Oh, what fresh faces.

73
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:44,208
Sir, the water quality isn't
normally like this, is it?

74
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,667
Water? Seems good to me.

75
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,208
Look around carefully,

76
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:55,292
Tell me if you like anyone
and I'll invite him over.

77
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:10,875
Wow, I seriously need to go to Seoul!

78
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:16,000
Yea, what's up with this?
Our youth is going to waste.

79
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,000
If you're so crazy about Seoul,

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,250
pick up a guy from Seoul
to take you to Seoul

81
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:24,083
To pick up a guy from Seoul,
I need to go to Seoul.

82
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,167
But how can I ?

83
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,875
Is it hard?

84
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,792
Who says you have to go there first?

85
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,292
I have an older friend who lives there.

86
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you close?

87
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:46,000
A friend of a friend of my own friend…

88
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,542
What? Not your friend,
but a friend of a friend of your friend?

89
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,375
Sounds complicated. You're wasting time.

90
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,250
Some respect!

91
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,875
Once he becomes the lover of my friend,
it won't be the least bit complicated.

92
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:02,875
Right? Right?

93
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,917
Could I borrow a light?

94
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,208
Thanks for earlier.

95
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,875
I wanted to say hi
but couldn't get around to it…

96
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:35,833
Huh?

97
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,375
You're that clumsy one
from earlier?

98
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,458
I'm not clumsy!

99
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, I don't mean to be rude.

100
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,208
You'll still lend me the light?

101
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:00,250
Thanks.

102
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,333
Are you sure you're old enough
to drink and smoke?

103
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,417
You must be from... Seoul?

104
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,250
How did you know?

105
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,333
You have a Seoul accent…

106
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:21,042
Do you like Kim Kwang-seok's songs?

107
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,292
You know of Kim kwang-seok?

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,750
Yes! I like him, too!

109
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,292
You look too young to know his songs.

110
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,458
Actually I didn't know until I saw

111
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:33,875
the winner of Super Star Search
sang one of his songs.

112
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,958
I fell in love
with the lyrics and melody.

113
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,083
You won't guess…

114
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,417
I was asked my number!

115
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:15,208
What? By that person from earlier?

116
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,583
Wow! What does he do?

117
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,500
He says he's in trade.

118
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,625
And his car? BMW? Ferrari?

119
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:23,375
Ah, I don't know.

120
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,792
Come on, you should have asked.

121
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,667
My older sister told me not to even
glance at anything less than an Audi.

122
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:29,625
Oh, please shut up!

123
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,167
Then don't eat the apple!

124
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,625
Alright, alright. Eat, eat.

125
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,833
We're meeting tomorrow morning.

126
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:45,833
You're finally being wed off
to a Seoul man!

127
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,375
What. What. What?

128
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,292
Why do you like Seoul people?

129
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:00,083
Seoul talk is so attractive!

130
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,542
I'm good at Seoul accents, too!

131
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:02,667
Bullshit.

132
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,875
People take me for a local
when I'm in Seoul.

133
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,792
Yeah, right.

134
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,458
Do you have money?

135
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,667
A bit more than 20 bucks.

136
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:11,917
Are you sure that's enough?

137
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,167
My bro says he will pick me up.

138
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,083
MY BRO?

139
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,000
My, my. It's not "My Honey," yet?

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,917
What's his name?

141
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:18,833
Dunno.

142
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,792
You don't even know his name
and you're going to Seoul with him?

143
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,250
I am gonna ask his name tomorrow.

144
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,167
Be careful.
Seoul is home to a lot of con men.

145
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,917
My bro isn't that type of a person!

146
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,625
You don't even know his name
and you call him My bro. Yeesh!

147
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,583
Are you sure if he's single?
Did you ask?

148
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,333
No.

149
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,583
Do you know anything?

150
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:37,583
He's 32 years old, good-looking and
superb at singing Kim Kwang-seok's songs.

151
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:41,542
Damn. 32 is totally middle-aged.

152
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,875
He's not middle-aged!
He's got a baby-face!

153
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,125
Well, did he say he likes you?

154
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,875
Would he have asked me to
come to Seoul if he didn't?

155
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,042
Maybe he just wants to sleep with you
for a night?

156
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:51,000
Hey!

157
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,083
Stop killing the spark.

158
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,167
What would you know about love?

159
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:56,833
Love, my ass.

160
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,250
Turn out the lights!

161
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,667
I can't let my face become swollen.
Because I'm precious.

162
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,208
Yeah, right.

163
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:10,292
You... gonna sleep with him
when you get to Seoul?

164
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:14,042
If I like him after spending
some time with him.

165
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,792
This guy's firmly hooked.

166
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,292
Go to Seoul with him for a date
but don't sleep with him.

167
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:20,500
Why not?

168
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,625
You should have sex
with someone your're in love with.

169
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,500
Yeah, sure.

170
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,292
Having sex too easily means
you are cheap.

171
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:35,417
I'm going to have sex
only with someone I love.

172
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:39,000
It's an innocence
I've protected for 20 years.

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,250
Bullshit.

174
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,417
I know you've been to
the gay sauna countless times.

175
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,000
No, never been!

176
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:44,875
Are you really a virgin?

177
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,125
Of course I am.

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,458
Have you guys ever had sex?

179
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,958
Of course yes. Are you kidding?

180
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,708
When? When did you?

181
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,292
I don't remember.

182
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,708
What is this?

183
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,250
What does he say?

184
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,333
That he'll be a bit late.

185
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,000
What did Geunho say?

186
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,375
That the guy will be a bit late.

187
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,167
-You sure he hasn't been stood up?
-You prick.

188
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,875
-He says he's almost here!
-Ah. Really?

189
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,708
-What did Geunho say?
-The guy is almost here

190
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,167
Aren't you cold?

191
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,042
No, I am not

192
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,208
You seem cold.

193
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,750
Nope, not in the least.

194
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,667
300Km to Seoul

195
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,417
(Mom :'()

196
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,375
I want to go to Seoul, too.

197
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,625
Then, go.

198
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,292
I don't have the money.

199
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,625
How about I help you celebrate
the end of exam?

200
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,708
Really?　-Let's go!

201
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,958
What do you find so interesting?

202
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,667
People everywhere live the same.

203
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,292
Still, it's Seoul.

204
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:06,417
You like Seoul that much?

205
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,542
Of course! I love Seoul.

206
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,083
Now we can say we're in Seoul

207
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,000
But. Do you know where to go from here?

208
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,250
Don't you have a smart phone?/

209
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,708
Get on line 3 and transfer to line 6!

210
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,250
Oh oh oh~~~

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,292
Over there!

212
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:54,208
Itaewon Station

213
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,000
Having fun, Geunho?

214
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,333
Yeah! There are so many people here.

215
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:37,375
This is the hottest club in Itaewon.

216
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:47,875
Geunho, I'm going to go say 'hi'
to my friends.

217
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,583
Wait here.

218
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:07,667
(Yongwoo)

219
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,625
What are you guys doing here?

220
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,917
Why aren't you picking up your phone?

221
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,792
How come you're alone?

222
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,458
Have you been deserted already?

223
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,750
He is over there.

224
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,625
Oh! He's sexy!

225
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,917
btw, how did you guys get here…

226
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:50,333
We've come to catch Seoul men, too.

227
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,208
We've ruined the exam.
That means we need to have some fun.

228
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,750
You can count on me.
I will hook you up with a nice guy.

229
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,000
You're talking big.
You didn't even know where you were.

230
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,708
That's mistake.

231
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:05,042
Just remember that I am the date coach.

232
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:06,917
Don't beg me to
get numbers for you later.

233
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:09,417
Ah. You just. Shut it!

234
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,042
-Isn't that guy cute?
-Who?

235
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,042
Who?

236
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:34,708
Sorry! I need to leave.

237
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:42,083
Ah.. He wants to leave. Sorry.

238
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:54,083
Looking for someone?　-No.

239
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,792
-Let's get out of here
-Who are you?

240
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,750
I... have company.
I'm here with someone.

241
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,375
Yea, my friend really has company.

242
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,208
I'm not talking to you.

243
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,208
I don't care.

244
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,167
But I do. I said. I have company.

245
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,542
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

246
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,417
-Just give me your number.
-No. No.

247
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:08,458
Let's leave. Together.

248
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,208
No. Really. This kid really has company.

249
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,375
Do you have 20 bucks?

250
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:38,792
What..?

251
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,958
They don't take credit card.

252
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,792
You still haven't thrown this away?

253
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,792
How could I?

254
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,292
It's where I first went with you.

255
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,917
He loves me, he loves me not,

256
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:48,500
he loves, loves me not…

257
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,750
he loves me!

258
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:05,250
Hey... wait. Wait. Just a minute.

259
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,333
Oh oh oh! Wait, just wait!

260
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,000
Don't speak!

261
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,458
Wha.... What is this? This thing?

262
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,833
A drug for love.

263
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,750
Lo...love....?

264
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:55,458
Aaaah. Wait... Wait a minute! Hey. Hey?

265
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:07,833
What's your name?

266
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,875
Yongwoo.

267
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:14,542
I love you, Yongwoo. You say it, too.

268
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,333
I love you.

269
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,583
Who? Who do you love?

270
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:24,792
You. You. I love You.

271
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:38,667
Having fun?

272
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:42,000
Let's meet at Itaewon Station
tomorrow at 12 noon.

273
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:31,333
50 USD

274
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:42,708
I come here often with my coworkers.
I'm a regular.

275
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,167
It seems really old.

276
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,750
You are the first gay friend
I ever brought here.

277
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:07,292
Where should we go now?
to a park or downtown?

278
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,000
Um.....

279
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,208
Can we go to your place?

280
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:16,417
My... place?

281
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:19,500
Yea. I want to get some sleep…

282
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,667
I'm curious, too.

283
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,250
I don't live alone.

284
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,417
Ah.. You live with your family.

285
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:35,042
Can't you just say
I'm a good friend and let me in?

286
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:50,083
I live with my wife.

287
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,292
What..?!!

288
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:11,792
How come you didn't say anything
until now?

289
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:13,667
You never asked...

290
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,667
You must be out of your mind.
Where are you?

291
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:43,125
Geunho, I'm really sorry,
I never meant to deceive you.

292
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:46,167
I tried to tell you
but I didn't have a chance.

293
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:49,417
I didn't know how to say it
so you wouldn't get me wrong.....

294
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:07,417
Why couldn't you talk.
Why didn't you say anything!

295
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:33,375
Get up.... Let's go home.

296
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,250
Thank you.

297
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,167
What time's the bus?　-Seven.

298
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:11,958
Here!
