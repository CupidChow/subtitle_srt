20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,343
Wait.

21
00:01:55,343 --> 00:01:57,570
Now, Pei Xun and I have
no connection at all.

22
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,760
Why should I be afraid of him?

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,920
(This time I must not marry anyone
who has any ties with the royal family.)

24
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,800
(Surviving is of utmost importance.
Yes, that's right.)

25
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,360
(One month later)

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,160
The young man
who was with Miss Liu is Yu Minghe,

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
the only son of Mr. Yu,
the Assistant Minister of Rites.

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,280
He's a famous gentleman in the capital.

29
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,360
A gentleman.

30
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,520
I have to say,

31
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,360
Mr. Yu is knowledgeable
and full of talents.

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,400
The only son
of the Assistant Minister of Rites

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,560
cannot be stopped
in his future prospects.

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,360
Made for each other with Miss Liu.

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,760
We don't care about his future.

36
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,120
The key is to marry a stable person.

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,880
He is. He is very stable.

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
So you...

39
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Yes, I want to.

40
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,800
You need to act more reserved.
You can't be racing to marry like this.

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,680
Mother, Mr. Yu is reliable.
He's perfect for me.

42
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,800
I will leave everything to you, Mother.

43
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,920
Qing, you've only known
him for a few months.

44
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,200
Then let's set the marriage.

45
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,360
(It must be settled at once.)

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,680
(Only then can I be sure
that my fate has really changed.)

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,456
So eager to get married?

48
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,145
Let's see then.

49
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,600
We can set the marriage
on a good day first.

50
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,984
Good.

51
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Your father has not returned
from the palace yet.

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,600
Could something major have happened?

53
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,056
Something happened!

54
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:26,960
Oh, there's trouble.

55
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,840
What happened?
Why did you arrive home so late?

56
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,080
Big news in the court today.

57
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
(Is Pei Xun...?)

58
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,200
What happened?
Don't keep us in suspense.

59
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,160
His Majesty has appointed
Prince Yi as the crown prince.

60
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,960
The Emperor's edict says,

61
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,360
"The sixth prince, Pei Xun,
exhibits brilliance and unusualness."

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,920
"He is exceptionally gifted,
deemed by the heavens."

63
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,240
"Now I obey the initial decree,
follow the rituals,"

64
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,640
"acquiesce to public opinion,
and solemnly inform heaven and earth"

65
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,400
"that I grant him the imperial seal
and ascend him to crown prince."

66
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,120
"He shall shoulder governing duties
and assume the military."

67
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,640
"All departments shall report
to the crown prince for decisions."

68
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:10,205
That's all.

69
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
(Camper Pei succeeded in ascending
to the throne this time!)

70
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,200
It really was a missed opportunity
to join the royal family.

71
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,040
My lord, why would His Majesty
appoint Prince Yi as the crown prince?

72
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,400
My lord, say something.

73
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,400
It seems I'm really not fated
to become a crown princess.

74
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,368
With his character,

75
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:56,333
after becoming the crown prince,

76
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,720
he must be more arrogant and conceited.

77
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,280
Your Highness, these are sent
by local officials and feudal lords.

78
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,840
The ink is still fresh.

79
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,120
It seems they were taken by surprise
that I took this position. So hasty.

80
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,280
Whose gift is this?

81
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,240
It's from Mr. Zhao,
the Vice Censor-in-chief.

82
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,760
It's time for a replacement
of the Vice Censor-in-chief.

83
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
Yes.

84
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,640
This is from Mr. Yu,
the Assistant Minister of Rites.

85
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,400
The Assistant Minister of Rites.

86
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,840
Mr. Yu used to be
a supporter of Prince Chen.

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,800
I didn't expect him
to switch sides so quickly.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,760
(The second volume of Shanhai Jing)
He is still waiting outside.

89
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,080
Yu Minghe, the son
of the Assistant Minister of Rites.

90
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,800
Let him in.

91
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,192
Yes.

92
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

93
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,000
Mr. Yu, please.

94
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,280
I've long heard that your family
is well-versed in classics.

95
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,560
I've been looking
for this rare book for a long time.

96
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,632
This gift is really to my liking.

97
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:31,640
I'm very grateful.

98
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,800
It was nothing.
The gift was prepared by my son.

99
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,480
I didn't expect it to have the honor
of being liked by Your Highness.

100
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:38,710
Very good.

101
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:42,240
Your son must be
well-educated and learned.

102
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,280
What position does he hold now?

103
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,280
Your Highness, you flatter us.
My son hasn't joined officialdom yet.

104
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,160
What a pity.

105
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,520
This shouldn't happen.
It's crazy that nobody's scooped him up.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,856
My son is naturally indifferent
to fame and fortune.

107
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:05,240
But at home,
he often mentions Your Highness.

108
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,072
He takes Your Highness
as his role model.

109
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:09,840
He says that if he's an official,
he must follow you.

110
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,160
He is even not afraid to die
for the country and the people.

111
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,496
Thanks for your respect.

112
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,440
I'll get a chance to meet him.

113
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,080
Thank you for your appreciation.

114
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,200
- You may leave now.
- Yes.

115
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,000
Seeing Your Highness in power, they want
to curry favor with you.

116
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,416
I'll hold a feast in my palace tomorrow.

117
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:40,064
Send an invitation

119
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,288
Yes.

120
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,680

121
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,149
