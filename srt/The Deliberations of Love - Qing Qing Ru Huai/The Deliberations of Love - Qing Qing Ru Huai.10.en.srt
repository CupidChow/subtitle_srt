Qing, I...

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,080
I was writing the documents yesterday,

22
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,840
so I-I let you down.

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,560
It's okay. I know
you're busy with official duties.

24
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,000
Qing, the crown prince
has been speaking highly of me nowadays.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,920
I believe that I will soon
rise to a high position.

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,720
And it will only be a matter of time
before I am granted a title.

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,240
Mr. Yu,

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,960
stay true to your aspiration

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,040
so that you can persevere.

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,280
You squander the vibrant spring,
locking doors and windows,

31
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,160
leaving me forsaken
while you indulge in leisurely delight.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,880
Yueqing,

33
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,560
are you complaining
that I've been neglecting you lately?

34
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,400
I don't understand this poem.

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,440
But if you are to lock your windows,

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,960
I will tear down the entire wall.

37
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:06,688
(You lock doors and windows,)

38
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:07,640
(leaving me forsaken.)

39
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,680
Why are you writing this poem again?

40
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,600
I think I have forgotten
many important things over these years.

41
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,120
Have you remembered them now?

42
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,680
Almost.

43
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Your Highness, I've been
keeping an eye on the crown prince,

44
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,080
and I've finally made
some progress these days.

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,960
Tell me about it.

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,160
Yesterday, His Highness strolled
with a lady at the lantern fair.

47
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,880
That is what you got all this time?

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,120
He's the heir to the throne.

49
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,720
Isn't it normal for him?

50
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,640
Please calm down.

51
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,840
I haven't finished yet.

52
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,120
That lady is Liu Yueqing,
the daughter of Minister Liu.

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
So what?

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,840
Just a minister's daughter.

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,200
The crown prince doesn't deserve her?

56
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,080
But the lady just got
engaged to the son of Mr. Yu,

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,120
who is working in the Eastern Palace.

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,440
Liu Yueqing, the crown prince,

59
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,840
and the Yu boy.

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,560
Interesting, really interesting.

61
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,280
Your Highness, I'm sorry
for my behavior yesterday.

62
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,720
It's okay.

63
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
(This handwriting is...)

64
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,840
Your Highness,

65
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,080
did you go
to the lantern fair yesterday?

66
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,080
Yeah.

67
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Is there anything else?

68
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,240
No, I'll take my leave.

69
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,880
Go.

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,840
(Your lantern.)

71
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,400
(Anything you compose is good.)

72
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,000
Prince Chen.

73
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,080
I've long heard
you're knowledgeable and talented

74
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,920
and well favored by the crown prince.

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,680
Now it seems like
your future is truly limitless.

76
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,080
You flatter me.

77
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,040
But you are

78
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,040
too trusting.

79
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,640
Your Highness, what does it mean?

80
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,160
Let's go talk somewhere else.

81
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,600
Your Highness, Prince Chen
and Yu Minghe just left together.

82
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,480
Got it.

83
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,480
Your Highness, Prince Chen may be trying
to stir up some trouble again.

84
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,840
My royal brother simply wants
to chat with someone

85
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,560
about my family affairs.
No need to panic.

86
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,440
But Yu Minghe...

87
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,040
I don't think

88
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,960
he can be indifferent to distractions.

89
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,640
Don't let him do anything out of line.

90
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,440
Yes, I will keep an eye on him.

91
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,480
Go.

92
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,160
On the night of the Lantern Festival,

93
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,480
my subordinate witnessed

94
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,320
my brother meeting
Miss Liu at the lantern fair.

95
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,840
Oh, right.

96
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,280
During the Spring Hunting event,

97
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,440
the two of them spent
a night together in the wilderness.

98
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,680
Perhaps

99
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,720
they rekindled an old flame that night.

100
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,320
An old flame?

101
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,000
You weren't aware?

102
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,760
I was talking too much.

103
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,640
Your Highness,

104
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
please feel free to tell me.

105
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,200
My father

106
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,920
once granted a marriage between them.

107
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,480
My brother was quite pleased with it,

108
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,880
but for unknown reasons,
Miss Liu suddenly changed her mind

109
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,040
and accepted the proposal
from your family.

110
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,240
And you happened to be recruited
into the Eastern Palace.

111
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,880
So you mean

112
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,440
that the crown prince
doesn't truly value me

113
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,160
but wants to take this opportunity

114
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,440
to take revenge on me?

115
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,320
I've never thought about it this way.

116
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,960
But

117
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,120
my brother is a good person,

118
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,680
only a bit domineering

119
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,000
and selfish.

120
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,120
He's been like that
since he was a child.

121
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,320
These are just my wild guesses.

122
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,680
Perhaps the crown prince
let you work in the Eastern Palace

123
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,880
because he appreciates your talent.

124
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,880
You must have been entrusted
with important duties by now, right?

125
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,920
Just a clerk with no real authority.

126
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,520
Mr. Yu, don't be discouraged.

127
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,240
I've long heard

128
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,720
that you are incredibly talented.

129
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,720
In all honesty, I quite admire you.

130
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,760
Unfortunately,
I just didn't act fast enough

131
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,520
and you were snatched away
by my brother.

132
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,240
Now if you want to seek another way out,

133
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,440
I'll be glad to plan for you.

134
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,880
