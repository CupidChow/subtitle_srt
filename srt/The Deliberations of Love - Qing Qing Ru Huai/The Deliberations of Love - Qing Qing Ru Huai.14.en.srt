20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,360
Miss Liu, this vase

21
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,200
is a precious gift
from the Empress Dowager,

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,320
rarely seen in the capital.

23
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,440
I will surely compensate you.

24
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:07,231
Seriously?

25
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:10,520
Do you think this is an ordinary item?

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,380
Everything has a price.

27
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,760
Name your price, Your Highness.

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
Han Zhen.

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,440
(They're well prepared.)

30
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,640
6,700 taels of silver.

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,720
What? It's a rip-off.

32
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,480
Are you going to deny it?

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,240
(You devil.)

34
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,312
I don't mind asking Minister Liu

35
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:38,563
to do the accounts.

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,576
No, don't.

37
00:02:44,175 --> 00:02:45,856
The value of these treasures

38
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:50,800
will be doubled a few years later.

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,920
Father, if I get kidnapped,

40
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,440
will you come to rescue me?

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,400
Whoever dares to hurt you,
I will fight them to death.

42
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,160
You don't need to.

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,840
What if the robbers want a ransom?

44
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,560
Will you use your private money
to save me?

45
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,496
I just fooled you.
Losing my money will kill me.

46
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:07,984
Don't be silly.

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,800
(I'm doomed.)

48
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,320
Have you thought of a solution?

49
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,800
Not yet.

50
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,760
If you can't compensate,

51
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:23,898
in my opinion,

52
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:26,800
you can work in the Eastern Palace.

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,432
It's deducted from your monthly salary
until it is paid off.

54
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:33,448
What do you say?

55
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,200
(Well played.)

56
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,760
(It's your trap.)

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,576
Your Highness.

58
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:46,560
I need to discuss it

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,600
with my father.

60
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,000
(Help.)

61
00:03:50,624 --> 00:03:51,904
Get her the ink and paper.

62
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:53,800
Let Miss Liu write a letter
to Minister Liu.

63
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,176
Yes.

64
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,336
Fine.

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,280
Thank you.

66
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:10,368
(To my parents)

67
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,480
(It's a long story, but no worries.)

68
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,480
(An accident happened
in the Eastern Palace.)

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,480
(I owe His Highness six thousand.)

70
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,280
(If you have spare money,
please consider redeeming me.)

71
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,080
(If the debt is not paid tomorrow,)

72
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,200
(I'll have to work here
to offset the debt.)

73
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,080
(Fortunately, it's a cozy place.)

74
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680
(Don't worry about me.)

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,280
(I will return once the debt is paid.)

76
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,192
If Qing works in the Eastern Palace,

77
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,974
is it okay?

78
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,120
(Even if my father doesn't help,)

79
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,760
(my mother will save me.)

80
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,440
Your Highness,
I think it's inappropriate.

81
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,424
If I stay, I'm afraid
it will damage your reputation

82
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:56,760
and attract criticism.

83
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,120
Why? We're unmarried adult people.

84
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,160
But...

85
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,240
(We're fine. Just focus on your work.)

86
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,200
(Do not make His Highness unhappy.)

87
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,400
I can tell
His Highness cares about Qing.

88
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,920
Don't worry.

89
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,640
That's good.

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,440
(What a cold father.)

91
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,075
It's getting late.

92
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:48,440
Miss Liu, please go to your room.

93
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,000
So, you invited me to the Spring Hunting

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,680
to be the decoy.

95
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,520
You wanted to save
Shangguan Yan back then, not me

96
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
You set me up?

97
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,120
(I was supposed
to keep a distance from that jinx.)

98
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,720
(But I'm trapped now.)

99
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,360
(I'll be tormented before leaving.)

100
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,520
(I can't stand it.)

101
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
