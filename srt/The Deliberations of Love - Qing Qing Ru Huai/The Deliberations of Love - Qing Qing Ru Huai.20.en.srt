Please show your badge.

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,240
The general asked me to confirm

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,768
the supplies to be shipped to the camp.

23
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:06,086
Move aside.

24
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,264
- Sorry, sir.
- Sorry, sir.

25
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:09,260
But...

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,320
Get out of my way!
Go prepare the horses and carts.

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,480
If you delay
the grain transportation tomorrow,

28
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,822
I will kill you two.

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,064
- Yes.
- Yes.

(Northwest Barracks)

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,280
You're smart.

32
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:39,776
(Border Barracks)

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,960
It's all rice husks. Moldy and inedible.

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,080
Is this the food
you will send to the border?

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,480
You've seen it all, haven't you?

36
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,200
Where's the grain you requisitioned?

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

38
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,160
You don't know?

39
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,520
Han Zhen, cut off his arm.

40
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
Don't. I'll tell you.

41
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,120
I'm tired of shipping grain every day.

42
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,440
Shhh, walls have ears.

43
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,720
Go.

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Hurry up.

45
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:47,277
(Northwest Barracks)

46
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
You transport inferior grain
to the border

47
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,600
but transport good grain elsewhere.

48
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,920
What are you trying to do?
Are you privately raising troops?

49
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,840
Who is that person? Tell us!

50
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,440
It is the crown prince
who ordered the switch.

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,360
Isn't it obvious

52
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,063
where the grain is now going

53
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,800
and who is raising the private soldiers?

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
How dare you slander the crown prince?
You're asking for it.

55
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,120
When should you deliver the food
to the Northwest Barracks?

56
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,800
Tell us!

57
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,200
It will be three days
from now at midnight.

58
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,440
Sir, this matter is serious.
We must plan carefully.

59
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,640
Go.

60
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,560
Sirs, what's happening here?

61
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,920
He's been requisitioning grain
under the crown prince's name.

62
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,336
We have retrieved the grain now.

63
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,200
Everyone, take your share.

64
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,992
Thank you both.

65
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:06,520
You've really saved our whole village.

66
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,032
Sir, that's an overstatement.

67
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:10,146
We ask only to take us in
for a few more nights.

68
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,680
That's what we should do.

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,680
Come on, let's share the grain.

70
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,720
- Come.
- Hurry up.

71
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,008
Step aside.

72
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,560
His Highness didn't choose you
for nothing.

73
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,360
No, I chose him.

74
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,280
Han Zhen,
is the prince's guard camped nearby?

75
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,360
Yes, it's only 20 miles north.

76
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,976
Then could you go there?

77
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,248
I have important matters to tell them.

78
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,520
Okay. Go.

79
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:01,392
Miss Liu.

80
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:05,080
This is Yun Qiu,
the commander I mentioned to you.

81
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,840
Miss Liu.

82
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,360
Commander Yun, it's critical.
I'll just cut to the chase.

83
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,520
We encountered some people
on our way to the border

84
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,920
posing as the crown prince's soldiers
and levying grain through violence.

85
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,064
This is utterly ridiculous.

86
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:17,419
We are in need of provisions, yes,

87
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,600
but we cannot coerce the people.

88
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,688
Someone is using His Highness' name
to exploit the people

89
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:24,440
and damage His Highness' reputation.

90
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,320
I suspect there might be
a spy within the army.

91
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,680
It's my negligence

92
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,600
that not only gave the villain
an opportunity to hurt the commoners

93
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,160
but also almost ruined His Highness.

94
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,520
Fortunately, we've captured their chief.

95
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,400
We can follow this lead

96
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,960
to wipe them out in one stroke
before they make any moves.

97
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,720
We are still not clear
about the enemy's strength.

98
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,960
If we act rashly, we might alert them.

99
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,840
It will make the future investigation

100
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,661
even more difficult.

101
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,936
What do you think

102
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:01,701
we should do?

103
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,120
Han Zhen, rush back
to the Eastern Palace now

104
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,320
and report everything here
to His Highness in detail.

105
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,280
Commander Yun and I
will try our best to hold them off.

106
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,720
Notify His Highness to prepare now.

107
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,560
No. It's too dangerous
for you to stay here alone.

108
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,480
Don't worry. Commander Yun is here.

109
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,960
I swear I will protect you with my life.

110
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Alright, I will set off now.
