20
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,000
You still have the mood to play this?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,800
News of your misconduct is spreading.

22
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,040
Why are you here, Yan?

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,200
I'm here to make fun of you.

24
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,472
What's the point of playing it alone?

25
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,744
I'll play it with you.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,536
Alright.

27
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,760
Xun, you seem to have changed.

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,696
Really?

29
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:36,672
Since your mother died,

30
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,720
you've been brutal enough
to contend against the rest of us.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,800
You don't yield to anyone.

32
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,760
After becoming the crown prince,
you are no longer competitive.

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,920
Don't you want the throne anymore?

34
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,600
You are as straightforward as before.

35
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,552
I heard that you were scolded

36
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:00,902
for pleading for me.

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,320
How could I intercede for you?

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,720
I'm afraid
you would be tricked by others.

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,272
You are my rival.

40
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:11,436
They're unworthy.

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,800
It's your turn.

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,320
I hate your sanctimonious attitude.

43
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,760
Will you die if you tell me the truth?

44
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,520
I did it for my mother's last wish,

45
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,256
for the recognition of our father,

46
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:43,240
and for realizing my ambition.

47
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,000
In short, I fought for many reasons.

48
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,640
But I met someone.

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,272
She's so afraid of death,

50
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,240
but she chose to stand with me.

51
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,336
(She's timid)

52
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:56,461
(and courageous.)

53
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,000
I realize I need someone
that I can take a risk for.

54
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,000
How can I let her take risks again?

55
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Suddenly, I don't want to fight anymore.

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,808
Living a stable life is enough.

57
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:15,222
Don't you think so?

58
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Liu Yueqing, right?
Just say her name, okay?

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,520
We've been competing for many years,
but you never compromised.

60
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,760
You gave up once she showed up.

61
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,808
Do you care about my feelings?

62
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,640
Do you see me as your rival?

63
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,560
Never.

64
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,560
You're always my brother.

65
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,560
The game is over. One more round?

66
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
You distracted me.

67
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,640
Let's do it again.

68
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
No takebacks, brother.

69
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,216
Your Highness.

70
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:06,320
Why are you back?

71
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,680
I found out about the army provisions.

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,520
Someone stole them to feed their army.

73
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,352
Miss Liu is worried.

74
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:13,800
So, she asked me to return to report.

75
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,720
Who's behind this?

76
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,480
What? Liu Yueqing is there?

77
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,152
When we had a private conversation,

78
00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:22,920
Miss Liu heard it all.

79
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,480
She insisted on going
to the border with me.

80
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,960
I failed to stop her, so...

81
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,320
How could you?

82
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,560
Your Highness, what should we do now?

83
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:35,440
Get the horses ready.

84
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,120
Your Highness, you're still grounded.

85
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,080
You're always my brother.

86
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,720
Yes, I'm always your brother.

87
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,344
Go ahead.

88
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:08,480
Just leave the rest to me.

89
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,040
When should you deliver the food
to the Northwest Barracks?

90
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,920
It will be three days
from now at midnight.

91
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,200
(It will take at least three days to go
to the capital and return. Too late.)

92
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,720
Commander Yun, we must go
to the Northwest Barracks tonight.

93
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,960
But Commander Han hasn't returned yet.
I'm afraid...

94
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,200
There's no time.
Tonight is their scheduled delivery day.

95
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,728
If they keep waiting,

96
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:39,360
they will get suspicious.

97
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,736
If they move their camp,

98
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:41,920
it will be hard to find them again.

99
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,760
But you're of noble status.

100
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,360
If you get into danger,
His Highness will blame me.

101
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,480
I'll never be forgiven.

102
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,360
Rest assured. I will protect myself.

103
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,560
We're running out of time.

104
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,360
Commander Yun, we disguise ourselves
as food delivery soldiers,

105
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,720
and sneak into the Northwest Barracks,

106
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,560
so as to buy His Highness more time.

107
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:08,224
(Chen Village)

108
00:07:11,936 --> 00:07:12,781
Miss Liu.

109
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:16,480
Our men and food have been arranged.

110
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,792
You guys have all worked hard.

111
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:39,920
You may eat your dinner now.

112
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,560
Leave the unloading to them.

113
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,480
Yes.

114
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,880
Good.

115
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,696
Miss, I've done what you told me.

116
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:58,920
Can you let me go?

117
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,560
Alright, but not now.

118
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,256
General.

119
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,880
(It's really him.)

120
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,240
Why took you so long today?

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,080
General, the mountain road is bumpy.

122
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,240
Alright, get it unloaded.

123
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,640
Yes.

124
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,160
General, soldiers
have worked hard these days.

125
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,160
I got two sheep today.

126
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,760
I wonder if you would like to eat them.

127
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,240
Do you want to eat them now
or fatten them up for later?

128
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,880
Since you have sheep, just butcher them
to go with the liquor.

129
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
Kill them!

130
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,920
Where is she?

131
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
Where have you been?

132
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
Buddy, where is my master?

133
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,320
They just left with a man.

134
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,080
Pei Xun.
