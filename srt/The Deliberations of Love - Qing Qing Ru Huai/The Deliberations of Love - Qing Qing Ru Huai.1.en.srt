20
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,648
(The 22nd day of the first lunar month
in Year 12 of Yongde)

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,760
The wine served no longer appeal?

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,880
(Prince Yi, Pei Xun)
Or getting bored with your concubine?

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,160
(Princess Yi, Liu Yueqing)
Why risk your life to be Crown Prince?

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,080
When do I have a concubine?

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,160
I'm seeking one for you.

26
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,120
But I'm afraid that day won't come.

27
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,144
The moon tonight

28
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:20,182
is the same as
on the night you married me.

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,600
Do you regret it?

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,864
(Cut the bull.)

31
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:35,240
(Does it matter now?)

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,800
(We are about to die.)

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,400
If there is a next life...

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,408
Don't say it.

35
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:44,123
It's all in the wine.

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,816
Farewell to Prince Yi

37
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:01,160
and Princess Yi!

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,576
(If there is an afterlife,
I don't want to meet you again.)

39
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:06,459
(Camper Pei.)

40
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,200
(Pei Xun once told me
a prince should compete for the crown.)

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,760
(In the spirit of being a good prince,)

42
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,344
(he advanced boldly and decisively,)

43
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,640
(and eventually, he got himself doomed.)

44
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,640
(And I got roped into it, too.)

45
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,904
(Rebellion is no small matter.)

46
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:27,625
(The Emperor was furious
and gave us poisoned wine.)

47
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,432
Your Highness.

48
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:32,840
Your Highness.

49
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,336
Your Highness.

50
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,272
(Prince Yi's Mansion.)
(Prince Yi's Mansion.)

51
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,000
(Why am I here?)

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,920
Luo, what time is it now?

53
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,040
It's already one in the morning.

54
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,400
What year is it now?

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,520
(Maid of Liu's Mansion, Luo)
You must have had a deep sleep.

56
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,480
The 20th day of the first lunar month
in Year 12 of Yongde.

57
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,760
(The 20th day of the first lunar month)
The 20th day.

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,360
Where is the Prince?

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,800
His Highness is discussing matters
with General Wang in the front hall.

60
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,600
(I went back to the day
before Pei Xun's rebellion.)

61
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,160
Luo, go serve in the front hall.

62
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,280
There are distinguished guests today.
Don't neglect them.

63
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,160
Yes.

64
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,112
(One in the morning.)

65
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,250
There's still time. As long as
I stay away from the death-bringer,

66
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,360
I am able to live well in this life.

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,760
My lady, where are you going?

68
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,600
Liu Yueqing, you'd better
behave yourself.

69
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
Without my permission today,

70
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,160
you can't step out of the room.

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,880
Your Highness,
do you feel uncomfortable?

72
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,760
Luo, I feel like I'm going to die.

73
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,520
I feel cold all over my body right now.

74
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,680
My head is so dizzy,
and I feel like vomiting.

75
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,520
You seem to be pregnant.

76
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,920
That's good news.

77
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,680
His Highness will be very happy.

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,080
Yes, Luo. I am pregnant.

79
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,480
Go to see the prince now

80
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,720
and tell him I have
something very important to tell him.

81
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,184
Yes.

82
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,224
Your Highness.

83
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,200
What's the matter?

84
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,560
You are going to be a father soon.

85
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,520
Have you seen the doctor? How far along?

86
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,600
Probably two to three months.
It's too late now.

87
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,120
I'll ask Luo to get a doctor
to have a careful check tomorrow.

88
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,600
If I'm not mistaken,

89
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,720
it's been a month
since you and I last slept together.

90
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,960
I was ordered to leave the capital
for three months before that.

91
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
Who's the father?

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,296
How dare you.

93
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:55,498
Tell me, whose child is this?

94
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,760
Please spare me.

95
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,176
Tell me.

96
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,816
(Camper Pei, you fell
a little short in schemes.)

97
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:33,360
(You want to rebel? Dream on!)

98
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,000
(Now you can't do it.)

99
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,120
(You should thank me after you wake up.)

100
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:39,331
(I'm doing this to save your life.)

101
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,880
General, it's past the agreed time,
but the prince hasn't appeared...

102
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,000
No more waiting.
Proceed according to the plan.

103
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,280
Yes.

104
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,120
(What can you do now?)

105
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,080
The decree has arrived.

106
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,960
Prince Yi planned to usurp and
is hence granted poisoned wine.

107
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,840
(Oh, no.)

108
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:23,520
Farewell...

109
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,792
Wait, I know the process.

110
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,680
(I am stupid. Even if I stop Pei Xun,)

111
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
(I can't stop his bumbling accomplice.)

112
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,600
(What a bad leader,
causing me to die again.)

113
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,440
(Camper Pei, I hope
I never see you again in my next life.)
