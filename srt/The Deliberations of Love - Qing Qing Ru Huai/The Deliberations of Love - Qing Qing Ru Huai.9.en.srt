20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,720
The library in the Eastern Palace
is really full of books.

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,800
The ninth volume on the east shelf
is the Six Confucian Classics.

22
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,160
The sixth volume on the south shelf
is a collection of history books.

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,080
The west shelf contains
various military textbooks.

24
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,920
On the north shelf,
there are poems and songs.

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,720
Your Highness,
you truly embody the ideal

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,520
of being both physically

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,120
and intellectually accomplished.

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,880
Mr. Yu, you are also
a famous gentleman in the capital

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,720
with outstanding talent
and abundant knowledge.

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,560
And you write a beautiful hand, too.

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,960
Your Highness have seen my calligraphy?

32
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,400
Yes, I have,

33
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,720
and it is still vivid in my memory.

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,840
For fame and fortune,
everyone is the same.

35
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,920
What's wrong, Qing?

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,120
Father, is fame and fortune
really that important?

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,680
As it is said, where there is profit,
people endeavor.

38
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,200
People endeavor.

39
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,520
It sounds very tempting.

40
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,000
What about you?

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,600
Life is short. Fame and fortune
are merely additional.

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,360
Our Liu family has four "don'ts".

43
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,480
Four "don'ts".

44
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,680
Don't covet. Don't give.

45
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,720
Don't fantasize. Don't ask.

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,280
(Don't covet. Don't give.)

47
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,080
(Don't fantasize. Don't ask.)

48
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Your Highness,
I've finished transcribing for today.

49
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,560
May I leave the palace early?

50
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,280
It is the Lantern Festival.

51
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,600
Seems that you have a date with a lady.

52
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,400
To be honest,

53
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,080
it is true that I have
an appointment with Miss Liu.

54
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,480
Go ahead.

55
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

56
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,280
Your Highness.

57
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,040
Is this the legendary Yuliang ink brush?

58
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,080
Yes, my father gave me
when I entered the court today.

59
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,680
It is invaluable.

60
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,960
May I take a closer look at it?

61
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,520
Since you like it so much,

62
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,440
why not write a poem with it?

63
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,960
If it's good,

64
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,680
I will give the ink brush to you.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

66
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
Miss Liu, it's very bustling
in the city today.

67
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,160
The whole world is bustling,

68
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,000
all because of
people's desire for profit.

69
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,400
I don't quite understand what you mean.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,400
Luo, you can go back.

71
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
I'll just wait for Mr. Yu here.

72
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,760
He must be on his way.

73
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,120
Yes.

74
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,880
(I started with him here.)

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,520
(And I'll end it here.)

76
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,680
What's going on?

77
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,160
Yu Minghe.

78
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,880
His poetic passions ran so high
that he got himself drunk.

79
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,520
Send Mr. Yu home.

80
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,120
Yes.

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,680
Good wine.
I can still drink, Your Highness.

82
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,280
Sir, how much is this flower lantern?

83
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,600
Oh.

84
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,680
You're here to solve
the lantern riddles again.

85
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,160
So, you're a regular.

86
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,320
I just happened to win a lantern.

87
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,840
Sir, I want this lantern.

88
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,680
Miss Liu is the one
who knows the game rules best.

89
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,800
Please, Miss Liu.

90
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,120
It's just a lantern.

91
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,520
But you want a girl to win it for you.

92
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,920
It might not be appropriate
if word gets out.

93
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,720

94
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,960
