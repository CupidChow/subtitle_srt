Do you know how much
I'm worried about you?

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
It's a long story.

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,440
Well, she just got home.

24
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,520
Let her finish breakfast.

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,080
Long story short, then.

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,960
Tell me why you went
to the Spring Hunting.

27
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,080
Why did His Highness get hurt for you?

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
I always warned you to act prudently.

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,800
Father, stop asking.

30
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm done.

31
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm going back to my room.

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,400
I won't have lunch.
I don't have an appetite.

33
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,720
Qing.

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,680
What kind of appetite is that?

35
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,120
Eat your food.

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,600
How did the Spring Hunting go?

37
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,080
It went smoothly.

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,240
Father.

39
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,600
I heard the envoy
went missing yesterday.

40
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm afraid that something has happened.

41
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,200
What happened?

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,080
Oh, I just remembered.

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,280
Xun didn't come back last night either.

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,520
Could it be...

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,680
Xun.

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,000
Father, rest assured.

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,400
The envoy is safe and sound.

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,040
I did find
that someone tried to hurt the envoy,

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,360
but I've captured the assassin.

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,520
The mastermind behind this
will be found out soon.

51
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,320
Who dared

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
to kill a foreign envoy?

53
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,640
Investigate this thoroughly.

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Yes.

55
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,920
Xun, who's behind this?

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,880
Has the assassin been caught?

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,160
Is it safe where they're held?

58
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,600
Why are you so interested in this?

59
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,600
I don't want you to be troubled by this.

60
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,200
Anyway, I have nothing else to do.

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,640
How about I help you interrogate them?

62
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,160
You really don't need my help?

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,320
It's an easy job for me.

64
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,840
Why not let me try?

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,840
Brother.

66
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,960
Mind your own business.

67
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,520
Xun, I can help.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,760
Do your killers
have any professional ethics?

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,320
Make it, or kill themselves.

70
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,800
Isn't that the rule?

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,000
How could they be caught?

72
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,480
I made a mistake.

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,680
I...

74
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
Please spare me. I have another idea.

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,200
Say it.

76
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,720
Since the crown prince wants
to investigate,

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,600
how about we kill the assassin

78
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
with him?

79
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,880
What did you say?

80
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,840
How dare you.

81
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,640
Do you believe I will kill you?

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,440
Get lost.

83
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,520
You stupid dog.

84
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,160
Your Highness,

85
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,640
you really like the tea set
gifted by Mr. Yu.

86
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,480
Mr. Yu? How could I forget about him?

87
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,600
Is the position of director
of the Library Bureau still vacant?

88
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you have a candidate in mind?

89
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,280
Yu Minghe.

90
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,360
(Pei Xun.)

91
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,080
I suddenly feel sleepy.

92
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,480
I'd better leave tomorrow.

93
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,840
(No.)

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,760
Who are you? Why are you chasing me?

95
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,840
(I'll be in danger once I'm with him.)

96
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,120
(I can't put it off any longer.)

97
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,640
(Tolerance)

98
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,440
Qing.

99
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,920
I have something to tell you.

100
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Qing, I have something to tell you too.

101
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,600
(Finally.)

102
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
You speak first.

103
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,960
The crown prince intends to promote me,

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,120
letting me manage the Library Bureau
at the Eastern Palace.

105
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
The Eastern Palace?

106
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,840
Didn't you want to open an academy?

107
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,960
That was just a stopgap.

108
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,840
Since the crown prince
appreciates my talent,

109
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,920
I should rechart my life.

110
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,200
I may even get an official position.

111
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,920
It's a risky job.

112
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,840
You might be troubled
to work for the crown prince.

113
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,040
Don't worry.

114
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,920
I will not participate in court affairs.

115
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,440
I will only compile books.

116
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,880
Qing.

117
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,440
Would you be willing
to wait for me for two years?

118
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,160
Qing, tomorrow is the Lantern Festival.

119
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,080
Let's hang out tomorrow.

120
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,800
Revisit the place where we first met.

121
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,880
Okay.

122
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,640
Alright, see you tomorrow.

123
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,880
