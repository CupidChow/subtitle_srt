20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,440
Liu Yueqing is forcing me
to do this the hard way.

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,640
Your Highness, please calm down.

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,464
She's spoiled.

23
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,119
Now, send my betrothal gifts to her.

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,280
Betrothal gifts?
Who are you going to marry?

25
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,560
Who else could it be? It's Liu Yueqing.

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,720
I will ask the Ministry of Rites
to make prenuptial preparations,

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,200
determine the betrothal gifts, and...

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,960
And what? Send betrothal gifts directly.

29
00:02:10,912 --> 00:02:12,600
Understood.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,600
Wow, so many betrothal gifts.

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,800
Congratulations.

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,280
Thank you.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,920
It's all mine.

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,560
Return them.

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,920
What?

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,720
What's going on here?

37
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,504
Send them again.

38
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,312
Return them.

39
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,480
Again.

40
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
Father, return them.

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,120
It's been returned twice already.
I can't do it three times.

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,592
I'm old.

43
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:12,440
I can't be unappreciative.

44
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,480
Return them yourself if you want.

45
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,520
You changed your mind?

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,240
Yeah, I did.

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,520
Your Highness, Shangguan Yan is here.

48
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,280
I'll leave you alone and take my leave.

49
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,752
No need.

50
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
Your Highness.

51
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,232
I'm here today

52
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:02,200
to thank you for saving my life.

53
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,400
You warned me
and got a decoy to replace me

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,000
during the Spring Hunting.

55
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,240
Otherwise, I would have lost my life.

56
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,840
No need to thank me. Our two countries
have always had a good relationship.

57
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,752
My father warned me

58
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:16,544
to ensure your safety.

59
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,200
(So, the one he wanted
to save that day was Shangguan Yan.)

60
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,560
I would like
to present this veil to you.

61
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,640
Why?

62
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,240
(Present a veil?)

63
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,168
It's a tradition in my country.

64
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:06,021
Thank you for saving my life.

65
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,040
(Good for you, Camper Pei.)

66
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,320
I have work to do.

67
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,560
I will take my leave.

68
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,744
Han Zhen.

69
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,497
See her out.

70
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,840
Please.

71
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,040
Pei Xun.

72
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,984
So, you invited me to the Spring Hunting

73
00:05:57,984 --> 00:05:59,520
to be the decoy.

74
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,880
You wanted to save
Shangguan Yan back then, not me.

75
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,920
You set me up?

76
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,320
The decoy was someone else.

77
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,960
I didn't know that the assassin
would mistake you for her.

78
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,248
If it hadn't been for you,

79
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,800
why would I have risked my life?

80
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,440
I nearly died because of you.

81
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,176
Without me, you...

82
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,330
And what would you do?

83
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:23,218
Well...

84
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:26,960
Don't you know what it means
for Shangguan Yan to give you a veil?

85
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,480
What does it mean?
It's just a veil. No big deal.

86
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,352
Just a veil.

87
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:34,400
You accepted it
without knowing its meaning.

88
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,560
If you knew,
would you hop around joyfully?

89
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,816
Han Zhen.

90
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,440
The veil.

91
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,920
You...

92
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,656
No, this is my house.

93
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:12,840
Why should I leave?

94
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,320
Liu Yueqing.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,440
(Liu Yueqing, you fool.)

96
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,920
(Do you think you're
at the old Prince Yi's Mansion?)

97
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,800
Han Zhen, close the door.

98
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,208
Yes.

99
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,560
Your Highness,
are you going to play dirty?

100
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,832
Play dirty?

101
00:07:41,984 --> 00:07:43,920
