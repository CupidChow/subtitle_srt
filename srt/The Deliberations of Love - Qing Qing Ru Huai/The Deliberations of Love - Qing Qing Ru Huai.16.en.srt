20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,120
Is there any news from the crown prince?

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,600
He has barely left his palace recently.

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Really?

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,112
Something's fishy.

24
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,220
Check it out.

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Your Highness.

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,480
It's you. What are you doing here?

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
I...

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,600
Get out of here.

29
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,480
I only asked you to write
about his romantic affairs.

30
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,040
Yet you conspired against him
behind my back.

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,392
Are you trying
to murder the crown prince?

32
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:38,140
Do you have a death wish?

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,240
Luckily, you didn't betray me.

34
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:50,816
Your Highness.

35
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:55,320
I was foolish and made a grave mistake.

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,440
I have no place in the court anymore.

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,400
There is no hope for me
to make a comeback.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I beg for your guidance.

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,920
Alright, get up.

40
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,968
I have connections with Lord Shi Leming,

41
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:29,880
who's guarding the border.

42
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,320
You take this to him.

43
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,640
I think he will take you in for my sake.

44
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,120
Your future depends on your own luck.

45
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:11,884
Miss.

46
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:14,320
Your family asked me
to give this to you.

47
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,240
My family?

48
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,720
(Meet me in the Purple Bamboo Forest
at three this afternoon.)

49
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,400
I trust her.

50
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,200
Yes, I also trust her.

51
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,120
But she has a poor sense of direction.

52
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,040
What if she can't find her way back?

53
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,000
How did you know, Your Highness?

54
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,840
Wait for me, Your Highness!

55
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,080
It's you?

56
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,592
Qing.

57
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,680
Mr. Yu, please behave yourself.

58
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,376
I was wrong, Qing.

59
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,560
I regret dissolving our engagement.

60
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,640
I'm about to leave for the frontier.

61
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,600
I'm afraid I'll never return.

62
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:17,280
The only person

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,840
I can't give up is you.

64
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,680
Would you go with me?

65
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,800
No.

66
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:26,560
I will be good to you.

67
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,120
We could open an academy.

68
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,120
We could live a simple life.

69
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,600
Isn't that what you've always wanted?

70
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:35,412
I can give it all to you.

71
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,680
Yes, I did once yearn for that.

72
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,880
I only wanted to find the right person
to spend the rest of my life in peace.

73
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,400
I can do it, Qing.

74
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,120
I can give up everything for you.

75
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,560
Give up what? Your vanity or arrogance?

76
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,320
When you weighed the pros and cons,
the first thing you gave up was me.

77
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,520
No, it's not like that.

78
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,400
Thank you for teaching me a lesson.

79
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,120
I realize I need someone
that I can take a risk for.

80
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,280
Many hasty choices were made

81
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,840
because I didn't meet the right person.

82
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,920
Thank you for teaching me
what I truly want.

83
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,592
The man she wants to choose?

84
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:17,426
Is she referring to Your Highness?

85
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,328
What else?

86
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,000
I see, Your Highness.

87
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,000
So, what is it that you truly want?

88
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,800
- Is it the crown prince, Pei Xun?
- Let go.

89
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,920
Is it Pei Xun?

90
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,960
Let go of me.

91
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,040
Are you alright?

92
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,040
This line is the boundary.

93
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,160
From now on,
do not step into the capital.

94
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,333
Otherwise,

95
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:04,040
you will not leave alive.

96
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,120
Put me down.

97
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,200
You've twisted your ankle.

98
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,840
How did you know?

99
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,200
How long have you been eavesdropping?

100
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,920
I'm an above-board man.

101
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,320
Don't move. If not treated,

102
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,520
the injury will be severe,
and you may even be incapacitated.

103
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,360
Why were you there?

104
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,240
Just passing by.

105
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,440
Oh, you heard me?

106
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,240
I heard and memorized it all.

107
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,080
(What did he memorize?)

108
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,120
It's getting late.
You may leave and rest.

109
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,368
Okay.

110
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,040
No, you don't have to.

111
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,872
