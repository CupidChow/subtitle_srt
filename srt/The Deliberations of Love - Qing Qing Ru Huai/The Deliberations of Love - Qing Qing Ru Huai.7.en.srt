Hold onto me tight if you want to live.

22
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,320
You're so afraid of death.

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,720
I've been dreaming of a woman for years.

24
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,960
(Does he also remember everything?)

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,680
Your Highness,

26
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,880
what did you dream about?

27
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,360
This woman

28
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,840
cheated on me.

29
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,840
She poisoned me for her lover.

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,000
It was just a dream, Your Highness.
Don't take it seriously.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,240
It cannot be true.

32
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,840
This woman

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,120
looks much like you.

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Forgive me, Your Highness.
It's all my fault.

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,720
I will never appear before you again.

36
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,480
You will never see this face again.

37
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,440
(Nice try.)

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,680
Open your eyes. Look at me.

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,280
I dare not, Your Highness.

40
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,160
Why cancel the engagement?

41
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,360
I just...

42
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,360
I don't want to get married too early.

43
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,440
Is it marriage you don't want

44
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:45,960
or me?

45
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,360
Your Highness, it's getting late.

46
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,760
We better go back.

47
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,280
You have a wound on your hand.

48
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,120
I am too tired.

49
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,480
I can't walk.

50
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,120
I'm leaving, Your Highness.

51
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,800
The woods are infested with wild beasts.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,400
You can try

53
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,320
if you can get out of here alive.

54
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
(Wild beasts?)

55
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,800
I suddenly feel sleepy.

56
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,000
I'd better leave tomorrow.

57
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,320
I finally found you, Your Highness.

58
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,880
Why is Miss Liu here?

59
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,600
How did you hurt your hand?

60
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,760
It's okay.

61
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,840
Let's bring Miss Liu back with us.

62
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,440
It's getting late. Let's leave tomorrow.

63
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,840
What should I say to Minister Liu?

64
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,480
Tell him the truth.

65
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,720
Master, you have to think of something.

66
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,960
I don't know what to do.

67
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,400
Any traces of Qing?

68
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
We searched everywhere she usually went.

69
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,960
If anything happened to Qing,

70
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,160
I don't want to live either.

71
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,040
She will be fine.

72
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,160
Send her back to her room.

73
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,680
Master, Commander Han Zhen is here.

74
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,720
Commander Han?

75
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,120
Let him in.

76
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,920
Yes.

77
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,160
Commander Han.

78
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,040
What brought you here?

79
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,200
Miss Liu joined
the Spring Hunting yesterday.

80
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,360
Spring Hunting?

81
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,840
(Why did she join it?)

82
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,760
Where is my daughter now?

83
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,400
Miss Liu was trapped
in a pit in the forest.

84
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,080
What?

85
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,720
However,

86
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,200
His Highness has already rescued her.

87
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,920
Great.

88
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,600
However,

89
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,000
His Highness was injured
while saving her.

90
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,960
His Highness was injured?

91
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,280
Thankfully, he is fine now.

92
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,800
Oh my!

93
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
Miss Liu...

94
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,640
To repay his favor,

95
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,240
she decided to stay to look after him.

96
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,360
That's what she should do.

97
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,280

she let her guard down in this place.)
