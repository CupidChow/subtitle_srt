20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,400
Your Highness, urgent news.

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,160
The supplies you had
your personal guards escort is missing.

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,088
Report from the border guards said

23
00:01:57,088 --> 00:01:59,680
they hadn't received any of them
dispatched by the court.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,960
Now there's disorder at the border.
They're reporting to the court,

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
hoping to get new supplies.

26
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,288
Your Majesty,

27
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:19,360
there's a rumor that the crown prince
has withheld the army's supplies,

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
causing food shortages on the frontline.

29
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,832
Such an incident occurred
under the crown prince's watch.

30
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:30,368
I'm afraid...

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,216
Detaining the food
is not the worst thing.

32
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:35,480
My greater fear is that someone
may give it to their own army.

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,600
Mr. Yu, don't slander recklessly.

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,000
Who in the capital doesn't know
that the crown prince is tyrannous?

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,720
My son just started handling
affairs in his house.

36
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,576
For no reason, he was dismissed,
driven out and cut off

37
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:49,720
from any future official career.

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,200
We are discussing an important matter.

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,792
Mr. Yu, don't bring up
your own family matters

40
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:55,520
to make a fool of yourself.

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,960
You!

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
What's your view on this, General Wang?

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,880
Your Majesty, I suspect there is
something strange about this matter.

44
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,560
The crown prince is benevolent
and dedicated to the country.

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,360
He would definitely not do such a thing.

46
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,224
There are indeed many doubts

47
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:23,008
about the army's supplies.

48
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:25,728
General Wang,

49
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:31,280
go to the border immediately
to investigate the matter thoroughly.

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

51
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,360
Mr. Yu, is there anything else?

52
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,480
Please help us, Your Majesty.

53
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,280
This is a petition from victims
of the crown prince's power abuse.

54
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,240
My son is engaged
to Minister Liu's daughter.

55
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,840
The crown prince forced him
to break off the engagement.

56
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,000
Then he sent the betrothal gifts
to Liu's house right away.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,240
His Highness was blatantly
snatching someone's wife away!

58
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,232
My poor son is loyal to the country,

59
00:04:31,232 --> 00:04:34,624
but has run into such an immoral prince.

60
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,440
Prepare the decree.

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
Your Highness, good news!

62
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,080
Tell me about it.

63
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,240
The crown prince made a mistake
in transporting the supplies,

64
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,880
causing a food shortage crisis
on the frontline.

65
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,280
His Majesty is furious and wants
to confine the crown prince.

66
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,440
What kind of good news is that? Get out!

67
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,456
(Something is odd about this.)

68
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:12,360
(I need to talk to Father.)

69
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,080
Father, I heard the news.

70
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Although he is cunning and scheming,

71
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,000
always up to no good...

72
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,040
Even though he is misbehaving every day,

73
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,080
you can't just confine him
based on some ungrounded rumors.

74
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,280
That's a bit too impetuous.

75
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,680
What do you think
happened to the supplies?

76
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,720
It must be someone
trying to set up my brother.

77
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,000
Can't I see

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
what even you can see?

79
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,400
That's true.

80
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,080
I'm confining him temporarily
to avoid suspicion.

81
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,720
Besides, he's been grabbing
too much attention lately.

82
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,080
I've had General Wang go to the border
to thoroughly investigate it.

83
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,720
The truth will come out.

84
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,520
You're so wise, Father.

85
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,020
(Why isn't he back so late?)

86
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,392
His Highness is very busy today

87
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:38,820
and can't accompany you for the meal.

88
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,340
Your Highness,
please receive the decree.

89
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,580
What exactly has happened?

90
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,180
Here's the decree.

91
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,820
During the crown prince's supervision,
he failed in military duties

92
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,700
and made an inexcusable error
in transporting the army's provisions.

93
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,420
His conduct has been poor,
and under criticism.

94
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,340
From today, he shall be deprived
of his title and confined to his palace.

95
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,040
Without His Majesty's permission,
he shall not leave the palace.

96
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:30,450
That's all.

97
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,260
Wait. Here's His Majesty's oral decree.

98
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,940
"Let my arrogant son kneel and reflect."

99
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,460
Your Highness, please.

100
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,780
It may rain tonight.

101
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,296
The rain is too heavy. Go back.

102
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,140
Thank you for your care
in the past few days.

103
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,460
I'm afraid I won't be able
to repay it in the future.

104
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,660
Right, you will leave eventually.

105
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,540
Then why are you here?

106
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,940
Rather than felling dejected
after losing you,

107
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,500
I might as well
get used to it from now on.

108
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,940

make me think you like me.
