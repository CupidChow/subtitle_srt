00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,360
I can't take any more.

Don't worry. It wasn't poisoned wine.

52
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,520
- Mr. Zhou. Mr. Wang.
- Please. Another drink.

53
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,680
- Okay.
- Drink.

54
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,360
- Let's have a drink.
- Fill it up.

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,520
Mr. Wang, I heard
that you obtained a treasure.

56
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,000
Commander Han.

57
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:51,286
May I know where my daughter is now?

58
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,368
Well,

59
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:58,058
Miss Liu said
she felt anxious in crowded places,

60
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,880
so she went to rest in another room.

61
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Yes, my daughter has this problem.

62
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,280
I forgot after a few shots.

63
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,760
Where is His Highness?

64
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,400
Yeah, he hasn't shown up yet.

65
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,800
Yeah, what's taking him so long?

66
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,560
We are about to start the banquet.

67
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,600
(In that case, I guess it must be done.)

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,800
Looks like my brother
is putting on airs.

69
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,920
As his elder brother,
I should discipline him.

70
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,200
Well, why not come with me

71
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,960
to find His Highness?

72
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,680
Okay, let's go with Prince Chen

73
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,400
to find His Highness.

74
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,440
Good, let's go.

75
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,280
- Okay.
- Let's go.

76
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,600
- Please.
- Come on.

77
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,848
I can't finish my meal.

78
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,747
Go home with Qing?

79
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,800
His Highness might be resting.

80
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,200
Don't you want to know
why His Highness is absent?

81
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,640
Yes, we want to.

82
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,600
Xun, we're expecting you.

83
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,600
(Where is she?)

84
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,200
I just took a nap. Sorry for being late.

85
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:46,904
Xun.

86
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,280
Your inkstone looks nice.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
Xun, your...

88
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,520
What are you looking for, Yan?

89
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,400
(No way. She came in.)

90
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,800
Xun, I have to lecture you.

91
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,400
Even as the crown prince,
you can't ignore the rules of etiquette.

92
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,600
You're right.

93
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,872
Sorry to keep you waiting.

95
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:30,800
I've prepared a show

96
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,120
for you all.

97
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,800
(What trick is he playing?)

98
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,760
Please move to the front yard.

99
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,560
Your Highness, what happened?

100
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,240
She might accidentally drink the tea
that Yan prepared for me.

101
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,440
He really risks everything.

102
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,640
Your Highness, she is all right now.

103
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,680
You may leave.

104
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,560
Yes.

105
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,280
Liu Yueqing, do you remember
who took you to my bedroom?

106
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,720
A servant.

107
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,680
Our guards verify every new servant

108
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,800
to ensure absolute safety.

109
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,480
This servant must have mingled
with the guests.

110
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,091
This Eastern Palace is not a place

111
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:32,400
where he can come and go as he wishes.

112
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,920
Xun, what are you doing?

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
It's dangerous.
What if someone gets hurt?

114
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,000
If they're cowards,

115
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,360
they shouldn't be here.

116
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,008
Really?

117
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:58,268
Brother.

118
00:08:58,784 --> 00:08:59,880
Watch out.

119
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,360
Xun.

120
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:06,927
Calm down.

121
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,920
Please step aside.

122
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,520
His Highness really is something.

123
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:28,828
(Where am I?)

124
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:30,656
(Wait.)

125
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,920
You started it.

126
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,560
(Liu Yueqing, are you crazy?)

127
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,400
(It's so embarrassing.)

128
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,400
(Wait, when was I drugged?)

129
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,680
Why does the tea make me dizzy?

130
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,440
(The tea? I tried to be cautious,
yet I still fell into the trap.)

131
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:05,984
(They dare to do it
in the Eastern Palace.)

132
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:08,680
(I guess they are targeting Pei Xun.)

133
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,560
(Again? Bad things happen to me
every time I meet him.)

134
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hold your horses.

135
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,400
Catch him.

136
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,280
Catch him. Go on.

137
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,600
Who instructed you
to drug His Highness? Speak!

138
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,440
Your Highness, please spare me.

139
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,720
Please spare me.

140
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,800
Xun, this person looks timid.

141
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,120
He has no courage to drug you at all.

142
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:49,440
Who do you think

143
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:52,480
gave him the courage?

144
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,640
Well, how should I know?

145
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,080
It's just a warning this time.

146
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,960
Whoever does it again will be executed.

147
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,080
Father, let's get out of here.

148
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,320
Qing, why did you come here?

149
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,528
Let's go.

150
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:16,960
It's a dangerous place. Let's leave.

151
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,432
Wait a bit longer.

152
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,240
His Highness is wise.

153
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,472
He is truly audacious.

154
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:29,040
How dare he drug His Highness.

155
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,520
- Everyone.
- Can't let it go.

156
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,840
Go back to the banquet now.

157
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,240
It's over. Come on.

158
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,664
Your Highness.

159
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:39,845
Please.

160
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,376
Where were you just now?

161
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:50,900
Aren't you having a rest?
