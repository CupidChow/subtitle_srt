=Episode 6=

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,520
Father, the Spring Hunting this year
differs from the previous ones,

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,200
with foreign envoys joining us.

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,240
Diplomacy is important.
Xun is still young.

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,120
He's clever, but he lacks experience.

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,480
I should be in charge of this event.

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,880
What do you think, Xun?

26
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,360
I agree with what Yan said.

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,320
I indeed lack experience.

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,320
But I hope you can let me try.

29
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,600
After all, you've asked me
to assist in governing.

30
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,960
I can't only do things
I'm already experienced in.

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,936
Xun, it's not a child's play.

32
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:29,480
You can't do as you please.

33
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,200
It's not a test
to accumulate experience.

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,000
Father, Xun is young and impulsive.

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,760
I should be in charge of this event.

36
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,984
I actually think

37
00:02:41,984 --> 00:02:43,904
what Xun said makes sense.

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,720
If the crown prince
can't even host a hunting event,

39
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,120
how can he take the responsibility
of ruling a country?

40
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,696
I don't agree.

41
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:56,080
Father, you can't favor him

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,280
because he's the crown prince.

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,680
What's your opinion then?

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,880
I...

45
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,760
I have an idea.

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,240
I'll present your military achievements
with a pie chart.

47
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,720
Whoever hits
their own military achievement area

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,760
will be in charge of the Spring Hunting.

49
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,360
Go ahead.

50
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,600
I'll listen to you.

51
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,896
My two sons.

52
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:39,875
Get started.

53
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,832
Brother, please.

54
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:48,640
(Pei Yan, Pei Xun)

55
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,376
Well...

56
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:54,014
Xun, you shall be in charge

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,280
of the Spring Hunting.

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,600
Thank you.

59
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,168
Congratulations, Your Highness.

60
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,224
It's a not surprise.

61
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:14,233
No big deal.

62
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,080
The hunting event will be splendid.

63
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,960
Do you want to invite Miss Liu?

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,640
It's an event for men. What can she do?

65
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
It's a competition among men,

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,360
so it's a good chance
to let her see your charm.

67
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:34,240
Mind your own business.

68
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,280
Spring Hunting?

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Thanks for his kindness, but...

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,080
According to His Highness,
if you refuse,

71
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,920
he let me give you this letter.

72
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,600
(Miss Liu, if you don't want
to repay the favor you owe me,)

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,320
(I will have to let your betrothed
pay it back.)

74
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,720
This is moral kidnapping.

75
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,600
Camper Pei.

76
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Camper Pei?

77
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
Your Highness, here's one more thing.

78
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,600
Speak.

79
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
Prince Chen has targeted Shangguan Yan,
the envoy from Qiang.

80
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,800
And he has arranged for assassins,

81
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,600
planning to act
during the Spring Hunting.

82
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,720
Old tricks again.

83
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,840
You just started ruling.
If anything happens to this envoy,

84
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,480
you will be blamed for that.

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,880
However, Shangguan Yan
has always been veiled.

86
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
No one has ever seen her face.

87
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,680
I have prepared a decoy.

88
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,120
I'll lure them
to the west of the hunting ground

89
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,320
and capture them all.

90
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,560
The hunting event
will be more interesting.

91
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,400
Why is her face covered?

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,960
They say it's a tradition.
Girls always veil their faces

93
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,800
unless they meet the men they like.

94
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,328
Unbelievable.

95
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:13,400
Well.

96
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,680
There aren't other women
at the Spring Hunting.

97
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,520
It won't be hard to find her.
Go as planned.

98
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,800
Yes. And about the crown prince...

99
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,560
What about him?

100
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,120
This event gives us a rare opportunity.

101
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,568
Besides, it's normal for there
to be dangers during a hunt.

102
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:31,616
How about...

103
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,928
I kill him?

104
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,480
He's my brother. How dare you.

105
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,040
Don't you dare. He's my brother.

106
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,880
You scoundrel,
how dare you hold that thought!

107
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,616
Spare me, Your Highness!

108
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,080
He can't see me.

109
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,000
Miss Liu.

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,576
He saw me.

111
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,496
You're late, Miss Liu.

112
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:09,240
The Spring Hunting has already begun.

113
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,712
It's okay. Anyway, I won't go hunting.

114
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,316
I...

115
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,600
I'll enjoy the scenery.

116
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,800
His Highness instructed me to tell you
to wait for him in the main camp.

117
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,800
Okay.

118
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,000
I didn't promise I would wait for him.

119
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,200
Why is there another one?

120
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,920
What's going on?
Why are there two women wearing veils?

121
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,080
Split up and act. Kill the two of them.

122
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,920
(I'll lure them to the west
of the hunting ground and capture them.)

123
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,024
The west? This direction?

124
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:39,040
No.

125
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,120
Help!

126
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,320
It's an ambush!

127
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,992
It's done.

128
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:12,200
Xun, you failed this time.

129
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,240
Help!

130
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,320
Who are you? Why are you chasing me?

131
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,400
(I still can't escape in this life.)

132
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,000
