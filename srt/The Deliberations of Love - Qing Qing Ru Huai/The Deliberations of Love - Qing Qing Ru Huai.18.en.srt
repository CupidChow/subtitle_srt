Take the medicine.

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,064
Okay.

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,744
I'll do it.

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,008
Now can you tell me

24
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:04,880
why you broke off the engagement?

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,400
Why do you tend to hold grudges?

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,120
It's been gnawing at me.

27
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,200
Because I was afraid.

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Afraid of what?

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,280
(I can't tell him
that I was afraid of death, can I?)

30
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,320
Nothing. I'm not afraid now.

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,400
- Really?
- Yes.

32
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,080
(Pei Xun is much more dependable.)

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,448
(This life)

34
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:34,080
(will never end the same way.)

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,728
You can go home

36
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:39,440
and don't come to my palace
for the next few days.

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,024
Without my father's permission,

38
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,776
no one can see me.

39
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,696
Don't worry.
After everything is settled,

40
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:52,240
I will surely bring you back myself.

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,480
After all, Minister Liu
has already received my betrothal gifts.

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,216
Alright.

43
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,384
Your Highness.

44
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,360
I'll go back to pack my things.

45
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,640
His Majesty has already asked
General Wang to find out the truth.

46
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,840
(General Wang.)

47
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,040
The result should be out soon.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,360
I suspect there is
a mole involved in the matter.

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,960
Tomorrow, after Wang Kun sets off,
you go to the border.

50
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,192
Yes.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
You must do it secretly.

52
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,600
(If I remember correctly,)

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
(he was Pei Xun's right-hand man)

54
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
(in the last two lives.)

55
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,088
(After Pei Xun was given death,)

56
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:47,142
(he disappeared.)

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,992
(And how was the treason exposed)

58
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:51,080
(last time with me having Pei Xun)

59
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,760
(under house arrest?)

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,800
(Perhaps he had intended to rebel.)

61
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:02,330
No way.

62
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:06,048
The road to the border
is full of dangers.

63
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:07,562
I would be worried.

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,360
Moreover, His Majesty has already sent
someone to investigate the matter.

65
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,160
No need for you to make an extra trip.

66
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,440
Whether you agree or not, I have to go.

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,240
Pei Xun's character

68
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,120
and the achievements he's made
since he became the regent

69
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,480
have been seen by all.

70
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,800
How could he do something
like embezzling military supplies?

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
If this is really a trap for him,

72
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,400
he can hardly prove his innocence.

73
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,704
Once he is in trouble,

74
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:35,120
it's hard for you,
who received his betrothal gifts,

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,320
to escape the implications.

76
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,640
A-Are you threatening your father?

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,640
I wouldn't dare.

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,360
Fine, go.

79
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,200
But when you come back,
don't return the betrothal gifts.

80
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,920
I only just got my hands on them.

81
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,320
You are the best father in the world.

82
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,560
What spell did His Highness put on you?

83
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,328
My child,
it's your first time to travel far.

84
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:13,241
Take good care of yourself.

85
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,880
The journey will be tiring.

86
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,880
This is my hefty love for you.

87
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,880
Y-You have to be sparing
in your spending.

88
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,760
Father.

89
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,640
Father.

90
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,840
Enough. You've been keeping
so much private money from me.

91
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,568
I should have a share in it too.

92
00:05:41,856 --> 00:05:42,760
Give it to Qing.

93
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,640
Don't worry. With your hefty love,

94
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,480
I will take good care of myself.

95
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,560
- Good.
- Enough.

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,440
Good.

97
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,240
Then you could let go.

98
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,944
Thank you, Father.

99
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,486
Never mind.

100
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:02,600
Now you prioritize outsiders over us.

101
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,760
Do whatever you like.

102
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,544
Go ahead.

103
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,520
Father, Mother,

104
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:17,880
it's such a big favor.

105
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,560
When I return, I'll make sure
to take good care of you.

106
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,680
Luo, take good care of my parents.

107
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,680
Don't worry, Miss Liu.

108
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,000
Go ahead.

109
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:48,189
Master.

110
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,947
Miss Liu.

111
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:13,160
Why are you here and dressed like this?

112
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,000
I heard what you were
talking about that day.

113
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,200
Y-You are not...

114
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,360
I am going with you.

115
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,200
No way, this is not a game.

116
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,560
It's fraught with danger
all the way to the border.

117
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,112
If His Highness knows,

118
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:27,920
he will definitely chop me off.

119
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,080
I promise to return
as soon as I uncover the truth

120
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,400
and won't get in your way.

121
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,920
Otherwise, I will go alone.
