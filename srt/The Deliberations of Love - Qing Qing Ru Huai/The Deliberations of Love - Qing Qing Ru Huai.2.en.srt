How dare you.

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,928
- Please spare me.
- Whose child is this?

22
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:52,040
Prince Yi planned to usurp and
is hence granted poisoned wine.

23
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,160
Miss Liu, wake up.

24
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,000
(Luo? Here we go again?
Will it ever end?)

25
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,672
My girl,

26
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:22,800
(Mrs. Liu)
I can't live without you. My lord.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,736
What are you so unhappy about?

28
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,560
If you don't want to marry Prince Yi,

29
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,400
(Minister Liu)
even if it costs me my life,

30
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:32,743
I'll refuse this marriage

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,240
in front of His Majesty.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,920
Marriage?

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,120
Luo, what's today's date?

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,440
Did your sleep addle your brains?

35
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,800
Miss Liu, it's August
in Year Nine of Yongde.

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,320
Year Nine.

37
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,400
Great! His Majesty just granted
the marriage. There's still time.

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,840
I haven't married yet. Thanks, God.

39
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:03,080
My head.

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,560
Qing.

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,800
She's delirious. I have to
refuse the marriage now.

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,840
Miss Liu, you should take the medicine.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,320
Father hasn't come back
from canceling the marriage.

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,360
How can I take the medicine now?

45
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,120
You seemed pretty happy
about the marriage a few days ago.

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,480
Why did you suddenly change
your mind after waking up?

47
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,400
You are still young.
It's normal if you don't understand.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,720
(For a person who values life like me,)

49
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,960
(what is love compared to survival?)

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,880
(Tolerance)
Qing.

51
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
How's it going, Father?

52
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,880
The Emperor remembers
our family's service to the court

53
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,000
over the years.

54
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,320
For the sake of it,
His Majesty said it was only a joke

55
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:07,602
and agreed.

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
She refused?

57
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,320
(Prince Yi's Guard, Han Zhen)
She's short-sighted and unworthy of you.

58
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,400
Soon, she will surely cry her eyes out,

59
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,800
regretting today's action.

60
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,880
I think so.

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,720
Father, I cannot thank you enough.
I'll take this all.

62
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,680
Qing, although the Emperor
has agreed to dissolve our marriage,

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,760
we shouldn't be ungrateful.

64
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,480
You'd better stay home
and rest. It's safer.

65
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,928
Okay, Father. It's safer.

66
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,894
It's safe.

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
(As long as I get rid of that jinx,)

68
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,600
(I can stay alive.)

69
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,320
Whose child is this?

70
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,640
Please spare me.

71
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,912
Tell me.

72
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,880
Another nightmare, Your Highness?

73
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,488
Yes, it's been
the same dream for decades.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,080
Did you see that woman's face this time?

75
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:48,704
(Prosperity)

76
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,472
Now,

77
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:59,869
Prince Chen and Prince Yi
are fighting fiercely for the throne.

78
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,360
His Majesty lays sick in his bed.

79
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:07,487
The political landscape is complex.

80
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,040
You did the right thing
by breaking off your engagement.

81
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,576
(That Camper Pei)

82
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:14,947
(is really obsessed.)

83
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:16,506
It's okay.

84
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:20,360
I've carefully chosen for you

85
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,440
a new groom from a reputable family.

86
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,520
The eldest son of General Wang
is a fine young man.

87
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,720
W-Who?

88
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,280
The eldest son of General Wang.

89
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,120
(Pei Xun's terrible ally
in his previous life.)

90
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,440
No, Father. You must think it over.

91
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:44,064
What's wrong?

92
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:48,080
Our family and General Wang's
are well matched

93
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,920
General Wang has no concubines
and only two sons.

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,680
When you marry into their family,
you'll be in charge.

95
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,320
You'd be the sole mistress of the house.
Isn't it good enough for you?

96
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,352
General Wang...

97
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:03,168
Anyway, I won't marry into their family.

98
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,400
Enough. You don't want Prince Yi.

99
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,000
Now General Wang's eldest son.

100
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,160
So, what kind of person do you want?

101
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,680
My own desire is to find
someone stable to live this life with.

102
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,800
The military family heirs are bound
to get involved in fights.

103
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,320
If they start a rebellion or something,

104
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,640
our family would be executed with them.

105
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,688
Stop talking nonsense.

106
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:29,600
What do you want?

107
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,280
I heard there'd be
a lantern festival tomorrow.

108
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,640
Many young masters
from noble families will be there.

109
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,000
Choosing a scholar is better
than choosing a warrior.

110
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:43,296
Literary activity is always safer
than violence.

111
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,880
How about I pick
a scholar boy? It's safer.

You really have a good eye.

121
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,360
That is a prize for the festival.
It's not for sale.

135
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,312
Yu Minghe, a do-nothing.

136
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,857
Unfit for significant tasks.

137
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,120
(That is good. Low-key and safe.)

138
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,600
Sir, why did you stop writing?

139
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,560
One more question
and you can win the first place.

140
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,240
I'm just doing this for fun, not to win.

141
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,040
The first place can be left for someone
who truly wants to win.

is that he is low-key and humble.)

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,520
(He's a very safe choice.)

145
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,000
Would you mind writing
a poem now as a memento?

146
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,720
You can choose whatever prize
you want from the shop.

147
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,040
Could I give this lantern
to this young lady?

148
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,160
Of course, you can.

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,800
Thank you. I'm not going
to take your lantern for nothing.

150
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,840
You give me the lantern,
and we compose a poem together, okay?

151
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,200
That'll be a romantic story.

152
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:03,304

I look for her in vain.)
