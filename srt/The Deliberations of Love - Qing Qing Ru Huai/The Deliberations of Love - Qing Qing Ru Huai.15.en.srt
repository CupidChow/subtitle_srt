The white flower needs
to match the pink one.

Okay.

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,064
Look at her.

25
00:02:04,064 --> 00:02:06,480
Looks like she's meant
to be the hostess of this palace.

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,504
Perfect.

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,176
Miss Liu.

28
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,720
Your Highness.

29
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:23,683
Miss Liu.

30
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,960
Have you filed the documents
at the Book Pavilion?

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,640
The Book Pavilion?

32
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,438
I haven't yet.

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,120
Then come with me.

34
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,264
You only focus on the ink.

35
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:09,120
You're ignoring me.

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,776
Dark ink dries too easily,

37
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:14,521
while light ink looks plain.
I have to concentrate.

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,520
Yueqing.

39
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,960
What are you thinking? Come here.

40
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,280
Grind the ink stick.

41
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,576
You can't?

42
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,640
Dark ink dries too easily,

43
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:19,584
while light ink looks plain.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,712
(Dark ink dries too easily,)

45
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:26,534
while light ink looks plain.
I have to concentrate.

46
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,680
Your Highness, you don't need to stay.

47
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,720
Don't disturb my work.

48
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,400
Am I distracting you?

49
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,208
Alright.

50
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,080
(It's probably just a coincidence.)

51
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:08,880
(How could he possibly remember?)

52
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,760
Your Highness,
this is freshly stewed soup.

53
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,560
Has she eaten dinner yet?

54
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,168
Who?

55
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,080
Oh, she's still in the Book Pavilion.

56
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,118
Dinner has been sent over.

57
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,880
Your Highness.

58
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Your Highness, go to sleep.

59
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,000
Kill the light and sleep.

60
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,880
(Good heavens, what happened?)

61
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,077
(I must be dreaming.)

62
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,176
(I'm doomed.)

63
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,776
(What should I do?)

64
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,320
Luo, why are you sleeping
in my room again?

65
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,160
You're awake?

66
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,560
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

67
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,240
Yesterday,

68
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,304
someone restrained me from leaving,

69
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:07,835
asking to sleep together.

70
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,480
(How could this happen?)

71
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,344
(This isn't Prince Yi's Mansion.
And I'm no longer his wife.)

72
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:18,429
(How could I do this?)

73
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:23,488
Here's the thing.

74
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:26,080
I sleepwalk sometimes.

75
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
I can't remember what I did.

76
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,880
If it happens again,

77
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,200
you must wake me up.

78
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,960
Oh, is there a next time?

79
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:52,125
Well,

80
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,640
I haven't finished my work
at the Book Pavilion yet.

81
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,880
I have to go.

82
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,320
Miss Liu, you look so flustered.

83
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,400
Did you do something wrong
to His Highness?

84
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,160
I didn't.

85
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,880
I guessed right.

86
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,920
What exactly have you done?

87
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,800
I just made a mistake
that all women would make.

88
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,280
His Highness is magnanimous.

89
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,600
If you make a mistake,

90
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,220
he will surely forgive you.

91
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,840
Miss Liu, no worries.

92
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,264
Really?

93
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,840
Your Highness.

94
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,440
Miss Liu just made a mistake
that all women would make.

95
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,360
Please forgive her.

96
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:32,640
You may leave now.

97
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,728
Yes.

98
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,800
(Han Zhen, you're a fool.)

99
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,400
(Has he left?)

100
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,320
Am I some sort of wild beast?

101
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,920
No, you're a handsome prince,

102
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,200
gallant and charming.

103
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,040
How could you be a wild beast?

104
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,760
Then why are you avoiding me?

105
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:06,708
Am I?

106
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:08,840
I'm not.

107
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,480
I have a lot of things to do.

108
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,760
Sorry, I have to work.

109
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,560
Do you really have so much work to do?

110
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,920
(Get out of here.)

111
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,584
