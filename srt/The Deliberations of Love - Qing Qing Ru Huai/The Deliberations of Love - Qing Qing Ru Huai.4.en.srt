Oh, stop dilly-dallying.
It's not good to be late.

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,880
Father, can we not go?

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,200
We just declined
his marriage proposal recently.

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,640
He has gained power now.
We can't afford to offend him.

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,400
You cannot cause
trouble again. Let's go.

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,528
Father.

26
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:08,703
Father.

27
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,800
There will be so many people
at the crown prince's banquet.

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,920
How will His Highness
specifically notice you?

29
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,880
We just need to go through
the motions and blend in.

30
00:02:22,752 --> 00:02:24,000
Father.

31
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:25,720
(Eastern Palace)

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,440
- Your Highness.
- Please come in.

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,040
You're the crown prince.
How can you personally welcome guests?

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
It is improper.

35
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,920
What do you know?
I call this being close to the people.

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,760
Xun, my dear brother.

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,432
Yan.

38
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:40,704
Please stop.

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,360
The banquet is in the east hall.
The ministers are waiting for you.

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,560
Are they waiting for me?

41
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,088
Of course. They all said it.

42
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:51,000
The banquet wouldn't start
until you came.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,400
(Prince Chen, Pei Yan)
How outrageous! This is your palace.

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
I will go and discipline them now.

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,576
(Still not here?)

46
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:11,679
(Could it be...?)

47
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
Let's go.

48
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:20,672
Go.

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,440
Your Highness, what are we doing here?

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,680
Wait and we'll see.

51
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,280
Father, follow me.

52
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,548
Qing.

53
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:37,440
Why're you so familiar with this palace,
even knowing the back door?

54
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,520
(Living here for two lives,
how could I not be familiar?)

55
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,720
Lucky guess. Father, it's safer
to take the backdoor.

56
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,400
- Guess?
- Alright. Let's go.

57
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,560
Minister Liu, you're late.

58
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:00,896
I beg your pardon, Your Highness.

59
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,720
There were traffic jams on the road,
so we are a bit late.

60
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,400
Tell him we lost our way.

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Who is this?

62
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,800
This is my only daughter, Liu Yueqing.

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,200
Qing, greet His Highness.

64
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,520
Greetings, Your Highness.

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,760
Minister Liu, we are quite busy.

66
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,000
If there are any oversights,
please forgive us.

67
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,240
Your Highness, you are too polite.

68
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,000
Minister Liu, have you seen
this newly renovated mansion?

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,800
Let me show you around.
Please, this way.

70
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,600
Come this way, please.

71
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:46,197
Miss Liu,

72
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:48,080
this is the first time I've met you,

73
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,080
but I have a feeling of déjà vu.

74
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,120
Perhaps it's because I have
a common face

75
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,800
which you can see
everywhere on the streets.

76
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,640
Is that so?

77
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,080
I suddenly have a severe headache
due to an old illness.

78
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,640
Are you okay?

79
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,760
It's nothing serious.

80
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,000
I have heart palpitations
when seeing many people.

81
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,640
You may rest in the female quarters
in the west wing.

82
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,536
Thank you.

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,520
Glad to see this. Let me calm my nerves.

84
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,440
No, you can't...

85
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,600
It's not for you.

86
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,896
Thanks.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,080
Why does the tea make me dizzy?

88
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,080
Miss, you look unwell.

89
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,000
How about I take you to rest
in the women's quarters?

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,760
You can leave with your family
after the banquet is over.

91
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,200
Okay, thank you.

92
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,656
Be careful.

93
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,048
Watch your step.

94
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,320
What's going on?

95
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,672
(Pei Xun,)

96
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,292
(why are you still haunting me?)

97
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,600
Your Highness.

98
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,760
Yan, how much have you had to drink?

99
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:14,222
Xun,

100
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:16,192
after becoming the crown prince,

101
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:20,416
you're no longer close to me.

102
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,280
I'm grieved.

103
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,200
Han Zhen, escort
Prince Chen back to his seat.

104
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,120
Yes. Your Highness.

105
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,840
I'm so grieved.

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,736
(So hot.)

107
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,720
(So hot.)

108
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,400
You're sober now.

109
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,480
The grief made me sober.

110
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,480
I can walk by myself.

111
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,624
You don't need me

112
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:36,256
to tell you what you're gonna do, right?

113
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,792
No.

114
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,160
If the crown prince loses his morals...

115
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
I'm so hot, Pei Xun.
