20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,600
Yueqing.

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,800
Yu Minghe, I should have known.

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,800
You're behind all of this.

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,400
Are you surprised, Your Highness?

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,200
I'm not an incapable man.

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,120
What do you want?

26
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,400
To reunite you two, of course.

27
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,112
Now that everyone's here,

28
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:12,480
let's get on with it.

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,664
Yu Minghe.

30
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:15,904
Come at me.

31
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:18,320
Let her go.

32
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,272
No way.

33
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:25,640
None of us can be missing.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,720
Today, I want you dead.

35
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,224
Qing.

36
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,200
Watch closely

37
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,720
how Pei Xun will be cut to pieces.

38
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,952
Don't touch her.

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,480
Your Highness, I'm warning you.

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,480
I have Yueqing.

41
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,840
Are you injured?

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,200
Your Highness, be careful.

43
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,080
Yueqing may be heartbroken.

44
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,304
Qing, I know

45
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:01,220
Pei Xun is superb in martial arts.

46
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,000
If he tried to get rid of them,
it would be a piece of cake.

47
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,968
However...

48
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,219
Unfortunately,

49
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,240
their swords are smeared
with deadly poison.

50
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,480
You devil.

51
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,840
I deliberately
caught Pei Xun's attention.

52
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,960
I wanted him to get stabbed.

53
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:54,631
Pei Xun.

54
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:59,040
You're lucky to die by my hand.

55
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
Don't worry. Once you're dead,

56
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,320
Qing will come after you.

57
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,160
You two can be together again.

58
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,760
Yu Minghe.

59
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,280
It's okay now.

60
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
Pei Xun.

61
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,000
Pei Xun.

62
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,272
It's okay.

63
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,600
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

64
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,760
Why are you bleeding?

65
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,760
It's okay.

66
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,720
Why are you bleeding so much?

67
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,960
I'm fine now.

68
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:10,016
Pei Xun.

69
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:12,000
Pei Xun, don't scare me.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,024
Pei Xun.

71
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:14,640
Pei Xun.

72
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,768
Pei Xun.

73
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:17,824
Pei Xun.

74
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:21,200
Wake up!

75
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
It's okay now.

76
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,560
Don't cry. I'm fine.

77
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,680
It's okay now.

78
00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:55,782
Do you remember

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,960
that we first met
during the Lantern Festival?

80
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,040
How do you remember?

81
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,504
I remember.

82
00:07:07,232 --> 00:07:10,040
I'd just been made Prince Yi back then.

83
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,048
When I snuck out of the palace,

84
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,832
I wanted to experience
the Lantern Festival.

85
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,608
(Later,)

86
00:07:22,688 --> 00:07:24,240
(someone claimed with confidence)

87
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,280
(that she knew all the paths.)

88
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,720
(She took me to the North Street.)

89
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,080
You eat my candies,
and we will be friends.

90
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:47,808
(At that time,)

91
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:51,248
(you gave me a piece of candy.)

92
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,280
Is it tasty?

93
00:07:53,796 --> 00:07:55,497
Yeah, it's sweet.

94
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,661
(The sweetest candy I ever ate.)

95
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,910
(Afterward,)

96
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,949
(I found the lantern fair)

97
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,040
(is held on South Street.)

98
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,480
I took you to solve riddles.

99
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:21,283
I solved the lantern riddle,

100
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:25,120
but you took away the prize.

101
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,320
You got a lantern, didn't you?

102
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,448
I coaxed it from you.

103
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:34,619
It doesn't count.

104
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,400
Next year,

105
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,280
we will go to the lantern fair together.

106
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,768
Pei Xun.

107
00:09:00,768 --> 00:09:04,224
Pei Xun, wake up.

108
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,880
(Liu Yueqing, you started it.)

109
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,680
(Anything you compose is good.)

110
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,600
(It was Miss Liu
who turned me down all along.)

111
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,440
(But the only person
I want to marry is Liu Yueqing.)

112
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,760
(As long as you say yes,
I am ready to propose at any time.)

113
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,288
(Your tone)

114
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:27,006
(would make me think you like me.)

115
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,520
