Your Highness,
I have arrested all the rebel forces.

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,280
According to Wang Kun,

44
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,320
Lord Shi Leming got involved.

45
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,600
I doubt he has the brains for it.

46
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,160
Your Highness, I've sent people
to search.

47
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,960
Shi Leming and his men can't go far.

48
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,240
Your Highness, your timely arrival

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,488
inspired the army.

50
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:49,680
It turned our defeat into a victory.

51
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
The border rebels
are already eliminated,

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,616
but the surrounding people
have been suffering.

53
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,240
They need help.

54
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,720
You have been riding day and night.

55
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,280
Please rest here for a few days.

56
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,120
Just leave the rest to me.

57
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,520
Are you worried about me?

58
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,640
I'm not.

59
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,000
Really?

60
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,320
No.

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,680
Wang Kun made a fool of me.

62
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,400
He promised
the grain would be given to me,

63
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,280
but now he's trying
to make do with pig feed.

64
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,960
Please calm down. It's fishy.

65
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,920
Let me go to the Northwest Barracks
to investigate.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,560
Alright then.

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,360
(Qing.)

68
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,480
It's windy. You stay inside.

69
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,400
I'll tell them
about returning to the capital.

70
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,480
Okay.

71
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,000
(Why?)

72
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,200
Pei Xun.

73
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,000
Who are you?

74
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,920
Qing, long time no see.

75
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,840
Yu Minghe? Why are you here?

76
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:14,304
Qing.

77
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:18,520
Are we that estranged?

78
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,000
After all, we were not close before.

79
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,640
You're right.

80
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,040
Now, you're the future crown princess

81
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,120
of noble status,

82
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,200
while I'm nothing but a lone drifter.

83
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,320
I'm not worthy of talking
about the past with you.

84
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,208
Yu Minghe.

85
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,416
Everyone has to take responsibility
for what they do.

86
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,400
When you framed Pei Xun,

87
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,560
you should have thought of this outcome.

88
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Simply put, you're a victim
of your own scheming.

89
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,816
I was a true gentleman,

90
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:02,200
an honorable man.

91
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,160
It's you guys.

92
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,400
It was you who made me this way.

93
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,440
You're reaping the consequences.

94
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,760
If you hadn't been too greedy,

95
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,920
how could you have been so blind
and made a huge mistake.

96
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,920
However, you two are really lucky.

97
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,440
You survived the clash.

98
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,856
Shi Leming is such a fool.

99
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:27,625
He couldn't even
handle this little thing.

100
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,360
He deserved to die.

101
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,920
Alright then.

102
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,480
According to Wang Kun,

103
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,880
Lord Shi Leming got involved.

104
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,760
I doubt he has the brains for it.

105
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,920
It's you.

106
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:19,902
Yes.

107
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:22,280
It's me.

108
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:23,726
Unfortunately, Qing,

109
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,960
it's too late.

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,200
You and Yun Qiu will take Wang Kun
to the capital.

111
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,208
I'll deal with the border affairs first

112
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,400
before returning to the capital.

113
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,056
Yes.

114
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,120
What about the task I asked you to do?

115
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:51,907
It's completed.

116
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,520
I traveled a long way to find this.

117
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,000
Alright, I'll count this as your merit.

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,832
Your Highness, everything is ready.

119
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,817
I will set off first.

120
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,424
Yueqing.

121
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:18,524
Yueqing.

122
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,280
