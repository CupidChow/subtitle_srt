20
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,880
Take this book to your master

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,000
and tell him it's a gift
from the crown prince.

22
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,880
Boy.

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,320
Here you are.

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,440
Buy candied hawthorns with this.

25
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,920
Can you give the book to me?

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,640
Go.

27
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,280
Your Highness, this book chronicles
the glories of the previous dynasty

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,680
and insinuates
our dynasty's incompetence.

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,040
It seems that Prince Chen really...

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,560
He won't do anything
to destabilize the country.

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,280
So it's...

32
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,680
Yu Minghe?

33
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,880
I shall have the imperial guard...

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,360
No.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,240
That would attract
the court's attention.

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,400
If my father notices it,

37
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,680
he will surely severely punish
the author to reinforce his reign.

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,560
At that time,
not only Prince Chen will be implicated.

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,080
Some with ulterior motives

40
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,480
will seize this opportunity
to eliminate opponents.

41
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,840
You are worried about the Liu family?

42
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,240
I'll have Yu Minghe arrested
secretly first

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,760
to suppress this disturbance.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,800
What?

45
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,400
Is Yu Minghe mad?

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,160
I just asked him to write
about the crown prince's romantic tales,

47
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,640
but he overdid it.

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,240
Your Highness, the crown prince intends
to keep this matter a secret.

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,000
I suppose they won't track you down.

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,720
That's good.

51
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,080
Pass along my order.

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,040
My mansion will not receive guests

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
for the next few days.

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,200
Yes.

55
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,200
Miss Liu, something terrible happened.

56
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,560
What's all the fuss?

57
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,160
Something bad happened.

58
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,640
Mr. Yu is missing.

59
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,440
What? What happened?

60
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,200
A servant from the Yu family

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,720
just came and said
Mr. Yu hadn't been seen since he left

62
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,160
for the Eastern Palace two days ago.

63
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,560
They have had people investigate it.

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,760
It seems that Mr. Yu never left
the crown prince's palace

65
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,080
after going in.

66
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
The Eastern Palace?

67
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,680
Miss Liu,

68
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,880
could it be that Mr. Yu
angered His Highness

69
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,640
and was secretly killed?

70
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,760
(Pei Xun is petty.)

71
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,240
(Is he really being spiteful this time?)

72
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,000
Luo, I'll go out.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,440
Tell the Yu family for me.

74
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,680
Tell them not to worry.

75
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,400
I will investigate the matter
as soon as possible.

76
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,480
Yes.

77
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,720
I thought the first person to come
would be from the Yu family.

78
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,400
But it's you.

79
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
Your Highness,

80
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,840
if I've offended Your Highness before,

81
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,960
please punish me as you see fit.

82
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,400
If Mr. Yu has offended Your Highness,

83
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,920
I'll take the punishment for him.

84
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,800
Liu Yueqing, you really don't know
what's good for you.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,680
Can you afford the punishment

86
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,560
of causing unrest in the country?

87
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
What does it mean?

88
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,640
You said that Yu Minghe was a gentleman.

89
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,040
I will show you.

90
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,960
Qing.

91
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,160
Qing.

92
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,880
Qing, how did you get in?

93
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,480
His Highness let me in.

94
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,600
Qing, help me plead with His Highness.

95
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,080
I can't stay here for one more moment.

96
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,440
Spread rumors,

97
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,000
disrupt the court,

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,120
and slander the crown prince.

99
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,960
Yu Minghe, do you know these few words

100
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,280
can lead to the death of your family?

101
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,320
It really is you who did this.

102
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,200
Qing.

103
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
Qing.

104
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,640
I was a fool,

105
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,800
deluded and misled into doing wrong.

106
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,280
Qing,

107
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,840
I was wrong.

108
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,920
Since you have such a good relationship
with His Highness,

109
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,880
could you plead for me?

110
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,880
Could you do it, please?

111
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,680
I don't want to die.

112
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,160
I know that you were engaged
to His Highness before.

113
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,560
I don't mind.

114
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,760
Now,

115
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
he let you in,

116
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,560
and it means he still
has feelings for you.

117
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,400
Maybe he will listen to your words.

118
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,520
Yu Minghe, enough!

119
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,800
You really disappointed me.

120
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,840
Qing!

121
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,400
(If Pei Xun hadn't discovered it)

122
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,720
(and he had been really planted,)

123
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,600
(he would either have been executed)

124
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,320
(or have been deposed and exiled.)

125
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,880
Your Highness,

126
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,040
deal with Yu Minghe as you please.

127
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,440
Just don't involve
the rest of the Yu family.

128
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,680
(She didn't even plead for Yu Minghe.)

129
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,840
Alright.

130
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,600
I'll take my leave.

131
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,720
(I thought I could start over
in another life)

132
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,680
(and chose a safe haven for myself.)

133
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,280
(But why?)

134
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,920
(It was all in vain.)

135
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,800
Your Highness,
how will you deal with Yu Minghe?

136
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,640
Dismiss his position

137
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,200
and punish him with thirty strokes.

138
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,600
From now on,

139
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,680
never employ him in the court again.

140
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,736
Isn't it too lenient?

141
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,200
Don't mention

142
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,920
this matter again after today.

143
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,040
His Highness spared your life
without holding a grudge this time.

144
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,200
Know better your place in the future

145
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,160
and never try to approach
those you shouldn't.

146
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,160
I understand.

147
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,040
It took a lot of effort to build
a connection with the crown prince.

148
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,160
How could there be an error
in sorting out documents?

149
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,840
Did Miss Liu commit a mistake
that angered the crown prince

150
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,480
and you took the blame for her?

151
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,800
Father, it has nothing to do with her.

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
I've long heard

153
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,200
that she was dumped by the crown prince
when he was Prince Yi.

154
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,000
You're treasuring a dumped girl.

155
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,120
Look at how badly hurt you are now.

156
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,400
Your engagement with her is a jinx.

157
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,600
Better call it off early.
