clashes with my son's.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,880
They might be mutually incompatible.

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,600
Didn't you check it before?

25
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,320
They were said to be a perfect match.

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,560
Why would their fates clash?

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,520
Mr. Yu,

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
isn't your reason

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,480
too far-fetched?

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,520
They aren't engaged for long,

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,400
and my son met with a disaster
and lost his official position.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,800
Isn't this enough to prove it?

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000
You...

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,400
Mr. Yu,

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
don't make up stories.

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,160
Alright, Minister Liu.
Let's not spoil our relationship.

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,880
It's not the first time
your daughter has experienced this.

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,240
You're not new to this.

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,720
Father.

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,280
Let's start the process.

41
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,800
- You!
- Go.

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,160
Master.

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,120
Is this your idea, Mr. Yu?

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,920
I...

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Yu Minghe,

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,600
is it your idea?

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
I...

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,760
Luo, take my mother to rest.

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,800
Qing.

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,600
Mother, rest assured.

51
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,000
I know what to do.

52
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,640
Your Highness.

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,800
What's the matter?

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,080
Yu Minghe went to break off
his engagement today.

55
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,720
Break off?

56
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,680
Right. Yu Minghe looks stupid,

57
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,800
but he's obedient at least.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You let him break it off
without asking me?

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,200
I... Your Highness,

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,040
Yu Minghe is double-dealing
and hypocritical.

61
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,320
He's not a good match for Miss Liu.

62
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,160
And, Your Highness, you like Miss Liu.

63
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,280
So what?

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,320
Even if she is the one I want,

65
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,000
she should willingly accept it,

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,360
but not like this.

67
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,400
Your Highness.

68
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,440
Don't follow me.

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,880
Qing,

70
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,400
it isn't my idea.

71
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,680
No matter what difficulties
you may have,

72
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,720
I'd like to thank you first
for not marrying me.

73
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,360
But I must be the one
to write the cancellation letter.

74
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,680
You!

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,960
We're an educated family.

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,280
How can we be the ones being rejected?

77
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,600
Mr. Yu, don't forget
we're a prestigious family too.

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,560
If it hadn't been
for your son's persistent entreaties,

79
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,960
how could you have been connected
with us through marriage?

80
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,520
Father,

81
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,280
there's no need to waste words with him.

82
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,320
You!

83
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,760
Minister Liu, we both serve
as officials in the court.

84
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,920
Do you intend to bully me
because of my low rank?

85
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,680
My son is a pure and upright gentleman,

86
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,640
but your daughter seduced
the crown prince time and again.

87
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,120
And you have the gall to say no!

88
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,640
You!

89
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,360
Father.

90
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,320
Father.

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,520
Mr. Yu, you're so bold,

92
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,560
even daring to spread rumors about me.

93
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,960
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

94
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,600
Your Highness.

95
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,880
You resolutely canceled
my marriage proposal back then

96
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,800
and chose such a spineless man.

97
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,000
Do you ever regret it?

98
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,280
I...

99
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,520
Your Highness,

100
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,840
it was a misunderstanding just now.

101
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,560
I was just joking with Mr. Liu.

102
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,080
Mr. Yu, since you love meddling
in my private affairs so much,

103
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
now listen carefully.

104
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,280
Yes.

105
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,480
It was Miss Liu
who turned me down all along.

106
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,600
But the only person I want to marry

107
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,120
is Liu Yueqing.

108
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,560
Yes.

109
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,800
Now that you have come to your senses

110
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,200
and decided to cancel the engagement,

111
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
it means I still have a chance.

112
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,880
As long as you say yes,

113
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,200
I am ready to propose at any time.

114
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,600
Your Highness,

115
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,840
I've thought it through.

116
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Your Highness are the one
of unparalleled quality and merit,

117
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,760
far superior to those incompetent men.

118
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,160
Your Highness, I am willing to
be in a relationship with you again.

119
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,480
Qing.

120
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,640
I didn't want to cancel it.

121
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,560
I was just feeling down for a moment

122
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,000
and was confused.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,200
Enough, Minghe.

124
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,560
Your Highness,
it's my son who's being blind.

125
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,480
Since the engagement
has been called off,

126
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,400
Your Highness, we'll take our leave.

127
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,840
Let's go.

128
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,800
You think it's not shameful enough?

129
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,360
Go.

130
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,160
Your Highness, thank you
for helping out just now.

131
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,640
Please relax in the hall.

132
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,000
When did our girl

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,560
become so close with the crown prince?

134
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,400
His Highness said

135
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,360
it would be either Qing or not at all.

136
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:41,786
(Tolerance)

137
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,800
Do you find it interesting
to force a girl like me?

138
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,080
If this gets out, you will be seen
as a contemptible man,

139
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,160
seizing a subordinate's fiancée.

140
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,720
What about you?

141
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,360
Isn't it all because you
canceled our engagement?

142
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,720
Isn't it because you
wanted to find a safer choice?

143
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,120
You need to provide evidence
when you speak.

144
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,320
It's in my dreams.

145
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,040
Your evidence is in the dreams?

146
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,240
Mine is in the eyes of the people.

147
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,080
Why do you dream of me every day?

148
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,400
Is it because your thoughts
in the day become dreams at night?

149
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,960
Yes.

150
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,960
But my intuition tells me,

151
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,680
you should belong to me.

152
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,240
Farewell, Your Highness.

153
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:39,093
