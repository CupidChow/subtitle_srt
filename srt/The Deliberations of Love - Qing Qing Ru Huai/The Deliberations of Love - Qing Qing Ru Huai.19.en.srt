20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,600
You've come up with a great plan.

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,752
Now, Pei Xun's been put
under house arrest

22
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:53,308
by the Emperor
due to the food supply shortages.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,608
The border army is at a disadvantage.

24
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:58,444
If we launch a surprise attack,

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,800
they won't have time to react.

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,200
We'll definitely catch
them all in one swoop.

27
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:05,952
You're flattering me, general.

28
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,280
I'm just doing what I can.

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,680
It's due to your brilliant leadership

30
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,800
that we can carry out
the plan unnoticed.

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,720
Now the situation is in our favor.

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,960
When our great cause is achieved,
I will promote you

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,440
and guarantee you wealth and honor.

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,440
Thank you for that.

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,560
You might be celebrating too early.

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,520
The Emperor has banned the crown prince
from leaving his palace,

37
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,400
but it's merely for show.

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,040
I came here this time
by His Majesty's order

39
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,240
to thoroughly investigate this matter.

40
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,360
So, we've been working in vain.

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,653
What does it matter?

42
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:53,320
In this world, what can kill people
isn't just weapons,

43
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,680
but also a silver tongue.

44
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,033
Once rumors take root among people,

45
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:00,240
we just need to fuel the flames a bit.

46
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,160
Even if the Emperor trusts Pei Xun,

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,240
he will have to yield
to the public opinion.

48
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,960
You mean...

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,064
You two aren't locals.

50
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:29,280
Why are you here?

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,400
Sir,

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,240
we are just passing by
after a fruitless relative search.

53
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,640
Looking for relatives?

54
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,720
(Chen Village)
Ahead is the border.

55
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,600
(Chen Village)
You better go back as soon as possible.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,760
It's not too peaceful around here.

57
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,480
Thank you for the admonition.

58
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,320
It's getting late.

59
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,280
Why not stay here for a night

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,000
and continue our journey
early tomorrow morning?

61
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:58,432
Sounds good.

62
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:01,680
Sir...

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,680
You two don't look like bad guys.

64
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,360
There's an empty room in my house.
You can stay at my place

65
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,560
and leave tomorrow
if you're okay with that.

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,040
Thank you.

67
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:25,152
(Chen Village)

68
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,480
So once the crown prince's misconduct
is confirmed,

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,080
everyone will surely be dissatisfied
with his regency.

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,840
Then we can make a push,

71
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,560
and it would be considered justifiable.

72
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,560
Kill two birds with one stone move!

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,440
Qing.

74
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,272
Pei Xun.

75
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,520
Come here.

76
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,720
(Qing, I miss you so much.)

77
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,400
(Is this what they call
longing in love?)

78
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,520
Pei Xun.

79
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,000
Han Zhen, let's take a look.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,856
Okay.

81
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,440
Sir, what happened?

82
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,160
What else could happen?
The war has been intense recently,

83
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,920
and the border army
has been levying our food

84
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,160
or enlisting those unable
to provide food.

85
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,840
Who can afford that?

86
00:06:03,503 --> 00:06:05,888
A few more times

87
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:07,680
and we won't be able to survive.

88
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:11,328
You are outsiders.

89
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:13,120
Go hide right away.

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,080
This is the crown prince's order.
No time can be wasted.

91
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,040
Move faster, all of you!

92
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,240
This is far from enough.
Think you're dismissing a beggar?

93
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,880
It is too little!

94
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,280
Spare me, sir,

95
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,360
I really have nothing left.

96
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,720
I still have an 80-year-old mother

97
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,280
and two children that need to eat.

98
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,104
What is she still living for
at such an old age?

99
00:06:51,104 --> 00:06:53,040
She might as well be buried.

100
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,280
Please understand, folks.

101
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,760
The prince had no choice
but to give this order.

102
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,656
If there is no food,

103
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:08,160
our soldiers cannot fight

104
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,120
to protect our country.

105
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,736
When the nation is in ruins,

106
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:16,080
no one can survive.

107
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,800
Nonsense.

108
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:27,488
Who are you?

109
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,120
Daring to interfere in military affairs,
do you want to die?

110
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,880
The ones seeking death are you.

111
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,960
Taking advantage
of the crown prince's name to do wrong.

112
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,520
How dare you!

113
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,360
Who are you to accuse us
of impersonation?

114
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,680
What proof do you have?

115
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,976
You claim to be
under His Highness' command.

116
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:44,120
What proof do you have?

117
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,160
I...

118
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,720
His Highness leads
the troops with strict discipline.

119
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,440
He would never pillage the people

120
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,800
or conscript people casually.

121
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,280
You claim to be
under His Highness' command,

122
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
yet you behave
no different from bandits.

123
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,160
Are you taking advantage
of His Highness' name

124
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,648
to loot the people around

125
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:01,280
so as to tarnish
His Highness' reputation?

126
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,480
What are your intentions?

127
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,760
The kind prince
would never levy our vital food.

128
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,872
Impersonating His Highness' soldiers.

129
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,320
They are too bold.

130
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,480
You raving lunatic.

131
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,000
I will take your two heads

132
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,280
and then slaughter
these uncooperative rats.

133
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,920
Miss Liu, you take the villagers and go.

134
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,440
Everyone, go. Go!

135
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,960
Kill them!

136
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,400
Why are you posing as the prince's men
and levying grain everywhere?

137
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,320
What? We are his men.

138
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,400
We are His Highness' soldiers
in charge of grain levies.

139
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,520
Speak the truth, or we will kill you.

140
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,800
I am telling the truth.

141
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,576
All the grain we collect

142
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,160
is sent to the military camps.

143
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,520
Still talking nonsense?

144
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,232
If you're telling the truth,

145
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:13,400
where is the collected food?
Take us there.
