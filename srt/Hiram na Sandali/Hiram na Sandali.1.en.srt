1
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:17,002
Really, Charles?

2
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:19,180
I thought you were coming
with me.

3
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:22,211
Why aren't you dressed yet?

4
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:24,428
My body hurts today, hon.

5
00:01:24,722 --> 00:01:26,722
I'll just go with you next time.

6
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:31,419
What about our plan to eat out
after visiting?

7
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:32,934
So our date night's cancelled?

8
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,493
You're annoying, Ester.
We can still go out tomorrow.

9
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:39,502
Why do we have to fight
about this?

10
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:41,035
But you promised!

11
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:44,602
I don't complain to you
when I'm tired.

12
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:47,050
I don't know why you
still visit there.

13
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:49,107
It has been gone
for a long time.

14
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:01,502
[ANNIE] Love, where are we
going for our vacation?

15
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:04,333
Can we go visit Mom and Dad
in Canada?

16
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:05,433
Of course.

17
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:08,215
Wherever you want to go.
I'll take care of it.

18
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:10,811
By the way, love...

19
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:12,112
I know that already, Kris.

20
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:15,906
Today's April 17.
You don't need to explain.

21
00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:17,743
I'm fine with it.

22
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:20,025
My wife's amazing.

23
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:22,275
You're a mind-reader.

24
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:25,166
Do you still see
your ex-girlfriend there?

25
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,836
We don't see each other anymore.

26
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:31,836
The last time we met was
when Pochi died in 2017.

27
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:34,502
We don't visit at the same time.

28
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:36,150
Happy anniversary to you then.

29
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:40,002
You're so silly, Annie.

30
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:42,345
Why don't you come visit
Pochi's grave with me?

31
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,370
Even for just this time.

32
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:48,002
It's fine. I don't think Pochi
will welcome me.

33
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:51,303
It might get up from its grave
and bite me.

34
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:53,655
Of course it will get mad.

35
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,255
You're not with your ex
anymore when you visit.

36
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:00,265
When I'm done eating,
I'll go take a shower.

37
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:01,617
Then, I'll head out.

38
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,685
Make sure to dress up
and look good.

39
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:08,211
I want your ex to see that
I care for you well.

40
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:18,211
[KRIS] Ester?

41
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,191
[KRIS] How are you?

42
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:27,822
The last time we saw each other
was in 2017.

43
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,117
The same day of Pochi's funeral.

44
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,127
Was it really 2017?

45
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:34,427
I've forgotten it already.

46
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:37,869
Yes, that was seven years ago.

47
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,651
How are you?

48
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:41,884
Well, I'm married now,

49
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:44,627
but we don't have children yet.

50
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:47,284
You know my case, right?

51
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:50,517
But we're happy.

52
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:55,732
He is still so sweet even after
five years of marriage.

53
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:00,002
- You?
- We've been married for six years.

54
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:03,594
But she doesn't want
to have a baby yet.

55
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:05,977
She doesn't want to ruin her figure.

56
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,351
It's kinda funny.

57
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:11,252
She wants to be my only baby.
Always asking for my attention.

58
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:12,463
Are you already an engineer?

59
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:15,477
By God's grace, yes.

60
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:17,929
I also have a construction business.

61
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:20,021
What about you?

62
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:22,108
Wow, congratulations!

63
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:24,652
You've accomplished your dream.

64
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:27,336
As for me, I own a laundry shop.

65
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:28,502
Congratulations to you too.

66
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,711
Before...

67
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:32,704
that was our dream.
Now, you've made it into a reality.

68
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:39,264
Yes, it started when you fixed
my aunt's washing machine.

69
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:43,330
You said that we'd buy
broken washing machines,

70
00:04:43,693 --> 00:04:48,568
then, after fixing everything,
we'd start a laundry shop.

71
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:51,002
Well, it's great that
you still did it.

72
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:52,027
Yeah.

73
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:53,715
Even without you.

74
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,240
I miss Pochi.

75
00:04:56,786 --> 00:05:00,246
For sure, Pochi is happy
to see us together.

76
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,226
Pochi would be happy
even if it's just you.

77
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:05,467
I'm just the spare human.

78
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:08,382
But I still love Pochi.

79
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:12,279
It's true.

80
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,711
Pochi likes you
because of your gifts.

81
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:16,247
You and Pochi are alike.

82
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:17,573
Why so?

83
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:21,211
You both like the gifts I bring.

84
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,180
I missed you, Ester.

85
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:29,349
Do you want to eat?

86
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:33,607
This is wrong.

87
00:07:41,985 --> 00:07:43,585
We're both married already.

88
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:47,653
I don't want to ruin the
relationship that I have now.

89
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:50,509
I also don't want to ruin
other relationships.

90
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:53,368
Will we meet again?

91
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,919
I'm home, love!

92
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:13,734
You're home early, love.

93
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:16,858
This is for you.

94
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:21,235
Wow, what's this for?

95
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:25,462
You know, I'm sensing
something about you.

96
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,729
Did you do something bad?

97
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:30,272
Because you've been
a good boy for months now.

98
00:08:30,297 --> 00:08:32,067
You come home early.

99
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:34,069
You always bring bribes too.

100
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,309
The truth is...

101
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,107
Just kidding.

102
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:43,087
It's a prank!

103
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:44,304
So annoying.

104
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,419
I hope we will always
be like this.

105
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:50,311
Always happy, like crazy people.

106
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:52,919
Yes! I'm crazy for you.

107
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:55,627
You're quite the flatterer.

108
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:03,613
Maybe you can gratify me?

109
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:09,275
Later. I'm still not done
with my deliverables.

110
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,479
Come on. Just for a moment.

111
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:15,875
Prioritize your deliverables
to me before that.

112
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:19,481
You're so lustful.

113
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,550
Hi, hon.

114
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:52,086
What's the occasion, hon?

115
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:57,936
I just noticed that we're not
the same as before.

116
00:12:57,961 --> 00:13:00,461
We have both been busy.

117
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:07,110
I wanna bring back the
romance we've forgotten.

118
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,748
I'm sorry you've noticed
I'm out of myself lately.

119
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:15,192
I'm stressed at work.

120
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,483
And I'm always on my phone.

121
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:23,891
I'm also not sure if
I will get promoted.

122
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:28,519
Yeah, I see you're not
in the mood sometimes.

123
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:29,936
You're spaced out.

124
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:33,391
Sometimes, I wonder
if you still love me.

125
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:36,413
Hey, don't say that.
I love you so much.

126
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:40,924
I'm just really tired sometimes.

127
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:43,461
And you know that
I'm doing this for us.

128
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:44,530
Just...

129
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:46,745
Remember,

130
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:48,752
when you're having a hard time,

131
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:50,339
you can talk to me.

132
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:55,518
I won't leave you.

133
00:13:58,097 --> 00:13:59,403
Thank you, hon.

134
00:13:59,524 --> 00:14:00,590
I love you.

135
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:03,817
I love you too.

136
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:36,127
- Hon...
- Hmm?

137
00:17:36,127 --> 00:17:37,141
One more round?

138
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:40,902
I can't. I'm tired.

139
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:47,419
Oh. I have to send something
to my boss.

140
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:49,417
Oh god, I forgot.

141
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,705
Wait a minute.

142
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:05,936
[TERE] He's an animal, Charles!

143
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:08,752
He fooled me! He said
he's gonna change!

144
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:11,295
It's your fault for being
too stubborn, Tere.

145
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,752
What did I tell you?

146
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:14,652
I told you he's an asshole.

147
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:17,770
- You don't listen to me!
- Hey!

148
00:20:17,864 --> 00:20:19,155
What's going on?

149
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,097
Don't meddle! This is
between us siblings!

150
00:20:22,183 --> 00:20:24,227
She got fooled by
her worthless husband.

151
00:20:24,252 --> 00:20:25,636
I already left him.

152
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,066
That's enough!

153
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,066
Go up to our room, Tere.

154
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:31,093
Your brother and I will
talk first.

155
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,519
You shouldn't have scolded
your sister.

156
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:55,252
You know that she needs
someone to comfort her.

157
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:57,747
Rather than someone
to judge her.

158
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:00,263
What do you want me to do?

159
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:04,476
I'm just preventing myself
from going to her husband.

160
00:21:05,252 --> 00:21:07,252
You know, when I lose my cool,

161
00:21:07,252 --> 00:21:08,544
I'll beat that bastard up.

162
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:10,544
When will she go home?

163
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:12,424
Her children are still there.

164
00:21:12,975 --> 00:21:15,691
She should think of them too.

165
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,158
I've talked to our mom.

166
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:21,998
She doesn't want Tere
to stay there with her.

167
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:24,836
How can you blame her?

168
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:26,495
She was just talking to Tere,

169
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:30,044
but Tere suddenly walked out
and left her children there.

170
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:31,152
What now?

171
00:21:31,328 --> 00:21:32,448
Well...

172
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,542
Tere will stay here while
Mom is still mad at her.

173
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:37,567
What?

174
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:40,543
It's not that I'm driving
Tere away, but...

175
00:21:40,568 --> 00:21:43,312
We don't get along.
You know that.

176
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:45,351
She's too spoiled.

177
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:48,631
But I can't let her go home
to her husband.

178
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:51,364
The two of them might kill
each other when they meet.

179
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:53,656
Please take care of Tere
in the meantime.

180
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:57,768
Stay with her while I'm at work.

181
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,706
Hon...

182
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:01,953
Hon...

183
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:04,034
Do it for me...

184
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:08,377
Please take care of my sister.

185
00:22:09,014 --> 00:22:10,514
Alright then.

186
00:22:11,137 --> 00:22:12,959
I don't have a choice, do I?

187
00:22:15,758 --> 00:22:16,758
Thank you.

188
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:27,898
Ester. Drink with me.

189
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,407
I can't. I have to work
early tomorrow.

190
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:36,270
[TERE] Just for a while.

191
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:38,871
How much do you even make?

192
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:40,610
A million?

193
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:42,762
Will you lose millions

194
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:44,865
if you're late for a few hours?

195
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,849
Let's just talk tomorrow.

196
00:22:47,577 --> 00:22:48,605
You're already drunk.

197
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:52,627
If you don't need anything,
I'll go ahead and sleep.

198
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,437
You're such a brat!

199
00:22:54,462 --> 00:22:56,754
You're just dependent
on my brother.

200
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,720
Do you think you can live off

201
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:04,922
the mere change you earn
from your business?

202
00:23:06,105 --> 00:23:07,658
What are you saying?

203
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:09,407
What's happening here?

204
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:12,197
Talk to your sister.

205
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,434
She's belittling the business
I'm working hard for.

206
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:17,997
Why?

207
00:23:18,427 --> 00:23:20,001
Is there something wrong
with what I said?

208
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:22,752
Isn't that true?

209
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:25,226
You're just dependent
on my brother!

210
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:27,836
I'm not like you!

211
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:30,777
I can sustain myself
even without your brother.

212
00:23:31,218 --> 00:23:33,311
And I can work on my own,

213
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:34,717
not like you.

214
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:37,923
What are you saying, hon?

215
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:41,351
Why? Are you going to hurt me?

216
00:23:42,928 --> 00:23:44,843
Go on, hit me!

217
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:47,078
Let's break up.

218
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:52,829
Ester!

219
00:23:55,624 --> 00:23:58,819
You know, I miss you so much.

220
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:01,389
I'm missing your playfulness.

221
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:03,815
If only you're still here...

222
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:08,805
I'm sure you can
lighten up my mood.

223
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:10,878
I miss everything

224
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,523
even the things I don't
like about you.

225
00:24:15,729 --> 00:24:17,850
If only you could come
back to me...

226
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,544
I'll let you...

227
00:24:23,752 --> 00:24:25,917
destroy my slippers.

228
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:28,795
You can even pee anywhere.

229
00:24:34,627 --> 00:24:36,836
I miss you so much, Pochi.

230
00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:05,974
Wow, you still know.

231
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,597
Know what?

232
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,388
Stop pretending.

233
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:12,594
Thank you.

234
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,254
Of course, I remember
your favorite black coffee.

235
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:18,752
Back then, whenever
I bring you coffee,

236
00:25:18,752 --> 00:25:20,492
you get angry
when it isn't black.

237
00:25:20,665 --> 00:25:23,540
I'm glad that you remember.

238
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:25,627
But Charles...

239
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:29,252
Even though I always
tell him my favorites,

240
00:25:29,753 --> 00:25:30,917
he never gets it right.

241
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:37,367
I'm wondering if he really
knows anything about me.

242
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:40,345
Unlike me.

243
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:43,866
I know all his likes
and dislikes.

244
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:45,988
Some men are like that.

245
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,707
What do they call those types?

246
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,424
Nonchalant?

247
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:52,936
But I'm sure,

248
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:54,019
he loves you.

249
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,344
Can I know what you said
to Pochi?

250
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:05,534
Your nose looked like it
was crying earlier.

251
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:08,515
You were sniffling a lot.

252
00:26:08,665 --> 00:26:11,991
My annulment with Charles
is already ongoing.

253
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:13,956
But I thought...

254
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:16,238
Don't say anything.

255
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:19,064
Yes, I lied.

256
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,040
Of course, I don't
want you to know that...

257
00:26:23,594 --> 00:26:25,863
my relationship failed.

258
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,727
I don't want to lose to you.

259
00:26:29,752 --> 00:26:31,519
I didn't know that...

260
00:26:31,544 --> 00:26:34,813
we'll see each other again
after a year.

261
00:30:04,794 --> 00:30:06,669
I'll give you my phone number.

262
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:09,335
Call me when you need
someone to rely on.

263
00:30:09,787 --> 00:30:11,348
How about your wife?

264
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:12,580
I don't know.

265
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:15,220
All I know is that you need me.

266
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:16,692
I don't want to be a mistress.

267
00:30:16,794 --> 00:30:18,377
You won't be.

268
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,514
If she won't know.

269
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,669
- Hello. Why did you call?
- Hello?

270
00:30:38,694 --> 00:30:40,849
There's a big accident here
at the site.

271
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:42,862
- A lot are wounded, and dead.
- What?

272
00:30:42,887 --> 00:30:44,144
What?! Where's Engr. Joebert?

273
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:46,061
- I don't know, man.
- He's the one in charge.

274
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:47,586
I haven't seen him for a week.

275
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:49,144
Alright. I'll go there.

276
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:51,586
Call an ambulance
and anyone who can help.

277
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:53,657
- Alright.
- I'll be there.

278
00:31:22,496 --> 00:31:24,061
What is my favorite coffee?

279
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,030
Uh...

280
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:28,502
I don't know.

281
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:30,739
But that's a bestseller.

282
00:31:31,012 --> 00:31:32,928
Black coffee is my favorite.

283
00:31:33,002 --> 00:31:35,407
And you brought donuts?

284
00:31:35,742 --> 00:31:36,787
Are you okay?

285
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,012
Come on. What's wrong with that?

286
00:31:40,506 --> 00:31:43,896
It's just food. Don't get mad.

287
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:48,296
You know I don't
like sweets, right?

288
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:51,225
I don't know. Sorry.

289
00:31:51,586 --> 00:31:52,669
I'm sorry.

290
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:54,787
What do you really know
about me?

291
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:56,633
You're hard to talk to.

292
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:58,537
I just want to make it up
to you.

293
00:31:58,562 --> 00:32:01,379
But just because I don't
know your favorite food,

294
00:32:01,693 --> 00:32:02,959
you're mad again.

295
00:32:03,753 --> 00:32:05,347
- Come on.
- You...

296
00:32:05,502 --> 00:32:07,377
You want a cold brew.

297
00:32:08,144 --> 00:32:10,352
You're allergic to dog fur.

298
00:32:10,377 --> 00:32:12,294
That's why I didn't get one.

299
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:15,297
You want your eggs overcooked.

300
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:18,561
Because you get disgusted
if the yolk is runny.

301
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:20,086
What are you trying to say?

302
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:21,869
When you love someone,

303
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:25,377
you'd learn about
their likes and dislikes.

304
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,647
Come to think of it,

305
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,793
even if I tell you over and
over about my likes and dislikes,

306
00:32:31,692 --> 00:32:33,765
you won't even remember them.

307
00:32:34,877 --> 00:32:37,377
Even my allergies.

308
00:32:37,686 --> 00:32:38,686
There.

309
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,667
There you go again.

310
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,600
You're tiring.

311
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,462
You know?

312
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:48,055
I'm sorry if I'm not perfect.

313
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:50,285
And I'm also sorry...

314
00:32:52,877 --> 00:32:54,497
that I'm not Kris.

315
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:30,844
What happened?

316
00:33:31,422 --> 00:33:32,541
Are you okay?

317
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:34,900
They're investigating the site.

318
00:33:35,918 --> 00:33:38,561
They say the materials used
were substandard

319
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,542
- that's why it collapsed.
- How did that happen?

320
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,287
Engr. Joebert stole the funds.

321
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,058
That's why he's in hiding now.

322
00:33:47,716 --> 00:33:49,079
[WOMAN 1] Is anyone there?

323
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:52,842
- [WOMAN 2] Is anyone there?
- [WOMAN 3] Engineer Kris!

324
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:56,794
- Hello? Anyone home?
- Are you there, Engineer Kris?

325
00:33:57,182 --> 00:33:58,294
Bastard!

326
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,694
Take responsibility for what
happened to my husband!

327
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,079
Right! How about my kids?
They're still young!

328
00:34:04,104 --> 00:34:06,021
It's your fault, Engineer!

329
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,837
What did you do to my husband?

330
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:09,477
How about our children?

331
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:10,890
It's not my fault!

332
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,290
What are you saying?

333
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:13,815
We're both victims!

334
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,257
How did you become
a victim?

335
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:17,852
Have pity on my family.

336
00:34:17,877 --> 00:34:19,907
My business partner
just left me behind.

337
00:34:19,986 --> 00:34:20,986
What?

338
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:22,644
What shall we do?

339
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:23,794
Is that it?

340
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:25,611
That's unacceptable!

341
00:34:25,861 --> 00:34:27,240
That can't be!

342
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:36,964
Pochi's cute.

343
00:34:39,612 --> 00:34:41,251
I'll send this to him.

344
00:34:42,053 --> 00:34:43,333
Pochi's so cute.

345
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,160

347
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,033
What happened?

348
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:28,146
A lot of people are
messaging me.

349
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:30,561
They are threatening our lives.

350
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,211
I'll report that to the police.
I'll call them.

351
00:35:33,236 --> 00:35:34,270
No need.

352
00:35:35,818 --> 00:35:37,439
I'm afraid they'll do something.

353
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,549
I'm tired of our situation.

354
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:43,275
We've been hiding for months.

355
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:46,061
I can't face our neighbors, Kris.

356
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:47,103
Sorry.

357
00:35:47,561 --> 00:35:48,853
I'll find a way.

358
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:50,078
I love you, Kris

359
00:35:50,302 --> 00:35:51,962
but I can't take this anymore.

360
00:35:52,377 --> 00:35:54,877
I'm so tired.

361
00:35:56,843 --> 00:35:59,061
I'm so tired of thinking

362
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:01,430
of what will happen to us.

363
00:36:01,477 --> 00:36:03,061
I'm tired of being scared.

364
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:06,502
What if someone comes
to our house one day?

365
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:08,015
I don't want this anymore.

366
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,329
What are you trying to say?

367
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:37,211
"I love you, but I can't
take it anymore. Let's break up."

368
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:44,877
Annie?

369
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:48,930
Annie!

370
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:52,172
Annie!

371
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,918
Annie!

372
00:36:58,636 --> 00:36:59,717
Annie!

373
00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:01,310
Annie!

374
00:37:03,897 --> 00:37:05,189
Annie!

375
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:07,417
Annie!

376
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:10,840
Annie!

377
00:37:12,294 --> 00:37:13,502
Annie!

378
00:40:27,544 --> 00:40:29,211
Hello, why did you call?

379
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,573
Ester.

380
00:40:31,574 --> 00:40:33,817
Don't be shocked by what
I'm gonna tell you.

381
00:40:35,336 --> 00:40:36,440
- Ester...
- What?

382
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,174
Our mom...

383
00:40:39,658 --> 00:40:41,312
She's gone.

384
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:44,961
What?

385
00:40:45,252 --> 00:40:47,127
Mom is gone.

386
00:40:51,044 --> 00:40:53,127
She got into an accident.

387
00:40:53,247 --> 00:40:54,456
Ester...

388
00:40:55,514 --> 00:40:56,828
Mom died?

389
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,102
What happened?

390
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,747
I don't know either.

391
00:41:03,772 --> 00:41:05,820
I just got in the hospital.

392
00:41:09,627 --> 00:41:11,127
Where are you?

393
00:41:12,627 --> 00:41:15,544
Come here, Ester.

394
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,271
Alright, I'm on my way.

395
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,550
It'll be okay.

396
00:41:57,704 --> 00:42:00,025
Mom is gone.

397
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:07,769
Uh...

398
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:10,339
Are you sure...

399
00:42:10,748 --> 00:42:12,691
that you can stay here alone?

400
00:42:13,336 --> 00:42:14,983
Your mom just got buried.

401
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,050
Can you do this?

402
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,334
I can.

403
00:42:19,361 --> 00:42:20,906
Your sister told me

404
00:42:21,127 --> 00:42:22,650
that you can stay with her.

405
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:24,865
I think I should take you there.

406
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,390
I don't like it there.

407
00:42:26,415 --> 00:42:28,235
We're just gonna cry together.

408
00:42:31,321 --> 00:42:34,976
We both might feel worse.

409
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:38,993
If it's okay with you,
can I stay here too?

410
00:42:40,747 --> 00:42:43,038
I'm worried because you're alone.

411
00:42:43,265 --> 00:42:44,853
No one will take care of you.

412
00:42:45,727 --> 00:42:47,102
Don't worry.

413
00:42:47,346 --> 00:42:48,492
I can do this.

414
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,970
Besides, you've
already helped us a lot.

415
00:42:51,995 --> 00:42:56,408
You've taken care of
almost the entire funeral.

416
00:42:58,163 --> 00:42:59,214
I'll go ahead then.

417
00:43:01,252 --> 00:43:02,252
Alright.

418
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:43,112
The subscriber cannot be reached.
Please try again later.

419
00:43:49,203 --> 00:43:53,094
The subscriber cannot be reached.
Please try again later.

420
00:44:02,504 --> 00:44:06,314
The subscriber cannot be reached.
Please try again later.

421
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,265
Hey. Good morning.

422
00:44:45,092 --> 00:44:48,813
I just went inside
because I still have the key.

423
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:50,394
Sit down and eat.

424
00:44:52,775 --> 00:44:55,234
Thank you for the effort.

425
00:44:56,052 --> 00:44:57,093
It's nothing.

426
00:44:57,544 --> 00:44:59,627
You don't need to thank me.

427
00:44:59,811 --> 00:45:01,936
You've served me
for so long before.

428
00:45:01,961 --> 00:45:04,037
And you know, when
I was cooking earlier,

429
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:07,805
I was thinking about the
last time I cooked for you.

430
00:45:08,607 --> 00:45:09,825
I can't remember.

431
00:45:10,299 --> 00:45:11,902
I realized I was so awful
to you back then.

432
00:45:12,718 --> 00:45:14,513
While I was preparing this,

433
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,399
I didn't know what to cook.

434
00:45:20,544 --> 00:45:22,252
That's when I realized,

435
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:25,349
I don't really know
what your favorite is.

436
00:45:25,544 --> 00:45:27,044
I'm sorry if...

437
00:45:28,127 --> 00:45:30,627
I didn't appreciate you when

438
00:45:30,816 --> 00:45:32,709
you were the one

439
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,033
understanding and
taking care of me.

440
00:45:36,311 --> 00:45:38,227
I regret everything.

441
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:41,857
I wish I had treated you better.

442
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:43,900
I wish I had appreciated you.

443
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:48,327
So that we won't
need to break up.

444
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:50,545
I'm really sorry for
everything I did.

445
00:45:52,656 --> 00:45:54,569
You deserve someone better.

446
00:45:57,423 --> 00:45:58,423
Hey.

447
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,749
Don't cry...

448
00:46:10,664 --> 00:46:12,361
I'm sorry.

449
00:46:13,252 --> 00:46:14,848
I love you so much.

450
00:50:09,544 --> 00:50:12,351
Thank you for the second
chance you gave me.

451
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,639
I'll make it up to you.

452
00:50:15,185 --> 00:50:17,894
I will not waste
this opportunity.

453
00:50:43,088 --> 00:50:45,195
What happened to you?

454
00:50:45,698 --> 00:50:47,669
You're neglecting yourself
too much.

455
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,061
My life's done.

456
00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:55,736
Annie left me too.

457
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,387
I'm facing my misfortunes alone.

458
00:50:59,727 --> 00:51:01,636
Don't be too negative.

459
00:51:01,785 --> 00:51:03,324
I have good news for you.

460
00:51:03,508 --> 00:51:05,566
I know where Joebert is hiding.

461
00:51:05,591 --> 00:51:07,250
Where is that bastard?

462
00:51:07,924 --> 00:51:10,118
- Relax.
- He ruined my life.

463
00:51:10,143 --> 00:51:11,270
Let me handle this.

464
00:51:11,752 --> 00:51:13,075
I'll have him arrested.

465
00:51:13,936 --> 00:51:15,340
I'm taking care of the warrant.

466
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:17,747
After that, your life
will be fixed again.

467
00:51:17,883 --> 00:51:19,047
Thanks a lot.

468
00:51:19,964 --> 00:51:21,761
I didn't know what to do.

469
00:51:21,847 --> 00:51:23,629
Just fix yourself.

470
00:51:24,258 --> 00:51:25,935
I'll help you recover.

471
00:51:26,276 --> 00:51:28,901
I know a good lawyer
who can help you.

472
00:51:30,202 --> 00:51:32,410
You and Annie might
get back together.

473
00:51:39,908 --> 00:51:41,383
You know, Pochi,

474
00:51:42,887 --> 00:51:45,454
I've never been this
excited in my life.

475
00:51:47,388 --> 00:51:50,626
That feeling like something
good is gonna happen.

476
00:51:51,329 --> 00:51:53,086
If you were here, Pochi.

477
00:51:54,252 --> 00:51:55,851
Ester will be happy.

478
00:51:57,669 --> 00:51:59,197
We can be complete.

479
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,548
But this time...

480
00:52:05,382 --> 00:52:06,932
I'm not going to let her go.

481
00:52:11,892 --> 00:52:12,965
Hey, Kris.

482
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:14,512
We meet each other again.

483
00:55:13,502 --> 00:55:15,127
I love you, Ester.

484
00:55:17,502 --> 00:55:19,108
Don't worry.

485
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:23,194
I can say that without
any complication.

486
00:55:25,794 --> 00:55:28,002
Without hesitation.

487
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:31,746
Annie and I are separated.

488
00:55:33,326 --> 00:55:35,499
Charles and I are
together again.

489
00:55:37,746 --> 00:55:40,156
My mother died in an accident.

490
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,280
My mind was a mess that time.

491
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:54,125
Charles didn't leave my side.

492
00:55:55,002 --> 00:55:57,427
He took care of me when...

493
00:55:57,827 --> 00:55:59,667
I was calling you over and over.

494
00:56:05,502 --> 00:56:07,711
I called you many times.

495
00:56:08,553 --> 00:56:09,624
You said

496
00:56:09,885 --> 00:56:11,760
you will support me.

497
00:56:12,025 --> 00:56:14,609
You told me when
I need your help,

498
00:56:15,093 --> 00:56:16,967
you'll be there for me.

499
00:56:19,873 --> 00:56:22,044
I also went through a lot.

500
00:56:24,279 --> 00:56:26,599
You don't know the trouble
I went through

501
00:56:26,624 --> 00:56:28,192
just to see you again.

502
00:56:42,886 --> 00:56:44,032
I'm sorry.

503
00:56:48,211 --> 00:56:51,502
But it seems like we
can't be together.

504
00:56:58,294 --> 00:57:00,502
I can't leave Charles.

505
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,980
I was waiting for you...

506
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:10,766
I was hoping we'd get
back together.

507
00:57:12,407 --> 00:57:13,407
Ester.

508
00:57:13,919 --> 00:57:15,294
Don't leave me.

509
00:57:15,972 --> 00:57:18,235
I can't promise you anything.

510
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:22,375
I don't want to give you hope.

511
00:57:28,294 --> 00:57:29,502
Ester...

512
00:57:32,002 --> 00:57:34,002
Don't leave me, please.

513
00:58:07,627 --> 00:58:10,211
Don't worry, Ester.

514
00:58:10,294 --> 00:58:13,001
I didn't come here to fight.

515
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:16,375
I want to apologize to you.

516
00:58:16,721 --> 00:58:19,670
I know you've been good to me.

517
00:58:20,102 --> 00:58:23,269
But I didn't treat you well.

518
00:58:23,294 --> 00:58:25,269
My husband and I separated.

519
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:28,269
Maybe it happened,
so I can learn my lesson.

520
00:58:28,294 --> 00:58:30,977
Can we do anything to help you?

521
00:58:31,002 --> 00:58:33,211
I know we are not on good terms,

522
00:58:33,236 --> 00:58:37,072
but if you need someone
to rely on,

523
00:58:38,071 --> 00:58:39,259
just tell me.

524
00:58:39,284 --> 00:58:41,686
Thanks, but I don't need anything.

525
00:58:41,811 --> 00:58:43,137
I'm fine.

526
00:58:43,162 --> 00:58:44,985
I even brought you cake.

527
00:58:45,102 --> 00:58:46,351
I baked this.

528
00:58:46,376 --> 00:58:49,168
I want to build a cake shop.

529
00:58:49,994 --> 00:58:51,661
I look up at you.

530
00:58:51,714 --> 00:58:54,131
Because you can sustain yourself.

531
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:57,127
Perfect timing.
It's our anniversary.

532
00:58:57,498 --> 00:58:58,536
We have a cake now.

533
00:58:59,713 --> 00:59:02,013
My brother is very lucky
to have you.

534
00:59:02,186 --> 00:59:03,894
You're a businesswoman

535
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:06,502
and a thoughtful wife.

536
00:59:07,078 --> 00:59:10,592
What can I do to
make it up to you?

537
00:59:10,627 --> 00:59:12,275
Just help me out here.

538
00:59:12,573 --> 00:59:14,786
Here. I haven't finished this yet.

539
00:59:15,435 --> 00:59:16,644
Wow.

540
00:59:17,886 --> 00:59:19,178
Thank you for this.

541
00:59:19,744 --> 00:59:21,145
This completes the setup.

542
00:59:28,573 --> 00:59:29,573
Hello?

543
00:59:29,646 --> 00:59:31,879
Hello? Can we talk later?

544
00:59:31,904 --> 00:59:32,904
Oh!

545
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,102
Hon...

546
00:59:34,127 --> 00:59:35,156
Hi, hon!

547
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:36,181
Ah...

548
00:59:37,002 --> 00:59:39,794
I wanted to surprise you
but you surprised me instead.

549
00:59:40,699 --> 00:59:43,284
Here. Happy anniversary.

550
00:59:43,495 --> 00:59:45,350
Happy anniversary.

551
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,987
Did you like it?

552
00:59:48,213 --> 00:59:49,421
Of course.

553
00:59:50,073 --> 00:59:51,445
Really.

554
00:59:51,919 --> 00:59:54,311
My wife is so beautiful.

555
00:59:55,627 --> 00:59:57,419
I'm very lucky to have you.

556
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:01,894
Did setting this up
tire you out?

557
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,211
You know who helped me earlier?

558
01:00:04,211 --> 01:00:05,211
Who?

559
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:07,602
Tere! We already made up.

560
01:00:07,627 --> 01:00:09,186
She apologized to me.

561
01:00:09,211 --> 01:00:10,252
Tere?

562
01:00:10,294 --> 01:00:12,419
- Yes.
- She apologized?

563
01:00:13,127 --> 01:00:14,263
That's new.

564
01:00:16,502 --> 01:00:17,919
Wow.

565
01:00:17,919 --> 01:00:19,711
Okay, tell me about it.

566
01:00:19,736 --> 01:00:21,774
- I'll go to the washroom first.
- Alright.

567
01:00:23,127 --> 01:00:24,294
Tere?

568
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:47,211
When will you tell your wife
that we will have a child soon?

569
01:01:06,502 --> 01:01:09,075
How did you and Tere make up?

570
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:11,063
Tell me about it.

571
01:01:15,294 --> 01:01:16,294
Hon?

572
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,317
How can you do this to me?

573
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:20,893
Do what?

574
01:01:23,002 --> 01:01:24,015
This.

575
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,705
Hon, I'm sorry.

576
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:35,438
Sorry, I didn't intend
to do this to you.

577
01:01:35,663 --> 01:01:36,663
Uh...

578
01:01:37,665 --> 01:01:38,696
Alright.

579
01:01:38,727 --> 01:01:40,352
Don't mind the kid.

580
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:42,785
I can forget them for you.

581
01:01:43,102 --> 01:01:45,269
They're not important.

582
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:47,991
I was just sad then.
That's why I did that.

583
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:50,630
And you're the one I love.
You know that, right?

584
01:01:50,655 --> 01:01:51,725
That's enough.

585
01:01:52,227 --> 01:01:53,369
We're done.

586
01:01:59,711 --> 01:02:01,072
Don't be like that.

587
01:02:03,627 --> 01:02:04,711
Hon.

588
01:02:13,113 --> 01:02:14,316
You know, Pochi,

589
01:02:14,502 --> 01:02:18,127
the universe is bringing
Kris and I together.

590
01:02:18,597 --> 01:02:22,254
Maybe it's the perfect time
for us to get back together.

591
01:02:22,627 --> 01:02:24,492
You're happy for us, right?

592
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:29,135
What took you so long?

593
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,688
Your coffee went cold.

594
01:03:32,888 --> 01:03:37,186
I've also finished the food
we were supposed to share.

595
01:03:37,211 --> 01:03:39,733
I got hungry. Are you okay?

596
01:03:40,593 --> 01:03:43,061
Did something bad happen?

597
01:03:44,747 --> 01:03:46,247
Actually...

598
01:03:46,769 --> 01:03:49,186
I don't want to see you anymore,
so I'm avoiding you.

599
01:03:49,211 --> 01:03:52,002
I intentionally went late
so I won't bump into you.

600
01:03:52,027 --> 01:03:53,061
Why?

601
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:55,419
The last day we met...

602
01:03:56,459 --> 01:03:59,222
I lost my will to live.

603
01:03:59,247 --> 01:04:00,684
I got too depressed.

604
01:04:00,973 --> 01:04:04,147
I felt like all my efforts were
in vain because you were gone.

605
01:04:04,314 --> 01:04:06,360
Until Jeff introduced me
to someone.

606
01:04:07,419 --> 01:04:09,042
She's an engineer like us.

607
01:04:09,397 --> 01:04:10,582
She's so beautiful.

608
01:04:11,499 --> 01:04:13,707
And because of her,
I was able to recover.

609
01:04:13,732 --> 01:04:15,602
And we're already having a baby.

610
01:04:15,627 --> 01:04:17,850
I'm just waiting for my
annulment papers with Annie

611
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:19,504
so we can finally get married.

612
01:04:19,562 --> 01:04:24,270
I don't want our baby to grow up
with parents who aren't married.

613
01:04:24,295 --> 01:04:26,266
Wow, congratulations!

614
01:04:27,206 --> 01:04:28,331
You deserve it.

615
01:04:30,294 --> 01:04:32,437
You're easy to love.

616
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:38,794
Your future wife and child
are lucky to have you.

617
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:42,975
I'm sorry if I teared up.

618
01:04:45,163 --> 01:04:47,441
I just remembered
something from my past.

619
01:04:49,739 --> 01:04:51,394
How about you and Charles?

620
01:04:51,419 --> 01:04:52,591
We're okay.

621
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:59,391
Well, he finally became sweet.

622
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:03,409
More caring.

623
01:05:05,048 --> 01:05:06,570
Not like before.

624
01:05:06,595 --> 01:05:08,162
I won't stay for long.

625
01:05:08,693 --> 01:05:11,277
She's waiting for me in the car.

626
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:17,711
It's okay. Send my regards to her.

627
01:05:17,736 --> 01:05:20,018
This is the last time I'll go here.

628
01:05:22,651 --> 01:05:24,625
I already told her everything.

629
01:05:26,101 --> 01:05:27,950
I don't want to keep
secrets from her.

630
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,584
She accepted all my mistakes.

631
01:05:32,263 --> 01:05:33,474
Don't worry.

632
01:05:34,477 --> 01:05:37,258
I won't neglect Pochi's grave.

633
01:05:37,283 --> 01:05:39,783
I'm happy that finally...

634
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,550
you've found the one for you.
