00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:06,840
GIRLS' BEDROOM

2
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,466
- The photos are up.
- Hmm.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,260
- In those photos…
- Hmm.

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,678
AMO (27)

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:12,804
…I saw one of you.

6
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,389
NISEI (27)

7
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:17,392
You know, you were
posing like this with Baby.

8
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,102
That was one of the photos they put up.

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,480
<i>So when I saw that,</i>

10
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,401
I remembered how you hugged me,

11
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,529
and how you even kissed me, too.

12
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:32,115
I don't want a Nisei who hops around.

13
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,616
What do you mean "hops around"?

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,868
I mean, like,

15
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:38,329
if you were getting all touchy
like that with everyone

16
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,582
just to test the waters,
that would be gross.

17
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,417
- That's gross. You're right.
- Yeah.

18
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:48,048
I'd be sad if I was just another girl
that you were playing.

19
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,049
Right.

20
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,342
- She doesn't mince words.
- Hmm.

21
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,969
NAGANO

22
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,971
But you're not a girl that I'm "playing".

23
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,557
I'm just not completely sure yet.

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,768
I mean, I have made a choice, of course.

25
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,729
But there's still
a part of me that's unsure.

26
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,274
I'm guessing
it's not just Oto and me, right?

27
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,984
- The girls on your mind.
- You're right.

28
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,904
<i>Why would he say that to her?</i>

29
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,238
So…

30
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,076
Mmm…

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,329
If that's where you are right now,
I'm not cool with that.

32
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,497
- Hmm.
- Not at all.

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,957
- Okay.
- <i>Kudos for saying that.</i>

34
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,918
Do I still like her?

35
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,045
Maybe I don't.

36
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,422
If I liked her, I'd tell her that.

37
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:33,343
I sort of made excuses,
about not deciding yet.

38
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,556
So, whether it's Amo or Baby,
even Oto who I turned down,

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,100
it's still not clear to me.

40
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,810
<i>He's being honest, at least.</i>

41
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,895
Yeah. I know I'm being indecisive.

42
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,981
But the truth is, I don't know yet.

43
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,860
- So, Oto's still a candidate?
- Mmm.

44
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,530
- Even after that kiss?
- Right?

45
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:58,159
Amo's feelings are usually hard to share,
but she was super honest with him.

46
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,119
That was cool.

47
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,121
I thought that was so cool of her.

48
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,331
- Nisei is being greedy,
- Don't you think so?

49
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,958
- Still?
- Right?

50
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,628
But they kissed, and it seemed
like things were great between them.

51
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,089
Shouldn't that mean
his mind was set on Amo?

52
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,299
Right? Turns out that kiss
was just a mic check.

53
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,302
- "Lips check, check one two."
- He was checking the mic, got it.

54
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,554
"Is this thing on?"

55
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,931
But after they kissed,
Amo totally fell for Nisei.

56
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,474
She caught some serious feelings.

57
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,435
And because she has strong feelings,
now she's worried.

58
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,022
So, she wasn't sure
about Nisei when she kissed him.

59
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,483
- She wasn't sure.
- The kiss made her fall for him, but--

60
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,361
That's why she wants
to make sure he's serious now.

61
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,321
Nagano, you don't get it at all, do you?

62
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,948
I was lost, yeah.

63
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,410
I was like, "Wow, so that's what's
going on." Seriously.

64
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,453
- You looked so stunned.
- I was.

65
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,498
"They're kissing. Oh, my gosh.
They have to get married now!"

66
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,875
That's what I thought.

67
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,626
I heard wedding bells.

68
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,302
BLOOM OR WITHER,
I LIVE LIFE ON MY TERMS

69
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,345
EVER SINCE WE MET,
I HAVE NO REGRETS IN LOVE

70
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,681
THE HEAVENS GAVE ME THIS LIFE,
I'LL MAKE IT BLOOM

71
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,185
FOR MY BELOVED,
I'LL MAKE THE FLOWER OF LOVE BLOSSOM

72
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,520
IF I'M FATED TO FALL,
IT'LL BE IN A BLAZE OF GLORY

73
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,772
THE PURE LOVE
IN MY HEART WILL BLOSSOM

74
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,108
LIFE IS SHORT,
BUT I'LL STAND TALL TILL THE VERY END

75
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,194
IF I MUST FALL TO RISE,
MY LIFE WILL PROVE IT

76
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,196
MY LOVE WILL GO ON
EVEN AFTER I'M GONE

77
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,531
I WON'T WASTE
THE LIFE MY PARENTS GAVE ME

78
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,630
KIREI AKA KIICHAN (23)
MODEL & MAKEUP TEACHER

YURIA AKA BABY (25)
PAINTER & TALENT

80
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:43,056
OTOHA AKA OTO-SAN (22)
VOCATIONAL STUDENT & HOSTESS

81
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,641
<i>She's drawing something.</i>

82
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,643
<i>A drawing? So cool.</i>

83
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,561
<i>We talked about making some T-shirts</i>

84
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,271
<i>for the children's cafeteria,</i>

85
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,649
and that we should put a logo on them.

86
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,276
What would you like us to make?

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,695
Would you want T-shirts?

88
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,948
- That's cute.
- T-shirts might be good.

89
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,783
I think T-shirts are good.

90
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,160
And they'll make a good keepsake
for when they grow up.

91
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,078
Hmm.

92
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,330
- We'll make the T-shirts.
- Okay, yeah.

93
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,457
My company can provide them.

94
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,835
They'll deliver them here first.
Then we'll decorate them.

95
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,713
If you decide on the text, I can draw it.

96
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,923
You can?

97
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,925
That's what I'm studying in school.

98
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,722
<i>Design is the focus of my studies,</i>

99
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,977
<i>so it's only natural</i>
<i>that I be the one to draw it.</i>

100
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,104
I like kids so much already,

101
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:35,066
and I think it's so much fun
to imagine a design or a graphic

102
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,695
<i>that the kids might appreciate</i>
<i>wearing to school or out with friends.</i>

103
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,113
CAFE CHOCOLATE SQUAD RUNNING WILD

104
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:44,367
Yeah, this kind of thing
is super fun for me, for sure.

105
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,161
DAY BEFORE CHILDREN'S CAFETERIA EVENT

106
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,415
Let's do this quickly. What!
This room looks so beautiful now.

107
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,541
I know, right?

108
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,042
It's so amazing.

109
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,044
For real! I mean,
it looks so professional!

110
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,671
Super well done.

111
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,174
Oh.

112
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,385
It's a little scary up here.

113
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,679
It's definitely scary, right?

114
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,223
Here. I'll hold it for you.

115
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,059
So scary.

116
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,103
<i>He didn't say, "I'll paint it for you."</i>

117
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,439
- <i>That's right.</i>
- <i>Just, "I'll hold it."</i>

118
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,232
Oh, gosh!

119
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,694
Seriously?

120
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,778
It's fine!

121
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,239
Stop holding my hand.

122
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,618
- She's starting to look like a dominatrix.
- You're right, she is.

123
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,329
I'm holding it.

124
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,206
- It's scary.
- It's okay.

125
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,918
<i>Tackle held the ladder for me.</i>

126
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,212
I was kind of scared to stand up there

127
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,007
because I had to paint
pretty high up on the wall.

128
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,925
<i>But he held the ladder the whole time,</i>

129
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,219
<i>and even when I'd ask for something small,</i>

130
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,305
<i>he'd go above and beyond to help me.</i>

131
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,017
I feel a bond between us,
and he's always chosen me.

132
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,810
So, he makes me feel secure.

133
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,273
- Oh? Well, those feelings are unexpected.
- Oh.

134
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,108
That's way too big!

135
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,777
For real.

136
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,403
No, no, no.

137
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,364
It's way too big, right?

138
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,325
Just kidding, all good.

139
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,743
Hers is just different.

140
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,036
It's cute.

141
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,248
Isn't it cute?

142
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,709
He thinks a compliment
can get him out of anything.

143
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,628
<i>He was honest with me.</i>

144
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,381
On the boat,
he told me how he felt about me.

145
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,510
But if I'm unable
to love you back by the end of this…

146
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,304
I think that would be terrible.

147
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,143
I won't give up on you.

148
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,938
I understand.

149
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,360
But in a way,
being that honest with each other,

150
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,363
helped bring us closer,

151
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,491
<i>or at least helped erase</i>
<i>any weird tension between us,</i>

152
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,618
<i>so we can be more open with each other.</i>

153
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,831
If he ends up
having feelings for me when this is over,

154
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,708
I'd like to have another chance.

155
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,504
- I'm getting the hang of it.
- You're a pro now?

156
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,965
- It's so cute. Thank you.
- Yay!

157
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,926
- Come on, Tsuu. Where's the string?
- Oh, sorry. My bad.

158
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,263
- Here.
- Be careful.

159
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,557
- Whoa!
- See! What'd I tell ya?

160
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,601
Come on.

161
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,895
- It wasn't on purpose.
- Oh, my God.

162
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,564
- You're always getting splashed.
- Right.

163
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,149
- That's my role?
- That's your role.

164
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,275
Okay, got it.

165
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,359
Again with the water.

166
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,735
- Not the water.
- Danger!

167
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,653
That's right!

168
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,530
- Always with the water.
- Dangerous.

169
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,617
<i>Baby and I</i>
<i>have been talking for a few days.</i>

170
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,953
And I feel like I
can be myself around her.

171
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,289
You know, we also think a lot alike.

172
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:40,126
So I feel like that's a good sign as well,
as far as our future.

173
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,255
So, I'm thinking,
I'm her best option at this point.

174
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,632
Before the paint gets dry…

175
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,092
Oh, sorry. You got it.

176
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,928
Syoko, you should do it.

177
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,513
Yeah, please do it!

178
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,225
- Like this? Whoa.
- Looks nice.

179
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,477
- Oh, that's nice!
- Looks good.

180
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,437
- Yay!
- Good work, Syoko, as always.

181
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,480
Nice work!

182
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,566
<i>When you compare Syoko and myself,</i>

183
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,985
and consider the way we look,

184
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,155
and how we behave as former Yankiis,

185
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:13,409
I think, normally, we'd probably
be considered an odd pair.

186
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,077
<i>But despite that,</i>

187
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,456
<i>she allowed us to connect with her kids.</i>

188
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,124
<i>She clearly cares about them,</i>

189
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,168
<i>and would have wanted to keep them</i>

190
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,545
<i>away from us when we were their age.</i>

191
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,758
So I'm kind of hoping I get the chance
to properly thank her face-to-face,

192
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,259
at the end of all this.

193
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,346
- We're done.
- It's good?

194
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,555
I think it's good.

195
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,516
<i>Looks good.</i>

196
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,726
Right? It's good.

197
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,102
Mission accomplished.

198
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,231
I feel like the level
of detail on this is pretty great.

199
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,858
All that's left is to set up and cook.

200
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,194
- It looks perfect.
- For sure.

201
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,781
- Morning.
- Good morning.

202
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,866
- Nisei overslept, as usual.
- Nice.

203
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,118
- What up?
- Oh, there he is.

204
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,495
- Morning.
- Morning.

205
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,955
What's all that stuff?

206
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,415
The T-shirts have arrived.

207
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,710
For real? Awesome. Nice work, Nisei.

208
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,046
- Look.
- This is so cute.

209
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,465
- It came out nice!
- This looks great!

210
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,300
I made it look kinda mischievous.

211
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,094
- You're so good.
- Amazing.

212
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,679
She worked so hard on that.

213
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,556
- Thank you.
- Nice work!

214
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,266
Yeah, great work.

215
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,310
It's so cute. For real.

216
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,104
Wonderful. Thank you.

217
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,772
DAY OF THE CHILDREN'S CAFETERIA EVENT

218
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,274
It's a festival.

219
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,483
Hey, there.

220
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,818
- Hello.
- Hey!

221
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,027
Looking forward to today.

222
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,696
Got a few more things to do to prepare.

223
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,030
Today's gonna be great!

224
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,574
If you don't mind.

225
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,825
This is amazing.

226
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,161
- You definitely made this?
- We have to stick this over there.

227
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,496
Oh, right, yeah.

228
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,957
- Stick those onto the box.
- How about this?

229
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,500
- Right here is good.
- Okay.

230
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,752
I made sure to write
"Badly In Love" on it.

231
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,546
I see that, yeah. That's amazing.

232
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,797
This is so nice.

233
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,466
- Great.
- Applause.

234
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,510
<i>Oto?</i>

235
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,555
I thought she
had a great eye, artistically.

236
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,973
She also draws, of course.

237
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,601
I didn't see that coming.

238
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,020
I am kind of attracted to her.

239
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,105
<i>If I'm being honest,</i>

240
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,400
<i>I'd have to say that, initially,</i>
<i>I did think she was cute.</i>

241
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,901
<i>I liked her vibe.</i>

242
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,362
So, when it comes to Oto,
I kind of feel like

243
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,281
I want to get a bit closer with her.

244
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,951
- Oh. Interesting.
- Well, that's nice.

245
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,287
The chemistry between these two
is pretty good, you know?

246
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,330
Right.

247
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,625
Stick A? Where's that?

248
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,168
I guess these go together.

249
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,127
Oh, right.

250
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,963
I don't get it. Hold on a sec.

251
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,506
I don't get it either.

252
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,094
Oh, here? You're stamping my hand?

253
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,015
- I'll mix it with blue.
- Adding some blue?

254
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,017
- Wait.
- I think we're good.

255
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,102
- Something's off.
- Get one more, then it's done.

256
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,312
Something's not right.

257
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,272
I'll go get one more.

258
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,232
Let's try making another one.

259
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,735
You're covered in balloons, Baby.

260
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,154
- There's so many.
- They keep sticking to me.

261
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,659
- Hey, Milk.
- Yeah?

262
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,410
Milk, come here for a sec.

263
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,037
Baby's a balloon lady.

264
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,623
Isn't this kinda weird?

265
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,709
See? This isn't right.

266
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,794
Do it like this.

267
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,089
I should have asked you to do it,
would've been faster.

268
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,799
- What were you working on?
- When?

269
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:15,883
Just now.

270
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,218
- Now?
- Yeah.

271
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,428
I was working on some chores inside.

272
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,389
I tried to call you.

273
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,058
Yeah, that's way faster.

274
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,143
I knew I should have asked you to do it.

275
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,188
<i>She tried to call him, huh?</i>

276
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,148
<i>Interesting choice of words.</i>

277
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,653
It's like, no matter what I do,
she gets mad at me

278
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,530
and, like, makes a face.

279
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,616
<i>I feel like she's cold with me.</i>

280
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,576
<i>She gets mean.</i>

281
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,620
At one point,

282
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,872
I threw a box of markers to Tekarin.

283
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,460
And then, Baby said,
"Don't throw them. You might hit her."

284
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,963
Like super dead-serious.

285
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,005
Catch.

286
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,967
Hey, you shouldn't throw it. For real.

287
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,928
Sorry.

288
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,597
<i>That kind of annoyed me, you know?</i>

289
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,391
I was like, "The hell?"

290
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,310
I don't know why she did that.

291
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,147
And then, when we were talking
to Tackle in the living room,

292
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,065
about him and Kii,

293
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,943
<i>Tackle said he'd held the ladder for Kii,</i>

294
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,903
<i>to keep it steady while she was using it.</i>

295
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,031
So I was like, "You're such a gentleman.
That's so nice."

296
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,158
And then, Baby said,

297
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,995
<i>"You know, when I was on the ladder,</i>
<i>Milk didn't hold it for me."</i>

298
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,789
Like, "Don't you do this for a living?"

299
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,708
<i>But you just said you liked her?</i>

300
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,668
The way she said it was pretty harsh.

301
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,713
I think there was a better way
to express that.

302
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,009
Hmm.

303
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:44,680
So, like, Milk had been my
first choice among the guys,

304
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,265
all this time, but then…

305
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,434
<i>Today, for example,</i>

306
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:52,980
<i>I was kinda hoping he would come</i>
<i>spend time with me, but he didn't.</i>

307
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,191
And I noticed that.
It was a big deal for me.

308
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,276
<i>He wasn't there when she wanted his help.</i>

309
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:01,781
She doesn't take any initiative
or seek me out.

310
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,033
Even when we talk, it goes nowhere.

311
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,663
So for me, I feel like that initial spark
that I felt has faded a little, for sure.

312
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,250
But I shouldn't give up on her.

313
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,336
Mmm…

314
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,299
- Stop being a beggar, man.
- Right.

315
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,550
Just go get her.

316
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,469
Yeah, I think you're right.

317
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,638
- He said he liked her, right?
- Hmm.

318
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,264
All right. Good. Looks cute.

319
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,391
Oh, right. We worked on that yesterday.

320
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,352
- It smells like popcorn.
- I'm back.

321
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,729
- Mmm.
- No way.

322
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,606
<i>These two have something good going.</i>

323
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,399
<i>They have good chemistry.</i>

324
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,113
- All right. Let's get fired up.
- Yeah.

325
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,908
- Everyone, circle up.
- That head band suits him.

326
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,035
It does. He looks like a carnival worker.

327
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,870
- He does for sure.
- So true.

328
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,831
- Tsuu's looking cool.
- I dig his look.

329
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,207
Carnival boss is here.

330
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,167
The boss is here.

331
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,212
Okay, everyone.
We put a lot of work into this.

332
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:02,132
Let's show 'em what we got,
and make those kids as happy as possible!

333
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,385
Let's go!

334
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,846
- All right! This'll be great!
- Let's do this!

335
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,222
- Get in position.
- Okay.

336
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,057
- Good luck, everyone.
- Do your best!

337
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,101
- Let's go!
- Let's just do our best.

338
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,979
- Let the festival begin!
- All right, let's do this!

339
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,648
Come on! Welcome! Step right up!

340
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,607
Right here!

341
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,693
Welcome! Welcome!

342
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,320
- Welcome! This way!
- Do you want some takoyaki?

343
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,197
Nice! Nice!

344
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,365
Sure!

345
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,242
- You came for us?
- Yeah.

346
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,201
Thank you.

347
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,453
- Tekarin.
- Ah!

348
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,414
- She said "Tekarin."
- Mona!

349
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,457
Mona, thank you so much for the letter.

350
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,085
- My letter?
- I wrote a letter for you, too.

351
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,045
- Really? For me?
- All right!

352
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,463
- Is this fun?
- Right this way!

353
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,965
- Wanna give it a try?
- Thank you!

354
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,759
- A letter for you, Mona.
- <i>Oh, that's nice.</i>

355
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,261
I'm pretty good at this.

356
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,971
This is my best work.

357
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,181
- Hey!
- Thank you.

358
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,266
Eat up!

359
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,435
<i>"Eat up."</i>

360
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,812
- It's really good.
- Yeah? I must be a genius at it.

361
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,023
I'm from Kansai, so I make great yakisoba.

362
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,816
- It's good.
- Glad you like it.

363
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,985
I'll give you one. You want one, right?

364
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:09,450
I definitely want to open
a place like this for kids,

365
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,410
back in Ibaraki.

366
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,661
<i>There's so many kids</i>

367
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,289
<i>who have a lot of stuff</i>
<i>they want to share with their parents,</i>

368
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,167
<i>but their parents</i>
<i>are too busy for them, you know?</i>

369
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,379
I just hope everyone has a ton of fun
and goes home happy.

370
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,009
You played a lot, didn't you?

371
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,178
Nice, looking good.

372
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,472
Tekarin is such a sweet girl.

373
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,932
Yeah, she is so sweet.

374
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,017
- Nice girl.
- She seems like she'd be a good mom.

375
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,393
- I know.
- Right?

376
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,520
- Hey, let me see.
- <i>They're having a blast.</i>

377
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,439
Aw, that's so cute.

378
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,483
- Turn and face the camera.
- Like this.

379
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,276
Three, two, one…

380
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,612
So cute! That's a great photo!

381
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,113
<i>Well, that's nice!</i>

382
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,741
Some boys want you to put make up on them.

383
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,743
- <i>She's a professional.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

384
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,287
Just up to here. See? You don't--

385
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,664
You made it look easy.

386
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,416
<i>For a second there</i>
<i>I was a little overwhelmed,</i>

387
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,961
when all the kids just came rushing over.

388
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,921
But I'm a make-up artist now.

389
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,256
<i>Those are skills I can offer them.</i>

390
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,385
<i>I didn't feel like I had</i>
<i>too many strengths before,</i>

391
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,928
<i>so I used to be at a loss</i>

392
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,514
<i>and didn't know what I could do</i>
<i>to keep kids happy.</i>

393
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,976
But then this time,
when the kids came over,

394
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,396
<i>whether it was a three-year-old girl</i>
<i>or some teenage boys,</i>

395
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,315
<i>they were eager to learn from me,</i>
<i>how to do make-up.</i>

396
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,567
I had a place like that when I was little,

397
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,195
and that's how I was able
to make more friends.

398
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,614
<i>I didn't have any friends in my grade,</i>

399
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,908
<i>but because I had a place like that,</i>

400
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,411
<i>I made friends with kids</i>
<i>who went to other schools.</i>

401
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,622
It was an important part
of my childhood, for sure.

402
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,042
<i>I'm hoping that Syoko</i>
<i>lives a long, fruitful life.</i>

403
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,422
And I feel like I've grown a lot,
throughout this experience.

404
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,549
Wanna do it?

405
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,093
You'll do it?

406
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,470
- You're cute.
- So sweet.

407
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,515
Let's go, you got it!

408
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,225
You can do it! Go! Go! Go!

409
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,729
- Nice work!
- Amazing!

410
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,565
- You're scaring her! Terrifying!
- So scary!

411
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,400
Like some old dude is just yelling at her.

412
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,568
Yeah, for sure.

413
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,903
- Thank you for coming.
- Thanks so much.

414
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:10,863
Take care.

415
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,948
Your tattoos are cool.

416
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,534
Hey, I'll take you to my tattoo guy.

417
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,661
- Your tattoo guy?
- Stop it, stop it.

418
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,288
Do you have a boyfriend?

419
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,123
I don't. Because he was a player.

420
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,250
- Oh, that's no good.
- Whoa.

421
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,461
I've heard that before. Yeah.

422
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,130
So is this guy, so is he. For real.

423
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,591
Everyone, come here.
We're gonna take a picture.

424
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,967
Come over here.

425
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,303
All right, say cheese, everyone.

426
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,596
<i>Looking good.</i>

427
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,056
- That'll be great!
- Nice photo.

428
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,015
Thanks so much.

429
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,475
<i>That must feel good.</i>

430
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,601
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

431
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,894
- See you.
- It was fun.

432
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,437
Tackle, come here.

433
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,814
- Okay, bye.
- Mei-Mei is so cute.

434
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,776
<i>It's nice to see the kids</i>
<i>so happy like that.</i>

435
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,194
Thank you for everything.

436
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,196
- It was fun.
- You were great.

437
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,364
The kids loved it. They were so happy.

438
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,409
<i>Some of them were crying</i>
<i>because they didn't want you to go.</i>

439
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,036
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>No way.</i>

440
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,372
- Truly, thank you very much.
- Thank you, as well.

441
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,166
- I'll come visit again.
- Please do.

442
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,043
- Okay.
- This was fun, thank you.

443
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,712
Before we all take off,
I wrote a letter for you.

444
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,506
- Really?
- Is it okay if I read it aloud?

445
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,840
Yes, of course, please.

446
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,801
She likes to read letters out loud.

447
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,095
"Dear, Syoko. First of all, thank you

448
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,431
for letting us spend time with these kids
that are special to you,

449
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,935
<i>despite the way we look,</i>
<i>and our past as former Yankii."</i>

450
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,523
<i>"Some of us haven't completely</i>
<i>left our Yankii selves behind."</i>

451
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,567
<i>"We might swear, or look scary,</i>

452
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,237
<i>so I'm sure you must have been</i>
<i>at least a little worried."</i>

453
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,198
"But I adore you
for having such a big heart

454
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,866
and letting us do things our own way."

455
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,992
Thank you so much.

456
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,537
<i>"I think that having a big heart</i>

457
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,373
<i>and allowing kids to do their thing</i>
<i>and be themselves</i>

458
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,291
<i>comes with a huge responsibility."</i>

459
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,420
<i>"I was moved by how you can handle</i>
<i>all that when you interact with the kids."</i>

460
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,797
<i>Oh, Oto.</i>

461
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,049
"Someday, I hope I can become

462
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,302
a strong woman
with a huge heart, just like you."

463
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,512
That's so kind.

464
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,680
<i>She's great.</i>

465
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,641
"I also hope that I can start
something like this one day,

466
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,434
to provide support for children."

467
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,353
That is incredibly kind of you.

468
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,522
Thank you so much
for that wonderful letter.

469
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,233
- It was wonderful.
- Super sweet.

470
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,403
The kids genuinely seemed
like they were having a blast.

471
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,613
I think they definitely enjoyed it.

472
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,699
It became a good memory
for them. Thank you.

473
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,118
- Thank you.
- You're all so great.

474
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,953
- So are you!
- Thank you.

475
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:23,871
Goodbye.

476
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,707
- That was such a good time.
- Hmm.

477
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,085
- This is a dating show, right?
- It is, yes. A reality dating show.

478
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,254
- Not a rehabilitation show?
- No, no, no.

479
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,755
- Social rehab documentary?
- No.

480
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,756
- You sure?
- Yeah.

481
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,717
I was like, "What am I watching?"

482
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,220
It's not a rehab show. I promise it's not.

483
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,231
<i>Thanks for your hard work</i>
<i>at the children's event.</i>

484
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,566
- Nice job, everyone.
- Good work.

485
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,818
<i>Since this is the last night</i>
<i>you'll all spend together.</i>

486
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,779
<i>We are having</i>
<i>a smorgasbord in the courtyard.</i>

487
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,991
- Yay! All right!
- Let's go!

488
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,201
What's a "smorgasbord"?

489
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,285
I don't know.

490
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,996
They don't know what a smorgasbord is.

491
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,707
Look, a fire!

492
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,584
- Whoa, amazing!
- This is great.

493
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,337
This is the smorgasbord?
Like a buffet party?

494
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,713
Yeah, that's right.

495
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,173
Whoa, this is amazing!

496
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,383
Hey, this is exactly what I wanted.

497
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,220
- This is so nice.
- Ah, it's so fancy.

498
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,556
So, we've got one more day to go here.

499
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,351
Good job on the last two weeks, everyone.

500
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,311
- Nice job, everyone!
- Cheers!

501
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,063
<i>One more day to go.</i>

502
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,689
<i>That was fast, one day left.</i>

503
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,650
- <i>Their last night.</i>
- Good job.

504
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,526
- Yay!
- You know how to high-five?

505
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,612
She was like, "Hey!"

506
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,157
- <i>Everyone's gotten so close.</i>
- <i>Yeah, they're friends.</i>

507
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,284
What is love, anyway?

508
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,037
- What is love?
- I don't know, to be honest.

509
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,914
- Right?
- You sound so formal.

510
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,499
Because he's our elder.

511
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,458
Oh, I see.

512
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,252
This is crazy!

513
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,880
- But that was so fun.
- So cute.

514
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,841
- Today was a lot of fun, yeah.
- Hmm.

515
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,885
You don't get to experience that often.

516
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,346
- They were such good kids.
- Kids are great, right?

517
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,974
Yeah, the best. They're so adorable.

518
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,101
- Made me wonder if I was like that.
- I feel you.

519
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,352
I'm sure you were.

520
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,437
- I think everyone was, at some point.
- We all were.

521
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,397
Yeah.

522
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,484
In my case, both my parents worked
since I was in elementary school.

523
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,696
There was this kids' cafeteria
in my neighborhood too,

524
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,905
almost like a daycare.

525
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,824
- A latchkey kid.
- Ones next to the schools.

526
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,993
I was a latchkey kid.
I wore it around my neck.

527
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,578
I think the memories from there
are the strongest for me.

528
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,539
- Hmm.
- From my childhood.

529
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,334
Those fun times can stay with you,
so after being with the kids today,

530
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,295
I'm hoping they formed good memories.

531
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,296
Hmm.

532
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,091
Like, I grew up in a very strict family.

533
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:45,554
So, like, I was either at home, at school,
or being taken to some lessons.

534
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,889
Those were my only three options as a kid.

535
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,516
I didn't have a place to play,

536
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,144
or to open up
about what I was feeling at the time.

537
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,939
So, if there had been
a place like that for me as a kid,

538
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,318
<i>where no one would force me to do anything</i>

539
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,778
<i>and just let me do whatever I wanted,</i>

540
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,448
I think my life
would have been very different.

541
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,365
Makes sense.

542
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,783
That letter was so thoughtful.

543
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,327
- That was great.
- It's what I felt.

544
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,996
- I was surprised.
- <i>Yeah, it was lovely.</i>

545
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,498
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing,

546
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,084
that it would have been nice
to have a place like that.

547
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,004
And it's a dream of mine,

548
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,465
to create a special place like that,

549
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,467
a place that can warm people's hearts.

550
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,136
I hope it can be the kind of place

551
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,223
that they can remember forever.

552
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,643
<i>And so, I gave it everything I had today.</i>

553
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,438
And I feel like I can share that
with all of you

554
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,399
because of how open all of you have been.

555
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,028
So I'm starting to feel pretty sad.

556
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,446
It's sad it's ending.

557
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,074
<i>My past is complicated,</i>

558
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:51,620
so initially I was trying
to avoid being vulnerable.

559
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:55,082
But with everyone
living together in this environment,

560
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,876
<i>it turned out we could naturally open up,</i>

561
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,170
<i>because everyone has a similar mindset.</i>

562
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:04,591
<i>We could understand each other,</i>
<i>which was really important to me.</i>

563
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,054
And I thought,
maybe connecting is actually nice.

564
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,139
<i>Oh?</i>

565
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,227
- Anyway, I think it was good. Thank you.
- Yeah.

566
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,770
- Thanks for sharing.
- Thank you.

567
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,979
Thank you.

568
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,690
- Let's have another toast.
- All right.

569
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,192
- Hell yeah.
- Another toast.

570
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,402
And, cheers!

571
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:27,114
- Cheers!
- Cheers, everybody!

572
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,657
Good job!

573
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,204
Those two weeks just flew by.

574
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,330
They did.

575
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,417
- Time flew by, for real.
- So fast, right?

576
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,334
It flew by.

577
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,169
I mean, I'm happy it was with you guys.

578
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,629
Crazy how fast it went.

579
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,630
I'm sad.

580
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,967
This is what being young feels like.

581
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,260
I'm sad.

582
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,679
Baby said something great.

583
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,181
Like "connecting
with other people is quite nice. "

584
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,808
It was great that they got to interact

585
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,185
with different personalities
at the children's cafeteria.

586
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,354
They had to communicate differently.

587
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,274
That's right. They expressed themselves
differently with the kids.

588
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,775
Yeah, that's true.

589
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,278
You can tell Tekarin
likes connecting with kids.

590
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,530
- Yeah, she'd be a good mom.
- Right.

591
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,532
And Oto's letter was nice, wasn't it?

592
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,909
- It was so good.
- I know.

593
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,579
Like, she gets too serious
when it comes to romance,

594
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,998
but when it comes to work
or things like this,

595
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,667
you start to see her charm
a lot more, you know?

596
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,751
- Right!
- Yeah.

597
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,212
When you see Oto in that light,
she doesn't feel so intense.

598
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,506
- Right.
- She's being her natural self.

599
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,051
If she were to fall in love
after interacting more platonically,

600
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,887
I think things would go better for her.

601
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,432
- Yeah, for sure.
- Also, Baby was pretty cold towards Milk.

602
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,267
I feel like she was kind of mean.

603
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,144
<i>When something isn't going well,</i>

604
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,938
<i>wouldn't you want the person</i>
<i>you like to help you out?</i>

605
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,773
<i>That's what was happening.</i>

606
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,277
Like, "If you were paying attention to me,
you'd have seen I needed help."

607
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,904
I think she was feeling a bit of that.

608
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,824
What surprised me was that this
wasn't directed towards Nisei or Tsuu.

609
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,284
- Just Milk.
- Yeah.

610
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,870
I didn't think she
still had feelings for him.

611
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,456
She was like, "Why didn't you hold
the ladder for me?" Right?

612
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,541
- Exactly.
- It was a little desperate.

613
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,876
- It was.
- Begging a little.

614
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,295
I don't think she'd have said that
if she didn't like him.

615
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,423
But Milk is bad with clever comebacks,
know what I mean?

616
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,633
She asked, "Where were you?"

617
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,135
He could have flirted and said,
"Were you looking for me?"

618
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,678
- That's true.
- Good point.

619
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,306
"You didn't hold the ladder for me."
"I'll hold it right now."

620
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,266
"I'll hold it right away."

621
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,101
Then everyone would've laughed, right?

622
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,479
- Been playful and spontaneous.
- Something to laugh it off.

623
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,022
And then it would've been over.

624
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,357
Tackle, move over.

625
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,943
- Do you want to sit here?
- Yeah.

626
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,861
Move over. I want to sit.

627
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,947
You can sit on my lap.

628
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,949
I'm heavy, it should be
the other way around.

629
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,117
- Then you sit down. I'll sit on you.
- Sure.

630
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,661
- I'll stretch.
- Give me some.

631
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,120
<i>Oh, my.</i>

632
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,373
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Oh, my, that is just…</i>

633
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,707
<i>Oh, man, look at that.</i>

634
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,292
You didn't think I'd sit on you.

635
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,795
- <i>Of course she's upset.</i>
- <i>Naturally.</i>

636
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,423
Well, everyone,
shall we go spend some time one-on-one?

637
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,009
That sounds good.
Yuria, let's have one more chat.

638
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,554
- Nice.
- Let's talk.

639
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,763
Yeah, of course.

640
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,224
- You and I are oddly similar, right?
- We are.

641
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,351
- I'll do it for you.
- You're the same age?

642
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,769
This is killing me.

643
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,563
I hear that it either gets better.

644
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,816
<i>I can imagine that's pretty hard to watch.</i>

645
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,569
But it's not like I'm trying
to make it worse by flirting with you.

646
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,947
I know, I didn't take it that way.
I just want to hear you out.

647
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,407
We're just good friends.

648
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,701
- We're just buddies. That's all.
- Okay.

649
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,579
It's so dark!

650
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,913
After you.

651
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,666
Wow, this is so nice!

652
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,834
You think so?

653
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,836
I feel more at ease here than in our room.

654
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,004
- Really?
- Yeah.

655
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,298
- Kii, should we go?
- Sure.

656
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,762
- To the living room?
- Yeah, sure.

657
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,059
<i>Oh, here's another one</i>
<i>I can't quite get a read on.</i>

658
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,478
<i>Her response felt pretty genuine.</i>

659
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,147
Only one day left.

660
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,315
It's crazy.

661
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:49,941
I know.

662
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,194
- Let's toast. Cheers.
- Tenten, let's drink.

663
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,030
- Tenten, come here.
- Lil' Tenten.

664
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,906
- To Tenten.
- Hey, listen.

665
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,283
Don't think we need lil' Tenten.

666
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,076
I want Tenten to hear what I have to say.

667
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,703
- Leave him alone.
- It's totally fine.

668
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,289
I don't know what to do when she says,
"Come on stronger."

669
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,541
She says she likes me,
but takes no initiative.

670
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,629
And I know she's given it some thought.
She's serious.

671
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,339
I've always been a pretty assertive guy.

672
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,008
I'd chase them.
My first love wanted that, too.

673
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,343
But it's painful in the end.

674
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,469
Chasing is good.

675
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,263
So if she thinks
I'm not chasing her enough,

676
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,681
then I guess that's that.

677
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,392
- Chasing her more would just be painful.
- I get it.

678
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,312
I mean, for me, I feel like,

679
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,148
I don't want to just be in a relationship,
I want to get married.

680
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,858
- I see.
- After two weeks?

681
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,693
- You can know that quickly?
- No way.

682
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,779
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That's impossible.

683
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:39,449
If there's no one here
who makes me feel it's even possible,

684
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,576
then I think it's fine
if I don't match with anyone.

685
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,995
- So you're taking this seriously.
- Yeah, for sure.

686
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,497
We talked about this yesterday.

687
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,500
If I'm serious about this,
I should probably…

688
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,085
I think you should tell him.

689
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,211
How do you feel?

690
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,505
Would you tell him
if you were in my shoes?

691
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,090
No, but…

692
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,966
- Huh? What was that?
- What happened?

693
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,677
She deflated.

694
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,220
She's such an open book!

695
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,471
So easy to read.

696
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,766
It'll be clear soon enough. Either way.

697
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,267
- By tomorrow?
- Yeah.

698
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,352
Then, I'll borrow him.

699
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,105
If it fell apart because of that,
it was never good to begin with.

700
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,523
- Where to?
- Let's go.

701
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,149
- The girls' room?
- Anywhere.

702
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,360
We can go to the smoking area.

703
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,407
Whoa, the classroom.

704
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,409
Sit down.

705
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,453
Sit there? What about you?

706
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,538
On top.

707
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,497
Of me?

708
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,873
- Just sit there.
- No.

709
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,459
What's the point of you
sitting on top of me.

710
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,465
Fine, I'll sit next to you then.

711
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,722
- Let's make a toasty.
- Sure, cheers.

712
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,932
- <i>A "toasty."</i>
- <i>"Let's make a toasty."</i>

713
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,767
Where's Baby?

714
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,353
I don't know.
Maybe in the classroom with Tsuu.

715
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,605
I heard he told her yesterday
that he likes her too.

716
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,983
<i>Who did you hear that from?</i>

717
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,192
<i>From Tsuu himself.</i>

718
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,193
<i>Mmm.</i>

719
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,946
So I feel like I shouldn't
bother them right now.

720
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,992
I have a lot of respect for Tsukahara.

721
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,162
And I get tired
of having to chase all the time.

722
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,330
Oh, I get it, for sure.

723
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,791
Don't get tired after only two weeks.

724
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,543
I know, for real.

725
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,753
Seriously.

726
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,382
I mean, this was a lot of fun.

727
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,050
I'll probably cry tomorrow.

728
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,385
You'll cry tomorrow?

729
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,595
No, I'm just kidding.

730
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,221
- You won't cry?
- No.

731
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,056
- I'll make you cry.
- That's scary.

732
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,142
I will for sure.

733
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,685
- "I'll make you cry."
- Yeah.

734
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,562
I'll make you cry.

735
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,983
These two weeks were
pretty deep or pretty intense, right?

736
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,234
I mean, seriously,

737
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,613
I was able to open up because everyone
in the cast made that possible.

738
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,531
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

739
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,617
I chose to come on this show,

740
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,204
and that means
I got to get to know you all.

741
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,790
- That's true. That's right.
- You and I got to know each other.

742
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,957
Same for me.

743
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,251
That's why I'm glad I met everyone.

744
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,171
We don't know
how things will turn out. Tomorrow.

745
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:01,049
- Oh, right, we have to do the confessions.
- Yeah.

746
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,010
- We're confessing tomorrow.
- You're right.

747
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,596
- To everyone.
- I forgot about it.

748
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,681
I feel like confessing right now.

749
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,766
If it was up to me.

750
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,267
- If it was up to you?
- Yeah.

751
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,394
I was ready yesterday.

752
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,687
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

753
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,773
I can't wait.

754
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,818
- <i>He's so straightforward.</i>
- <i>Yeah, it's nice.</i>

755
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,319
Have you sorted out your thoughts?

756
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,489
No, I haven't sorted them out yet.
I mean, kind of…

757
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:30,453
But there's someone I want to talk to
and ask what his deal is.

758
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,788
Hmm.

759
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,164
I need to check on that.

760
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,459
So I don't have any regrets,
like you said.

761
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,753
- I think that's good.
- I think I need to talk to him.

762
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,796
Yeah.

763
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,882
- You should ask him to talk.
- Yeah.

764
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,425
I think I'll talk to him.

765
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,386
Definitely, tell him you want to talk.

766
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,303
Hmm.

767
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,430
For both of us.

768
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,100
- I don't like being bothered by this.
- Yeah, for sure.

769
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,686
You don't want to regret
not talking to him.

770
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,896
- Because this could be it.
- Yeah.

771
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,231
This is it?

772
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,024
You'll see him tomorrow.

773
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,359
At least.

774
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,653
- I'll go talk to him.
- Tell him what's up.

775
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,738
- "Tell him what's up."
- Yeah, tell him.

776
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,160
- Thanks for hanging out.
- Totally my pleasure.

777
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,413
I don't really get Milk.

778
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,040
<i>She can talk with Tsuu</i>
<i>about these kinds of things.</i>

779
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,293
I mean, to be honest,

780
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,128
I have no doubts anymore.

781
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,339
That's the truth. For me, at least.

782
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,009
I don't know how everyone else is feeling.

783
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,970
But for me, I have no doubts.

784
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,100
All that's left to do is to offer up
my feelings to her tomorrow.

785
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,561
Give it my all.

786
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,858
To be honest, it was too quick.

787
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,821
We won't get to hang out here anymore.

788
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,197
Isn't that crazy?

789
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,742
It's pretty sad.

790
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,703
Before coming here,
I used to start fiddling with my phone,

791
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:57,081
and then not be able to sleep,
and then eventually pass out.

792
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,418
Now I don't have time
to fiddle with my phone,

793
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,086
and I don't even want to.

794
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,505
I don't even care about social media.

795
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,383
- I feel pretty happy about that.
- Yeah.

796
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,887
You know, I think we were meant
to meet each other,

797
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,805
that's why we all got close.

798
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,059
We can get closer.
We can still get closer. Hmm.

799
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,685
- You think so?
- I know so.

800
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,853
- Closer than this?
- Yeah.

801
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,022
- Then do it.
- <i>Oh, my. She likes him.</i>

802
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,231
<i>Go for it, Tackle!</i>

803
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,399
Can I come in?

804
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,362
What the hell? Why are you
wearing a different outfit now?

805
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,947
- What?
- He ruined it!

806
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,865
Just when things were getting good.

807
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,117
A rival approaches!

808
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,119
Why did you change your clothes?

809
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,788
The other shirt was see-through.

810
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,122
- You think?
- Yeah.

811
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,124
- You noticed?
- Right? It's crazy.

812
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,543
Come over here. Join us. You're so funny.

813
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,295
Tenten, you're pretty great.

814
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,547
Same, you're the best.
All the guys have gotten close.

815
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,132
- Totally.
- Nice.

816
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,802
I'm glad I got to know the real Tenten.

817
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:51,803
You're so funny.

818
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,222
- Really?
- I bet he can be funnier.

819
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,099
The more we get to know each other, sure.

820
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,351
I broke out of my shell, thanks to you.

821
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,352
You did.

822
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,814
For real. I can't walk.

823
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,191
- That's funny.
- Just leave quickly.

824
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,194
- He's so cute.
- Good luck.

825
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,031
Thoughts? On tomorrow?

826
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,659
I mean, talking with you has felt great.

827
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,744
Like, you work in the service industry,

828
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,496
so you see a lot of women, of course.

829
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,164
But even then, I noticed that

830
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,585
you complimented me the most
on my personality and other things.

831
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,131
When I got to know your personality,
I thought that you were so mature.

832
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,509
My motto is
to be the girl who gets tastier

833
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,386
the longer that you chew her.

834
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,638
- I'm not boring.
- Like <i>atarime</i>? Like squid?

835
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,557
- That's good, I like that.
- Yeah, like squid.

836
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,599
That's nice.

837
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,269
You know, some things you said to me

838
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,687
got me thinking a lot.

839
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,898
I feel like I gained
so much from our talks.

840
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,942
I loved what you had to say.

841
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,237
I'm flattered.
It's nice to hear, thank you.

842
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:55,575
In terms of a person's personality,
or how they communicate,

843
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,244
it's good to get to know
all that about that person,

844
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,705
but it also makes it harder to choose.

845
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,124
Hmm.

846
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,627
Honestly, I think I'll decide
based on how I feel tomorrow.

847
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,963
REFRESHED

848
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,923
- Tenten.
- Wanna talk?

849
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,927
- A lot of memories here.
- Yeah, for sure.

850
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,179
<i>These two again.</i>

851
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,847
So, I feel like…

852
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,683
I mean, before you showed up here,

853
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:24,228
I was sort of like, you know…
How should I say it?

854
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,232
I had to be super assertive,
or no one would approach me.

855
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,277
So it felt so good when you approached me.

856
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,907
I hadn't-- It'd been such a long time
since I got a love letter from anyone.

857
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,868
<i>So, obviously</i>
<i>getting one from you felt great.</i>

858
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:44,665
There were a lot of things
you did that made me happy.

859
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,460
<i>But you also made me jealous.</i>

860
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,382
I realized that I do definitely
get jealous at times.

861
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:58,179
I noticed when I'd get that way,
and tried to communicate it.

862
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,224
In that sense, you made me a new person.

863
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,601
You helped me grow, in a way.

864
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,478
And that made me think

865
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:09,273
you're the kind of person
that can make other people jealous too.

866
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,484
So like… Yeah.

867
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,904
- When I think about you, I think…
- I just--

868
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,408
You're honest. More than anyone.

869
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,286
I'm sure everyone can be honest,
but they don't always show it.

870
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,246
Hmm.

871
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,293
And, for a long time,
I hadn't been honest like you are.

872
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,254
- Hmm.
- I feel like…

873
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,216
It's hard to open up to people.

874
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:39,011
And, like, not opening up
has become a habit.

875
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,722
Then I came here,

876
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,143
and I realized I need to speak
from my heart more.

877
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:50,439
And I feel like I learned that from you,
from how open you are.

878
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,150
- Hmm.
- I'm so grateful.

879
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,986
- Yeah, for real.
- Hmm.

880
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,698
- I feel awkward.
- I get it.

881
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,825
But seriously,

882
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,871
I'm pretty selective in choosing
who I surround myself with,

883
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,956
regardless of gender, you know?

884
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,586
So, when it comes to a girlfriend,

885
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,629
it's like…

886
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,007
she'll be the priority.

887
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,967
- She's so important.
- Hmm, I get that.

888
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,263
I get even more selective with my choice.

889
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,598
I can't make up my mind.

890
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,813
If I don't tell someone I like them,
they're not gonna know.

891
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,608
That's what I was thinking.

892
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,903
With Tenten, I can be myself.

893
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,697
I can be honest
about what I do and don't like.

894
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,576
And he's the only one
who helped me grow as a person.

895
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,704
So I told him
that I was thinking of choosing him,

896
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,372
in the end.

897
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,249
That's what we talked about.

898
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,501
<i>She's brave for telling him.</i>

899
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:56,047
To be honest,
I'm not completely sure about Tekarin.

900
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:02,970
I mean, of course, I'm very aware
that Tekarin has feelings for me.

901
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,557
So, I need to think about it carefully.

902
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,561
- Hard to know what he's thinking.
- Tough read.

903
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,856
- What's on his mind?
- Right? I think he's unsure.

904
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,740
- What's wrong?
- I like you.

905
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,950
Oh, thank you.

906
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,702
<i>Oh, no, her boobs. The underboobs are out.</i>

907
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,954
I still like you.

908
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,666
I'm happy to hear that. Seriously.

909
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,710
I truly am.

910
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:38,547
I used to be the type that committed
to someone before they asked.

911
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,757
Yeah.

912
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,926
That happened a lot.

913
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,263
So I've never gotten direct feedback

914
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,933
about what I could have done better
or what they didn't like.

915
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,644
So, whenever I like someone,

916
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:56,315
I feel like I don't quite know
how to act around them.

917
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,400
Hmm.

918
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,279
- So yeah, it's better if you tell me.
- Mm-hmm.

919
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,989
I want you to tell me.

920
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,907
Tell me what I'm doing wrong.

921
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,495
And I'll try to change what I can change.

922
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,831
So I wanted to ask you that.

923
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,336
- Oto, come on.
- There we go!

924
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,963
- Jeez.
- Here come the tears.

925
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,589
Crying isn't the way to go.

926
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,640
Crying again?

927
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,642
- I'm not crying.
- Yes, you are.

928
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,477
- I'm not crying.
- You are.

929
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,980
What would you do if I did?

930
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:39,066
I mean, I think
it's totally fine to cry. Mm-hmm.

931
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,819
It's human, you know? I do it a lot.

932
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,575
I'm so confused right now.
My head is in a weird place.

933
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,660
Why's it in a weird place?

934
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,621
Well, I mean, I want more time to think.

935
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,583
I can't quite figure out why
you like me in the first place,

936
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,959
to be honest.

937
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,294
Should I tell you the reasons?

938
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,463
Hmm? Yeah, tell me.

939
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,257
Number one. Your face.

940
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,383
That's it?

941
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,885
- Just number one.
- Yeah.

942
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,219
Number two.

943
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,512
Your dirty hair.

944
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,265
That's surprising, for real.

945
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,600
Three.

946
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,187
- You seem honest.
- Hmｍ.

947
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,773
If you don't like me, you show it

948
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,859
and I can tell
that you don't feel anything for me.

949
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,736
- So, you're honest.
- Yeah.

950
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,655
Number four.

951
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,617
At the same time,
if you tell me you're not into me,

952
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,744
I want to change your mind.

953
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,372
It motivates me to make you like me.

954
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,500
- And so I try harder.
- Okay.

955
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,878
So, I like you.

956
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,464
Thank you. That's it? Four reasons?

957
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,590
- Five.
- Five?

958
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,425
- I just do.
- That's number five?

959
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,927
- That's a lot.
- I know.

960
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,887
A lot of reasons for liking me.

961
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,056
- What should I do?
- <i>She's coming on strong.</i>

962
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,642
- <i>She's working hard.</i>
- I don't get it.

963
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,185
I honestly don't.

964
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,481
I just know that I can't give up.

965
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:05,152
I feel like the feeling
that there might be a chance

966
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,696
won't go away.

967
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,824
That's where I'm at.

968
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,702
- Got it.
- Yeah.

969
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:21,877
Okay.

970
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,390
What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

971
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,516
That's crazy.

972
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,977
I like you.

973
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,074
<i>Nisei's at a loss.</i>

974
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,243
- <i>He is.</i>
- <i>Doesn't know what to do.</i>

975
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,411
Let's go back.

976
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:56,871
Okay?

977
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,416
I guess we should.

978
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,097
I have to make a confession
at the end, regardless.

979
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,184
Right? You can decide that
based on how you feel tomorrow.

980
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,352
But in terms of how I'm leaning,

981
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,439
I might go for Oto.
I connect with her, and she's faithful.

982
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,068
Really? Wait? What did you say? Seriously?

983
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,112
For real? Oto?

984
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,408
- I think it's cool that she's so faithful.
- Hmm.

985
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,036
When we were working,
I watched her the whole time.

986
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,371
I watched how she worked.
You know, I'm a craftsman, so…

987
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,414
Mm-hmm.

988
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,375
Her sense of art,
her sense of aesthetic is quite good.

989
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,378
- That's what got you?
- Talking to her is fun too.

990
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,131
Oh, I'm so shocked. I did not expect that.

991
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,259
I mean, I don't go out of my way
to talk to Kii or you, do I?

992
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,594
That's true.

993
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,348
The only person
I went out of my way to talk to was Oto.

994
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,267
Wow. Wait, this is too crazy.

995
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,019
I don't think the girls know.

996
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,147
I haven't even told the guys
about how I feel.

997
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,441
- Oto doesn't know, either.
- I don't think so.

998
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,529
But there were a lot of things
that drew me to Oto.

999
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,739
More than Baby, to be honest.

1000
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:14,823
Wait a second.

1001
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,910
- But Oto is chasing someone else.
- Yeah, she is.

1002
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:21,705
So, it's not like I can just tell her
that I like her, too. You know?

1003
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:25,501
But I do have feelings for her.
That's why I've been talking to her.

1004
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,460
Hmm.

1005
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,504
We should have a serious talk.

1006
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,964
Milk, let's talk.

1007
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,508
Hey, let's talk.

1008
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,927
- Oh, no.
- After saying all of that.

1009
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,304
- She's here!
- After he shared all that.

1010
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,389
She's arrived.

1011
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,890
- What is it?
- Let's talk.

1012
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,976
Okay. Here we go.

1013
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,645
- Time to set things straight.
- Good luck.

1014
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,147
- Lighter?
- Nope.

1015
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,614
- Did you drink a lot?
- No, I did not.

1016
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,616
- <i>So formal.</i>
- <i>Yep.</i>

1017
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,286
- <i>Back to being polite.</i>
- <i>So polite with her.</i>

1018
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,625
- Not yet.
- Thirty series, wanna toast?

1019
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:07,626
It's the last day.

1020
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,170
- Did you cry again?
- Tomorrow is.

1021
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,590
- Sure, that makes me feel sad.
- Sit by me.

1022
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,049
- Let's make a toasty.
- For sure.

1023
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,843
- Cheers.
- Drink.

1024
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,345
I didn't think you'd drink
unless it was our last night.

1025
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,513
Of course.

1026
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,599
Wanna talk?

1027
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,767
Yeah, you should go talk to him.

1028
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,981
<i>Oh, right, these two.</i>

1029
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,155
It's ending, Nisei.

1030
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,032
- You're right.
- Yeah.

1031
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,158
Did you have fun?

1032
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,827
- I did have fun. Hmm.
- Hmm.

1033
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:46,123
I know that yesterday ended up with me
just venting what was on my mind.

1034
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,291
Hmm.

1035
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,294
And I realized I didn't thank you.
I'm glad you were here.

1036
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,671
I wouldn't have found romance
if you weren't here.

1037
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:53,881
- I wouldn't.
- Oh, really?

1038
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,924
Yeah. So, thank you.

1039
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,388
- What?
- Really?

1040
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,349
- Yeah, I do.
- I mean, yeah.

1041
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,684
- I feel like I should thank you.
- Hmm.

1042
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,935
That's true.

1043
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:10,272
I mean, like, I know you feel that way,

1044
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:13,192
but there's also other girls
that are into me, too.

1045
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,943
So, I don't know anymore.

1046
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,695
- You don't?
- Like…

1047
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,448
Gradually, you know,

1048
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,659
I'm feeling closer
to two different people.

1049
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,952
<i>It's starting to get confusing.</i>

1050
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,872
<i>Oto told me too much.</i>
<i>My head's in a weird place.</i>

1051
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,125
What do you mean?

1052
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,878
You'd told her you weren't into her,
but your feelings changed?

1053
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,172
Well, yeah, like…

1054
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,050
It's difficult.

1055
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,511
I'm having such a hard time

1056
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,596
putting my feelings into words.

1057
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,099
- <i>Huh?</i>
- <i>What's going on?</i>
